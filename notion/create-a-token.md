> Redirect URI requirements for public integrations
> The `redirect_uri` is a _required_ field in the request body for this endpoint if:
>   * the `redirect_uri` query parameter was set in the [Authorization URL](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#step-1-navigate-the-user-to-the-integrations-authorization-url) provided to users, _or_ ;
>   * there are more than one `redirect_uri`s included in the [integrationâ€™s settings](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) under **OAuth Domain & URIs**. 
> 

> In most cases, the `redirect_uri` field is required.
> This field is not allowed in the request body if:
>   * there is one `redirect_uri` included in the [integrationâ€™s settings](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) under **OAuth Domain & URIs**, _and_ the `redirect_uri` query parameter was not included in the Authorization URL.
