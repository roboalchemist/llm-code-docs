**Data sources** are the individual tables of data that live under a Notion database. [Pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/page) are the items (or children) in a data source. [Page property values](https://developers.notion.com/reference/page#property-value-object) must conform to the [property objects](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-object) laid out in the parent data source object.

Diagram of the new Notion API data model.  
A database is a parent of one or more data sources, each of which parents zero or more pages.  
Previously, databases could only have one data source, so the concepts were combined in the API until 2025.
As of API version `2025-09-03`, there's a suite of APIs for managing data sources:
  * [Create a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-data-source): add an additional data source for an existing [Database](https://developers.notion.com/reference/database)
  * [Update a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/update-a-data-source): update attributes, such as the `properties`, of a data source
  * [Retrieve a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-data-source)
  * [Query a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/query-a-data-source)
