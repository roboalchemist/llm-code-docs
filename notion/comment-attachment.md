# Source: https://developers.notion.com/reference/comment-attachment

The Comment Attachment object represents [files](/reference/file-object) that have been attached to a [Comment](/reference/comment-object).
> ##
>
> Comments can currently support up to 3 attachments.
## Request format (input)
### Object properties
After following the [Working with files and media](/docs/working-with-files-and-media) guide, provide an array of objects under the `attachments` parameter in the [Create comment](/reference/create-a-comment) API, each containing the following properties:
 | Parameter |
 | Type |
 | Description |
 | Example value |
 | `file_upload_id` |
 | `string` (UUID) |
 | ID of a [File Upload](/reference/file-upload) with a status of `"uploaded"` |
 | `"2e2cdb8b-9897-4a6c-a935-82922b1cfb87"` |
 | `type` |
 | `string`
(optional) |
 | Possible type values are:`"file_upload"` |
 | `"file_upload"` |
Example Create Comment request:
```
{
  "parent": {
    "page_id": "d0a1ffaf-a4d8-4acf-a1ed-abae6e110418"
  },
  "rich_text": [
    {
      "text": {"content": "Thanks for the helpful page!"}
    },
  ],
  "attachments": {
    "file_upload_id": "2e2cdb8b-9897-4a6c-a935-82922b1cfb87"
  }
}
```
In the Notion app, when viewing a comment uploaded using the API, the user experience is automatically customized based on the detected category of the file upload. For example, uploading a `.png` file displays your attachment as an inline image instead of a regular file download block.
## Response format (output)
### Object properties
The response of Comment APIs like [Create comment](/reference/create-a-comment) contains `attachments` with the following fields:
| Field | Type | Description | Example value |
|----|----|----|----|
| `category` | `string` (enum) | The category of this attachment. Possible type values are: `"audio"`, `"image"`, `"pdf"`, `"productivity"`, and `"video"` | `"audio"` |
| `file` | `object` | A [file object](/reference/file-object#notion-hosted-files-type-file) containing type-specific configuration. | `{"url": "<https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/...">, "expiry_time": "2025-06-10T21:26:03.070Z"}` |
Example attachment object in Create Comment response:
```
{
  "category": "video",
  "file": {
    "url": "https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/...",
    "expiry_time": "2025-06-10T21:26:03.070Z"

The `file.url` is a temporary download link generated at the time of retrieving a comment. See the guide on [Retrieving existing files](/docs/retrieving-files) to learn more about accessing the files you upload.
