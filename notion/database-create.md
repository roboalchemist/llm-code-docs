# Source: https://developers.notion.com/reference/database-create

Creates a database as a subpage in the specified parent page, or as a private page at the workspace level, with the specified `properties` schema set on its `initial_data_source`. Currently, the `parent` of a new database must be a Notion page (`page_id` type) or a [wiki database](https://www.notion.so/help/wikis-and-verified-pages).
Use this endpoint to create a database, its first [data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/data-source), and its first table view, all in one API call. Then, if you want to add a second data source, use the [Create a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-data-source) API with a version of at least `2025-09-03`, and provide the `database_id` as the `id` returned by the database create response.
For a complete reference on what properties are available, see [Data source properties](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-object). After creating the database, to update one of its child data sources' properties, use the [Update a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/update-a-data-source) API.
