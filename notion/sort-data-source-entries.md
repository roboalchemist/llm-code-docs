A sort is a condition used to order the entries returned from a data source query. 
A [data source query](https://developers.notion.com/reference/query-a-data-source) can be sorted by a property and/or timestamp and in a given direction. For example, a library data source can be sorted by the "Name of a book" (i.e. property) and in `ascending` (i.e. direction).
Here is an example of a sort on a data source property.
Sorting by "Name" property in ascending direction
```
{
  "sorts": [
    {
      "property": "created_time",
      "direction": "ascending"
    },
  ]
}

```

If youâ€™re using the [Notion SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js), you can apply this sorting property to your query like so:
JavaScript
```
const { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');

const notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY });
// replace with your own data source ID
const dataSourceId = 'd9824bdc-8445-4327-be8b-5b47500af6ce';

const sortedRows = async () => {
  const response = await notion.dataSources.query({
    database_id: databaseId,
    sorts: [
      {
        property: "Name",
        direction: "ascending"
      }
    ],
  });
  return response;
}

```

Data source queries can also be sorted by two or more properties, which is formally called a nested sort. The sort object listed first in the nested sort list takes precedence.
Here is an example of a nested sort.
JSON
```
{
  "sorts": [
        {
      "property": "Food group",
      "direction": "descending"
    },
    {
      "property": "Name",
      "direction": "ascending"
    }
  ]
}

```

In this example, the data source query will first be sorted by "Food group" and the set with the same food group is then sorted by "Name".

### [](https://developers.notion.com/reference/sort-data-source-entries#property-value-sort)
This sort orders the data source query by a particular property. 
The sort object must contain the following properties:
Property | Type | Description | Example value  
---|---|---|---  
`property` | `string` | The name of the property to sort against. | `"Ingredients"`  
`direction` |  `string` (enum) | The direction to sort. Possible values include `"ascending"` and `"descending"`. | `"descending"`  
### [](https://developers.notion.com/reference/sort-data-source-entries#entry-timestamp-sort)
This sort orders the data source query by the timestamp associated with a data source entry.
The sort object must contain the following properties:
Property | Type | Description | Example value  
---|---|---|---  
`timestamp` |  `string` (enum) | The name of the timestamp to sort against. Possible values include `"created_time"` and `"last_edited_time"`. | `"last_edited_time"`  
`direction` |  `string` (enum) | The direction to sort. Possible values include `"ascending"` and `"descending"`. | `"descending"`
