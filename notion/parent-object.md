# Source: https://developers.notion.com/reference/parent-object

[Pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/page), [databases](https://developers.notion.com/reference/database), [data sources](https://developers.notion.com/reference/data-source), [comments](https://developers.notion.com/reference/comment-object) and [blocks](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block) are either located inside other pages, databases, data sources, and blocks, or are located at the top level of a workspace. This location is known as the "parent". Parent information is represented by a consistent `parent` object throughout the API.
General parenting rules:
  * Pages can be parented by other pages, data sources, blocks, or by the whole workspace. 
    * _Prior to[API version 2025-09-03](https://developers.notion.com/docs/upgrade-guide-2025-09-03), page parents were databases, not data sources._
  * Blocks can be parented by pages, data sources, or blocks.
  * Databases can be parented by pages, blocks, or by the whole workspace. 
    * _For wikis, databases can also have a data source parent._
  * Data sources are parented by databases. 
    * _Linked or externally synced external data sources may have data source parents, but aren't thoroughly supported in Notion's API._


> ## ðŸš§
> Exceptions apply
> These parenting rules reflect the possible response you may receive when retrieving information about pages, databases, and blocks via Notionâ€™s REST API in the latest APIversion.
> If you are creating new pages, databases, or blocks via Notionâ€™s public REST API, the parenting rules may vary. For example, the parent of a database currently must be a page if it is [created](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-database) via the API.
> Refer to the API reference documentation for creating [pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-page), [databases](https://developers.notion.com/reference/database-create), [data sources](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-data-source), and [blocks](https://developers.notion.com/reference/patch-block-children) for more information on current parenting rules.
