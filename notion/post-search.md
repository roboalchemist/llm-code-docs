# Source: https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-search

Searches all parent or child pages and data_sources that have been shared with an integration.
Returns all [pages](https://developers.notion.com/reference/page) or [data_sources](https://developers.notion.com/reference/data-source) , excluding duplicated linked databases, that have titles that include the `query` param. If no `query` param is provided, then the response contains all pages or data_sources that have been shared with the integration. The results adhere to any limitations related to an [integrationâ€™s capabilities](https://developers.notion.com/reference/capabilities).
To limit the request to search only pages or to search only data_source, use the `filter` param.
