# Source: https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-comment

Returns a [comment object](https://developers.notion.com/reference/comment-object) for the created comment.
There are three locations where a new comment can be added with the public API:
  1. A page
  2. A block
  3. An existing discussion thread


The request body will differ slightly depending on which type of comment is being added with this endpoint.
To add a new comment to a page or block, a `parent` object with a `page_id` or `block_id` must be provided in the body params. 
To add a new comment to an existing discussion thread, a `discussion_id` string must be provided in the body params. (Inline comments to start a new discussion thread cannot be created via the public API.)
**_Either_ the `parent.page_id` , `parent.block_id` _or_ `discussion_id` parameter must be provided â€” ONLY one can be specified**.
