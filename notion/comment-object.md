The Comment object represents a comment on a Notion page or block. Comments can be viewed or created by an integration that has access to the page/block and the correct capabilities. Please see the [Capabilities guide](/reference/capabilities) for more information on setting up your integration's capabilities.
When [retrieving comments](/reference/retrieve-a-comment), one or more Comment objects will be returned in the form of an array, sorted in ascending chronological order. When [adding a comment](/reference/create-a-comment) to a page or discussion, the Comment object just added will always be returned.
