# Source: https://developers.notion.com/reference/patch-block-children

Creates and appends new children blocks to the parent `block_id` specified. Blocks can be parented by other blocks, pages, or databases.
Returns a paginated list of newly created first level children [block objects](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block).
Existing blocks cannot be moved using this endpoint. Blocks are appended to the bottom of the parent block. To append a block in a specific place other than the bottom of the parent block, use the `"after"` parameter and set its value to the ID of the block that the new block should be appended after. Once a block is appended as a child, it can't be moved elsewhere via the API.
For blocks that allow children, we allow up to **two** levels of nesting in a single request.
There is a limit of **100 block children** that can be appended by a single API request. Arrays of block children longer than 100 will result in an error.

> Integration capabilities
> This endpoint requires an integration to have insert content capabilities. Attempting to call this API without insert content capabilities will return an HTTP response with a 403 status code. For more information on integration capabilities, see the [capabilities guide](https://developers.notion.com/reference/capabilities).
### [](https://developers.notion.com/reference/patch-block-children#errors)
Returns a 404 HTTP response if the block specified by `id` doesn't exist, or if the integration doesn't have access to the block.
Returns a 400 or 429 HTTP response if the request exceeds the [request limits](https://developers.notion.com/reference/request-limits).
_Note: Each Public API endpoint can return several possible error codes. To see a full description of each type of error code, see the[Error codes section](https://developers.notion.com/reference/status-codes#error-codes) of the Status codes documentation._
