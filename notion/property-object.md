All [data source objects](https://developers.notion.com/reference/data-source) include a child `properties` object. This `properties` object is composed of individual data source property objects. These property objects define the data source schema and are rendered in the Notion UI as data columns. 
> ## 📘
> Data source rows
> If you’re looking for information about how to use the API to work with data source rows, then refer to the [page property values](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-value-object) documentation. The API treats data source rows as pages.
Every data source property object contains the following keys: 
Field | Type | Description | Example value  
---|---|---|---  
`id` | `string` | An identifier for the property, usually a short string of random letters and symbols.  
  
Some automatically generated property types have special human-readable IDs. For example, all Title properties have an `id` of `"title"`. | `"fy:{"`  
`name` | `string` | The name of the property as it appears in Notion. |   
`description` | `string` | The description of a property as it appear in Notion.  |   
`type` |  `string` (enum) | The type that controls the behavior of the property. Possible values are:  
  
- `"checkbox"`  
  
- `"created_by"`  
- `"created_time"`  
- `"date"`  
- `"email"`  
- `"files"`  
- `"formula"`  
- `"last_edited_by"`  
- `"last_edited_time"`  
- `"multi_select"`  
- `"number"`  
- `"people"`  
- `"phone_number"`  
- `"relation"`  
- `"rich_text"`  
- `"rollup"`  
- `"select"`  
- `"status"`  
- `"title"`  
- `"url"` | `"rich_text"`  
Each data source property object also contains a type object. The key of the object is the `type` of the object, and the value is an object containing type-specific configuration. The following sections detail these type-specific objects along with example property objects for each type.

> ## 📘
> Database relations must be shared with your integration
> To retrieve properties from data source [relations](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups#what-is-a-database-relation), the related database must be shared with your integration in addition to the database being retrieved.

> ## 🚧
> It is not possible to update a status data source property's `name` or `options` values via the API.
> Update these values from the Notion UI, instead.
## [](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-object#title)
A title data source property controls the title that appears at the top of a page when a data source row is opened. The `title` type object itself is empty; there is no additional configuration.
Example title data source property object
```
"Project name": {
  "id": "title",
  "name": "Project name",
  "type": "title",
  "title": {}
}

```

> ## 🚧
> All data sources require one, and only one, `title` property.
> The API throws errors if you send a request to [Create a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/create-a-data-source) or [Create a database](https://developers.notion.com/reference/database-create) without a `title` property, or if you attempt to [Update a data source](https://developers.notion.com/reference/update-a-data-source) to add or remove a `title` property.
> ## 📘
> Title data source property vs. data source title
> A `title` data source property is a type of column in a data source.
> A data source `title` defines the title of the data source and is found on the [data source object](https://developers.notion.com/reference/data-source). 
> Every data source requires both a data source `title` and a `title` data source property. This ensures that we have both:
>   * An overall title to display when viewing the database or data source in the Notion app
>   * A title property for each page under the data source, so page titles can be displayed in the Notion app
> 

## [](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-object#url)
A URL data source property is represented in the Notion UI as a column that contains URL values. 
The `url` type object is empty. There is no additional property configuration.
Example URL data source property object

  "type": "url",
  "url": {}
}

```

## [](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-object#unique-id)
A unique ID data source property records values that are automatically incremented, and enforced to be unique across all pages in a data source. This can be useful for task or bug report IDs (e.g. TASK-1234), or other similar types of identifiers that must be unique.
The `unique_id` type object can contain an optional `prefix` attribute, which is a common prefix assigned to pages in the data source. When a `prefix` is set, a special URL (for example, `notion.so/TASK-1234`) is generated to be able to look up a page easily by the ID. Learn more in our [help center documentation](https://www.notion.com/help/unique-id) or [Notion Academy lesson](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-academy/lesson/unique-id-property).
