CONCLUSION
==========

Feature flag management has matured into a crowded but well-differentiated
market. Choice depends on:

- SCALE: Statsig for 1+ trillion events, Flipt for lightweight needs
- INTEGRATION: LaunchDarkly for SDKs, Kameleoon for existing platforms
- COST: Open-source (Unleash, GrowthBook) or developer-friendly (ConfigCat)
- COMPLIANCE: Self-hosted solutions (Unleash, Flagsmith, flagd)
- ANALYTICS: Warehouse-native (Amplitude, Statsig, Eppo)
- SIMPLICITY: ConfigCat, Flipt, Firebase Remote Config

All platforms now support:
✓ Feature flags with targeting rules
✓ Percentage-based rollouts
✓ A/B testing and multivariate testing
✓ Progressive delivery patterns
✓ SDKs for major languages
✓ REST APIs for custom integration
✓ CI/CD pipeline integration

The market has matured enough that "good enough" open-source solutions can
compete with enterprise platforms on features while offering better privacy,
cost control, and customization options.
