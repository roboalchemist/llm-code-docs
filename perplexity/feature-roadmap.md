Our roadmap is shaped by our users - have a feature in mind? Submit your suggestion [here](https://community.perplexity.ai/) and help us build the future of AI together.
Video Upload Capabilities
Multimodal video processing
We’re expanding our multimodal capabilities to include video uploads, targeting availability by the end of August 2025.This feature will enable:
  * **Video Content Analysis** : Upload and analyze video files directly through the API
  * **Frame-by-Frame Processing** : Extract insights from video content at multiple time points
  * **Visual Scene Understanding** : Analyze visual elements, objects, and activities in video content
  * **Multimodal Search** : Search for information based on both visual and audio elements from your uploaded videos

Supported formats will include common video file types (MP4, MOV, AVI) with reasonable file size limits for API efficiency.This capability will unlock new use cases in content moderation, educational analysis, media research, and automated video summarization.
File Search & Connectors
Expanded data access
Expanding your ability to access and process information:
  * Search across various file types
  * Integration with external data sources
  * Parity with enterprise connector capabilities

This feature will allow your applications to tap into a broader range of data sources for more comprehensive insights.
Expanded Structured Outputs Support
Enhanced response formatting
We’re expanding our structured outputs capabilities:
  * **Universal JSON Support** : JSON structured outputs are now available for all models across all tiers
  * **Complete Regex Support** : Extending regex pattern support to all models (currently available for `sonar` and `sonar-reasoning`)
  * **Advanced Schema Validation** : Enhanced validation options for more reliable structured data
  * **Output Templates** : Pre-defined templates for common use cases

This expansion will make it easier to build applications that require consistent, structured data from our API responses.
Documentation Overhaul
More comprehensive resources
We’re committed to making our documentation a truly exceptional resource:
  * **Improved Layout** : Optimized structure for better self-serve workflows
  * **Consistent Design** : Unified branding between our landing page and documentation
  * **Enhanced Content** : Revised explanations for better developer understanding
  * **Vertical-Specific Guides** : Specialized documentation for publishers, merchants, and other industry partners
  * **High-Fidelity Demos** : More comprehensive examples beyond our basic cookbook demos
  * **Comprehensive Prompt Guide** : In-depth resources to help you build effectively with our search + LLM API
  * **API Selection Guides** : Clear guidance on which API is best suited for specific scenarios

These improvements will help you get up to speed faster and make the most of our API capabilities.
Increased Rate Limits
Support for high-volume applications
We’re scaling our infrastructure to support significantly higher request volumes:
  * Working toward supporting use cases up to 100K RPM
  * Designed for high-growth startups and enterprise applications

This enhancement will ensure our API can grow alongside your application’s user base and processing needs.
Better Error Handling
Clearer troubleshooting
Improving our error framework:
  * More descriptive error messages
  * Clearer guidance on resolving common issues

This will reduce debugging time and help you understand and address issues more efficiently.
Multimedia Capabilities
Beyond text processing
Broadening the types of content you can work with:
  * **URL Content Integration** : Specify URLs within prompts to search for and analyze content from specific web pages directly
  * **URL Parsing** : Extract and analyze content from web pages

These features will enable new use cases and richer interactions within your applications, allowing you to reference specific web content and build more comprehensive research workflows.
Context Management / Memory
Improved context handling
We’re addressing the limitations of managing context in API calls by introducing new context management features.Key improvements include:
  * **Efficient Context Storage** : Avoid appending responses from previous API calls to new ones, reducing the risk of exceeding context windows.
  * **Session-Based Memory** : Enable session-based memory to maintain context across multiple API calls without manual intervention.

These enhancements will make it easier to build applications that require persistent context without hitting technical limitations.
