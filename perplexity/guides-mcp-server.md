What is MCP?
The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard designed to connect AI assistants with the systems where data lives. By providing a universal interface for AI applications to access structured and unstructured data, MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations, enabling AI models to retrieve real-time, relevant information more efficiently. Learn more about MCP [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

MCP Server for Perplexityâ€™s Sonar API
Our **MCP server implementation** for Sonar allows any AI-powered tool to perform real-time, web-wide research using Perplexityâ€™s powerful search engine. This server acts as a bridge between AI applications and the Sonar, enabling seamless integration for retrieving and synthesizing relevant, up-to-date information from the web.
