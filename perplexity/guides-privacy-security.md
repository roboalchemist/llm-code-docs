Data We Collect
The only data we collect through the API consists of essential billable metrics required for service operation:
  * Number of tokens processed
  * Model used for each request
  * Request timestamp and duration
  * API key identification (for billing purposes)

This billing metadata does not include any content from your prompts, responses, or other user data.
