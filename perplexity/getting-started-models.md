## Search
Models designed to retrieve and synthesize information efficiently.
Best suited for quick factual queries, topic summaries, product comparisons, and current events where simple information retrieval and synthesis is needed without complex reasoning.
Not ideal for multi-step analyses, exhaustive research on broad topics, or projects requiring detailed instructions or comprehensive reports across multiple sources.

## Reasoning
Models that excel at complex, multi-step tasks.
Excellent for complex analyses requiring step-by-step thinking, tasks needing strict adherence to instructions, information synthesis across sources, and logical problem-solving that demands informed recommendations.
Not recommended for simple factual queries, basic information retrieval, exhaustive research projects (use Research models instead), or when speed takes priority over reasoning quality.

## Research
Models that conduct in-depth analysis and generate detailed reports.
Ideal for comprehensive topic reports, in-depth analysis with exhaustive web research, and projects requiring synthesis of multiple information sources into cohesive reports like market analyses or literature reviews.
