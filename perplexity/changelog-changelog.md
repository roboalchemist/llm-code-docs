September 2025
SecurityAPI KeysKey Management
**New: API Key Rotation Mechanism** We’ve introduced a comprehensive API key rotation system to enhance security and simplify key management for your applications.**Key features:**
  * **Seamless Rotation** : Replace API keys without service interruption
  * **Automated Workflows** : Set up automatic key rotation schedules
  * **Enhanced Security** : Regularly refresh keys to minimize security risks
  * **Audit Trail** : Track key usage and rotation history
  * **Zero Downtime** : Smooth transitions between old and new keys

**How it works:**
  1. Generate a new API key while keeping the old one active
  2. Update your applications to use the new key
  3. Deactivate the old key once migration is complete

This is particularly valuable for production environments where continuous availability is critical, and for organizations with strict security compliance requirements.**Best practices:**
  * Rotate keys every 30-90 days depending on your security requirements
  * Use environment variables to manage keys in your applications
  * Test key rotation in staging environments first
  * Monitor key usage to ensure successful transitions

Access key rotation features through your [API Portal](https://perplexity.ai/account/api).
