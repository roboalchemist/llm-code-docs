Coverage:
  □ Set minimum coverage thresholds (80% common)
  □ Track coverage over time
  □ Focus on meaningful coverage (not just line count)
  □ Use coverage tools but don't obsess over % metrics
  □ Enforce thresholds in CI/CD

CI/CD Integration:
  □ Run unit tests on every push
  □ Run E2E tests on main/develop
  □ Cache dependencies
  □ Use parallel execution
  □ Upload coverage reports
  □ Comment on PRs with results

Reporting:

SUMMARY
================================================================================

The JavaScript testing ecosystem in 2026 is mature, diverse, and healthy:

✓ Jest remains the industry standard (1M+ weekly downloads)
✓ Vitest is rapidly growing as a modern alternative (5x faster)
✓ Playwright dominates E2E testing (fastest + most capable)
✓ Codecov/Coveralls excel at coverage tracking
✓ Allure provides professional test reporting
✓ Multiple tools are production-ready and well-maintained

The "best" choice depends on:
  1. Project type (React, Vue, Node.js, etc.)
  2. Performance requirements
  3. Team expertise and preferences
  4. Integration needs (CI/CD, reporting, etc.)

Modern tools increasingly support drop-in replacements and standardized formats,
making it easier to switch between tools without rewriting tests.

For most projects in 2026:
  → Jest + Cypress for React (popular choice)
  → Vitest + Playwright for modern/Vite projects (trending choice)
  → Mocha + Chai for Node.js APIs (flexible choice)
