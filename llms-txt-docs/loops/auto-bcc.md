# Auto BCC

> Import emails and contacts to your CRM by adding a BCC address to your marketing emails.

<Tip>
  Our Auto BCC feature works with campaigns and loops, but is not offered on transactional emails.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  By adding a BCC email address in your settings, your emails will be BCCd to this address.
  Do not use a personal email address, only one generated by your CRM.
</Warning>

## Overview

Auto BCC is a feature that imports emails and contacts into your CRM platform. This works by adding a BCC email address to all outgoing campaigns and loops emails sent from Loops.

You can add a BCC email address in your [Tracking settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=tracking).

Be aware that BCCing might not be enough by itself. Some platforms may require you to add the sender email address to an allowlist or for the sender to be a user on your account.

## Syncing with Salesforce

You can record all outgoing email and add contacts into Salesforce using a pre-generated Email to Salesforce address.

[Find your BCC email address](https://support.cloudhq.net/where-do-i-find-my-bcc-address-in-salesforce/) and paste it into the **BCC email address** field in Loops.

[Read how Email to Salesforce works](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.email_my_email_2_sfdc.htm\&type=5)

## Syncing with HubSpot

You can log all outgoing emails and add new contacts to HubSpot using your pre-generated BCC address.

[Find your BCC email address](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/connected-email/log-email-in-your-crm-with-the-bcc-or-forwarding-address#use-the-bcc-address) and paste it into the **BCC email address** field in Loops.

<Tip>
  Make sure to read the "Requirements to log emails to the CRM using the BCC address" section on the page above to make sure the sync works correctly.
</Tip>

## Syncing with Attio

Using Attio's [Email forwarding](https://attio.com/help/reference/email-calendar/email-forwarding) feature, you can sync outgoing emails to your Attio account.

[Find your forwarding email address](https://attio.com/help/reference/email-calendar/email-forwarding#finding-your-inbound-email-address) and paste it into the **BCC email address** field in Loops.

<Tip>
  Your Attio log in email has to match the sending email in Loops. For example, if your sending domain is `mail.mydomain.com` and the ["From" address](/sending-first-email#sending-settings) for your email is `bob@mail.mydomain.com`, your Attio account email has to be `bob@mail.mydomain.com` for this integration to work.
</Tip>

## Syncing with other CRMs

Most CRMs have a feature that lets you import email and contacts. Look for a BCC email address and add it to your Loops settings.
