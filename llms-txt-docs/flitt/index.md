Large language models (LLMs) can help you to develop Flitt integrations.

**Documentation in plain text format**

Flitt documentation is available as plain text markdown files by adding `/index.md` to the end of any url.

For example, the plain text version of this page can be accessed at [https://docs.flitt.com/llms.md](/llms/index.md).

Plain text `.md` documentation format can be useful in such cases:

- Optimal tokens for LLM to process.
- All the content is rendered in the plain text file including sub menus and tabs which can be not visible in HTML version.
- LLMs can easily parse and understand markdown structure.
- File `/llms.txt` hosted at [https://docs.flitt.com/llms.txt](/llms.txt) can instruct AI tools and agents how to retrieve the plain text versions of our pages.
- The `/llms.txt` file is an emerging convention designed to help websites communicate rules and guidelines for Large Language Models (LLMs), similar to how `robots.txt` guides web crawlers.
