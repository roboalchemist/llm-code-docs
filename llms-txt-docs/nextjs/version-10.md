# How to upgrade to version 10


There were no breaking changes between versions 9 and 10.

To upgrade to version 10, run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@10
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add next@10
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm up next@10
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun add next@10
```

> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their corresponding versions.
