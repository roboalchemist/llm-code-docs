# Form Component
@doc-version: 16.0.3


The `<Form>` component extends the HTML `<form>` element to provide  **client-side navigation** on submission, and **progressive enhancement**.

It's useful for forms that update URL search params as it reduces the boilerplate code needed to achieve the above.

Basic usage:

```tsx filename="/ui/search.js" switcher
import Form from 'next/form'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Form action="/search">
      {/* On submission, the input value will be appended to
          the URL, e.g. /search?query=abc */}
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="/ui/search.js" switcher
import Form from 'next/form'

export default function Search() {
  return (
    <Form action="/search">
      {/* On submission, the input value will be appended to
          the URL, e.g. /search?query=abc */}
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

## Reference

The behavior of the `<Form>` component depends on whether the `action` prop is passed a `string` or `function`.

* When `action` is a **string**, the `<Form>` behaves like a native HTML form that uses a **`GET`** method. The form data is encoded into the URL as search params, and when the form is submitted, it navigates to the specified URL. In addition, Next.js:
  * Performs a [client-side navigation](/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating.md#client-side-transitions) instead of a full page reload when the form is submitted. This retains shared UI and client-side state.

### `action` (string) Props

When `action` is a string, the `<Form>` component supports the following props:

| Prop      | Example            | Type                            | Required |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| `action`  | `action="/search"` | `string` (URL or relative path) | Yes      |
| `replace` | `replace={false}`  | `boolean`                       | -        |
| `scroll`  | `scroll={true}`    | `boolean`                       | -        |

* **`action`**: The URL or path to navigate to when the form is submitted.
  * An empty string `""` will navigate to the same route with updated search params.
* **`replace`**: Replaces the current history state instead of pushing a new one to the [browser's history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) stack. Default is `false`.
* **`scroll`**: Controls the scroll behavior during navigation. Defaults to `true`, this means it will scroll to the top of the new route, and maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.

### Caveats

* **`onSubmit`**: Can be used to handle form submission logic. However, calling `event.preventDefault()` will override `<Form>` behavior such as navigating to the specified URL.
* **[`method`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#method), [`encType`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#enctype), [`target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#target)**: Are not supported as they override `<Form>` behavior.
  * Similarly, `formMethod`, `formEncType`, and `formTarget` can be used to override the `method`, `encType`, and `target` props respectively, and using them will fallback to native browser behavior.
  * If you need to use these props, use the HTML `<form>` element instead.
* **`<input type="file">`**: Using this input type when the `action` is a string will match browser behavior by submitting the filename instead of the file object.
