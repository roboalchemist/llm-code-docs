# Integrate API

> Easily add intelligent features to your app

Hypermode makes it easy to incrementally add intelligence your app.

## API endpoint

You can find your project's API endpoint in the Hypermode Console, in your
project's Home tab, in the format `https://<slug>.hypermode.app/<path>`.

## API token

Hypermode protects your project's endpoint with an API key. In your project
dashboard, navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys** to find and manage your API
tokens.

From your app, you can call the API by passing the API token in the
`Authorization` header. Here's an example using the `fetch` API in JavaScript:

```javascript
const endpoint = "" // your API endpoint
const key = "" // your API key
// your graphql query
const query = `query {
  ...
}`

const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: key,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
  }),
})
const data = await response.json()
```

<Note>
  Additional authorization methods are under development. If your app requires a
  different protocol, reach out at
  [help@hypermode.com](mailto:help@hypermode.com).
