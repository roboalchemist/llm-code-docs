<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

The official Dgraph client implementation for JavaScript, using
[gRPC-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/grpc-js) (the original
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client for JavaScript is now deprecated).

This client follows the [Dgraph Go client](./go) closely.

<Tip>
  You can find the official Dgraph JavaScript gRPC client at:
  [https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js). Follow the [installation
  instructions](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js#install) to get it up
  and running.
</Tip>

## Supported versions

More details on the supported versions can be found at
[this link](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js#supported-versions).

## Quickstart

Build and run the
[simple project](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js/tree/main/examples/simple),
which contains an end-to-end example of using the Dgraph JavaScript client.
Follow the instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js/tree/main/examples/simple/README.md)
of that project.

  JavaScript gRPC client, for Node.js >= v6.
</Tip>

### Creating a client

A `DgraphClient` object can be initialized by passing it a list of
`DgraphClientStub` clients as arguments. Connecting to multiple Dgraph servers
in the same cluster allows for better distribution of workload.

The following code snippet shows just one connection.

```js
const dgraph = require("dgraph-js")
const grpc = require("grpc")

const clientStub = new dgraph.DgraphClientStub(
  // addr: optional, default: "localhost:9080"
  "localhost:9080",
  // credentials: optional, default: grpc.credentials.createInsecure()
  grpc.credentials.createInsecure(),
)
const dgraphClient = new dgraph.DgraphClient(clientStub)
```

To facilitate debugging, [debug mode](#debug-mode) can be enabled for a client.

### Multi-tenancy

In [multi-tenancy](/dgraph/enterprise/multitenancy) environments, `dgraph-js`
provides a new method `loginIntoNamespace()`, which allows the users to login to
a specific namespace.

In order to create a JavaScript client, and make the client login into namespace
`123`:

```js
const dgraphClientStub = new dgraph.DgraphClientStub("localhost:9080")
await dgraphClientStub.loginIntoNamespace("groot", "password", 123) // where 123 is the namespaceId
```

In this example, the client logs into namespace `123` using username `groot` and
password `password`. Once logged in, the client can perform all the operations
allowed to the `groot` user of namespace `123`.

### Altering the database

To set the schema, create an `Operation` object, set the schema and pass it to
`DgraphClient#alter(Operation)` method.

```js
const schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setSchema(schema)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

Starting Dgraph version 20.03.0, indexes can be computed in the background. You
can set `setRunInBackground` field of the `Operation` object to `true` before
passing it to the `DgraphClient#alter(Operation)` method. You can find more
details [here](/dgraph/admin/update-types#indexes-in-background).

```js
const schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setSchema(schema)
op.setRunInBackground(true)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

> NOTE: Many of the examples here use the `await` keyword which requires
> `async/await` support which is available on Node.js >= v7.6.0. For prior
> versions, the expressions following `await` can be used just like normal
> `Promise`:
>
> ```js
> dgraphClient.alter(op)
>     .then(function(result) { ... }, function(err) { ... })
> ```

`Operation` contains other fields as well, including drop predicate and drop
all. Drop all is useful if you wish to discard all the data, and start from a
clean slate, without bringing the instance down.

```js
// Drop all data including schema from the Dgraph instance. This is useful
// for small examples such as this, since it puts Dgraph into a clean
// state.
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setDropAll(true)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

### Creating a transaction

To create a transaction, call `DgraphClient#newTxn()` method, which returns a
new `Txn` object. This operation incurs no network overhead.

It is good practice to call `Txn#discard()` in a `finally` block after running
the transaction. Calling `Txn#discard()` after `Txn#commit()` is a no-op and you
can call `Txn#discard()` multiple times with no additional side-effects.

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn()
try {
  // Do something here
  // ...
} finally {
  await txn.discard()
  // ...
}
```

To create a read-only transaction, set `readOnly` boolean to `true` while
calling `DgraphClient#newTxn()` method. Read-only transactions can't contain
mutations and trying to call `Txn#mutate()` or `Txn#commit()` results in an
error. Calling `Txn.Discard()` is a no-op.

You can optionally set the `bestEffort` boolean to `true`. This may yield
improved latencies in read-bound workloads where the guaranteed latest value is
not strictly needed.

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn({
  readOnly: true,
  bestEffort: false,
})
// ...
const res = await txn.queryWithVars(query, vars)
```

### Running a mutation

`Txn#mutate(Mutation)` runs a mutation. It takes in a `Mutation` object, which
provides two main ways to set data, JSON and RDF N-Quad. You can choose
whichever way is convenient.

We define a person object to represent a person and use it in a `Mutation`
object.

```js
// Create data.
const p = {
  name: "Alice",
}

// Run mutation.
const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetJson(p)
await txn.mutate(mu)
```

For a more complete example with multiple fields and relationships, look at the
\[simple] project in the `examples` folder.

Sometimes, you only want to commit a mutation, without querying anything
further. In such cases, you can use `Mutation#setCommitNow(true)` to indicate
that the mutation must be immediately committed.

`Mutation#setIgnoreIndexConflict(true)` can be applied on a `Mutation` object to
not run conflict detection over the index, which would decrease the number of
transaction conflicts and aborts. However, this would come at the cost of
potentially inconsistent upsert operations.

Mutation can be run using `txn.doRequest` as well.

```js
const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetJson(p)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setCommitNow(true)
req.setMutationsList([mu])

await txn.doRequest(req)
```

### Running a query

You can run a query by calling `Txn#query(string)`. You need to pass in a DQL
query string. If you want to pass an additional map of any variables that you
might want to set in the query, call `Txn#queryWithVars(string, object)` with
the variables object as the second argument.

The response would contain the method `Response#getJSON()`, which returns the
response JSON.

Let’s run the following query with a variable \$a:

```console
query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a))
  {
    name
  }
}
```

Run the query, deserialize the result from Uint8Array (or base64) encoded JSON
and print it out:

```js
// Run query.
const query = `query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a))
  {
    name
  }
}`
const vars = { $a: "Alice" }
const res = await dgraphClient.newTxn().queryWithVars(query, vars)
const ppl = res.getJson()

// Print results.
console.log(`Number of people named "Alice": ${ppl.all.length}`)
ppl.all.forEach((person) => console.log(person.name))
```

This should print:

```console
Number of people named "Alice": 1
Alice
```

You can also use `txn.doRequest` function to run the query.

```js
const req = new dgraph.Request()
const vars = req.getVarsMap()
vars.set("$a", "Alice")
req.setQuery(query)

const res = await txn.doRequest(req)
console.log(JSON.stringify(res.getJson()))
```

### Running an upsert: query + mutation

The `txn.doRequest` function allows you to run upserts consisting of one query
and one mutation. Query variables could be defined and can then be used in the
mutation. You can also use the `txn.doRequest` function to perform just a query
or a mutation.

```js
const query = `
  query {
      user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
  }`

const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetNquads(`uid(user) <email> "correct_email@dgraph.io" .`)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setQuery(query)
req.setMutationsList([mu])
req.setCommitNow(true)

// Upsert: If wrong_email found, update the existing data
// or else perform a new mutation.
await dgraphClient.newTxn().doRequest(req)
```

### Running a conditional upsert

The upsert block allows specifying a conditional mutation block using an `@if`
directive. The mutation is executed only when the specified condition is true.
If the condition is false, the mutation is silently ignored.

See more about Conditional Upsert
[Here](/dgraph/dql/mutation#conditional-upsert).

```js
const query = `
  query {
      user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
  }`

const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetNquads(`uid(user) <email> "correct_email@dgraph.io" .`)
mu.setCond(`@if(eq(len(user), 1))`)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setQuery(query)
req.addMutations(mu)
req.setCommitNow(true)

await dgraphClient.newTxn().doRequest(req)
```

### Committing a transaction

A transaction can be committed using the `Txn#commit()` method. If your
transaction consisted solely of calls to `Txn#query` or `Txn#queryWithVars`, and
no calls to `Txn#mutate`, then calling `Txn#commit()` isn't necessary.

An error is returned if other transactions running concurrently modify the same
data that was modified in this transaction. It is up to the user to retry
transactions when they fail.

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn()
try {
  // ...
  // Perform any number of queries and mutations
  // ...
  // and finally...
  await txn.commit()
} catch (e) {
  if (e === dgraph.ERR_ABORTED) {
    // Retry or handle exception.
  } else {
    throw e
  }
} finally {
  // Clean up. Calling this after txn.commit() is a no-op
  // and hence safe.
  await txn.discard()
}
```

### Clean up resources

To clean up resources, you have to call `DgraphClientStub#close()` individually
for all the instances of `DgraphClientStub`.

```js
const SERVER_ADDR = "localhost:9080"
const SERVER_CREDENTIALS = grpc.credentials.createInsecure()

// Create instances of DgraphClientStub.
const stub1 = new dgraph.DgraphClientStub(SERVER_ADDR, SERVER_CREDENTIALS)
const stub2 = new dgraph.DgraphClientStub(SERVER_ADDR, SERVER_CREDENTIALS)

// Create an instance of DgraphClient.
const dgraphClient = new dgraph.DgraphClient(stub1, stub2)

// ...
// Use dgraphClient
// ...

// Cleanup resources by closing all client stubs.
stub1.close()
stub2.close()
```

### Debug mode

Debug mode can be used to print helpful debug messages while performing alters,
queries, and mutations. It can be set using
the`DgraphClient#setDebugMode(boolean?)` method.

```js
// Create a client.
const dgraphClient = new dgraph.DgraphClient(...);

// Enable debug mode.
dgraphClient.setDebugMode(true);
// OR simply dgraphClient.setDebugMode();

// Disable debug mode.
dgraphClient.setDebugMode(false);
```

### Setting metadata headers

Metadata headers such as authentication tokens can be set through the context of
gRPC methods. Below is an example of how to set a header named `auth-token`.

```js
// The following piece of code shows how one can set metadata with
// auth-token, to allow Alter operation, if the server requires it.

var meta = new grpc.Metadata()
meta.add("auth-token", "mySuperSecret")

await dgraphClient.alter(op, meta)
```

## Browser support

<Note>
  The official Dgraph JavaScript gRPC client is designed for Node.js
  environments and doesn't officially support browser usage due to gRPC-web
  limitations and bundling complexities. However, you can achieve **most** of
  the same capabilities in browsers using Dgraph's HTTP API with standard
  `fetch` requests.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you only need basic CRUD operations and don't require admin endpoints (like
  schema alterations or dropping data), consider using Dgraph's GraphQL API
  instead, which is designed for client-side usage and provides better security
  boundaries.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  We don't recommend connecting directly to Dgraph from browser applications as
  this could expose your database credentials and connection details to end
  users. Consider using a backend API as a proxy instead.
</Warning>

### Node.js gRPC vs browser HTTP API

Below are side-by-side examples showing how to perform common operations using
both the Node.js gRPC client and browser-compatible HTTP requests.

#### Creating a connection

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const dgraph = require("dgraph-js")
const grpc = require("grpc")

const clientStub = new dgraph.DgraphClientStub(
  "localhost:9080",
  grpc.credentials.createInsecure(),
)
const dgraphClient = new dgraph.DgraphClient(clientStub)
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
const DGRAPH_HTTP_URL = "http://localhost:8080"

// Test connection to Dgraph
const response = await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/health`)
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`Cannot connect to Dgraph: ${response.status}`)
}
console.log("Connected to Dgraph successfully")
```

#### Setting schema

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setSchema(schema)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
const schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."

await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/alter`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/rdf" },
  body: schema,
})
```

#### Running queries

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const query = `query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a)) {
    name
  }
}`
const vars = { $a: "Alice" }
const res = await dgraphClient.newTxn().queryWithVars(query, vars)
const data = res.getJson()
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
const query = `query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a)) {
    name
  }
}`
const vars = { $a: "Alice" }

const response = await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/query`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables: vars }),
})
const data = await response.json()
```

#### Running mutations

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn()
try {
  const p = { name: "Alice", age: 26 }
  const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
  mu.setSetJson(p)
  mu.setCommitNow(true)
  await txn.mutate(mu)
} finally {
  await txn.discard()
}
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
const p = { name: "Alice", age: 26 }

await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/mutate?commitNow=true`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ set: [p] }),
})
```

#### Upsert operations

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const query = `query {
  user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
}`

const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetNquads(`uid(user) <email> "correct_email@dgraph.io" .`)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setQuery(query)
req.setMutationsList([mu])
req.setCommitNow(true)

await dgraphClient.newTxn().doRequest(req)
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
const query = `query {
  user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
}`

await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/mutate?commitNow=true`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
    set: [{ uid: "uid(user)", email: "correct_email@dgraph.io" }],
  }),
})
```

#### Conditional upserts

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const query = `query {
  user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
}`

const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetNquads(`uid(user) <email> "correct_email@dgraph.io" .`)
mu.setCond(`@if(eq(len(user), 1))`)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setQuery(query)
req.addMutations(mu)
req.setCommitNow(true)

await dgraphClient.newTxn().doRequest(req)
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
const query = `query {
  user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
}`

await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/mutate?commitNow=true`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
    mutations: [
      {
        set: [{ uid: "uid(user)", email: "correct_email@dgraph.io" }],
        cond: "@if(eq(len(user), 1))",
      },
    ],
  }),
})
```

#### Drop all data

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setDropAll(true)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/alter`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ drop_all: true }),
})
```

#### Authentication

**Node.js (gRPC):**

```js
const meta = new grpc.Metadata()
meta.add("auth-token", "mySuperSecret")
await dgraphClient.alter(op, meta)
```

**Browser (HTTP):**

```js
await fetch(`${DGRAPH_HTTP_URL}/alter`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/rdf",
    "auth-token": "mySuperSecret",
  },
  body: schema,
})
```

### Browser-specific considerations

#### Connection strings

For convenience, you can parse connection strings similar to database URLs:

```js
function parseDgraphUrl(connectionString) {
  if (connectionString.startsWith("http")) {
    return { url: connectionString, headers: {} }
  }

  // Handle dgraph://user:pass@host:port format
  const url = new URL(connectionString.replace("dgraph://", "https://"))
  const headers = {}

  if (url.username && url.password) {
    headers["Authorization"] =
      `Basic ${btoa(`${url.username}:${url.password}`)}`
  }

  return {
    url: `http://${url.hostname}:${url.port || 8080}`,
    headers,
  }
}

// Usage
const { url, headers } = parseDgraphUrl("dgraph://user:pass@localhost:8080")
const DGRAPH_HTTP_URL = url
```

### Limitations of HTTP API

* **No streaming**: HTTP doesn't support gRPC streaming capabilities
* **Transaction isolation**: HTTP requests are stateless; use upserts for
  consistency
* **Performance**: Higher overhead compared to persistent gRPC connections
