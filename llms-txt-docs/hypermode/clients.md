# Dgraph Clients

  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If

A client is a program that calls dgraph. Broadly, there are stand alone clients
such as Ratel, which is a graphical web-based app, and programmatic client
libraries which are embedded in larger programs to efficiently call Dgraph.

GraphQL is an open standard with many clients (graphical and libraries) also,
and GraphQL clients work with Dgraph.

Dgraph provides [client libraries](/dgraph/sdks/overview) for many languages.
These clients send DQL queries, and perform useful functions such as logging in.

Note that Dgraph doesn't force or insist on any particular GraphQL client. Any
GraphQL client, GUI, tool, or library works well with Dgraph, and it's the
users' choice which to choose. Dgraph only provides clients for the proprietary
DQL query language. GraphQL clients are available for free from many
organizations.
