# App Manifest

> Define the resources for your app

The manifest for your Modus app allows you to configure the exposure and
resources for your functions at runtime. You define the manifest in the
`modus.json` file within the root of directory of your app.

## Structure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Endpoints" icon="rectangle-code" href="#endpoints">
    Expose your functions for integration into your frontend or federated API
  </Card>

  <Card title="Connections" icon="router" href="#connections">
    Establish connectivity for external endpoints and model hosts
  </Card>

  <Card title="Models" icon="cube" href="#models">
    Define inference services for use in your functions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Base manifest

A simple manifest, which exposes a single GraphQL endpoint with a bearer token
for authentication, looks like this:

```json modus.json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.hypermode.com/modus.json",
  "endpoints": {
    "default": {
      "type": "graphql",
      "path": "/graphql",
      "auth": "bearer-token"
    }
  }
}
```

## Endpoints

Endpoints make your functions available outside of your Modus app. The
`endpoints` object in the app manifest allows you to define these endpoints for
integration into your frontend or federated API.

Each endpoint requires a unique name, specified as a key containing only
alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

<Note>
  Only a GraphQL endpoint is available currently, but the modular design of
  Modus allows for the introduction of additional endpoint types in the future.
</Note>

### GraphQL endpoint

This endpoint type supports the GraphQL protocol to communicate with external
clients. You can use a GraphQL client, such as
[urql](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql) or
[Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), to interact
with the endpoint.

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "endpoints": {
    "default": {
      "type": "graphql",
      "path": "/graphql",
      "auth": "bearer-token"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"graphql"` for this endpoint type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="path" type="string" required>
  The path for the endpoint. Must start with a forward slash `/`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="auth" type="string" required>
  The authentication method for the endpoint. Options are `"bearer-token"` or
  `"none"`. See [Authentication](/modus/authentication) for additional details.
</ResponseField>

## Connections

Connections establish connectivity and access to external services. They're used
for HTTP and GraphQL APIs, database connections, and externally hosted AI
models. The `connections` object in the app manifest allows you to define these
hosts, for secure access from within a function.

Each connection requires a unique name, specified as a key containing only
alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

Each connection has a `type` property, which controls how it's used and which
additional properties are available. The following table lists the available
connection types:

| Type         | Purpose                          | Function Classes            |
| :----------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `http`       | Connect to an HTTP(S) web server | `http`, `graphql`, `models` |
| `dgraph`     | Connect to a Dgraph database     | `dgraph`                    |
| `mysql`      | Connect to a MySQL database      | `mysql`                     |
| `neo4j`      | Connect to a Neo4j database      | `neo4j`                     |
| `postgresql` | Connect to a PostgreSQL database | `postgresql`                |

<Warning>
  **Don't include secrets directly in the manifest!**

  If your connection requires authentication, you can include *placeholders* in
  connection properties which resolve to their respective secrets at runtime.

  When developing locally,
  [set secrets using environment variables](/modus/run-locally#environment-secrets).

  When deployed on Hypermode, set the actual secrets via the Hypermode Console,
  where they're securely stored until needed.
</Warning>

### HTTP connection

This connection type supports the HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate with
external hosts. You can use the [HTTP APIs](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/http) in
the Modus SDK to interact with the host.

This connection type is also used for
[GraphQL APIs](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/graphql) and to invoke externally
hosted AI [models](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/models).

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "openai": {
      "type": "http",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"http"` for this connection type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="baseUrl" type="string" required>
  Base URL for connections to the host. Must end with a trailing slash and may
  contain path segments if necessary.

  Example: `"https://api.example.com/v1/"`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint" type="string" required>
  Full URL endpoint for connections to the host.

  Example: `"https://models.example.com/v1/classifier"`
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  You must include either a `baseUrl` or an `endpoint`, but not both.

  * Use `baseUrl` for connections to a host with a common base URL.
  * Use `endpoint` for connections to a specific URL.

  Typically, you'll use the `baseUrl` field. However, some APIs, such as
  `graphql.execute`, require the full URL in the `endpoint` field.
</Note>

<ResponseField name="headers" type="object">
  If provided, requests on the connection include these headers. Each key-value pair is a header name and value.

  Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which
  resolve at runtime to environment variables provided for each connection, via
  the Hypermode Console.

  <Accordion title="Examples">
    This example specifies a header named `Authorization` that uses the `Bearer`
    scheme. A secret named `AUTH_TOKEN` provides the token:

    ```json
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {{AUTH_TOKEN}}"
    }
    ```

    This example specifies a header named `X-API-Key` provided by a secret named
    `API_KEY`:

    ```json
    "headers": {
      "X-API-Key": "{{API_KEY}}"
    }
    ```

    You can use a special syntax for connections that require
    [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
    In this example, secrets named `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` combined and then are
    base64-encoded to form a compliant `Authorization` header value:

    ```json
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Basic {{base64(USERNAME:PASSWORD)}}"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queryParameters" type="object">
  If provided, requests on the connection include these query parameters, appended
  to the URL. Each key-value pair is a parameter name and value.

  Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which
  resolve at runtime to secrets provided for each connection, via the Hypermode
  Console.

  <Accordion title="Example">
    This example specifies a query parameter named `key` provided by a secret named
    `API_KEY`:

    ```json
    "queryParameters": {
      "key": "{{API_KEY}}"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

### Dgraph connection

This connection type supports connecting to Dgraph databases. You can use the
[Dgraph APIs](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/dgraph) in the Modus SDK to interact
with the database.

There are two ways to connect to Dgraph:

* [Using a connection string](#using-a-dgraph-connection-string) (preferred
  method)
* [Using a gRPC target](#using-a-dgraph-grpc-target) (older method)

You can use either approach in Modus, but not both.

#### Using a Dgraph connection string

This is the preferred method for connecting to Dgraph. It uses a simplified URI
based connection string to specify all options, including host, port, options,
and authentication.

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "my-dgraph": {
      "type": "dgraph",
      "connString": "dgraph://example.hypermode.host:443?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken={{DGRAPH_API_KEY}}"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"dgraph"` for this connection type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connString" type="string" required>
  The connection string for the Dgraph database, in URI format.
</ResponseField>

#### Using a Dgraph gRPC target

This is the older method for connecting to Dgraph. It uses a gRPC target to
specify the host and port, and a separate key for authentication. It
automatically uses SSL mode (with full CA verification) for the connection -
*except* when connecting to `localhost`.

Additional options such as username/password authentication aren't supported. If
you need to use these options, use the connection string method instead.

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "my-dgraph": {
      "type": "dgraph",
      "grpcTarget": "example.grpc.region.aws.cloud.dgraph.io:443",
      "key": "{{DGRAPH_API_KEY}}"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"dgraph"` for this connection type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="grpcTarget" type="string" required>
  The gRPC target for the Dgraph database.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
  The API key for the Dgraph database.
</ResponseField>

### MySQL connection

This connection type supports connecting to MySQL databases. You can use the
[MySQL APIs](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/mysql) in the Modus SDK to interact with
the database.

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "my-database": {
      "type": "mysql",
      "connString": "mysql://{{USERNAME}}:{{PASSWORD}}@db.example.com:3306/dbname?tls=true"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"mysql"` for this connection type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connString" type="string" required>
  The connection string for the MySQL database.

  Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which
  resolve at runtime to secrets provided for each connection, via the Hypermode
  Console.

  The connection string in the preceding example includes:

  * A username and password provided by secrets named `USERNAME` & `PASSWORD`
  * A host named `db.example.com` on port `3306`
  * A database named `dbname`
  * Encryption enabled via `tls=true` - which is highly recommended for secure
    connections

  Set the connection string using a URI format
  [as described in the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.html#connecting-using-uri).

  However, any optional parameters provided should be in the form specified by the
  Go MySQL driver used by the Modus Runtime,
  [as described here](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/blob/master/README.md#parameters)

  For example, use `tls=true` to enable encryption (not `sslmode=require`).
</ResponseField>

### Neo4j connection

This connection type supports connecting to Neo4j databases. You can use the
[Neo4j APIs](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/neo4j) in the Modus SDK to interact with
the database.

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "my-neo4j": {
      "type": "neo4j",
      "dbUri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
      "username": "neo4j",
      "password": "{{NEO4J_PASSWORD}}"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"neo4j"` for this connection type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="dbUri" type="string" required>
  The URI for the Neo4j database.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="username" type="string" required>
  The username for the Neo4j database.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="password" type="string" required>
  The password for the Neo4j database.
</ResponseField>

### PostgreSQL connection

This connection type supports connecting to PostgreSQL databases. You can use
the [PostgreSQL APIs](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/postgresql) in the Modus SDK to
interact with the database.

**Example:**

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "my-database": {
      "type": "postgresql",
      "connString": "postgresql://{{PG_USER}}:{{PG_PASSWORD}}@db.example.com:5432/data?sslmode=require"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  Always set to `"postgresql"` for this connection type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connString" type="string" required>
  The connection string for the PostgreSQL database.

  Values may include variables using the `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax, which
  resolve at runtime to secrets provided for each connection, via the Hypermode
  Console.

  The connection string in the preceding example includes:

  * A username and password provided by secrets named `PG_USER` & `PG_PASSWORD`
  * A host named `db.example.com` on port `5432`
  * A database named `data`
  * SSL mode set to `require` - which is highly recommended for secure connections

  Refer to
  [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING)
  for more details on connection strings.

  <Tip>
    Managed PostgreSQL providers often provide a pre-made connection string for you
    to copy. Check your provider's documentation for details.

    For example, if using Neon, refer to the
    [Neon documentation](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

<Tip>
  See [Running locally with secrets](/modus/run-locally#environment-secrets) for
  more details on how to set secrets for local development.

## Models

AI models are a core resource for inferencing. The `models` object in the app
manifest allows you to easily define models, whether hosted by Hypermode or
another host.

Each model requires a unique name, specified as a key, containing only
alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

```json modus.json
{
  "models": {
    "text-generator": {
      "sourceModel": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
      "provider": "hugging-face",
      "connection": "hypermode"
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="sourceModel" type="string" required>
  Original relative path of the model within the provider's repository.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="provider" type="string">
  Source provider of the model. If the `connection` value is `hypermode`, this
  field is mandatory. `hugging-face` is currently the only supported option.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connection" type="string" required>
  Connection for the model instance.

  * Specify `"hypermode"` for models that Hypermode hosts.
  * Otherwise, specify a name that matches a connection defined in the
    [`connections`](#connections) section of the manifest.
</ResponseField>

<Tip>
  When using `hugging-face` as the `provider` and `hypermode` as the `connection`,
  Hypermode automatically facilitates the connection to an instance of a shared or
  dedicated instance of the model. Your project's functions securely access the
  hosted model, with no further configuration required.
</Tip>
