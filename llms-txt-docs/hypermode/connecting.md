# IDEs and Clients

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

When you deploy a GraphQL schema, Dgraph serves the corresponding
[spec-compliant GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) API
at the HTTP endpoint `/graphql`. GraphQL requests can be sent via HTTP POST or
HTTP GET requests.

## Getting your GraphQL endpoint

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hypermode">
    * access the [Hypermode console](https://hypermode.com/login)
    * the `GraphQL Endpoint` is displayed at the bottom.
    * click on the link button to copy it.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-Managed">
    `/graphql` is served by the Alpha nodes of the Dgraph cluster on the
    HTTP-external-public port. Refer to
    [ports usage](/dgraph/self-managed/ports-usage).

    For a local install the graphql endpoint would be

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/graphql
    ```

    The URL depends on your configuration and specifically

    * the port offest defined by `--port_offset` option of the dgraph alpha command.
    * the configuration of TLS for https.
    * the usage of a load balancer.
  </Tab>

## Clients

You are ready to write GraphQL queries and mutation and to run them against
Dgraph cluster.

When building an app in React, Vue, Svelte, or any of you favorite framework,
using a GraphQL client library is a must.

As Dgraph serves a
[spec-compliant GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) API
from your schema, supports instropection and GraphQL subscriptions, the
integration with GraphQL UI client libraries is seamless.

Here is a not limited list of popular GraphQL UI clients that you can use with
Dgraph to build apps:

* [graphql-request](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt/graphql-request)
* [URQL](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql)
* [Apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
