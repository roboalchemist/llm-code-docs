**Start with a simple greeting:**

```text
Hello Sidekick! I'm starting the 30 Days of Agents program.
Can you tell me what makes you different from other AI assistants?
```

Notice how Sidekick explains its capabilities and agent-like features.

<Tip>
  **Agent learning moment** Sidekick can take real actions, not just provide
  suggestions. This fundamental difference shapes how you interact with it.
</Tip>

## Step 2: test web search capabilities

One of Sidekick's core strengths is real-time web search. Let's test this with
current information:

**Try this search request:**

```text
Can you search for the latest news about AI developments this week?
I'm particularly interested in any major announcements or breakthroughs.
```
