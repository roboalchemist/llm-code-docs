# Day 9: Creating Reusable Tasks - Scale Your Agent's Skills

> Learn to capture successful workflows as reusable tasks. Transform one-time interactions into scalable, repeatable skills that enhance your agent's capabilities and organizational productivity.

<Card title="Day 9 challenge" icon="repeat">
  **Goal**: create reusable tasks from successful workflows

  **Theme**: community week - workflow optimization and reusability

  **Time investment**: \~15 minutes
</Card>

<Note>
  We're reworking some things and Agent tasks are available soon!
</Note>

Welcome to Day 9! Over the past two days, you've built custom agents and
sophisticated workflows. Today you'll learn to capture these successes as
**reusable tasks**—turning one-time interactions into scalable, repeatable
skills that anyone can use.

Tasks are how agent capabilities evolve from experimental to institutional
knowledge.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Understand the difference between conversations and tasks
* Use the Create Task button to automatically generate reusable workflows
* Edit and refine auto-generated task prompts
* Experience how tasks transform agent utility

<Warning>
  This builds on Days 7-8's agent creation and workflow development. You'll need
  the custom agent and workflows you've built to complete today's activities.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding tasks vs. conversations

Before creating tasks, understand what makes them powerful:

**Conversations** are exploratory and unique:

* One-time problem solving
* Iterative refinement and discovery
* Learning and experimentation
* Context-specific solutions

**Tasks** are structured and repeatable:

* Standardized workflows
* Consistent outputs
* Scalable across users and scenarios
* Institutional knowledge capture

<Tip>
  **The task mindset** think about which workflows would be valuable if someone
  else could execute them without needing to understand all the context and
  iteration that went into creating them.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Identify task-worthy workflows

Look for conversations that have these characteristics:

**Clear workflow patterns:**

* Multi-step processes that worked well
* Consistent input/output structures
* Logical sequences that could be repeated
* Successful outcomes worth replicating

**High reusability potential:**

* Processes you'll need again with different inputs
* Workflows that could benefit other team members
* Patterns that work across different scenarios

### Common task patterns

**Research and analysis workflows:**

* Market research with standardized reporting
* Competitive analysis with consistent frameworks
* Customer feedback analysis and insights

**Automation workflows:**

* Meeting preparation with agenda and research
* Project status reporting across tools
* Content creation and distribution processes

## Step 3: using the create task button

After completing a successful workflow with your agent, look for the **Create
Task** button in the bottom left of your interface.

### How the create task button works

1. **Click the Create Task button** in the bottom left after a successful
   workflow
2. **Hypermode analyzes your conversation** to identify repeatable patterns
3. **Auto-generates a task prompt** that captures the workflow essence
4. **You can edit and refine** the generated prompt before saving

### The automatic analysis process

When you click Create Task, Hypermode:

* **Identifies the core workflow** from your conversation
* **Extracts key parameters** that could be customized
* **Generates a structured prompt** that preserves the successful pattern
* **Suggests a task name and description** based on the workflow

### Editing your task prompt

The auto-generated prompt appears for you to review and refine:

**You can edit:**

* Task name and description for clarity
* Prompt instructions to add specificity
* Parameter definitions for customization
* Output format requirements

<Info>
  The Create Task button uses AI to automatically identify reusable patterns and
  generate prompts, but you have full control to refine and perfect the task
  before saving.

## Step 4: Using your saved tasks

Once you've refined and saved your task, it becomes available as a reusable
workflow:

### How saved tasks work

* **Task pills** appear proceeding the chat interface
* **Click any task** to invoke it with new parameters
* **Provide new inputs** while maintaining the proven workflow structure
* **Get consistent outputs** that follow the pattern you established

### Testing your task

Click on your newly created task and test it with different inputs to ensure it
works reliably across various scenarios.

## What you've accomplished

In 15 minutes, you've mastered the task creation workflow:

**Automated workflow capture** used the Create Task button to automatically
identify and capture successful patterns

**Prompt refinement skills** learned to edit auto-generated prompts for maximum
effectiveness

**Scalable productivity** created tasks that others can execute with one-click
invocation

**Quality control** developed the ability to refine AI-generated task prompts
for better outcomes

**Institutional knowledge creation** transformed individual expertise into
repeatable organizational capabilities

## The power of automated task creation

The Create Task button represents a breakthrough in knowledge capture:

**Traditional approach**: manually document processes, hope people follow them,
lose institutional knowledge when people leave

**Automated approach**: one-click capture of successful workflows, AI-generated
prompts that preserve expertise, instant availability for team reuse

This is how modern organizations can scale expertise without losing the nuance
of what actually works.

## Pro tip for today

After creating several tasks using the Create Task button:

**Look for task improvement opportunities:**

* Which auto-generated prompts needed the most editing?
* What patterns make tasks more reliable and useful?
* How can you structure conversations to generate better auto-tasks?

This helps you become more effective at both conducting task-worthy workflows
and refining the results.
