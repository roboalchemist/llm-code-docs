# Design a subscriptions integration

Learn about the configuration options for a subscriptions integration.

Use this guide to learn the different ways to build your subscriptions integration, and follow the links to in-depth, step-by-step guides. You’ll need to consider the following:

- [How you want to charge customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md#pricing-model)
- [How you want your customers to provide their payment information](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md#checkout-options)
- [When you want customers to pay for the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/design-an-integration.md#select-billing-model)

## Decide how you want to charge customers 

Compare the following pricing models and determine how you want to charge your customers for the subscription to your product or service:

- **Flat rate**: Charge customers a flat rate for the service tier they choose.
- **Per-seat**: Charge customers for each pricing unit, which represents one user or seat.
- **Tiered**: Charge customers a varied amount for each pricing unit, based on quantity or usage.
- **Usage-based**: Charge customers based on their usage of your product or service.

| **Tiered**      | **Volume-based pricing**: You multiply the quantity or usage by the unit cost of the tier.

  **Graduated pricing**: You multiply the quantity or usage by the amount for each tier, and sum the totals for each tier.

  In the following example, you offer lower rates for customers who use more projects per month, with tiers that you can adjust based on volume or graduated pricing.

|             | Number of projects | Price per tier |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| First tier  | 1-5                | 7 USD          |
| Second tier | 6-10               | 6.50 USD       |
| Third tier  | 11+                | 6 USD          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Usage-based** | **Fixed fee and overage pricing**: You charge a flat fee per month for your product or service. The flat fee has some included usage entitlement, and you charge any additional usage (overage) at the end of the period.

  **Pay as you go pricing**: You charge for usage tracked over a specific period. You can use any of the following pricing: per unit, per package, volume-based, or graduated.

  **Credit burndown pricing**: You collect prepayment for your usage-based product or service, and allow customers to apply [billing credits](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/billing-credits.md) as they use your product or service.

  In the following example, you charge a flat rate per month for your service that includes a set number of tokens. You charge any usage above the included tokens at an additional rate per token.

|             | First unit | Last unit | Per unit  | Flat rate |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| First tier  | 0          | 100,000   | 0.00 USD  | 0.00 USD  |
| Second tier | 100,001    | ∞         | 0.001 USD | 0.00 USD  | |

Compare the following checkout interfaces and determine how you want your customers to provide their payment information for the subscription to your product or service.
