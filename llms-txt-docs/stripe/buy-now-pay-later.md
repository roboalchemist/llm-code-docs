# Buy now, pay later

Learn about buy now, pay later methods with Stripe.

You can also use subscription schedules to set up [installment plans](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules.md#installment-plans). Learn more about other options for [accepting payments in installments](https://docs.stripe.com/recurring-payments.md#installment-plans).

Buy now, pay later methods let customers pay in installments over time. You’re paid immediately and in full and your customers pay nothing or a portion of the total at purchase time. Buy now, pay later methods are often used by:

- Retailers selling high value goods and services like luxury items or travel fares that want to increase conversion.
- Retailers selling low value goods and services that want to increase average cart size and reach new customers who might not have credit cards.
- Regional banks that allow consumers to split credit card payments over multiple billing cycles.

Read our [Buy Now, Pay Later Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/buy-now-pay-later) for more information.

## Get started

You don’t have to integrate buy now, pay later payment methods individually. [Dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md) are enabled by default and let you configure payment methods in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) without writing code. Stripe handles the logic for dynamically displaying the most relevant eligible payment methods to each customer. You can use dynamic payment methods with [standard Checkout integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout.md). Get started by:

- [Creating a Stripe-hosted page](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart.md)
- [Embedding a payment form on your site](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/embedded/quickstart.md)
- [Building a checkout page with embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart-checkout-sessions.md)
- [Using the Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page.md)

You can manually list buy now, pay later payment methods if you build your own payments form. Read the docs for the specific payment method to understand how to add it to your integration.

## Payments

At checkout, the customer chooses to pay with a buy now, pay later service. Then the customer creates or logs into an account with the buy now, pay later provider. Next, the customer accepts or declines the terms of the repayment plan, and then returns to the business’ site.

1 Cards and bank debit methods including SEPA debit, AU BECS direct debit, and ACSS debit support both `on_session` and `off_session` with [setup future usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage). All other payment method types either don’t support `setup_future_usage` or only support `off_session`.2 Payment methods might require confirmation with [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-return_url) to indicate where Stripe should redirect your customer after they complete the payment.
