# Customer Balance Transaction

Each customer has a [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-balance) value, which denotes a debit or credit that’s automatically applied to their next invoice upon finalization. You may modify the value directly by using the [update customer API](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/api/customers/update.md), or by creating a Customer Balance Transaction, which increments or decrements the customer’s `balance` by the specified `amount`.
