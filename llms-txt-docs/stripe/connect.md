# Revenue Recognition for Connect platforms

Learn how revenue recognition works with Connect platforms.

To amortize revenue for application fees over the service periods on the direct charges or destination charges, please [create a ticket](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=financial_reports) on our support page.

You can collect application fees in three ways: [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md), [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges.md), and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md).

Create destination charges on your platform account to take fees, then transfer remaining funds to your connected accounts. Revenue recognition recognizes the revenue from the application fees.

Create direct charges to make charges directly on the connected account and take fees in the process. Revenue recognition recognizes the revenue from the application fees.

Create separate charges and transfers to make charges on your platform account on behalf of connected accounts, perform transfers separately, and retain funds in the process. Revenue recognition recognizes the revenue from the retained funds.

Destination charges are available to all users. If you’re interested in using Stripe Revenue Recognition for direct charges or separate charges and transfers, [create a ticket](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=financial_reports) on our support page.
