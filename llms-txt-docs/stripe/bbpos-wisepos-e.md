Available in: US, CA, GB, IE, SG, AU, NZ, NL, BE, AT, ES, DK, SE, NO, CH, IT, LU, PT, FI, MY, CZ, PL![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/wisepos-floating-tall.e8478124cda0e088b2e19f503f574f53.png)

The [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/bbpos-wisepos-e.md) is a countertop reader for Stripe Terminal apps. It [connects](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader.md?reader-type=internet) to the Stripe Terminal SDK over the internet.

This reader is compatible with the following integrations: JavaScript, iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs and server-driven.

For BBPOS WisePOS E readers, we recommend the [server-driven integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration.md?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven), which uses the Stripe API instead of a Terminal SDK. To view the reader’s parts and features, see the [BBPOS WisePOS E product sheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/terminal/product-sheets/wpe_product_sheet.pdf).

## Troubleshoot the reader 

Make sure your network meets all of our [network requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements.md), and try the steps in the [network troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements.md#troubleshooting) section.

To begin troubleshooting, use the following common scenarios to help diagnose the issue.

### Run diagnostics 

The BBPOS WisePOS E includes built-in diagnostics that can help you identify connectivity and configuration issues. We recommend running these diagnostics as the first step when troubleshooting any reader problems.

To access the diagnostics menu:

1. Swipe in from the left edge of the screen on your reader.
1. Tap **Settings**.
1. Enter the admin passcode. The default is **0-7-1-3-9**.
1. Select **Diagnostics**.

The diagnostics menu displays test results and information about your reader:

- **DNS resolution**: Verifies that the reader can resolve domain names.
- **Stripe connectivity**: Verifies that the reader can connect to Stripe servers. This test must pass for your reader to process payments and receive updates.
- **Terminal events connectivity**: Tests the reader’s connection to the Stripe event infrastructure.
- **WiFi information**: Shows WiFi frequency and signal strength (if connected using WiFi).
- **Battery and hardware status**: Displays battery health, voltage, capacity, and dock/hub connection status.

> If the Stripe connectivity test fails, your reader won’t be able to process payments or receive software updates. Follow the [network troubleshooting steps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements.md#troubleshooting) to resolve connectivity issues.

We recommend running diagnostics whenever you experience issues with your reader, or as part of your regular maintenance routine to proactively identify potential problems.

### Reader is unable to connect 

To check connectivity, go to [settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/bbpos-wisepos-e.md#settings), then select **WiFi settings**. This displays all available WiFi networks. To see more details about the connection, tap the connected network name.

If you’re experiencing connectivity issues, run the [diagnostics tests](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e.md#diagnostics) to check Stripe connectivity and identify the root cause.

### Reader is unable to connect to Ethernet, even though docked 

You must connect both cables before inserting the reader into the dock. Remove the reader and re-insert into the dock.

If the issue persists, run the [diagnostics tests](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e.md#diagnostics) to verify network and Stripe connectivity.

### Reader is unable to update 

If your reader doesn’t update, it’s possible that it can’t connect to Stripe. Run the [diagnostics tests](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e.md#diagnostics) to check Stripe connectivity. Make sure the Stripe connectivity test says “Passed.” If the test fails, follow [these steps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements.md#troubleshooting).

> If you use a router, refer to your router’s manual and reconfigure the networking setup.

## Stripe reader software 

Stripe maintains the software that controls the BBPOS WisePOS E. The reader receives updates automatically from Stripe when not in use. These can include improvements and required security updates from Stripe and our hardware partners. As reader software updates are made available, update your readers to the latest available version to continue using Stripe Terminal. Failing to install a required update can prevent a reader from accepting payments.

The reader restarts every day at midnight for PCI compliance, and disconnects from the POS app every morning. Leave your reader on and connected to power to receive automatic software updates. This ensures that updates happen at midnight (in the timezone of the [assigned location](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md)) to avoid interruption to sales. If you unplug the reader at night, an update could start when you turn it back on. To manually check for an update, reboot the reader.

### Reader software version 

The BBPOS WisePOS E software consists of four components: the reader application, firmware, configuration, and key identifier. The following table summarizes the latest version of each of these components for the countries where WisePOS E is available. You can find your reader’s versions in the [Diagnostics menu](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e.md#diagnostics).

> In PCI listings, the firmware identifier is in the format `WSC5x.11-xxxxx-xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` is a placeholder for ROM version and firmware version, respectively. All versions are PCI compliant.
> 
> Specifically, a PCI firmware ID `WSC5x.11-WXYZZ-ABCDD` maps to ROM version `W.X.Y.ZZ` and reader version `AA.BB.CC.DD`. For example, `WSC5x.11-18302-50127` maps to ROM version `1.8.3.2` and firmware version `5.00.01.27`. If the ROM version only has three digits `W.X.Y`, `ZZ` is `00`.

| Countries                    | Reader     | Firmware            | Configuration           | ROM     |
