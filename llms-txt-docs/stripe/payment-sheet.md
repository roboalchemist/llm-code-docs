# Payment Sheet

A prebuilt UI that presents payment methods in a sheet.

The Payment Sheet is a prebuilt UI that presents payment methods in a sheet and is our recommended way to [accept payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment.md) in most apps. You can customize it to match the look and feel of your app. The In-app Payment Sheet is available in our [iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), and [React Native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) SDKs. See our [accept in-app payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment.md) guide to get started.

> Android apps in the US that sell digital goods can now process payments in-app using the Payment Sheet. If you sell digital goods on iOS, see how to implement an app-to-web flow using Stripe Checkout in [Sell in-app digital goods and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/digital-goods/checkout.md).

## Payment methods

The Payment Sheet provides access to over 100 payment methods across all Stripe-supported countries. You can enable payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard or by using [Custom Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/custom-payment-methods.md).

Payment method providers often change their collection and display requirements. When you use Payment Sheet to display payment methods, Stripe handles all payment detail collection in prebuilt, localized forms that we keep up-to-date with each payment provider.
