# Income statement

Analyze revenue, expenses, and net income with the income statement report.

The [income statement](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/statements?tab=income_statement) provides details about your company’s financial performance for a specified period. It calculates net revenue by subtracting total contra revenue from total revenue, and determines net income by adding gains and subtracting expenses and losses from net revenue. This analysis lets you assess financial health and understand the impacts of contra revenue, expenses, and gains.

## Income statement report 

The income statement report categorizes financial data systematically, aiding in the assessment of net income and efficient tracking of contra revenue items.

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General ledger account | Lists entries mapped to your general ledger account, either mapped in Stripe using the [map to your chart of accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/chart-of-accounts.md) feature or default [Stripe accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology.md) |
| Period                 | This shows the accounting period of the report data; when using the compare feature, additional columns display multiple periods.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Compare                | When using the compare feature, additional columns show comparative data for a selected previous period, which enables side-by-side analysis.                                                                                                                                             |

The compare feature helps your analysis by providing insights across two different accounting periods, highlighting trends and changes in financial performance over time.

The figures shown in the income statement reconcile with other Revenue Recognition reports such as the balance sheet, debits and credits report, and trial balance over the same timeframe and currency, to ensure accuracy in your financial records.
