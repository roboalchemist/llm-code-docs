# User Roles and Permissions

> Datafold uses role-based access control to manage user permissions and actions.

Datafold has three default roles:

| Role     | Description    | Permissions                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| default  | Full user role | Create and modify monitors, create diffs, explore data and lineage                                   |
| admin    | Administrator  | Default permissions plus the ability to manage users and configurations such as database connections |
| viewonly | View-only role | View diffs and monitors without the ability to create or modify them                                 |
