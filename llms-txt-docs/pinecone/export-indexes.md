# Export indexes

Pinecone does not support an export function. It is on our roadmap for the future, however.

In the meantime, we recommend keeping a copy of your source data in case you need to move from one project to another, in which case you'll need to reindex the data.

For backup purposes, we recommend that you take periodic backups. Please see [Back up indexes](/guides/manage-data/back-up-an-index) in our documentation for more details on doing so.
