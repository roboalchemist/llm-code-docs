# Merchant evidence gathering

## In this article, you will find a clear guide for evidence gathering process and what evidence you need to provide to defend a dispute.

## What is evidence?

When a customer raises a dispute, they need to provide Klarna with valid evidence to support their claim. The specific information required varies based on the nature of the dispute (dispute reason) to ensure it is relevant to the issue at hand. If the necessary evidence is provided and the matter is not resolved between merchant and customer within the set timelines, an investigation might be initiated from Klarna's side and the dispute will show for you under `"Open disputes"` in the Disputes App when you are using the Merchant portal App flow, on the other hand, if you are using the email flow you will receive an email with a link to the webform.

## Report a problem

### Goods not received (full or part order)

We will request the shipping information (shipping date, carrier, and tracking number) and the proof of delivery from you (including delivery time, address, and name of receiver). In addition you will be asked to select the delivery method that suits your order. These have been categorized into three categories:

- Physical Goods,
- Intangible Goods
- On Demand/Food Delivery

Each category includes requests tailored to get the most relevant information pertaining to your dispute. Please note that **you should only select the category that applies to your order.** For `Goods not Received` disputes the main piece of evidence is a valid Proof of Delivery (POD). This document provides us with enough detail to confirm the goods have been correctly delivered to the customer as ordered. Depending on the type of goods and how they are delivered this POD can look different. We expect you to provide a POD as an attachment, it is not sufficient to provide a tracking link. The POD must meet the requirements set out in the Merchant Protection Program. Klarna cannot accept other evidence on its own, for example forwarding emails from customers saying they received the goods. You can of course provide this in addition to a POD, but without a valid POD the dispute will be decided in favor of the customer. In general if the customer does not accept the delivery of the order or does not pick-up the goods, they will be sent back. However, this is not a valid use of the right of withdrawal (in the EU) nor is it considered a valid return. The customer is expected to accept delivery and follow the right of withdrawal and/or the store's return policy. If a customer has not accepted the delivery make sure this information is included either in the POD or in the response to Klarna.

### Faulty goods (item different or significantly not as described)

These are usually the most complex disputes. Questions we commonly ask are “Have you been in contact with the customer?” and “Have you come to an agreement?” (such as refunding the faulty goods or resending the product). Accepted evidence includes:

- Proof that the claim has been solved
- Explanation of why the claim is invalid
- Offer of resolution (repair, replacement, refund)
- Prepaid return label

### Incorrect invoice

We will request evidence from you to prove that the invoice is correct. This dispute reason can include a variety of scenarios, including missing discounts, wrong price, return not registered, cancellation or invalid fees. For example if a customer claims that a discount is missing (backed up by evidence) you need to prove why the discount was not applicable.

## Report a return

### Return

We will ask you if you received the return. If you did, please make sure to adjust the invoice of the related order. If you received the return but do not accept it, make sure to explain your reasoning in the comment section (´Add reply´). If you have not received the return, but the customer used your return label, please check on the status and give a more detailed response than return not received. If the customer used your label, you are liable for the return, even if it is lost in transit. If you have more information about the return, for example the tracking ID belongs to a different order, an empty box was returned, wrong items were returned, etc. please make sure to clearly state this in your response. If you provide customers with a pre-paid return label and the customer has not used it, please include this information in your response. Please note that if you select the option indicating that you will make adjustments to the statement you are committing to performing a refund equal to the disputed amount. If you do not perform said refund within 96 hours of responding, we will perform an automatic chargeback of the disputed amount.
