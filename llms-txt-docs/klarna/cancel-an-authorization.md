# Cancel an authorization

## Use the Klarna payments API to cancel an authorization and remove any customer debts gotten during the payment session.

## Requesting the release

When a customer won't complete a purchase or you won't use the authorization token immediately, you can cancel the authorization. This action clears the customer's debt. To cancel an authorization, send a `DELETE`request with an empty request body to the `{apiUrl}/payments/v1/authorizations/{authorizationToken}` endpoint. Provide the authorization token you got from the [`authorize()` call](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/integrate-with-klarna-payments/other-actions/cancel-an-authorization.md) as an {`authorizationToken`} parameter. Canceling an authorization might impact our credit assessment when attempting to generate a new one.

### Success response

In response to your call, you receive a `204` status code corresponding to a successful but empty response.

``` json
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: application/json
Klarna-Correlation-Id: e19dc121-1276-419d-882a-c343d58fb9aa
{ }
```

### Error response

​If the authorization token in your request is invalid, you get an error response. Ensure the `authorization_token` value you provided is correctly formatted and corresponds to an authorization that has not expired.
