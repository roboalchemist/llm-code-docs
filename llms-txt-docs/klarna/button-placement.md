## Checkout page

The most important placement of the button is on the checkout page itself. Position the Express checkout button as a primary option for completing the purchase. This placement is designed to enhance the user experience, as it reduces the number of steps needed to finalize the purchase, appealing to users seeking a quick and secure checkout experience. Highlight the benefits of using the Express checkout button with an appropriate label, for example, "Checkout faster" or "Express checkout".

## Wishlists

If your platform contains a wishlist or other curated lists of products, offer the Express checkout button as the primary call to action. This can turn contemplation into action. Offering a seamless transition from wishlist to purchase encourages users to make decisions based on items they have already expressed interest in, potentially increasing conversion rates. It's also recommended to provide the user with a functionality to deselect the items that they aren't ready to purchase from a wishlist.

## Optimizing for specific shopping moments

### Featured products

Place the Express checkout button alongside featured products or promotions directly on the homepage to catch the user's interest immediately, and facilitate immediate action.

### Restocked products

When notifying shoppers about an item becoming re-stocked, implement the Express checkout button in the notification email or on the product page to capture immediate interest and facilitate action.

### In-demand products

Use prominent Express checkout buttons on flash sale pages or sections at the time they go on sale, ensuring that users can rapidly secure in-demand items. This approach can significantly enhance the user experience by reducing friction in high-pressure purchase situations.
