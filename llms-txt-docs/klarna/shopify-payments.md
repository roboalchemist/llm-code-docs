# Klarna for Shopify Payments

## Offer flexible Klarna Payment options like installments and pay later through Shopify Payments, enhancing your checkout experience in supported regions with easy integration.

### Shopify Payments - Powered by Stripe

Klarna can be added as [a local payment method](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/local-payment-methods/klarna) supported by Shopify through their Payments platform which is integrated via [Stripe](https://docs.klarna.com). Using Klarna on Shopify Payments provides a safe and easy checkout experience for your customers. Customers can choose to pay in instalments, pay in full, pay later, or finance their transaction using direct debit or credit. When a customer places an order and uses a Klarna payment option to pay, the funds are paid to you in your next [Shopify Payments payout](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/getting-paid-with-shopify-payments/view-payouts). <em>You cannot choose which Klarna payment methods to offer</em> It isn't possible to choose which Klarna payment options your customer can use at checkout. The Klarna payment options your customer can use are automatically decided depending factors including - but not limited to - your store location and the customer's previous order history. If you would like to offer Klarna in a market not listed above, integrate Klarna through the third party app [here](https://docs.klarna.com/platform-solutions/e-commerce-platforms/shopify/payments/ways-to-integrate-on-shopify).
