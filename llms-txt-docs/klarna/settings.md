By clicking on **"Generate new Klarna API key"**, you will get a new API key. It can only be accessed once, so downloading it is essential.

An API key may not be needed and in use anymore, one can disable it by clicking "*Disable*" and confirming that action by pressing "**Disable credentials**" in the following screen.

## Client identifiers

When integrating products like On-site messaging or Express checkout, using our Web SDK, you'll need to utilize a `client identifier`. To enable this functionality, you must register the origin domains where you plan to deploy the Web SDK and create a corresponding client identifier for use in your code.

Follow these steps to create a client identifier: 1.Go to **"Client Identifiers"** section. 2.If you have access to multiples MIDs with the same user, select the corresponding MID in the **Store** drop down menu at the top of the page.

3.Ensure that the merchant URLs are registered as ***Allowed Origins*** by clicking in ***"Allowed Origins***" tab. Once *allowed origins* are properly registered, go **back**'' to the previous page.

4.Click on **"+ Generate client identifier"** button in order to create a new id. A new screen will be opened with the identifier that will allow you to copy it, however this identifier will be accessible later if needed by selecting "***copy***" option in the identifiers table.
