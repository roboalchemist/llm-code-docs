Large Language Models are unlocking unprecedented possibilities. But going from a flashy demo to a production-ready app isn’t easy. You need to:

* Rapidly iterate across complex prompts, numerous models, context data, embedding model params, vector stores, chunking strategies, chain nodes and more -- getting to the **right** configuration of your 'GenAI System' **for your use case** needs experimentation and thorough evaluation.
* Carefully keep harmful responses away from your users, while keeping harmful users from attacking your GenAI systems.
* Monitor live traffic to your GenAI application, identify vulnerabilities, debug and re-launch.

Galileo GenAI Studio is the all-in-one evaluation and observability stack that provides all of the above.

### Metrics

Most significantly -- you cannot evaluate what you cannot measure -- Galileo Research has constantly pushed the envelope with our **proprietary research backed Guardrail Metrics** for best in class:

* Hallucination detection (see our published [Hallucination Index](https://www.rungalileo.io/hallucinationindex?utm%5Fsource=LinkedIn\&utm%5Fmedium=Post\&utm%5Fcampaign=HallucinationIndex)) ,
* Security threat vector identification,
* Data privacy protection,
* and much more...

### Modules

The GenAI Studio is composed of 3 modules. Each module is powered by the centralized Galileo Guardrail Store.
