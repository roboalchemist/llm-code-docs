### The Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log your runs">Integrate promptquality into your system or test a template model combination through the Playground. Choose and register your metrics to define what success means for your use case.</Step>
  <Step title="Analyze results">Identify poor perfomance, trace it to the broken step, form hypothesis on what could be behind it.</Step>
  <Step title="Debug, Fix & Run another Eval">Tweak your system and try again until your quality bar is met.</Step>
</Steps>
