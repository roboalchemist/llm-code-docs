# Web SDK Overview

Welcome to the ASAPP Chat SDK Web Overview!

This document provides an overview of how to integrate the SDK (authenticate, customize, display) and the various API methods and properties you can use to call the ASAPP Chat SDK. In addition, it provides an overview of the ASAPP ContextProvider, which allows you to pass various user information to the Chat SDK.

If you're just getting started with the ASAPP Chat SDK, ASAPP recommends starting with the [Web Quick Start](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start "Web Quick Start") section. There you will learn the basics of embedding the ASAPP Chat SDK and how to best align it with your site.

ASAPP functionality can be integrated into your website simply, by making sure that a snippet of javascript is included in your site template.

The subsections below provide both an integration overview and detailed documentation covering everything from how to easily get started with your ASAPP integration through how to implement arbitrarily fine-grained customization of the look and feel and the functioning of ASAPP technology to meet your design and functional requirements.
