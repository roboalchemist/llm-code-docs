# Chat Instead Overview

Chat Instead is a feature that allows you to prompt customers to chat instead of calling. When customer volume shifts from calls to chat, this reduces costs and improves the customer experience.

You can use any ASAPP SDK to display a menu when a customer taps on a phone number to give them the option to Chat Instead or to call.

To enable this feature:

1. Identify Call buttons or phone numbers on your website that you want to convert into entry points for Chat Instead.
2. Use the Chat Instead API, which is part of the ASAPP SDK.
3. Contact your Implementation Manager to configure Chat Instead.
