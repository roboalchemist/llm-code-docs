> Learn how to transmit data to ASAPP for Applications and AI Services.

Customers can securely upload data for ASAPP's consumption for Applications and AI Services using three distinct mechanisms. Read more on how to transmit data by clicking on the link that best matches your use case.

* [**Upload to S3**](/reporting/send-s3 "Transmitting Data to S3")

  S3 is the supported mechanism for ongoing data transmissions, though can also be used for one-time transfers where needed. ASAPP customers can transmit the following types of data to S3:

  * Call center data attributes
  * Conversation transcripts from messaging or voice interactions
  * Recorded call audio files
  * Sales records with attribution metadata
* **[Upload to SFTP](/reporting/send-sftp "Transmitting Data to SFTP")**

  SFTP is the supported mechanism for **one-time data transmissions**, typically used for sending training data files during the implementation phase prior to initial launch. ASAPP customers can transmit the following types of training data via SFTP:

  * Conversation transcripts from messaging or voice interactions
  * Recorded call audio files
  * Free-text agent notes associated with messaging or voice interactions

  Reach out to your ASAPP account contact to coordinate sending data via SFTP.
