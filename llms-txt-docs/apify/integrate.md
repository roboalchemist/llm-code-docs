# Integrate with Apify

If you are building a service and your users could benefit from integrating with Apify or vice versa, we would love to hear from you! Contact us at mailto:integrations@apify.com to discuss potential collaboration. We are always looking for ways to make our platform more useful and powerful for our users.

## Why integrate with Apify

Apify is the leading platform for web scraping, AI agents, and automation tools. By integrating Apify into your platform, you enable users to incorporate real-time, structured data from the web with zero scraping infrastructure on your side.

https://apify.com/store contains thousands of pre-built Actors, ready-made tools for web scraping and automation.

## Integration types

An Apify integration can be *general*, allowing users to integrate any Actor from Apify Store into their workflows (or their own Actors), or *Actor-specific*, enabling targeted automation like integrating https://apify.com/apify/instagram-scraper for use cases like social media monitoring.

### General integrations

General integrations allow users to integrate Actors into their workflows by connecting Apify with other platforms. Examples include:

* https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/zapier.md integration allows Zapier users to enrich their automation workflows with data from the web or to add additional Actions performed by https://apify.com/store.
* https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/keboola.md integration enables Keboola users to easily pull data crawled from the web into their data pipelines.

### Actor-specific integrations

Actor-specific integrations are designed for targeted use cases. While they work similarly to general integrations, they help users find the right Apify tools more easily and provide a better experience. Examples include:

* https://www.make.com/en/integrations/apify-instagram-scraper
* https://www.lindy.ai/integrations/instagram

For more examples both general and Actor-specific, check https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations.md.

## Integrating with Apify

To integrate your service with Apify, you have two options:

* Build an external integration using the https://docs.apify.com/api/v2
* Build an https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors that will be used as integration within https://console.apify.com

![Integration-ready Actors](/assets/images/integration-ready-actors-3f9c1f9b61abf5dd4157f050cf2cb3d8.png)

### Building an integration Actor

One way to reach out to Apify users is directly within https://console.apify.com. To do that, you need to build an integrable Actor that can be piped into other Actors to upload existing data into a database. This can then be easily configured within Apify Console. Follow the https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/actors/integration-ready-actors.md.

### Building an external integration

An alternative way is to let your users manage the connection directly on your side using https://docs.apify.com/api/v2 and our API clients for https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js or https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python. This way, users can manage the connection directly from your service.

### Authentication methods

Apify supports two main authentication methods for secure API access.

*OAuth 2.0* - Use OAuth 2.0 to allow users to authorize your integration without sharing their credentials.

*API token* - Apify user generates personal API token from Apify account settings page. For more information, see https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api#api-token.

### API implementation

To build an integration, core API endpoints can be mapped as **actions and triggers** inside your platform.

#### Action endpoints

##### Run an Actor

Triggers the execution of any Apify Actor by ID, allowing users to start custom or public web scraping and automation Actors with specified input parameters.

Recommended features:

* Select Actor: The Actor list will be pre-populated with Actors that the user created or used, using the https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/acts-get and enriched with Actors from the store, which the user has not run already using https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/store-get.
* Synchronous vs. asynchronous run: flow will wait until the run/task finishes (consider a timeout on your platform side)
* Input UI: upon selecting an Actor, dynamically display specific Actor input and preload default example values based on the Actor Input schema. Alternatively, allow users to insert a JSON input for the Actor.
* Additionally, it should include the option to choose https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds, https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources#memory, and https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources#memory.
* Field mapping: allowing users to map fields to data acquired in previous steps of the workflow.

##### Run a task

Starts a predefined task (a saved Actor configuration), making it easy for users to run recurring or templated workflows without redefining inputs each time.

Recommended features:

* *Select task*: The task list will be pre-populated with tasks that the user created, using the https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/actor-tasks-get API.
* *Synchronous vs. asynchronous run*: the flow will wait until the run/task finishes (considering timeout on your platform side)
* *JSON input field*: possibility to add a JSON input to override the task input.

##### Get dataset items

Fetches structured results (JSON, CSV, etc.) generated by a previously run Actor or task, which can be used as input for further workflow steps.

Recommended features:

* *Dataset*: Dropdown (user's datasets) or ID/String input. Populated via https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/datasets-get.
* *Limit (optional)*: The maximum number of dataset items to fetch. If empty, the default limit will be used.
* *Offset (optional)*: The offset in the dataset from where to start fetching the items. If empty, it will be from the beginning.

##### Get a key-value store item

Retrieves a specific item from a key-value store, commonly used to access metadata, snapshots, logs, or one-off results generated during Actor execution.

Recommended features:

* *Key-value store*: Dropdown (user's KV stores) or ID/String input. Populated via https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/key-value-stores-get.
* *Record key*: value (string)

##### Scrape a single URL

Runs Apify's https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler in synchronous mode to extract structured data from a single web page - ideal for on-demand URL scraping inside agents or automation flows.

Recommended features:

* *URL*: that you intend to scrape (string)

* *Crawler type*: Dropdown menu, allowing users to choose from the following options:

  <!-- -->

  * *Headless web browser* - Useful for websites with anti-scraping protections and JavaScript rendering. It recognizes common blocking patterns like CAPTCHAs and automatically retries blocked requests through new sessions.
  * *Stealthy web browser (default)* - Another headless web browser with anti-blocking measures enabled. Try this if you encounter anti-bot protections while scraping.
  * *Raw HTTP client* - High-performance crawling mode that uses raw HTTP requests to fetch pages. It's faster and cheaper, but might not work on all websites.

##### Universal API call

A node to send API requests to Apify, allowing advanced users to configure or query Actors, tasks, datasets, or other API endpoints programmatically.

#### Trigger endpoints

##### Watch Actor runs

Monitors the status of an Actor run by ID, useful for triggering follow-up steps once a job has completed. Triggered when a specific Actor run reaches terminal status (succeeded, failed, timed out, aborted).

Recommended features:

* *Select Actor runs to watch*: Dropdown (list of user's Actors). Populated via https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/acts-get

##### Watch task runs

Similar to watching Actor runs, this tracks the progress and completion status of a specific task run to allow event-driven actions in a workflow.

Recommended features:

* *Select Actor tasks to watch*: Dropdown (list of user's tasks). Populated via https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/actor-tasks-get.

### Pricing options

Choose between two pricing models based on your integration setup.

#### Direct user billing

Users create their own Apify accounts and are billed directly by Apify for their usage. This model gives users full control over their Apify usage and billing.

#### Whitelabel access

Users access Apify through your platform without needing an Apify account. Apify bills you based on consumption, and you factor costs into your pricing.

### Monitoring and tracking

To help Apify monitor and support your integration, every API request should identify your platform. You can do this in one of two ways:

* Preferred:

  <!-- -->

  * Use the `x-apify-integration-platform` header with your platform name (e.g., make.com, zapier).
  * If your platform has multiple Apify apps, also include the `x-apify-integration-app-id` header with the unique app ID.

* Alternative:
  <!-- -->
  * Set a custom `User-Agent` header that identifies your platform.

These identifiers enable better analytics and support for your integration.
