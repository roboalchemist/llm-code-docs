# Your Apify Store bio

## Your Apify Store bio and Store “README”

To help our community showcase their talents and projects, we introduced public profile pages for developers. On a dedicated page, you can showcase contact info, a summary of important Actor metrics (like total users, response time, and success rates), and all of their public Actors. We took inspiration from freelance platforms.

This space is all about helping you shine and promote your tools and skills. Here’s how you can use it to your advantage:

* Share your contact email, website, GitHub, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, or Discord handles.
* Summarize what you’ve been doing in Apify Store, your main skills, big achievements, and any relevant experience.
* Offer more ways for people to connect with you, such as links for booking a meeting, discounts, a subscription option for your email newsletter, or your YouTube channel or blog.
  <!-- -->
  * You can even add a Linktree to keep things neat.
* Highlight your other tools on different platforms.
* Get creative by adding banners and GIFs to give your profile some personality.

Everything is neatly available under a single URL, making it easy to share.
