# Fine Tuning via API

>  Fine tune your models programmatically through our API.

We've made fine-tuning via API available through unstable routes that are subject to change. For most users,
we highly recommend fine-tuning through the Webapp to achieve optimal performance with a smooth experience.
However, some users may prefer to fine-tune via API for custom use cases.

The following base models are supported for general access:

* `OpenPipe/Hermes-2-Theta-Llama-3-8B-32k`
* `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`
* `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct`
* `OpenPipe/mistral-ft-optimized-1227`
* `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`

Learn more about fine-tuning via API on the [route page](/api-reference/post-unstablefinetunecreate).
Please contact us at [hello@openpipe.ai](mailto:hello@openpipe.ai) if you would like help getting set up.
