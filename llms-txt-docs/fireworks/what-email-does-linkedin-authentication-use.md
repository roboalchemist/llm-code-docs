# What email does LinkedIn authentication use?

When you authenticate with Fireworks using LinkedIn, we use the **primary email address** associated with your LinkedIn account for identification and account management.

## How it works

Fireworks automatically retrieves your primary email address from your LinkedIn profile during the authentication process. This email address becomes your Fireworks account identifier.

## Managing your primary email

To change your primary email address on LinkedIn:

1. Go to your [LinkedIn email settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/manage-email-addresses)
2. From there, you can add new email addresses or change your primary email
3. Click **Add email address** to add a new email or select an existing one to make primary

  You can also follow the [LinkedIn documentation](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a519904) for detailed instructions on managing email preferences.

## Switching between accounts

You can easily switch which Fireworks account your LinkedIn authentication logs into by changing your primary email address on LinkedIn before logging in. This allows you to:

* Log into different Fireworks accounts using the same LinkedIn account
* Switch between personal and work accounts by updating your LinkedIn primary email
* Maintain separate billing and usage tracking for different email addresses

The authentication will use whatever email is set as primary at the time of login, so you can switch accounts by simply updating your LinkedIn primary email before authenticating.
