# API Authorization
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/authorization



The Frigade API is secured using authorization tokens.
These api keys are used to authenticate your requests to the API. You can create and manage your api keys in the [Frigade Dashboard](https://app.frigade.com/developer).

Frigade provides two scopes of API keys: public and private. Below, we describe the differences between the two.

## Public API keys

This key can be exposed publicly (i.e. in your frontend code) and is used to access the public API endpoints.
These endpoints are prefixed with the `public` namespace in the API url (e.g. `https://api.frigade.com/v1/public/flows`).

## Private API keys

This key should be kept secret and is used to access the private API endpoints. It can be used to both access public and private API endpoints.

## Sample API request

The key should be passed in the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.
For example, to access the list of available flows in your account, you would make the following request:

```bash
curl -i -X GET \
   -H "Authorization:Bearer api_public_J3FNG3dJASDKLW98SN4KLOJHNTYUFGNVSK" \
 'https://api.frigade.com/v1/public/flows'
```


# Get User Flow State
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/flows/flow-states-get

get /v1/public/flowStates
Get the state of a User in all Flows



# Update User Flow State
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/flows/flow-states-post

post /v1/public/flowStates
Updates the user's state in a single Flow



# Delete Flow
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/flows/flows-delete

delete /v1/flows/{numericFlowId}
Delete a Flow

Deleting a Flow will remove all the data associated with it, including the Flow itself, its responses, and any other related data. This operation is irreversible.

<Warning>Only call this endpoint from your backend code.</Warning>

### Obtaining the numeric ID of a Flow

To obtain the numeric ID of a Flow, you should make a [GET request](/api-reference/flows/flows-get) to get the Flow you are looking to change. The numeric ID is a number and is different from the slug (e.g. `flow_GzXC2fHz`). The reason for this is that different [versions](/platform/versioning) of the Flow share the same slug but have different numeric IDs to differentiate them.


# Get a Flow
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/flows/flows-get

get /v1/public/flows/{slug}
Get a single Flow by its Flow ID/slug.



# Update Flow
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/flows/flows-put

put /v1/flows/{numericFlowId}
Update a Flow's configuration and metadata

As this endpoint modifies data, you will need to use the [private API key](/api-reference/authorization).

<Warning>Only call this endpoint from your backend code.</Warning>

# Webhooks
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/api-reference/webhooks



Webhooks allow you to receive notifications from Frigade when certain events occur.
You can use webhooks to receive notifications about your users when they start a Flow and as they progress through it.

## Creating a webhook

To add a new webhook, open the **Developer** page from the left sidebar, pick the **Webhooks** tab and click the "New webhook" button.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/webhooks.png" />
</Frame>

## Supported events

The following events are currently supported:

<ParamField body="flowResponse.startedFlow">When a user starts a Flow</ParamField>
<ParamField body="flowResponse.completedFlow">When a user completes a Flow</ParamField>
<ParamField body="flowResponse.skippedFlow">When a user dismisses/skips a Flow</ParamField>
<ParamField body="flowResponse.startedStep">When a user starts a Step in a Flow</ParamField>
<ParamField body="flowResponse.completedStep">When a user completes a Step in a Flow</ParamField>

## Webhook payload

The payload of the message includes the type of the event in the `type` property.

The data property contains the actual payload sent by Frigade.
The payload can be a different object depending on the event type.

### Schema

```typescript
{
  // Event type identifier
  type: string;  // e.g. "flowResponse.completedFlow"
  
  // Timestamp when the event occurred (ISO 8601)
  time: string;  // e.g. "2024-08-21T16:31:36.207Z"
  
  // Request timeout in milliseconds
  timeout: number;

  // User information
  user: {
    // The user id in your system. This will match the `foreignUserId` field in the data object.
    id: string;
    // The name of the user
    name: string;
    // The email of the user
    email: string | null;
  };

  // Flow information
  flow: {
    // Flow ID, for example: flow_8Lq7hAqA
    id: string;

    // Flow name, for example: "NPS Survey"
    name: string;
  };

  // Detailed response data
  data: {
    // Step-specific data, keyed by stepId
    [stepId: string]: {
      [fieldName: string]: any;
    };

    // Response ID
    id: string;

    // Flow ID
    flowId: string;

    // Flow slug
    flowSlug: string;

    // Numeric Frigade user ID
    userId: number;

    // Frigade user slug
    userSlug: string;

    // Action type: COMPLETED_FLOW, SKIPPED_FLOW, COMPLETED_STEP, SKIPPED_STEP
    actionType: string;

    // Step ID
    stepId: string;

    // ISO 8601 timestamp
    createdAt: string;

    // Foreign user ID. This will match your own internal user ID provided to Frigade.
    foreignUserId: string;

    // Whether the flow is blocked
    blocked: boolean;

    // Whether the flow is hidden
    hidden: boolean;

    // Additional data collected, such as form data in a stringified JSON object.
    data: string;
  };
}
```

The below example shows the payload for a `flowResponse.completedFlow` event for the [NPS Survey](/component/survey/nps) component with flattened data fields:

```json

  }
}
```

## Verifying webhooks

When you create a webhook, Frigade will generate a secret key for you. You can use this key to verify that the webhook is coming from Frigade.

<Note>
  If you don't verify the request, your app will be susceptible to a number of attacks since your webhook endpoint is open to the public.
</Note>

To verify the request, you need to calculate the HMAC SHA256 digest of the JSON-encoded `data` field using the secret key as the key and compare it to the value in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header. The signature is base64 encoded.
Note that when JSON-encoding the `data` field it needs to match the order of the keys in the payload and not contain any whitespace between the keys and values.

For example, in Node.js, you can do it like this:

```ts
const crypto = require('crypto');

const payload = '{"type":"flowResponse.completedStep",....}}'
const secret = 'my-secret' // Find this in the webhook settings in the Frigade dashboard
function verifySignature(secret, payload) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(Buffer.from(payload, 'utf-8'));
  const digest = hmac.digest('base64');
  return digest;
}

const signature = verifySignature(secret, payload);

if (signature !== payload.signature) {
  throw new Error('Invalid signature');
}
```

## Verifying timestamps

The `time` field in the payload is the time when the event occurred. You can use this field to verify that the request is not a [replay attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack) by ignoring older events.

## Retrying failed requests

Frigade will retry failed requests up to 5 times with an exponential backoff strategy.

## Common fields

The following fields are available in all Frigade webhooks (shown in flattened format):

* `flow__id`: The ID of the Flow that triggered the webhook
* `flow__name`: The name of the Flow that triggered the webhook
* `user__id`: The ID of the user that triggered the webhook
* `user__name`: The name of the user that triggered the webhook (if available)
* `user__email`: The email of the user that triggered the webhook (if available)


# Announcement
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/component/announcement

Communicate information or drive action via modal-based announcements

<Frame className="h-96 items-center px-4">

    src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/components/announcement.svg"
    style={{
    width: "350px",
  }}
  />
</Frame>

## About this component

The `Announcement` component is a flexible communication tool that’s perfect for sharing important information or driving user action. They’re especially effective for getting the word out about new feature launches, upcoming webinars, or welcoming users to new areas of your product.

**When to Use Announcements:**

* **Key Communications:** Use announcements to highlight significant updates or events that need immediate user attention.
* **Transactional Flows:** They’re also great for welcoming users or guiding them to explore new features, like kicking off a product tour.

**Advantages of Announcements:**

* **Grab Attention:** Announcements often interrupt workflows in a way that demands attention, making sure users don’t miss out on important info.
* **Visual Impact:** You have ample space for visual assets (videos, images, GIF), which can help draw users in and keep the message engaging.

**Best Practices for Effective Announcements:**

* **Limit Frequency:** To avoid overwhelming users, try to keep announcements to once a session per user, and ideally once a week. This helps maintain their impact and prevents the dreaded “wack-a-mole” effect.
* **Be Concise:** Keep your messages short and to the point. The easier they are to digest, the more likely users will engage with them.
* **Target Your Audience:** Make sure your announcements are relevant and reach the right people by targeting on user properties, events and other signals.
* **Clear Calls to Action:** Use actionable phrases like “Learn more” and direct links over passive language like "Got it" or "Okay".
* **Utilize Collections:** Use Frigade Collections to manage in-app UI channels effectively, ensuring that only one announcement is displayed at a time.
* **Less Critical Info:** For non-essential information, consider launching announcements in the corner of the screen without background blurs for a subtler touchpoint.

## About this component

The `Banner` component is a versatile, persistent UI component that typically span the full width of a page or container, often at the top or bottom of the page. They serve as an unobtrusive way to communicate important information and promote additional offerings without disrupting the user’s workflow.

**When to use Banners:**

* **Alerts:** Ideal for notifying users about critical updates, such as free trial expirations or scheduled maintenance.
* **Lightweight Up-sells:** Effective for promoting related products or features, banners can be strategically targted and placed next to relevant content.

**Advantages of Banners:**

* **Non-Disruptive Communication:** Since banners remain visible without interrupting the user experience, they allow users to continue their tasks while still being informed.
* **Flexible Design Options:** Banners can be customized with full-bleed graphics and images, making them visually appealing and engaging. Frigade supports custom components including on-brand, eye-catching banners.

**Best Practices for Banners:**

* **Use Collections:** Leverage Collections to define reusable in-app UI channels, enabling teams to efficiently manage and launch banners across different pages, such as your product dashboard or a specific product pages.
* **Regulate Frequency:** Control the frequency of banner displays to ensure they remain relevant and engaging without overwhelming users.
* **Make Dismissible:** Most often, banners are easily dismissible for the best user expeirence. In select cases, banners may be non-dismissible to communicate a critical message for some time (e.g. product downtime).

A carousel checklist component to drive set up and activation

## About this component

The `Checklist` component is one of Frigade’s most popular tools, especially for user onboarding and activation. They’re super handy for guiding users through their journey, whether it’s at the start of their experience or when they’re setting up a new product vertical or a complex feature.

**When to Use Checklists:**

* **Onboarding and Activation:** Checklists are perfect for helping users get started and ensuring they complete essential tasks. They provide a clear path forward and help users feel more confident as they navigate your product.

**Advantages of Announcements::**

* **Two Default Versions:** Frigade offers two out-of-the-box checklist formats—carousel and collapsible—so you can choose what fits best for your users. Plus, if you need something custom, you can easily build one using the Frigade SDK/API.
* **Deeply integrated:** The most effective checklists measure actual in-product results. Frigade makes it easy to connect checklist steps to automatically complete from actual in-product actions and milestones.

**Best Practices for Checklists:**

* **Limit the Number of Tasks:** Keep your checklists manageable. Too many tasks can overwhelm users, so aim for a concise list that’s easy to follow.
* **Pre-Complete Steps Where Applicable:** For example, marking “Set up account” complete after sign up can show users progress from the start and create a sense of momentum (like showing 20% done instead of 0%).
* **Avoid Basic “Mark Done” Steps:** Whenever possible, tie checklist steps to actual workflows and tasks. Deep linking users to complete actions is way more effective. It’s okay to have “Skip” or “Mark done” as secondary options for non-essential steps.
* **Include a CTA to Hide the Checklist:** Giving users the option to hide the checklist can help them feel more in control of their setup and UI.
* **Break Large Workflows into Smaller Segments:** If you have a hefty checklist (like 12 steps), consider phasing it and breaking it into smaller groups (like two groups of 6). This makes it feel less daunting.
* **Measure Completion Rates:** Keep track of how users are progressing through each step and the entire checklist. This data can help you identify areas for improvement for future iterations.

## About this component

The `Form` component is a super versatile tool that can fit right into your product UI or pop up in a modal for things like surveys. They can be used for wide range of use cases including registration flows, surveys, feedback forms, and more. The component supports form validation (client and server-side), conditional fields, branching logic, and multi-step Flows.

**When to Use Forms:**

* **Embedded in UI:** Forms work great for tasks like product registration, helping users get started smoothly without leaving the page.
* **Modal Surveys:** Use forms in modals for surveys or feedback, making it easy for users to share their thoughts without disrupting their experience.

**Why Forms Are Powerful:**

* **Conditional and Branching Logic:** Forms can adapt based on user responses, guiding them through a tailored experience that feels intuitive.
* **Custom React Steps:** You can embed custom React components to invite teammates or perform API lookups, adding a personal touch to your forms.
* **Customizable Input Types:** With a variety of built-in input types—like text fields, multiple-choice options, and dropdowns—you can design forms that suit your specific needs.

**Best Practices for Forms:**

* **Provide Progress Indicators:** Adding progress bars or step indicators (like "Step X of Y") can help users see how far they've come and what's left to do. This makes the process feel less daunting and more manageable.
* **Streamlined Data Collection:** Frigade makes it easy to create new forms quickly, allowing you to gather user data and send it wherever you need it in your system.

### Dynamic Fields

    </Frame>

    Sometimes you may want to conditionally render a dynamic field based on the value of another field. The example above dynamically changes the second dropdown based on the value of the first dropdown.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration and Code">
    This component requires a custom form field for dynamically changing the input. You can achieve this by using the `formContext` provided by react-hook-forms.
    In this case, we define a [custom field](/component/form#custom-field-types) type called `DynamicFollowUpBasedOnField` that renders a `SelectField` component.
    The options of the `follow-up` dropdown depends on the value of `food`. If the user selects `pizza`, the `follow-up` dropdown will show options for pizza toppings. If the user selects `pasta`, the `follow-up` dropdown will show options for pasta sauces.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```Typescript App.tsx
      import { Form, type FormFieldProps, SelectField } from "@frigade/react";

      const App = () => {
      return (

      <Form
      flowId="my-flow-id"
      fieldTypes={{
      DynamicFollowUpBasedOnField: (props: FormFieldProps) => {
      const categoryValue = props.formContext.watch("food");
      const field = props.fieldData.props.mappings[categoryValue];

                if (!field) {
                  return null;
                }

                return (
                  <SelectField
                    {...props}
                    fieldData={{
                      ...props.fieldData,
                      ...field,
                    }}
                  />
                );
              },
            }}
          />

      )
      }

      ```

      ```yaml Configuration
      steps:
        - id: collect-intend
          title: Tell us about your favorites
          subtitle: Help us understand your preferences and taste.
          fields:
            - id: food

                      - value: alfredo
                        label: Alfredo

    </Frame>

    This example shows how to implement branching in a form based on the user's choice in the first step.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration and Code">
    If you want a form to conditionally skip a step based on the result of a previous step, you can use the `visibilityCriteria` property in the step configuration.
    For instance, the example below will jump directly to page 3 if the user picks a specific option on the first page/step:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```Typescript App.tsx
      import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';

      const App = () => {
      return (

      <Frigade.Form flowId="my-flow-id" as={Frigade.Dialog} dismissible />
      ); }

      ```

      ```yaml Configuration
      steps:
        - id: page-1
          title: This is page 1
          primaryButtonTitle: Next
          fields:
            - id: test-radio-1
              type: radio
              label: Which page do you want to go to?
              options:
                - label: Go to page 3
                  value: x
                - label: Continue to page 2
                  value: y
        - id: page-2
          title: This is page 2
          primaryButtonTitle: Next
          # Replace the flow ID below with your own
          visibilityCriteria: user.flowStepData("my-flow-id", "page-1", "test-radio-1") != "x"
          fields:
            - id: test-text
              type: text
              label: Text field
        - id: page-3
          title: This is page 3
          primaryButtonTitle: Finish
          fields:
            - id: test-radio-3
              type: radio
              label: Radio group
              options:
                - label: Radio 1
                  value: 1
                - label: Radio 2
                  value: 2
                - label: Radio 3
                  value: 3
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    `visibilityCriteria` will work with both form data or any other [Targeting](/platform/targeting#examples) condition.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Supported Field Types

The component supports the following builtin field types that correspond to their respective HTML input types:

* `select`

* `radio`

* `text`

* `textarea`

* `checkbox`

### Overriding Field Attributes

You can override or add any attribute for a field by using the `props` property in the field configuration.
For instance, this is useful if you want to use the `text` field type, but override the `type` to `email` or `tel`. It can also be used to add any attribute such as a css class, data, or styling.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: step-1
    title: This is page 1
    fields:
      - id: email
        type: text
        props:
          type: email
          className: "my-custom-class"
          data-attr: "my-custom-data-attr"
          style:
            color: "red"
```

### Custom Field Types

The Form SDK is built on top of [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), which means you can use the majority of its features in your forms. You can define your own custom field types using the `fieldTypes` [prop](#fieldtypes).
For instance, you can implement a simple calendar datepicker field type as such:

```tsx
import { FormFieldProps } from "@frigade/react";
import * as Frigade from "@frigade/react";

function CalendarField({ field, submit }: FormFieldProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="date" onChange={field.onChange} value={field.value} />
    </div>
  );
}

// ...

<Frigade.Form flowId="my-flow-id" fieldTypes={{ calendar: CalendarField }} />;
```

It is also possible to conditionally render a field based on the value of another field by using the [formContext](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useformcontext) provided by react-hook-form.
For instance, if you want a custom field called `company-size` to show up when a user selects `company` in the `customer-type` field:

```tsx
import { type FormFieldProps, SelectField } from "@frigade/react";
import * as Frigade from "@frigade/react";

<Frigade.Form
  flowId="myflowid"
  fieldTypes={{
    "company-size": (props: FormFieldProps) => {
      const customerTypeValue = props.formContext.watch("customer-type");

      if (customerTypeValue !== "company") {
        return null;
      }

      return <div>My custom conditional field</div>;
    },
  }}
/>;
```

## Form Validation

The component supports client-side and server-side validation out of the box. You can define validation rules for each field in the form configuration using the `pattern` property with a regular expression. The example below shows how to validate an email field:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: collect-intend
    fields:
      - id: email
        type: text
        required: true
        pattern:
          message: Please provide a valid email
          value: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

### Server-side Validation

You can perform server-side validation by returning a Promise from the `onPrimary` event handler. If the promise resolves to `false`, the current step in the form will not be marked as completed. The `onPrimary` event handler also contains all form data collected in the session, which allows you to send the data to your server for validation or storage.

```tsx
import { StepHandlerProp } from "@frigade/react";
import * as Frigade from "@frigade/react";

const App = () => {
  const handlePrimary: StepHandlerProp = async (step, event, properties) => {
    const response = await fetch("https://my-server.com/validate", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(properties),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      return true;
    }

    // The current step in the form will be marked as completed
    return false;
  };

  return <Frigade.Form flowId="my-flow-id" onPrimary={handlePrimary} />;
};
```

## Browser Navigation

You can implement browser navigation (back/forward) with your Frigade forms using the [useFlow](/sdk/hooks/flow) hook. This allows users to navigate through form steps using their browser's back and forward buttons.

Here's an example of how to implement this:

```jsx
import { useFlow } from '@frigade/react';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export function FormWithBrowserNavigation() {
  const flowId = 'your-flow-id';
  const { flow } = useFlow(flowId);
  const flowRef = useRef(flow);

  // Update ref when flow changes
  useEffect(() => {
    flowRef.current = flow;
  }, [flow]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!flowRef.current) return;

    // Handle browser navigation events
    const handlePopState = () => {
      const currentStepIndex = flowRef.current.getCurrentStepIndex();
      const newStepIndex = parseInt(window.location.hash.replace('#step-', '')) || 0;
      
      if (newStepIndex < currentStepIndex) {
        // User clicked back - go to previous step
        flowRef.current.back();
      } else if (newStepIndex > currentStepIndex) {
        // User clicked forward - go to next step
        flowRef.current.forward();
      }
    };

    // Add event listener for browser navigation
    window.addEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);
    };
  }, []); 

  return (
    <Frigade.Form 
      flowId={flowId}
    />
  );
}
```

This example:

1. Uses the `useFlow` hook to get access to the flow instance
2. Uses a ref to store the flow instance and prevent re-renders
3. Sets up an event listener for browser navigation (`popstate`)
4. Handles browser back/forward navigation by moving to the appropriate step using `flow.back()` or `flow.forward()`
5. Cleans up the event listener when the component unmounts

When users click the browser's back button, they'll be taken to the previous step in the form. Similarly, clicking forward will take them to the next step.

## Prefilling a form

Forms can be prefilled by using [Dynamic Variables](/platform/dynamic-variables) by linking the `value` of a `field` to the `variables` prop of the Form component. The example below shows how to prefill a form with the user's name:

<CodeGroup>
  ```Typescript App.tsx
  import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';

  const App = () => {
  return (

  <Frigade.Form
  flowId="my-flow-id"
  variables={{
    name: "John Doe",
  }}
  />
  ) }

  ```

  ```yaml Configuration
  steps:
    - id: collect-intend
      fields:
        - id: name
          type: text
          label: Your name
          value: ${name}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Hint
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/component/hint

Hints are a great way to subtly call attention to specific parts of your UI

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/components/hint.svg"
    style={{
    width: "350px",
  }}
  />
</Frame>

## About this component

The `Hint` component provides users with contextual guidance without interrupting their workflow. Unlike tours, hints are not sequential and are closed by default, allowing users to engage with them at their own pace. This design choice minimizes disruption and enhances the user experience by offering assistance when needed.

**When to Use Hints:**

* **Contextual Assistance:** Provide users with relevant tips or information based on their current task or location within the app.
* **Feature Highlights:** Draw attention to new or underutilized features without overwhelming users with a full tour.
* **Error Prevention:** Offer guidance that helps users avoid common mistakes or pitfalls as they navigate the application.

**Best Practices for Hints:**

* **Visibility:** Ensure hints are easily noticeable but not obtrusive. Use subtle animations or colors to draw attention without being distracting.
* **Actionable Content:** Like tours, hints should provide actionable advice. For example, instead of stating “This is the settings page,” a hint could say, “Click here to adjust your notification preferences.”
* **Dismissible:** Hints should be easily dismissible. Users should feel in control and not forced to engage with hints if they choose not to.

## Demo

# Card
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/component/inline-card

Communicate information or drive action via in-line content cards

<Frame className="h-96 items-center">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/components/inline-card.svg" style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }} />
</Frame>

## About this component

The `Card` component is a handy little UI element that’s great for showing off promotional materials and important info in a visually appealing way. While they share some similarities with banners, cards have their own unique vibe and offer flexibility in placement.

**When to Use Cards:**

* **Promotional Materials:** Think of cards as your go-to swiss-army knife for inline promotions. For instance, showcasing new features, nudging users with onboarding tips, or encouraging user referrals.

**Advantages of Cards:**

* **Inline Placement:** You’ll usually find cards sitting neatly within in the main UI, like in a sidebar or alongside other product elements. This makes them easy to spot without getting in the way of the user experience.
* **Visual Appeal:** Cards can be designed with eye-catching images, icons, and text, making them interesting and engaging for users.
* **Versatile Use:** Whether you’re promoting a feature or sharing a helpful resource, cards can handle a variety of content types, making them super flexible.

**Best Practices for Cards:**

* **Strategic Placement:** Think about where you put your cards. Positioning them where users can easily see them can boost engagement.
* **Keep It Consistent:** Stick to a consistent design and placement across all your cards. These patterns helps create a cohesive look and feel throughout your app, which increases engagement.
* **Clear Calls to Action:** Make sure each card has a clear call to action, like “Learn More” or “Request Demo.” This encourages users to take that next step.

## Resources

* Launch cards with no-code using custom [Collections](/platform/collections#inline-ui-components)
* Target your card to specific users with [Targeting](/platform/targeting)
* See [industry examples](https://www.productonboarding.com/?type=card) of cards

# Progress Badge
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/component/progress-badge

Display a user's progress through a Flow

    style={{
    width: "220px",
  }}
  />
</Frame>

## About this component

The Progress Badge component is unlike other components in that it doesn't have its own Flow. It exists to remind a user where they left off in an existing Flow (e.g. Checklist), and to help get them jump back in and complete it.

## Demo

* See progress badges in action in our [live demo](https://demo.frigade.com/checklists)

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code">
    ```tsx
    import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <Frigade.ProgressBadge flowId="my-flow-id" />
      );
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

# NPS Survey
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/component/survey/nps

Collect structured and freeform feedback from your users

<Frame className="h-96 items-center px-4">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/components/nps.svg" />
</Frame>

## About this component

The `Survey` component is a fantastic way to engage users right when it matters and gather valuable feedback or data. Whether you’re looking to measure satisfaction or collect insights, targeted in-app surveys can help you connect with users at key moments in their journey.

**When to Use Surveys:**

* **User Research:** Deploy surveys like NPS (Net Promoter Score) right after users complete specific actions. This is a great way to capture their feelings while the experience is fresh in their minds.
* **Data Collection:** Use surveys to collect additional data after user signups, helping you enrich your CRM and tailor your communications.

**Best Practices for Surveys:**

* **Flexible Display Options:** By default, NPS surveys typically float on the screen, ensuring they don’t take over the entire user experience. This keeps the process smooth and non-intrusive.
* **Full-Screen Takeovers:** For the highest engagement rates, for custom surveys or other input forms, they can be displayed inline within the page or as a full page modal. Just be sure to use these methods thoughtfully to avoid annoying users.

**Custom Surveys:**

* **Built on Forms:** Custom surveys utilize the same underlying components as Forms, which means you can refer to the Forms documentation for more details on how to create and implement them effectively.

## Resources

* Launch surveys with no-code using [Collections](/platform/collections#announcements-surveys-and-dialogs)
* Target your survey to specific users with [Targeting](/platform/targeting)
* See [industry examples](https://www.productonboarding.com/?type=survey) of surveys

## Demo

* See surveys in action in our [live demo](https://demo.frigade.com/modals)

## Alternative scales

The component comes with a default NPS scale of 0-10. You can also use a custom scale by passing the `options` property either directly in the React component or in the YAML config via the `props` property. For instance, in the example below, we're using an emoji scale:

  <Tab title="Emoji Survey">
    <Frame style={{ paddingTop: "64px", paddingBottom: "64px" }}>

# Tour
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/component/tour

Guide users through a specific product flow or feature

<Frame>

## About this component

The `Tour` component is a sequential walkthrough designed to guide users through in-app steps. While tours can be one of the most effective ways to onboard users, they can also be a bit controversial. A poorly designed tour can be frustrating, especially if it interrupts users when they have a task in mind. We’ve all been there—logging into an app only to be confronted by an intrusive tour that disrupts our focus. This often leads to users rushing to close or ignore the tour, resulting in a net negative experience.

**When to Use Tours:**

* **Product Onboarding:** Show new users around critical workflows to get started
* **Feature Launches:** Increase adoption of a new feature by showing users how it workflows
* **Ongoing Education:** Automatically trigger tours for users once they reach a certain usage threshold, or give users the ability to request a tour themselves if they get stuck

**Best Practices for Announcements:**

* **Opt-In Design:** Tours should ideally be opt-in. Asking users if they want guidance results in much higher engagement compared to forcing a tour upon them. Users can opt in from a checklist, announcement, inline card, or help hub.
* **Actionable Steps:** Avoid generic and obvious statements like “This is the X page.” Instead, make tours actionable by connecting them to actual user actions. For example, a step that completes only when a user enters specific input or successfully finishes a task.
* **Keep It Short:** Tours should be concise—avoid lengthy, 16-step tours that can overwhelm users.
* **Dismissible:** Generally, tours should be dismissible. Be cautious about creating a tour that cannot be closed.
* **Relaunch Hub:** If relevant, consider providing a hub where users can relaunch specific tours. This is helpful if they are not ready or don’t have time when prompted.

  />
</Frame>

## Targeting announcements

You can target [announcements](/component/announcement) to specific groups of users using the [Targeting](/platform/targeting) section on the flow detail page.
By default, an announcement will show up for all users once the flow code is live in production.

## Launching additional announcements without code changes

We recommend using the [Dialogs Collection](/platform/collections) to launch new announcements without updating your product codebase. The Dialogs Collection is built-in to the Frigade SDK and can be used to launch Frigade Announcements, Surveys, and other Dialog-based components.

## Launching another Flow from an Announcement

You may want to launch another Flow when a user clicks on the primary button of a different Flow. For example, you can launch a tour Flow when a user clicks on the primary button of an announcement. You can achieve this my modifying the [Targeting](/platform/targeting) of the tour Flow directly in the Frigade dashboard, locating the given announcement under **Flows** and selecting **Completed** (typically initiated by the primary button) or **Dismissed** (if the user clicks the X button in the announcement).

# Using Custom Components in Collections
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/guides/custom/collections



[Collections](/platform/collections) allow you to deploy [Flows](/platform/flows) without having to manually embed them in your app code, which is great! Who doesn't love no-code deploys? But you may be asking "How do I use Custom Components if I'm not rendering React components directly?" Great question, let's dig in to how to use Custom Components in Collections.

To start, let's get a Collection set up with a Custom Flow in it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a &#x22;Macguffins&#x22; Collection">
    In the Frigade web app, [Create a Collection](/platform/collections#creating-a-collection) named "Macguffins".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Custom Flow">
    1. In the top nav bar, click the "Create" button and select "Custom" from the list of available Flow types.
    2. Use the three dot menu to rename your flow to "The Rug"
    3. In the Advanced Flow editor, replace the default YAML with the following:

    ```yaml
    type: macguffin
    title: The Rug
    subtitle: It really ties the room together.
    owner: The Dude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your Flow to the Macguffins Collection">
    1. Select "Collections" in the left nav bar
    2. Click "Macguffins" from the list of Collections
    3. Click "Add Flows" and select "The Rug"
    4. Click "Save Collection" (or press CMD+S)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Embed the Macguffins Collection in your app">
    1. Click "In-App Channel" to show the embed code for your Collection
    2. Paste the embed code into your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

Great! Excellent job so far, you should now have a Collection in your app that does absolutely nothing. But this is a good thing! You've defined a Flow with a `type: macguffin` that's unknown to Frigade -- we don't have a built-in Component in the SDK that matches that Flow type, so there's nothing to render yet.

Let's fix that by wiring up a new `<Macguffin>` Component and registering it with the Frigade `<Provider>` so that we know how to render Flows with `type: macguffin`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Macguffin Component">
    Paste the following code into `Macguffin.tsx`

    ```jsx
    import { Flow, type FlowProps } from '@frigade/react';

    export function Macguffin(props: FlowProps) {
      return (
        <Flow {...props}>
          {({ flow }) => {
            <h3>{flow.title}</h3>
            <p>{flow.subtitle}</p>
            <p>{flow.owner}</p>
          }}
        </Flow>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pass your Component into the Provider">
    Add the `flowTypes` prop to `<Frigade.Provider>` to map your new `<Macguffin>` Component to the `macguffin` Flow type

    ```jsx
    import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';

    import { Macguffin } from 'Macguffin.tsx'

    export function App() {
     return (
       <Frigade.Provider apiKey="..." flowTypes={{
         macguffin: Macguffin
       }}>
         {/* ... */}
       </Frigade.Provider>
     )
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it, you're done. You should now see your `<Macguffin>` rendering the contents of your Flow. Now that you have it set up, you can deploy any Flow with `type: macguffin` to any Collection.


# Flow Component
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/guides/custom/flow-component



`<Flow>` is a generic wrapper that bootstraps all of the functionality of a Frigade Flow. We use it as the basis for building Flow-aware Components in our SDK, and we recommend it as the starting point when building your own custom components.

In this example, we will build a custom announcement component with an open source UI kit. We'll use `AnnouncementProps` and `Flow` from `@frigade/react` to get the data. We'll use [Sanity UI](https://www.sanity.io/ui) primarily to build the UI.

The final result looks like this:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/guides/custom/sanity-announcement.png" style={{maxWidth: '700px'}} />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new Announcement Flow">
    In the Frigade dashboard, tap "Create Flow" from the top right corner and select "Announcement" as the Flow type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update the Flow YAML">
    Next, we can update the YAML to include our desired announcement content. Here's an example we can start with:

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - id: announcement-page-one
        title: First page title
        subtitle: A space to share more details with users about your product update or announcement.
        primaryButton:
          title: Click me
          uri: https://www.frigade.com
          target: _blank
        secondaryButton:
          title: Next
        imageUri: https://frigade.com/img/grey-box-two.svg
      - id: announcement-page-two
        title: Second page title
        subtitle: This is also a space to share more details with users about your product update or announcement.
        imageUri: https://frigade.com/img/grey-box-two.svg
        primaryButton:
          title: Learn more
          uri: https://www.frigade.com
          target: _blank
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a React component">
    Now let's create a React component to render our announcement in the product.

    We will import some components from `@frigade/react` and `@sanity/ui` to build the UI. Here are our imports:

    ```jsx
    "use client";
    import { Button, Card, Dialog, Flex, ThemeProvider } from "@sanity/ui";
    import { buildTheme } from "@sanity/ui/theme";
    import { AnnouncementProps, Flow, Progress, Text } from "@frigade/react";
    ```

    Next we have the announcement component. We use `flowId` to connect the component to our Frigade Flow. Then we use the Announcement props such as `step.title`, `step.subtitle`, `step.imageUri`, `step.primaryButton.title`, and `step.secondaryButton.title` to render the content where we like.

    We are using the Sanity UI `Dialog`, `Button`, `Card`, and `Flex` components to build the UI. Sanity doesn't have a component for progress, so we can import the `Progress` component from `@frigade/react` to render optional progress indicators for the current page.
    \`

    ```jsx
    export function AnnouncementWithFrigade({
      flowId,
      ...props
    }: AnnouncementProps) {
      return (
        <ThemeProvider theme={buildTheme()}>
          <Flow as={null} flowId={flowId} {...props}>
            {({
              flow,
              handleDismiss,
              handlePrimary,
              handleSecondary,
              parentProps: { dismissible },
              step,
            }) => (
              <Dialog
                __unstable_autoFocus={false}
                header={step.title}
                id="dialog-example"
                onClose={
                  dismissible
                    ? () => {
                        // @ts-expect-error - handleDismiss expects an event to be passed to it
                        handleDismiss();
                      }
                    : undefined
                }
                zOffset={1000}
              >
                <Flex
                  direction="column"
                  gap={4}
                  paddingRight={4}
                  paddingLeft={4}
                  paddingBottom={4}
                >
                  {step.imageUri && (
                    <Card radius={4} overflow="hidden">
                      <img src={step.imageUri} />
                    </Card>
                  )}

                  <Text.Body2>{step.subtitle}</Text.Body2>

                  <Progress.Dots
                    current={flow.getCurrentStepIndex() + 1}
                    marginInline="auto"
                    total={flow.getNumberOfAvailableSteps()}
                  />

                  <Flex direction="row" gap={3}>
                    {step.primaryButton?.title && (
                      <Button
                        onClick={handlePrimary}
                        text={step.primaryButton.title}
                        tone="primary"
                        width="fill"
                      />
                    )}
                    {step.secondaryButton?.title && (
                      <Button
                        onClick={handleSecondary}
                        mode="ghost"
                        space={3}
                        text={step.secondaryButton.title}
                        width="fill"
                      />
                    )}
                  </Flex>
                </Flex>
              </Dialog>
            )}
          </Flow>
        </ThemeProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Place the component in your product">
    Now, if you've already installed Frigade via the [quick start guide](/quickstart), you can simply place the `AnnouncementWithFrigade` component in your product where you'd like the announcement to appear with the `Flow ID` we generated in the first step. Here's an example of how you might do that:

    ```jsx
    "use client";
    import { AnnouncementWithFrigade } from "@/components/Sanity/Announcement";

    const ECommerce: React.FC = () => {
      return (
        <>

          <AnnouncementWithFrigade dismissible={true} flowId="flow_VEJdWA2M" />

          {/* Your application here */}

        </>
      );
    };

    export default ECommerce;
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're done!">
    That's it! You've built a custom announcement component using the Frigade React SDK and Sanity UI. If you visit the page you should now see your announcement in the product.

    As you interact with the Flow, you will see a user profile generated in the Frigade dashboard. You can delete the user or reset this specific Flow in the user profile page in order to see it again after completing it.

    Of course, you can always use targeting as well to ensure your announcement only shows up after a certain action or to a specific audience.
  </Step>
</Steps>


# JavaScript SDK
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/guides/custom/js-sdk



You can build components entirely headless using the [Frigade JS SDK](/sdk/js). For instance, to build a simple Checklist component, you can use the `Flow` and `Step` classes to get the data and build the UI. Here's an example of how to do just that:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js app.js
  import { Flow, Step } from '@frigade/js';

  const flowId = 'flow_RgilNasCrSBQmrVM'; // Replace this with the Flow ID found in the Frigade dashboard
  const frigade = new Frigade('FRIGADE_API_KEY');
  const flow = await frigade.getFlow(flowId);

  const checklist = document.getElementById('checklist');

  const steps = flow.getSteps();
  const stepsCompleted = flow.getNumberOfCompletedSteps();
  const totalSteps = flow.getNumberOfAvailableSteps();

  const progress = document.createElement('div');

  progress.innerHTML = `
    <div>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>${stepsCompleted}/${totalSteps}</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      ${steps.map((step, index) => {
        const isCompleted = index < stepsCompleted;
        return `<div style="background-color: ${isCompleted ? 'blue' : 'grey'}; height: 9px; width: 100%;"></div>`;
      }).join('')}
    </div>
  `;

  checklist.appendChild(progress);

  const stepsList = document.createElement('ul');
  stepsList.innerHTML = steps.map((step, index) => {
    const isCompleted = index < stepsCompleted;
    let html = `<li style="color: ${isCompleted ? 'blue' : 'grey'};">`
    html += `<p>${step.name}</p>`;
    html += `<button id="step-${step.id}">Mark Complete</button>`;
    html += `</li>`;
  }).join('');

  checklist.appendChild(stepsList);

  steps.forEach((step, index) => {
    const isCompleted = index < stepsCompleted;
    const button = document.getElementById(`step-${step.id}`);
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      if (!isCompleted) {
        step.complete();
        button.style.color = 'blue';
      }
    });
  });
  ```

  ```html index.html
  <div id="checklist"></div>
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# useFlow Hook
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/guides/custom/useflow-hook



The `useFlow` hook sits one layer deeper in the React SDK than the [Flow Component](/guides/custom/flow-component) and serves as the connection between our vanilla JS data layer and React Components.

In most cases, you'll want to use `<Flow>` over `useFlow`, but if you need a deeper level of control over the lifecycle and behavior of a Flow, or if you need access to a Flow outside of a Component, this hook is for you.

In this example, we'll build a Progress Badge using the [useFlow hook](/sdk/hooks/flow) for the data layer.
Additionally, we'll leverage a series of prebuilt Frigade component primitives such as `<Box>` to build the UI.

The final result looks like this:

<Frame caption="A custom built progress badge">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/guides/custom/custom-progress-badge.png" style={{maxWidth: '400px'}} />
</Frame>

First, create a new Flow in the Frigade Dashboard by navigating to the **Flows** tab and clicking **Create Flow**. Select **Custom Flow** as the Flow type.

You can use any code you wish for the YAML configuration, however, we recommend starting with the following example:

```yaml
steps:
    # Only the id field is required per step.
  - id: unique-step-id-1
    title: Some title
    # You can add any custom fields here.
    # They will automatically be available in the Flow object.
    foo: bar
  - id: unique-step-id-2
    title: Some title
  - id: unique-step-id-3
    title: Some title

```

We're now ready to wire in the frontend code. Start by simply importing the `useFlow` hook. We'll then use the hook to get the flow data and calculate the number of steps completed and the total number of steps:

```jsx
import { useFlow } from '@frigade/react';

export function ProgressBadge() {
  const flowId = 'flow_RgilNasCrSBQmrVM'; // Replace this with the Flow ID found in the Frigade dashboard
  const { flow } = useFlow(flowId);
  const stepsCompleted = flow?.getNumberOfCompletedSteps();
  const totalSteps = flow?.getNumberOfAvailableSteps();
}
```

To see the full list of methods and fields in the `flow` object, see the [Flow API Reference](/sdk/js/flow).

Now, all we have left to do is to build the UI. We'll use the `Box` and `Text` components from the Frigade React SDK to build the UI. We'll also use the `IconRender` component to render the ChevronRight icon from the `lucide-react` package:

```jsx
import { Box, Text, useFlow } from '@frigade/react';
import { ChevronRight } from 'lucide-react';

export function ProgressBadge() {
  const flowId = 'flow_RgilNasCrSBQmrVM';
  const { flow } = useFlow(flowId);
  const stepsCompleted = flow?.getNumberOfCompletedSteps();
  const totalSteps = flow?.getNumberOfAvailableSteps();


  if (!flow) {
  return null;
  }

  // This flag is automatically set to false if the Flow is not visible to the user.
  // Flows will automatically be hidden if the user has already
  // finished the Flow or if they don't fit the audience.
  if (!flow.isVisible) {
  return null;
  }

  return (
      <Box
        display="flex"
        flexDirection="column"
        border="md"
        borderRadius="md"

          >
            {Array.from({ length: totalSteps }, (_, i) => {
              const stepNumber = i + 1;
              const isCompleted = stepNumber <= stepsCompleted;
              return (
                <Box
                  key={i}
                  backgroundColor={
                    isCompleted
                      ? 'blue'
                      : 'grey'
                  }
                  borderRadius="md"
                  height="9px"
                  width="100%"
                  display="flex"
                />
              );
            })}
          </Box>
        </Box>
      </Box>
  );
}
```

That's it! You've built a custom component using the Frigade React SDK.

# Guide: Targeting New Users
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/guides/only-target-new-users

Learn how to use Frigade's [targeting](/platform/targeting) feature to only show a Flow to new users

### Targeting a Flow to new users

When building product onboarding, the brand new user experience is often one of the first experiences teams focus on. In this guide, we'll show you how to set up your Flow so that your new user experience is only shown to new users.

There are several ways to approach this, but we'll cover one of the most straight forward and popular methods.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write sign up dates to Frigade user properties">
    First, we'll want begin passing user signup or account created dates to Frigade. You can do this by sending the property to Frigade with the SDK. The documentation on [User Hook](/sdk/hooks/user) has more details, but below is a code snippet with an example.

    ```tsx
    import { useUser } from '@frigade/react';

    const { addProperties } = useUser();

    addProperties({
      // Pull this number from your database or auth provider
      createdAt: '2023-08-01T00:00:00.000Z',
    });
    ```

    Once a property is written to Frigade, it will begin to show up in the user properties section of the user detail page and you'll be able to access it for Frigade targeting and dynamic variables.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/guides/targeting/user-properties.png" className="rounded-md" style={{border: '1px solid #E8EBF0',}} />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add targeting to your Flow">
    Next, open the **Targeting** tab of the Flow detail page. Click `Add filter`, then choose `User property`, and then choose our `createdAt` field we just set for account creation date. Once selected, we can set the logic so only shows it to new users.

    By choosing `is greater than` we can tell Frigade to only show this Flow to users whose sign up date is on or after a specific day, such as the day we roll the experience out. We could also choose an option like `within the last X days` to show an experience to users within a relative time period.

    You can of course adjust and combine the properties and periods to further refine your targeting (e.g. isEnterprise, completedSetup, etc.).

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/guides/targeting/audience-targeting.png" alt="User detail page" className="rounded-md" style={{border: '1px solid #E8EBF0',}} />

    And that's it! Now your Flow will only be shown to users who signed up in the period you specified. If you already have audiences set up with another analytics tool, be sure to check out our [Integrations](/integrations) to connect and use them in Frigade.

1. [Adding a Tour to your application](#adding-a-tour-to-your-application)
2. [Adding Hints to your application](#adding-hints-to-your-application)
3. [Tips and tricks](#tips-and-tricks)

## Adding a Tour to your application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Tour">
    In the Frigade Dashboard, create a new [Tour](https://app.frigade.com/prod/components/tour).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find your Step anchors">
    Pick out the elements in your application that you want to attach individual Steps to.

    <Info>Each Step in a Tour uses a [CSS Selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors) to attach itself to the element in your page that you want to highlight. We recommend adding a unique `id` to your element to ensure that Frigade can find it.</Info>

    ```tsx
    <span id="my-element">
      This is the element that we're going to attach a Tour Step to.
    </span>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Flow">
    In the Frigade Dashboard, use the `selector` property in each step of your Tour to highlight the desired element in your application:

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - title: "Welcome to Frigade!"
        description: "This is a tour of the Frigade platform."
        selector: "#my-element"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Embed the Tour Component">
    Add the [Tour](/component/tour) Component to your application with its corresponding Flow ID.

    ```tsx
    <Frigade.Tour flowId="flow_Bkh43aEjXcrna2lO" />
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Hints to your application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create some Hints">
    In the Frigade Dashboard, create new [Hints](https://app.frigade.com/prod/components/hints).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find your Hint anchors">
    Pick out the elements in your application that you want to attach individual Steps to.

    <Info>Each Hint uses a [CSS Selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors) to attach itself to the element in your page that you want to highlight. We recommend adding a unique `id` to your element to ensure that Frigade can find it.</Info>

    ```tsx
    <span id="my-element">
      This is the element that we're going to attach a Hint to.
    </span>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Flow">
    In the Frigade Dashboard, use the `selector` property in each Hint to highlight the desired element in your application.

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - title: "Welcome to Frigade!"
        description: "This is a tour of the Frigade platform."
        selector: "#my-element"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Embed the Tour Component">
    No, that's not a typo, Hints are actually a specially configured `<Frigade.Tour>`!

    ```tsx
    <Frigade.Tour
      flowId='flow_Bkh43aEjXcrna2lO'
      sequential={false} // Show all Steps at once
      defaultOpen={false} // Only show Hint markers
    />
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips and tricks

### Seamless navigation between pages

One of the benefits of Frigade is that it can tap into your existing router to navigate users across pages without janky page refreshes. Check out our guide on [Navigation](/sdk/navigation) for setup.

### Debugging Steps

If a Step in a Tour is not appearing when you expect it to, you can enable debugging by enabling Verbose logging in your browser. To enable this in Chrome Devtools, simply click the three dot menu in the console as shown below:

<Frame caption="Enabling verbose logging in Chrome Devtools">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/guides/tours/debug.png" className="h-96" />
</Frame>

This will log if a selector is not found on the current page.

### Controlling the z-index of Steps

By default, Steps are rendered with a z-index of 9999. To change this, you can use the `zIndex` prop on a Tour:

```tsx
<Frigade.Tour flowId="my-flow-id" zIndex={100} />
```

Or alternatively, you can override the z-index for a specific Step directly in the YAML config using the `zIndex` property:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: my-tour-step
    title: My title
    subtitle: My subtitle
    primaryButton:
      title: Got it
    selector: "#my-tour-step-anchor"
    props:
      zIndex: 42
```

### Overriding position for a specific Step

If you want to force a specific Step to show up on the left or right side of the targeted element, you can use the `align` and `side` properties in Config YAML to override the default positioning.
It follows the same syntax as the [align and side props](/component/tour#align) on the `Tour` component.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: my-tour-step
    title: My title
    subtitle: This Step will show up on the left of the target element, after its trailing edge
    primaryButton:
      title: Got it
    selector: "#my-tour-step-anchor"
    props:
      align: after
      side: left
```

### Offset x and y positioning

You can add a custom offset to the x and y positioning of each Step in a Tour using the `sideOffset` and `alignOffset` properties (see [Tour component documentation](/component/tour)).
Alternatively, you can override the offset for a specific Step directly in the YAML config by leveraging the `props` field:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: my-tour-step
    title: My title
    subtitle: My subtitle
    primaryButton:
      title: Got it
    selector: "#my-tour-step-anchor"
    props:
      sideOffset: 10
      alignOffset: -10
```

### Hiding CTA buttons

Sometimes you may want to hide the CTA button on a single Step for a user to take an action in your application rather than simply continuing the tour on every button click. To do this, simply omit the `primaryButton.title` property in the YAML config:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: my-tour-step
    title: My title
    subtitle: My subtitle
    # Omitting primaryButton.title will hide the CTA button
    # primaryButton:
    #   title: Got it
    selector: "#my-tour-step-anchor"
```

### Programmatically completing a step

If you want too programmatically complete the step (e.g. an action in your app advances the Flow), see the documentation for automatically [advancing a Flow](/sdk/advanced/completing-a-step).


# Amplitude

# Hubspot
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/integrations/hubspot



Frigade supports writing data to Hubspot. When users take action in Flows, Frigade will send the data and any corresponding metadata to Hubspot.
For instance, when a User completes a Survey or a step in a Checklist, Frigade will send this data to Hubspot to the matching contact.

<Info>
  Frigade will only send data to Hubspot if the User has an email associated with them. To associate an email with a User, see the [useUser hook](/sdk/hooks/user) or the [User API](/api-reference/users).
</Info>

# Sending Frigade data to Hubspot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Hubspot API Token">
    To get started, you will need to create a Hubspot API token by setting up a Private App in your Hubspot account.
    You can do this by navigating to the **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Private Apps** page as seen below:
    ![Hubspot Integrations](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/hubspot/settings.png)

  </Step>
</Steps>


# Mixpanel
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/integrations/mixpanel



Frigade supports ingesting Mixpanel data and using this data to [Target flows](/platform/targeting) to users.

There are two ways to integrate Mixpanel with Frigade: real-time sync (via Mixpanel Webhooks) or a daily sync (via the Mixpanel API). Both options can also be used together.

Depending on your use case, we recommend using the Webhook integration for real-time data and the API integration for historical data as well as syncing non-standard user properties.

## Mixpanel Webhooks (Webhook sync)

Sending Mixpanel data via Webhooks allows you to send real-time data to Frigade as your users enter and leave cohorts. The setup process is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook in Mixpanel">
    Following the [Mixpanel documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/cohort-sync/webhooks), create a new Webhook on the Mixpanel **Integrations** page.
    You should use the following parameters when creating the webhook:

    * **Connector name:** `Frigade`
    * **URL:** `https://api.frigade.com/v1/thirdParty/cdp/mixpanel`
    * **Username:** `frigade`
    * **Password:** Your <i>private</i> Frigade API key (found on the **Developer** page in the Frigade dashboard)

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/mixpanel/webhook-1.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="View cohort data in Frigade">
    After setting up the Webhook, you will see the cohort data in the Frigade dashboard. Note that it may take up to 30 minutes the first time before all data is synced.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/mixpanel/webhook-2.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mixpanel Cohorts in Frigade (API sync)

To send your Cohorts to Frigade, you will need to create a service account in Mixpanel and add the keys to Frigade. Frigade will then automatically sync your cohorts from Mixpanel.

<Steps>
  <Step title=" Create a Mixpanel Service Account for Frigade">
    To create a service account for Frigade, open your Mixpanel project, then click **Project Settings** and select the **Service Accounts** tab. Then click **Add Service Account** and select **Analyst** as the role.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/mixpanel-1.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Mixpanel Service Account keys to Frigade">
    Open the [Integrations](https://app.frigade.com/integrations) page in the Frigade dashboard and click the "Connect" button for Mixpanel. Then paste the two keys you copied in the previous step into the corresponding fields.

    Then, copy the **Project ID** from Mixpanel that you wish to sync cohorts from. You can find the Project ID on the Project Settings page in Mixpanel:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/mixpanel-2.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="See your Mixpanel Cohorts in Frigade">
    Your Mixpanel cohorts appear as properties on your users in Frigade. Each cohort is prefixed with `mixpanel_cohort_` and the name of the cohort. For example, if you have a cohort named `NewUsers`, you will see a property named `mixpanel_cohort_NewUsers` on your users in Frigade.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/mixpanel-3.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Targeting Mixpanel Cohorts

You can target users based on these properties in the [Targeting](/platform/targeting) section of the Frigade dashboard. For instance, to target users in the `NewUsers` cohort, you can use the following targeting rule:

```js
user.property('mixpanel_cohort_NewUsers') == true
```

# Salesforce
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/integrations/salesforce



Frigade supports syncing data with Salesforce. For instance, when a User completes a Survey or a step in a Checklist, Frigade will send this data to Salesforce to the matching contact.

<Info>
  Frigade will only send data to Salesforce if the User has an email associated with them. To associate an email with a User, see the [useUser hook](/sdk/hooks/user) or the [User API](/api-reference/users).
</Info>

# Sending Frigade data to Salesforce

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Salesforce to Frigade">
    To get started, open teh Frigade Dashboard and navigate to the **Integrations**. Click **Connect** on the Salesforce integration.
    This will prompt you to connect your Salesforce account to Frigade using OAuth.
    ![Salesforce Connect](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/salesforce/connect.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify data to sync">
    After connecting Salesforce, you will have the option to specify which data you would like to sync to Salesforce.
    By default, Frigade will only send Step and Flow completion events to Salesforce along with the associated metadata. For example, when a User completes a Survey or a step in a Checklist, Frigade will send this data to Salesforce for the corresponding contact.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the integration">
    You can test the integration by completing a Flow or a Step in a Flow. Once the Flow is completed, you can check Salesforce to see if the data has been synced.
    In the example below, a contact completed and NPS Survey and the data was synced to Salesforce:

# Segment
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/integrations/segment



Frigade supports bidirectional reads and writes from Segment. This guide shows you how to get started in a few minutes.

## Sending Segment data to Frigade

You can set up Frigade as a destination for Segment identify, group, and track calls by using [Webhooks as a destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/webhooks/).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add webhook destination">
    Log in to your Segment account, open workspace, and select source. Click on **Add Destination** and search and select **Webhooks**.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/segment-1.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create mapping">
    Next after creating the destination, click the **Mappings** tab and add a new mapping:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/segment-2.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select event types to send to Frigade">
    Select the event types you want to send to Frigade. In this example we select identify, group, and track, but you can select any event type you want to send to Frigade.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/segment-3.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Frigade Webhook URL">
    Fill out the **Select mappings** as shown below using:

    * `https://api.frigade.com/v1/thirdParty/cdp/segment` as the URL
    * `POST` as **Method**
    * `100` as **Batch Size**. Note: if you send fewer than 500 events per day, it is recommended to set this to a lower value to avoid delays in sending events to Frigade.
    * Your secret Frigade API key (it will be the one prefixed with `api_private`). This key can be found in the dashboard under [API Keys](https://app.frigade.com/developer). Make sure to prefix it with `Bearer` as shown in the screenshot below.
    * `Authorization` as the key

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/segment-4.png" className="rounded" />

    Finally, set **Enable Batching?** to **Yes**. Optionally, you can send a test event to verify that the webhook is working. Click **Save** to save the webhook.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Turn on the webhook">
    Finally, turn on the webhook by turning on the mapping you just created. Then, open the **Settings** tab and enable the Destination.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/segment-5.png" className="rounded" />

    Congratulations! You have successfully set up Frigade as a destination for Segment. You can now use Frigade's [Targeting](/platform/targeting) with your Segment data to create personalized experiences for your users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sending Frigade data to Segment

Frigade also supports sending user and organization events from Frigade Flows to Segment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your Segment write key">
    To send events to your Segment instance, select **Add Source** and then **HTTP API**. Then, copy your Segment write key.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/segment-write.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Segment in Frigade">
    Next, go to your Frigade dashboard and select **Integrations**. Click **Add Integration** and select **Segment**.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/segment.png" />

    You will be asked to enter your Segment write key. Click **Connect** to save the integration. Shortly after, events will start streaming from Frigade in real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Slack
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/integrations/slack

Easily send messages to a Slack channel when users take actions in your Flows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Slack Workflow">
    In Slack, open the Workflow page by searching for **Workflows** in the search bar and click the **Create a Workflow** button. Then, choose the **From a webhook** option:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-1.png" className="rounded" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a webhook in Frigade">
    Copy the **Webhook request URL** from Slack. Then press **X**.

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-2.png" className="rounded" />

    In the Frigade dashboard, navigate to the **Developer** section and click on **Webhooks**. Click the **New webhook** button and fill in the details as shown below with your Flow of choice. In this example, we use a simple [Form Flow](/component/form):

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-3.png" className="rounded" />

    <Tip>You can use a free service such as [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to test your webhook.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up data variables in Slack">
    In the Slack Workflow, click the **Starts with a webhook** card at the top and add the variables you'd like to send in your Slack message as seen below:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-4.png" className="rounded" />

    By default Frigade sends `user__email` and `user__name` for the given user if the data has been [provided in the SDK](/sdk/hooks/user). In this case, we also want to send the value of the `message` field from the Form Flow. To do this, we add a new variable `data__data__message` to map it to the field. You can target any field in a Frigade Form by prefixing the variable name with `data__data__`.
    <Tip>Select and radio form inputs will include both the label and the value in the webhook.  Therefore, if your field is named `industry` you should use `data__data__industry__label` to get the label or `data__data__industry__value` to get the value.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send a message to a Slack channel">
    Add a new step to the Slack Workflow by clicking the **Messages** link in the right menu. Then pick your channel of choice and add the variables you'd like to send in your Slack message as seen below:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-5.png" className="rounded" />

    Finally, hit the **Publish** button in the top right corner to make your Slack Workflow live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your Slack integration">
    You're now all set to test your Slack integration. In your application, complete the Flow you've set up the webhook for. In this case, we'll submit the Form Flow:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-6.png" className="rounded" />

    After completing a step in the Frigade Flow, you should now see the following show up in your Slack channel:

    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/integrations/slack/slack-7.png" className="rounded" />

That's it! You've successfully integrated Slack with Frigade. Remember, Frigade webhooks are unique for the Development and Production environments, so make sure to create a new webhook for each environment you want to integrate with Slack.

# Example

If you want a new Slack message when a user provides an NPS score in a Frigade Form, you can set up a webhook in Frigade and a Slack Workflow as follows:

1. Create a new workflow in Slack and copy the Webhook URL.
2. Create a new webhook in Frigade and paste the Slack Webhook URL.
3. Pick **Flow completed** and **Flow dismissed**.
4. Add the variables `data__nps-score-page__nps-score` (for the NPS Score) and `data__nps-feedback-page__nps-feedback-text` (for the NPS Comment) to the Slack Workflow.
5. Craft a message and pick a channel to send the data to.

## Overview

***

### Flows

[Flows](/platform/flows) are the main building blocks of Frigade. Flows can power product announcements, set up guides, product tours, or even custom flows. Flows have built-in state management, versioning, analytics, and validation to make it easy to build and collaborate.

### Components

Flows power [components](/component/overview) inside your codebase. We offer high quality, pre-built UI components to ship faster e.g. `<Frigade.Announcement />`, `<Frigade.Tour />`.

Components are embedded in your product natively. You can style Frigade components with your design system, themes, or custom CSS. You can also build custom Frigade components.

### Admin Dashboard

The web [admin dashboard](/platform/overview) helps you manage your Flows and users. You can create, edit, and delete Flows, view analytics and user progress, and make updates to your in-app experiences.


# Analytics
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/analytics

Frigade provides analytics and connects to external analytics platforms

## Built-in Analytics

***

Frigade provides built-in funnel analysis to help you understand the performance of your Flows. Frigade will automatically track how many users have interacted with a Flow and how many have completed it. You can also see how many users have dismissed or quit a Flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/analytics.png" alt="Analytics" />
</Frame>

### Flow cohorts

Frigade analytics are based on user cohorts. Frigade will group users into daily cohorts based on the date they first interacted with the Flow.

You can see detailed breakdowns by hovering on any given day in the graph. Statuses include completing the Flow, dismissing or quitting the Flow, or not yet completing the Flow.

### Time windows

You can change the time range for the stats by clicking on the dropdown in the top right corner of the analytics page. You can choose between `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, or `All time`. The metrics on the right side represent the totals for the selected time window, and the graph and step completion rates below will also adjust to the selected time window.

### Flow versions

Each time a new [version](/platform/versioning) of a Flow is published it will its own analytics. This allows you to review the performance of different versions of the same Flow over time.

## External Analytics

***

You can send Frigade tracking events to an external analytics platform for dashboards and reporting. Check out the [integrations](/integrations/) section to see our supported platforms.

Additionally, you can always connect Frigade to the analytics platform of your choice using webhooks. See the [webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) documentation for more information.

# Collections
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/collections

Launch Flows and set cool-offs without code

Collections are **reusable in-app UI channels** to launch Flows without code. Once embedded and styled, Collections can house and display new Flows without code updates. This is especially useful for product teams who want to templatize Flows and enable non-technical teammates to launch them (e.g. product announcements).

Collections also provide **governance and orchestration** through air traffic control functionality. This includes controls like limits, cool-offs, and priorities. For example, Collections can determine the frequency and timing of a group of Flows to avoid overwhelming users e.g. only show one announcement per day, space out an in-app upsell campaign.

## Launch with Collections

***

#### Announcements, Surveys, and Dialogs

Frigade comes with a default Collection called <strong>Dialogs</strong>. The Dialogs Collection is built-in to the Frigade SDK and can be used to launch Frigade Announcements, Surveys, and other Dialog-based components without updating your product codebase.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Frigade SDK">
    To add a new dialog-based component to your product, first make sure the Frigade Provider is properly installed in your product. This is also where you can add custom CSS for your dialog components.

    ```jsx
    import * as Frigade from "@frigade/react";

    const FRIGADE_API_KEY = "api_public_abcd1234";

    export const App = () => {
      const userId = "...";

      return (
        <Frigade.Provider
            apiKey={FRIGADE_API_KEY}
            userId={userId}
            css={{
            '.fr-announcement': ANNOUNCEMENT_CSS,
            }}>
            {/* ... */}
        </Frigade.Provider>
      );
    };
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Dialog Flow">
    Next, create a new dialog-based Flow (e.g. Announcement, NPS Survey, Tour) in Frigade. Customize this Flow with your content and targeting logic.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Flow to the Dialog Collection">
    Finally, add the Flow you just created to the Collection via the <strong>Add Flows</strong> button in the Collection detail page. From here, you can also control the cool-off and priority of included Flows.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/collections-detail.png" alt="Collections" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>A Flow can display for eligible users immediately after being added to a Collection in Production</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Inline UI Components

You can also use Collections to launch new Flows that are embedded directly into your product UI with no-code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Collection">
    To start, create a new Collection in the Frigade dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restrict the Flow Types">
    Next, we recommend restricting the Flow types to only what you plan to support for this in-app channel e.g. Banners, Cards, etc. This prevents accidentally adding Flows to an embedded Collection that do not fit the intended space.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Embed and Style the Collection">
    Next, grab the install snippet for the Collection and place it in your product codebase where you want the in-app channel to live. You can also style the Collection with custom CSS.

    ```jsx
    import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <Frigade.Collection collectionId="collection_4jDCTYUm" css={NAV_CARD_CSS}/>
      );
    };
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and Add a Flow to your Collection">
    Finally, create a Flow and add it to the Collection. Depending on the Flow targeting and Collection priority, the Flow will begin to go live to eligible users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a Collection

To create a Collection, visit the Collections page in the Frigade dashboard and click on the **New Collection** button. You will be prompted to enter a name and description for the Collection. Once created, you can access the embed snippet, set the display logic, and add Flows to the Collection.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/collections.png" alt="Collections" />
</Frame>

## Ordering Flows

You can specify the priority of Flows within the Collection by dragging and dropping them in **Flow priority** section of the Collection detail page. This is useful for prioritizing content types (e.g. onboarding > upsells > research) or sequences (welcome > getting started > go deeper).

<Accordion title="Flow ordering in Collections">
  <Warning>
    <b>Note:</b> Collections do not guarantee Flows will be shown in that order.
  </Warning>

  Flows may still be shown out of order if they are triggered out of order. Collections
  are used to resolve priorities when multiple Flows are eligible to be shown at
  once. If you need to ensure an exact order, you can combine Collections with [Flow
  targeting](/platform/targeting) to ensure users have completed another Flow first
  or any other criteria.
</Accordion>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/collections-reorder.png" alt="Collections" />
</Frame>

## Ordering Collections

Collections themselves can also be ordered via drag and drop on the Collections overview page. Because Flows can belong to multiple Collections, this priority informs the order in which Frigade processes each Collection.

## Combining Collections and Targeting

Collections can and should be combined with [Flow targeting](/platform/targeting) to ensure the right Flows are shown to the right users at the right time.

You can think of Collections as content pools. By giving each individual Flow its own targeting, Collections can then personalize the product experience to each user by choosing the highest priority eligible Flow for them.

## Usecases

***

### Feature adoption

Let's say we have a few different educational in-app sequences to encourage further feature adoption and that a user may be eligible for multiple sequences. For each sequence, we can use Flow targeting to define

1. the eligible audience (e.g. enterprise, free trial, etc.) and
2. the exact order of the sequence (e.g. Flow 1 must be completed to see Flow 2).

If we have defined multiple sequences, we can create a Collection and add all the Flows to ensure that only a single Flow from any campaign can be shown within a desired time frame. This helps ensure that users are not overwhelmed and increases the likelihood that users will engage with the content.

### Product communications

SaaS products often use dialogs and floating UI to communicate and collect important information. For example, an [announcement](/component/announcement) or a [survey](/component/survey/nps). Oftentimes, product teams may accidentally show multiple competing experiences to the same user at the same time.

This can easily be avoided with Frigade. The default Collection called "Dialogs" can house all of our announcements and surveys to spread these experiences out with cool-offs. We can rank these Flows so that onboarding announcements take priority over product updates and user research (or whichever order makes sense for your product).

### Product Upsells

Let's say our product has a free trial experience and we want to nudge users toward upgrading to a paid plan. We can create a Collection called "Upsells" and add our entire catalog of upsell Flows to this Collection (announcements, cards, banners, etc.). We can then set a limit of one per day to ensure we're not overwhelming users with too many upsell messages.

We can define the audience for each Flow to ensure that only users who are actively in a free trial are eligible to be shown the messages. Once a user upgrades, the Flow audiences will prevent them from receiving any further promos in the sequence.

# Dynamic Variables
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/dynamic-variables



Sometimes you want to use a dynamic piece of content within your Flow such as an email address or a localized string for  [i18n](/platform/i18n). In these cases, you can use **dynamic variables** to personalize for each user.

### Setting Dynamic Variables

***

Flows support setting custom variables anywhere in the data defined from the Frigade dashboard with the `${variable}` pattern. For instance,
your Flow might look like this:

```yml
steps:
  - id: "announcement-page-1"
  - title: "Welcome to Acme, ${firstName}!"
```

Then using your React component of choice, you can set the `firstName` variable like so:

```tsx
<Frigade.Announcement
  ...
  variables={{
    firstName: 'Christian'
  }}
/>
```

Variables can also be added at the global level via the `<Frigade.Provider />`. This will make them accessible in all Flows and [Collections](/platform/collections).
To pass in variables globally, simply pass the `variables` object to the provider:

```tsx
<Frigade.Provider
  ...
  variables={{
    firstName: 'Christian'
  }}
/>
```

See the [Provider documentation](/sdk/provider#variables) for more details.


# Environments
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/environments

Frigade supports development and production environments

## Changing environments

***

Frigade environments allow you to manage your Flows across **Development** and **Production**. You can access each environment from the dropdown in the top of the left sidebar.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/environments.png" alt="Environments" className="rounded-md" style={{}} />
</Frame>

## Manage Flow across environments

***

By default, Flow IDs are unique to each environment. However, if you want to use the same Flow ID across environments, you can use **Sync to Production** to link a Flow between Development and Production.

### Sync Flows to Production

When you are ready to move a Flow from Development to Production, you can simply **Sync to Production** from the overflow menu on the Flows page. This will create a new Production Flow with the same ID, content, targeting, and properties.

If the Flow ID already exists in Production, then **Sync to Production** will give you the choice to overwrite the Flow or create a new draft version with your changes.

<Frame>

</Frame>


# Flows
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/flows



## What are Flows?

***

Flows are the main building blocks of Frigade. Flows are made up of one or more Steps that you want a user to take. A Flow can be a product tour, a checklist, a form, or any other onboarding experience you can imagine.

Flows comes with built-in content management, version control, and analytics to make it easier to build and collaborate on onboarding.

Users have their own state for each Flow (e.g. started, dismissed, completed), and it is automatically tracked by Frigade. Flows can also track Steps across groups of users, such as companies or teams.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/flow-detail-editor.png" />
</Frame>

## User Lifecycle

Users can have state in Flows and in the Steps within a Flow. The lifecycle of a user's state in a Flow is as follows:

1. **Not started**: The user has not seen or engaged with the Flow.
2. **Started**: The user has seen the Flow and may have completed or skipped one or more Steps.
3. **Completed** or **Dismissed**: The user has completed or dismissed the Flow.

Once a Flow is completed or dismissed, it will remain in this state for the user unless the Flow is restarted via the SDK, API, or the **Reset in Flow** button in the Frigade Dashboard. This is true even if the Flow has new Steps added or a Step's state is reset.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


# Using HTML in Strings
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/html-in-strings



You can use basic HTML tags to format strings in your YAML Flow definitions. The following tags and attributes are supported:

* `<b>`
* `<i>`
* `<u>`
* `<a href="..." target="...">`
* `<br>`
* `<p>`
* `<img src="..." alt="...">`
* `<div>`
* `<span>`

The `style` and `class` attributes can be used to style all of the above elements.

## Example

```yaml
title: This title is <b>really</b> important
```


# Internationalization
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/i18n



Internationalization (i18n) is supported in Frigade through [dynamic variables](/platform/dynamic-variables). Dynamic variables allow you to pass in the string variable in the appropriate language based on the users' locale, settings, etc.


# Admin Overview
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/overview

Easily manage your product onboarding from the admin dashboard

The admin dashboard is where you create and manage your organization's onboarding. It includes our UI component library, Flow management, and analytics on all onboarding activity. The following sections highlight some of the key functionality of the platform.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/flows.png" />
</Frame>


# Targeting
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/targeting



Use targeting to personalize Flows to different cohorts of users, seamlessly link multiple onboarding experiences together, and define completion criterias for a Step in a Flow.

## Flow targeting

***

You can optionally add targeting to every Flow you create. You can view and edit this targeting logic on the **Targeting** tab of the Flow detail page. The Flow targeting logic is used to determine who should see the Flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/flow-detail-audience.png" alt="Flow Targeting" />
</Frame>

### Example use cases

Here are some common ways we see developers using Flow targeting:

* Only show a Flow to newly created accounts
* Show a Flow to users with a certain job function or user property
* Show a Flow to users who have taken a specific action in the product (e.g. an upsell once they use something 10 times)
* Show a Flow to users who have completed another Flow (e.g. a "next steps" Flow after a user completes an initial onboarding Flow)
* Show a Flow only after X days have passed since completing another Flow

<Note>Refer to the users [SDK](/sdk/hooks/user) and [API](/api-reference/users) for more info on using properties and events in targeting</Note>

## Step targeting

***

You can also leverage targeting logic within the Steps of a Flow by using the Advanced Editor.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/flow-detail-yaml-step-visibility.png" alt="Step visibility" className="rounded-lg" style={{border: '1px solid #D3D3D3',}} />
</Frame>

### Example use cases

Here are some common ways we see developers using Step targeting:

* Mark a Step complete based on a condition [using steps\[\].completionCriteria](/sdk/advanced/completing-a-step#automatically-marking-steps-complete)
* Show or hide a Step based on a condition [using steps\[\].visibilityCriteria](/component/tour#flow-configuration)
* Mark a Step started based on a condition [using steps\[\].startCriteria](/component/tour#flow-configuration)

## User props

***

All data you've made available to Frigade can be used in your targeting logic, including the properties below supported on [users](/sdk/hooks/user). You can also sync with your [existing analytics platform](/integrations/) to leverage [user properties and events](/sdk/hooks/user) you're already tracking.

<ParamField body="user.flow('<flowId>')">User Flow state (e.g. `COMPLETED_FLOW`)</ParamField>
<ParamField body="user.flowStep('<flowId>', '<stepId>')">User Flow Step state (e.g. `COMPLETED_STEP`)</ParamField>
<ParamField body="user.flowStepData('<flowId>', '<stepId>', '<fieldId>')">Data collected from in a specific step (e.g. form data)</ParamField>
<ParamField body="user.event('<eventId>').count">User event count</ParamField>
<ParamField body="user.property('<property>')">User properties</ParamField>
<ParamField body="user.propertyContains('<property>', '<searchString>')">User properties partial match (<Tooltip tip="Not case-sensitive. Returns true or false.">more</Tooltip>). It supports searching in strings, objects, and arrays.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="user.currentUrl()">Current URL of the user</ParamField>

## Group props

***

All data you've made available to Frigade can be used in your targeting logic, including the properties below supported on [groups](/sdk/hooks/group). You can also sync with your [existing analytics platform](/integrations/) to leverage [group properties and events](/sdk/hooks/group) you're already tracking

<ParamField body="group.property('<property>')">Group properties</ParamField>
<ParamField body="group.event('<eventId>').count">Group event count</ParamField>

## Boolean logic and operators

***

Supported operators are: `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `contains`, `!contains`,  `endsWith`, `!endsWith`, `startsWith`, `!startsWith`, `within`, `!within`

## Examples

***

Here are some examples of some of the most popular targeting logic we see developers using.

#### Relative dates

You can use relative dates in your targeting logic similar to how this is handled in [plain Javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763327/how-to-calculate-date-difference-in-javascript).
For example, you can target users who are younger than at least 30 days:

```javascript
user.property('accountCreatedDate') within 30d
```

Or target users who are older than 30 days:

```javascript
user.property('accountCreatedDate') !within 30d
```

This behavior also works for targeting users who have completed a Flow within as certain time frame:

```javascript
user.flow('flow_i6kH7DjcbE6tiaQd') !within 4w
```

#### Property matching

Target a Flow to a user who has connected their bank account:

```javascript
user.property('bankAccountConnected') == true
```

#### Check if a property is present

Target a Flow to a user who has a job title:

```javascript
user.property('jobTitle') != null
```

#### Absolute dates

Target a Flow only for users signed up after a certain date:

```javascript
user.property('accountCreatedDate') > '2023-03-01 00:00:00'
```

#### Flow state

Target a Flow to a user who has completed another onboarding Flow already and has connected a bank account:

```javascript
user.flow('flow_i6kH7DjcbE6tiaQd') == 'COMPLETED_FLOW' && user.property('bankAccountConnected') == true`
```

Target a Flow when a Step in another Flow is completed:

```javascript
user.flowStep('flow_i6kH7DjcbE6tiaQd', 'my-step-id') == 'COMPLETED_STEP'
```

Target the output of a previous step in the same Flow:

```javascript
user.flowStepData('flow_i6kH7DjcbE6tiaQd', 'my-step-id', 'my-field-id') == 'some-value'
```

#### Event counts

If the event properties do not matter and you simply wish to see if a user has triggered an event, you can use the following expression:

```javascript
user.event('pageView').count > 0
```

Automatically trigger when a group/organization sends a specific event:

```javascript
group.event('connectedBankAccount').count > 0
```

#### Current URL

Target based on the current URL contains a specific string:

```javascript
user.currentUrl() contains 'example.com'
```

Target based on the current URL ends with a specific string:

```javascript
user.currentUrl() endsWith '?myParam=123'
```


# Users and Groups
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/users-and-groups

Easily manage users and groups as they engage with your Flows

## User Management

***

You can view all of the users interacting with your Flows on the <a href="https://app.frigade.com/users" target="_blank">users</a> page. Users will automatically appear in Frigade once they have been identified in your app (see [SDK](/sdk/hooks/user) or [API](/api-reference/users) docs for more info).

You can see all of the Flows that a user has engaged with and their status for each Flow on the user detail page. This can be especially useful for Customer Success teams to see which customers may be stuck and where.

If needed, you can also reset a user's status for a Flow to allow them to start over. This is an especially helpful feature when developing with Frigade to reset your own Flow status.

### Exporting User Data

You can export your users and their state in a given Flow by clicking the **Export** button on **Users** tab on a Flow detail page. This will download a CSV file with all of the user's data and state in the given Flow. Alternatively, you can use the [API](/api-reference/users/users-get) to fetch user data programmatically or use the [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) whenever a user takes actions in your Flows.

### Standardized User Fields

When sending user properties to Frigade, the platform will automatically decorate the following fields on the user profile:

* `firstName`
* `lastName`
* `email`
* `organization`

## Group Management

***

You can view all of your groups and their associated data on the <a href="https://app.frigade.com/users" target="_blank">groups</a> page. Groups allows you to associate an individual user with a group (e.g. a company, organization, account, project, or team).
Groups will automatically show up in Frigade once they have been identified in your app (see [SDK](/sdk/hooks/group) or [API](/api-reference/groups) docs for more info).

The group detail page will show all of a group's members and where they are in your onboarding Flows. Groups are especially helpful if you have any tasks in your product that are shared across a group of users.

For example, you may want to implement a checklist with a Step that can be completed by any user in the group (e.g. connecting a third party API). You can use groups to ensure once that Step is completed by one user it will be completed for all users.

### Standardized Group Fields

When sending group properties to Frigade, the platform will automatically decorate the following fields on the group:

* `name`
* `imageUrl`
* `website`

# Version Control
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/platform/versioning

Manage the rollout of new Flow updates with built-in version control

## Creating a new version

***

To create a new version of your Flow, open the versions panel on the Flow detail page. Then, click the **New version** button.
The new version will remain a draft until you activate it. Frigade supports one draft version at a time. Tap **View** on a version to view and make changes.

</Frame>

## Activating a draft version

***

Once your draft version is ready to go live, click **Activate** to publish it. If there are existing users in your Flow, you will have a choice on how to transition users:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Restart in-progress users in new version">
    This option will restart all users currently in the Flow in the new version. Users who have already completed the Flow will not see the new version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exit in-progress users from the Flow">
    This option will exit all users currently in the Flow. Only new users who enter the Flow moving forward will see the new version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restart all users in new version">
    This option will restart all users in the Flow in the new version regardless of their state. This means that users who have already completed the Flow will also see the new version, too.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/platform/flow-detail-versions-restart.png" alt="Transitioning users" />
</Frame>

## Old versions

***

Once a draft has been activated, old versions of the Flow become read-only. Analytics for old versions will be preserved and can be viewed by clicking the **View** button on an old version.

        Next, add the Frigade `Provider` component to your app and plug in your public API key from earlier. We recommend wrapping your entire application to ensure that the SDK is available everywhere.
        Below are examples for how to install the Provider in popular React frameworks.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```tsx React
          // Add this to your main application file, e.g., App.tsx or index.tsx

# Dynamically Completing a Step
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/advanced/completing-a-step

Learn how to dynamically complete steps in Flows when your users take certain actions in your application.

For most components, steps in Flows are marked as completed when a user clicks the primary button. However, for components such as [Checklists](/component/checklist), you may want to complete or skip steps when your users take certain actions in your application rather than clicking the primary button. This can be achieved either marking a step completed via the SDK or API, or by defining a targeting query in the `completionCriteria` property on a step.

### Marking Steps completed via the SDK

Call the `complete` method from the [useFlow hook](/sdk/hooks/flow) in the [React SDK](/sdk/quickstart) or via the [JS SDK](/sdk/js/flow). In the example below, we're calling the `complete` method from the React SDK:

```javascript
import { useFlow } from '@frigade/react';

const { flow } = useFlow("my-flow-id");

await flow.steps.get('my-step-id').complete();
```

### Marking Steps complete via Targeting

Use the `completionCriteria` property on a step to automatically mark the step as completed when a user meets the criteria. See [Targeting](/platform/targeting) for more examples of how to write targeting queries.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: my-step-id
    ...
    completionCriteria: user.property('connectedBank') == true
```

### Preventing Steps from completing on primary button click

In built-in Flow components, a step is marked as complete when the primary button is clicked. To prevent this, select **No action** in the editor under the **Primary button** property:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/sdk/no-action.png" />
</Frame>

## API Methods

You can also mark steps completed via the [flowStates](/api-reference/flows/flow-states-post) API endpoint.


# Merging a guest session with a authenticated user
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/advanced/linking-guest-users

Link a guest session's state to a user when they register or log in

Frigade will generate a guest user ID for you if you do not provide a user id. This ID is stored in the user's browser using `localStorage`.
This allows unauthenticated users to have state in Frigade Flows and to be able to continue their session when they return to your application.

Often it is useful to link a guest session to a user when they register or log in and transfer all state and data.

You can do this by calling the [Users API endpoint](/api-reference/users/overview) with a `linkGuestId` parameter. This will merge all state from the guest session to the user with the `userId` you provide. Note that this will only take affect if the given `userId` does not yet have any state in Frigade.

To do this in Javascript, you can use the `fetch` API:

```jsx
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <FRIGADE_PUBLIC_API_KEY>',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: '{"userId":"<USER_ID>", "linkGuestId":"<GUEST_ID>"}'
};

fetch('https://api.frigade.com/v1/public/users', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```


# Reverse Proxy and Custom Domains
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/advanced/reverse-proxy



A reverse proxy allows you to use your own domain when sending data to and from Frigade. To set up a reverse proxy, you need to create a `CNAME` record in your DNS settings.
The `CNAME` record should point to `api.frigade.com` and override the host header to `api.frigade.com`.

For example, if you want to use `api.example.com` as your domain, you should create a `CNAME` record for `api.example.com` that points to `api.frigade.com` and override the Host header to `api.frigade.com`.
Then, when instantiating Frigade in your application with the `<Frigade.Provider />` component, you should set the `apiUrl` to `https://api.example.com`:

For a more in depth guide on how to set up a reverse proxy, check out [this guide](https://posthog.com/docs/advanced/proxy) from Posthog.

```jsx
import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';

const App = () => (
  <Frigade.Provider apiUrl="https://api.example.com">
    <App />
  </Frigade.Provider>
);
```


# Automated Testing
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/advanced/testing

Learn how to run unit and integration tests with your Frigade Flows

***

Unlike no-code tools, Frigade allows you to easily write automated tests for your Flows. In this guide, we will show you how to write and run tests for your Flows using Playwright and Jest. The same principles can be applied to any testing framework.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Using a test user">
    When writing tests for your Flows, you should use a test user. This user should have the same permissions and properties as the users who will use your Flow.

    Before running your tests, you will likely want to reset this user in Frigade. This can be done by making the following API request using your private API key in the Developer environment (see [API docs](/api-reference/users/users-delete) for more information):

    ```javascript
    function resetTestUser() {
      fetch('https://api.frigade.com/v1/users?foreignId=my-test-user-id', {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
          'Authorization
          : `Bearer ${process.env.FRIGADE_PRIVATE_DEV_API_KEY}`,
        },
      });
    }
    ```

    With this in hand, you can add a `beforeAll` to reset the test user before and after running your tests.

    ```javascript
    beforeAll(() => {
      resetTestUser();
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Writing tests">
    To write tests for your Flows, you can use Playwright, Puppeteer, or any other testing framework.

    In this example, we will use Playwright. This test presses the primary button with the text "Got it" in a `Frigade.Announcement` and ensures that the modal is closed.

    ```javascript
    const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

    test('close announcement', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');
      await page.click('text=Got it');
      await page.waitForSelector('text=Got it', { state: 'detached' });
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Going further">
    For testing more complex scenarios (for instance, the chaining of Flows), you can leverage the underlying Vanilla JS SDK to simulate completing the first Flow and then starting the second Flow.

    Methods such as `flow.complete()` or `step.complete()` support an optional `createdAt` parameter that can simulate the time of completion, too.

    ```javascript
    import { Frigade } from '@frigade/js'

    test('Flow is visible after completing other Flow', async () => {
        const frigade = new Frigade(process.env.FRIGADE_PRIVATE_DEV_API_KEY, {
          userId: "my-test-user-id"
        })
        const flow = await frigade.getFlow("flow_abc")
        expect(flow.isVisible).toBeFalsy() // The Flow is not yet visible because `flow_def` has not been completed
        await frigade.getFlow("flow_def").complete({
            // Overrides the date of completion
            createdAt: "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          })
        expect(flow.isVisible).toBeTruthy() // The Flow is now visible
      })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


# V1 SDK Guide
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/advanced/v1



## Upgrading from V1 to V2

This guide outlines some of the biggest changes you need to make to upgrade from V1 to V2. Scroll down to the bottom for instructions on how to [use V1 and V2 at the same time](/sdk/advanced/v1#running-both-v1-and-v2-of-the-sdk).

### Provider theme

In V2, we have a [fully-fledged theming system](/sdk/styling/theming) that allows you to customize every token in our design system. If you used V1's theme colors, you can convert them to V2 like so:

```jsx
// V1
<FrigadeProvider
  config={{
    defaultAppearance: {
      theme: {
        colorText: '#3d3d3d',
        colorTextSecondary: '#494949',
        colorTextOnPrimaryBackground: '#fff',
        colorPrimary: '#2956B5',
        colorBorder: '#E2E2E2',
      }
    }
  }}
>

// V2
<Frigade.Provider
  theme={{
    colors: {
      neutral: {
        // Replaces colorBorder
        border: '#E2E2E2',

        // Replaces colorText
        foreground: '#3d3d3d'
      },
      primary: {
        // Replaces colorTextOnPrimaryBackground
        foreground: '#fff',

        // Replaces colorPrimary
        surface: '#2956B5'
      }
    }
  }}
>
```

Note that `colorTextSecondary` was deprecated and doesn't have a V2 equivalent.

### Global style overrides

We no longer wrap descendents of the Frigade Provider in a container element, as we found that for most users adding an extra wrapper to the DOM at (or near) the top was more disruptive than helpful.

As a result, we no longer support the `config.defaultAppearance.styleOverrides` property that existed on `FrigadeProvider` in V1.

We now recommend that you author global styles using your existing CSS workflow.

### Component style overrides

We use [Emotion's CSS prop](/sdk/styling/css-overrides) in V2, so you can write any CSS that Emotion supports directly on any component:

```jsx
// V1
<FrigadeAnnouncement
  appearance={{
    styleOverrides: {
      'button': {
        backgroundColor: 'fuchsia'
      }
    }
  }}
/>

// V2
<Frigade.Announcement
  css={{
    '.fr-button-primary': {
      backgroundColor: 'fuchsia',

      '&:hover': {
        backgroundColor: 'lilac'
      }
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Important difference between V1 `styleOverrides` and V2 `css` props:

The V2 `css` prop accepts a style object, which means that if you're using V1's `styleOverrides` prop to pass Tailwind classNames through to sub-components, you'll need to update your code to pass Tailwind's [arbitrary variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants), e.g.:

```jsx
// V1
<FrigadeAnnouncement
  appearance={{
    styleOverrides: {
      'button': 'w-full'
    }
  }}
/>

// V2
<Frigade.Announcement
  className="[&_button]:w-full"
/>
```

### Navigation

The `navigate` prop is now a top-level prop on Provider, it is no longer nested inside `config`:

```jsx
// V1
<FrigadeProvider
  config={{
    navigate: (url, target): void => {
      if (target === "_blank") {
        window.open(url, "_blank");
      } else {
        router.push(url);
      }
    },
  }}
>

// V2
<Frigade.Provider
  navigate={(url, target) => {
    if (target === "_blank") {
      window.open(url, "_blank");
    } else {
      router.push(url);
    }
  }}
>
```

### Event handlers

The catch-all `onButtonClick` prop has been replaced with individual handlers for `onPrimary`, `onSecondary`, `onDismiss`, and `onComplete`.

Full definitions of each handler are available in our [component docs](/component/announcement#oncomplete)

### Hooks

Our SDK hooks now expose objects from our [JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frigade/js) directly, for example [useFlow](/sdk/hooks/flow) returns an instance of [Flow](/sdk/js/flow), which you can operate directly on as you would in the JS SDK.

***

## Running V1 and V2 together

If you already have a V1 implementation and aren't ready to fully upgrade yet, you can use both V1 and V2 at the same time. This setup allows you to import V1 components from `@frigade/react` and V2 components from `@frigade/reactv2`.

### Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="First, install V2 using a package alias:">
    ```json
    "dependencies": [
    "@frigade/react": "1.x",
    "@frigade/reactv2": "npm:@frigade/react@2.x",
    ]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Then add the V2 `Provider` above the V1 `FrigadeProvider`:">
    ```tsx
    import { FrigadeProvider } from "@frigade/react";
    import * as Frigade from "@frigade/reactv2";

    const FRIGADE_API_KEY = "api_public_abcd1234";

    export const App = () => {
      const userId = "...";

      return (
        <Frigade.Provider apiKey={FRIGADE_API_KEY} userId={userId}>
          <FrigadeProvider publicApiKey={FRIGADE_API_KEY} userId={userId}>
            {/* ... */}
          </FrigadeProvider>
        </Frigade.Provider>
      );
    };
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sharing state between V1 and V2

When using V1 and V2 together, state is not shared between the two providers. Be sure to call `frigade.reload()` from the [useFrigade() hook](/sdk/hooks/frigade) (V2) and/or `refresh()` from the `useFlows()` hook (V1).

## Flows not showing up
If your Frigade components are not rendering in your product as expected, below are some of thhe most common issues and solutions to help you troubleshoot.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Developer console">
        Open the developer console in your browser and look for any error messages.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="API key">
        Make sure you have the correct API key in your `<Frigade.Provider />` component. You can find your API key in the [Frigade dashboard](https://app.frigade.com/developer).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Flow status">
        Make sure your Flows are properly installed in your app and that they are active in the Frigade dashboard. If you have not published your Flows, or if you have turned them off, they will not be available in your app.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Flow targeting">
        Make sure any targeting you've set in the **Targeting** tab of your Flow is correct. If the targeting is too restrictive, your Flows may not show up for the intended users.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Environment">
        Make sure you are using the correct environment in your `<Frigade.Provider />` component. Each environment has its own API key and Flows. If you are using the wrong environment, your Flows will not show up in your app.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Debug mode">
        If you are still having issues, you can enable debug mode in Chrome Devtools ([see guide](/guides/tours#debugging-tooltips)).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Ensure zIndex is set correctly">
        If your Flows are not showing up, it may be because they are being rendered behind other elements on the page. You can fix this by setting the `zIndex` on components such as `Frigade.Tour` or `Frigade.Announcement` to a higher value.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Rules">
        If you've created a rule in the **Rules** tab of Frigade that includes the Flow then that could affect its visibility. Make sure you've configured the rule correctly and that your Flow is actually expected to show.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Guest users in my dashboard

If a `userId` is not available when Frigade is initialized via the `<Frigade.Provider />` and/or the JS SDK, Frigade will automatically assign a guest user id to the user. This is to ensure that the user can still be tracked and that their data is not lost.

To prevent Frigade from automatically generating guest user IDs, you can pass a flag to the `<Frigade.Provider />` as shown below:

```jsx
<Frigade.Provider generateGuestId={false} />
```

## Import error

If you into an error such as `Can't import the named export 'Anchor' from non EcmaScript module (only default export is available)`, it is likely that you are using an older version of create-react-app.

There are two ways to fix this issue:

1. Upgrade to the latest version of create-react-app (you need to be on version 5.0.0 or higher of `react-scripts`).
2. Eject your app from create-react-app (if not already done) and manually configure your webpack to support ESM. Do this by adding the following to your webpack config:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.mjs', '.js', '.json'],
    mainFields: ['module', 'main'],
  },
  rules: [
    ///...
    { test: /\.mjs$/, include: /node_modules/, type: 'javascript/auto' }
  ],
  //...
};
```

# useFlow
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/hooks/flow



The `useFlow(<flowId>)` hook makes it easy to build headless components or manipulate the state of a Flow for an existing component.
It exports a single field, `flow`, which contains the current state of the Flow, as well as a set of methods to manipulate the Flow.
[View the Flow class docs](../js/flow) to see the available fields and methods.

## About this hook

The `useFlow` hook is especially useful if you want to build a highly custom experience with your UI and/or components. You can find some example of how to build custom Flows in our [Custom Components guide](/guides/custom).

### Example use cases:

* Building a custom onboarding progress widget for your sidebar navigation
* Building a custom Kanban-style onboarding experience
* Building a highly custom onboarding checklist interface

### Example usage:

```tsx
import { useFlow } from "@frigade/react";

function MyComponent() {
  // Replace "myFlowId" with the ID of your Flow
  const { flow } = useFlow("myFlowId");

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{flow.title}</h1>
      <p>{flow.subtitle}</p>
      <p>Currently on step {flow.getCurrentStep().id}</p>
      <button onClick={flow.next}>Next</button>
      <button onClick={flow.back}>Previous</button>
      <button onClick={flow.reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Tip>Make sure to call any Frigade hook within the context of `<Frigade.Provider />`</Tip>


# useFrigade
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/hooks/frigade



The `useFrigade()` hook exposes the underlying [Frigade JS SDK]() instance that powers the React SDK.
[View the Frigade class docs](../js/frigade) to see the available fields and methods.

## About this hook

The `useFrigade` hook can be used to access the underlying Frigade JS SDK instance and interact with it directly.
It should rarely be used as the provided [useFlow](./flow), [useUser](./user), and [useGroup](./group) hooks should be sufficient for most use cases.

### Example usage:

```tsx
import { useFrigade } from "@frigade/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { frigade } = useFrigade();

  useEffect(() => {
  	const myHandler = (flow) => {
      console.log(`Detected change in ${flow.id}`);
    }
    frigade.onStateChange(myHandler);
    return () => {
      frigade.removeStateChangeHandler(myHandler);
    }
  }, []);
}
```

<Tip>Make sure to call any Frigade hook within the context of `<Frigade.Provider />`</Tip>


# useGroup
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/hooks/group



The `useGroup()` hook enables you to add properties and send tracking events to the current group.

## About this hook

The hook contains the following methods:
<ParamField body="track(eventName: string, properties?: Record<string, unknown>)">Promise that sends tracking events for the current group</ParamField>
<ParamField body="addProperties(properties: Record<string, unknown>)">Promise that adds properties to the current group</ParamField>
<ParamField body="setGroupId(groupId: string, properties?: Record<string, unknown>)">Promise that sets the current group ID. Using this hook can cause unexpected behaviors if also setting the group ID at the `<Frigade.Provider />` level.</ParamField>

### Example use cases:

* Tracking events and adding properties to the current group for using with [Targeting](/platform/targeting/)
* Wrapping the `track` method with your existing tracking/analytics methods

### Example usage:

```tsx
import { useGroup } from '@frigade/react';

function MyComponent() {
  const { addProperties } = useGroup();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        addProperties({ orgHasConnectedBankAccount: true });
      }}
    >
      Connect Bank Account
    </button>
  );
}
```

<Tip>Make sure to call any Frigade hook within the context of `<Frigade.Provider />`</Tip>

## Standardized properties

The following standardized properties are automatically added to the group object if provided via `addProperties`:

* `name`: The name of the group/company/organiation
* `imageUrl`: The URL of the group/company/organiation's logo


# useUser
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/hooks/user



The `useUser()` hook enables you to add properties and send tracking events to the current user.

## About this hook

The hook contains the following methods:
<ParamField body="track(eventName: string, properties?: Record<string, unknown>)">Promise that sends tracking events for the current user</ParamField>
<ParamField body="addProperties(properties: Record<string, unknown>)">Promise that adds properties to the current user</ParamField>

<Info>Update the `userID` in the top-level `Frigade.Provider` component to change users</Info>

## Example use cases:

* Tracking events and adding properties to the current user for using with [Targeting](/platform/targeting/)
* Wrapping the `track` method with your existing tracking/analytics methods

### Tracking events example

```tsx
import { useUser } from "@frigade/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { track } = useUser();

  useEffect(() => {
    track("MyComponent Viewed");
  }, []);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

### Adding properties example

```tsx
import { useUser } from "@frigade/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { addProperties } = useUser();

  useEffect(() => {
    addProperties({
      email: "test@test.com",
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
      imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.png",
    });
  }, []);
}
```

Properties can also be added to the `userProperties` object via the `Frigade.Provider` component:

```tsx
<Frigade.Provider 
  apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
  userID="1234567890"
  userProperties={{ 
    email: "test@test.com", 
    firstName: "John", 
    lastName: "Doe", 
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.png" 
  }}
>
  <App />
</Frigade.Provider>
```

<Tip>Make sure to call any Frigade hook within the context of `<Frigade.Provider />`</Tip>

## Standardized properties

The following standardized properties are automatically added to the user object if provided via `addProperties`:

* `email` - The user's email address
* `name` - The user's full name
* `firstName` - The user's first name
* `lastName` - The user's last name
* `imageUrl` - The user's profile image URL


# Flow JS Type Definition
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/js/flow



All of Frigade's Javascript SDKs share the same Flow type definition which is defined in the [Frigade JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frigade/js).

The Flow object is the main object that models a Flow's static metadata (title, subtitle, steps, etc.) as well as the current user's state in this flow.

It contains all the data and methods needed to build custom components with Frigade and to interact with the Frigade API without writing a single custom network call.

# JS Quickstart
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/js/quickstart



The [Frigade JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frigade/js) is a lightweight library that allows you to easily integrate Frigade into any stack that runs Javascript.
Unlike the React SDK, it is completely headless and does not include any UI components. Instead, it provides a simple API that allows you to quickly build
your own components powered by Frigade with any Javascript framework or library.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the JS SDK">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```txt npm
      npm install @frigade/js
      ```

      ```txt yarn
      yarn add @frigade/js
      ```

      ```txt pnpm
      pnpm install @frigade/js
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    Simply `import { Frigade }  from '@frigade/js'` and initialize the SDK with your **public API key** from the **Developer** page of the dashboard.

    ```js
    import { Frigade } from '@frigade/js'

    const frigade = new Frigade('FRIGADE_API_KEY')

    await frigade.identify('USER_ID', {
      name: 'USER_NAME',
      email: 'USER_EMAIL',
      signed_up_at: 'USER_SIGNED_UP_AT' // ISO 8601 format
    })

    // Optional: send organization/group id
    await frigade.group('ORGANIZATION_ID', {
      name: 'COMPANY_NAME',
    })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building with Frigade">
    That's pretty much it! You can now use the Frigade JS SDK. Here's how to get a Flow:

    ```js
      const flow = await frigade.getFlow('FLOW_ID')
      console.log('Flow status:', flow.isCompleted)

      const currentStep = flow.getCurrentStep();

      /*
      * You'll usually want to ensure that the flow and current step are both
      * marked as "started" when a user sees them.
      */
      await flow.start();
      await currentStep.start();

      /*
      * Handling interaction is easy -- Flows and Steps have built-in methods
      * to update their state.
      */
      async function handleStepComplete() {
        await currentStep.complete();
      }
    ```

    We recommend taking a quick look at the [JS SDK API documentation](./frigade) to get a better understanding of the available methods and how to use them. Also, check out our guide on [building custom components](/guides/custom) for more information on how to build custom experiences with Frigade.

# Step JS Type Definition
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/js/step



All of Frigade's Javascript SDKs share the same Flow Step type definition which is defined in the [Frigade JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frigade/js).

The Step type is a representation of a step in a Flow.

It contains all the data and methods needed to build custom components with Frigade and to interact with the Frigade API without writing a single custom network call.

# Properties

### \$state

**\$state**: `Object`

The state of the step for the given user in the given Flow.
Example:

```
{
 completed: true,
 skipped: false,
 started: true,
 visible: true,
 blocked: false,
 lastActionAt: "2014-01-01T23:28:56.782Z"
}
```

***

### autoMarkCompleted

`Optional` **autoMarkCompleted**: `boolean`

# Navigation
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/navigation



Frigade supports the ability to route users to different pages in your application through the `primaryButtonUri` and `secondaryButtonUri` props defined in the [Flow configuration](/component/tour#flow-configuration).

By default, Frigade will use the `window.location` object to navigate to the specified URI. This works well for some use cases, but it causes a full page refresh which can be disruptive.

For optimal performance, we recommend overriding this behavior by providing a custom `navigate` function to the `Frigade.Provider` component where you can use your own router for a smoother experience.

# Examples

Overriding the default navigation handler is different depending on your React framework of choice. Below are examples for the most popular Routers:

## Next.js App and Pages Router

```jsx
import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'; // or 'next/router' if using Pages Router

const App = () => {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <Frigade.Provider
      navigate={(url, target) => {
        if (target === "_blank") {
          window.open(url, "_blank");
        } else {
          router.push(url);
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </Frigade.Provider>
  );
}
```

## React Router

```jsx
import * as Frigade from '@frigade/react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  const history = useHistory();

  return (
    <Frigade.Provider
      navigate={(url, target) => {
        if (target === "_blank") {
          window.open(url, "_blank");
        } else {
          history.push(url);
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </Frigade.Provider>
  );
}
```


# React SDK Overview
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/overview

Frigade React SDK and JavaScript SDK

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/sdk/npm.png" />

## Getting Started

Check out the [SDK Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart) for instructions on installing the React SDK in your app.

## Components

The Frigade React SDK includes a [library](/component/overview) of highly customizable onboarding components that you can use to build your app.

## JavaScript SDK

Our [JavaScript SDK](/sdk/js/quickstart) is a lightweight, headless library you can use to build custom experiences with Frigade. The SDK is vanilla and works for Node.js, React Native, and the browser.

## Typescript

All types used in the Javascript SDK are exported from the `@frigade/react` package under the `FrigadeJS` namespace. You can import them like so:

```javascript
import { FrigadeJS } from "@frigade/react";
```

## Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.

We are mainly focused on React, but we plan to build SDKs for other frameworks. If you'd like to be notified about new SDKs, reach out and <a href="mailto:support@frigade.com">let us know</a> which framework you're using.


# Provider
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/provider



The `<Frigade.Provider />` component is the root component of the Frigade SDK. It initializes the SDK and keeps track of the user's session and state in all Frigade Flows.a

See the [Quickstart Guide](/sdk/quickstart) to see an example of how to use the Provider.

# Properties

### apiKey

**apiKey**: `string`

Your public API key from the Frigade dashboard. Do not ever use your private API key here.

***

### apiUrl

`Optional` **apiUrl**: `string`

The URL prefix of the API to use. By default, Frigade will use the production API: [https://api.frigade.com/v1/public](https://api.frigade.com/v1/public)

***

### children

`Optional` **children**: `ReactNode`

***

### css

`Optional` **css**: `Record`\<`string`, `unknown`>

Global CSS properties to attach to the :root element.

**See**

[https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#object-styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#object-styles)

***

### defaultCollection

`Optional` **defaultCollection**: `boolean`

By default, Frigade.Provider will render a built-in Collection to allow no-code deploys of Announcements and other floating Components. Set this to `false` if you want to manually control the rendering of the default Collection.

***

### generateGuestId

`Optional` **generateGuestId**: `boolean`

Whether to generate a Guest ID and session if no userId is provided at render time.
If set to false, Frigade will not initialize or render any Flows until a userId is provided.
Defaults to true.

***

### groupId

`Optional` **groupId**: `string`

The group ID to use for this context (optional).

***

### groupProperties

`Optional` **groupProperties**: `PropertyPayload`

Optional group properties to attach to the groupId on initialization.

***

### navigate

`Optional` **navigate**: [`NavigateHandler`](#navigatehandler)

A function to handle navigation. By default, Frigade will use `window.open` if not provided.
[https://docs.frigade.com/v2/sdk/navigation](https://docs.frigade.com/v2/sdk/navigation)

***

### preloadImages

`Optional` **preloadImages**: `boolean`

Whether to preload images in Flows. Defaults to true.

***

### syncOnWindowUpdates

`Optional` **syncOnWindowUpdates**: `boolean`

Whether to sync state with Frigade on URL or focus change. Defaults to true.

***

### theme

`Optional` **theme**

The global theme to use across components. See docs on styling: [https://docs.frigade.com/v2/sdk/styling/theming](https://docs.frigade.com/v2/sdk/styling/theming)

***

### userId

`Optional` **userId**: `string`

The user ID of the user who is interacting with Frigade. If not provided, Frigade will generate a random guest ID and persist it in local storage.

***

### userProperties

`Optional` **userProperties**: `PropertyPayload`

Optional user properties to attach to the userId on initialization.

***

### variables

`Optional` **variables**: `Record`\<`string`, `unknown`>

Global variables to apply to all Flows, including Collections.
If the individual Collection or Flow has its own variables, the two objects will be merged, with the Flow/Collection having high priority.
Example:

```tsx
variables={{
  name: "Bobby Nerves",
  occupation: "Vocalist",
}}
```

This prop can conveniently be used to pass entire i18n objects as well, which will allow all Flows to access i18n strings as needed.

# React SDK Quickstart
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/quickstart

How to set up Frigade in your React app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the React SDK">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```txt npm
      npm install @frigade/react
      ```

      ```txt yarn
      yarn add @frigade/react
      ```

      ```txt pnpm
      pnpm install @frigade/react
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Provider">
    Add the Frigade `Provider` component to your app. Make sure to paste in your **public** API key and user ID.
    Optionally, you can pass in user properties like `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email` to decorate the user profile in Frigade.

    ```jsx
    import * as Frigade from "@frigade/react";

    const FRIGADE_API_KEY = "api_public_abcd1234";

    export const App = () => {
      const userId = "..."; // If no user id is provided, Frigade will generate a guest id

      return (
        <Frigade.Provider
          apiKey={FRIGADE_API_KEY}
          userId={userId}
          userProperties={{
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            email: "john.doe@acme.com"
          }}
        >
          {/* ... */}
        </Frigade.Provider>
      );
    };
    ```

    For a full list of supported properties, see the [Provider documentation](/sdk/provider).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your first component">
    That's pretty much it! You can now use the SDK. Here's an example of how to use the `Announcement` component:

    ```tsx
    import * as Frigade from "@frigade/react";

    export const DemoComponent = () => {
        return <Frigade.Announcement flowId="flow_abcd1234" />;
    };
    ```

    Be sure to create an `Announcement` in Frigade web dashboard and link the FlowId to the component above. Check out our general [Quickstart](/quickstart) for more information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Now that you have Frigade running in your application, you will likely want to style them to fit your brand.
See the [styling guide](/sdk/styling/theming) to get started.


# CSS Overrides
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/styling/css-overrides



## CSS Prop

We use [Emotion's css prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#use-the-css-prop) under the hood in our components. You can pass a `css` object in at the top level of any of our components to create scoped styles for that specific instance of that component.

Since the `css` prop is scoped to each component, you can treat it as though it were a `style` prop with added functionality. For example:

```tsx
// This CSS will be compiled at runtime by Emotion and applied to
// the `.fr-card` wrapper at the top level of the Card component

<Frigade.Card
  css={{
    backgroundColor: "goldenrod",
  }}
/>
```

## Styling sub-components

We also assign stable class names to each internal part of each component, to make style overrides as easy as:

```tsx
<Frigade.Tour
  css={{
    ".fr-tooltip-content .fr-tooltip-close": {
      backgroundColor: "pink",
    },
    ".fr-button-primary": {
      backgroundColor: "fuchsia",
    },
  }}

  {...}
/>
```

To find the stable class names for any given component, you can either:

1. Inspect the component in your browser's dev tools and look for classes prefixed with `fr-`
2. [View the source](https://github.com/FrigadeHQ/javascript/tree/main/packages/react/src/components) for the component and use the value of the `part` prop (class name will always be `fr-${part}`)

## Global overrides

If you want to style every instance of a Frigade component (or write any other general CSS), the `<Frigade.Provider />` component also accepts a `css` prop. It writes global CSS into the document, so use it with caution.

Since every Frigade Component has its own stable classname, you can override every `<Button.Primary />` simply by writing CSS in object syntax:

```tsx
<Frigade.Provider
  css={{
    ".fr-button-primary": {
      backgroundColor: "aquamarine",

      "&:hover": {
        backgroundColor: "honeydew",
      },
    },
  }}

  {...}
/>
```

To override the styles for every Frigade Button, use a [wildcard attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors):

```tsx
<Frigade.Provider
  css={{
    "[class*='fr-button']": {
      backgroundColor: "maroon",

      "&:hover": {
        backgroundColor: "cornsilk",
      },
    },
  }}

  {...}
/>
```

## Overriding CSS from the Flow editor

You can override the `css` prop or any other attribute from the Flow editor by providing the `props` field in the Advanced YAML editor:

```yaml
props:
  css:
    backgroundColor: "blue"
    ".fr-button-primary":
      backgroundColor: "chartreuse"
steps: ...
```

You can also override the styling on specific Steps by providing the `props` field on the given Step. This will override the styling for that specific Step only:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: step-1
    props:
      css:
        ".fr-button-primary":
          backgroundColor: "chartreuse"
```

## External CSS

If you prefer to use your own CSS workflow, any old CSS will work. You can provide a top-level `className` prop to a component via a static stylesheet, CSS Modules, etc. then scope your styles to that:

```jsx
<Frigade.Tour className="my-scoped-component" {...} />
```

```css
.my-scoped-component {
  & .fr-button-primary {
    backgroundcolor: "chartreuse";
  }
}
```

Note: If you use external CSS to target `.fr-` classnames, your CSS must be source-ordered *after* Frigade's CSS in order to properly override the built-in Component styles.

If you don't have control over source-ordering in your app, you can increase the specificity of your selectors instead:

```css
body :is(.fr-title) {
  font-size: 42px;
}
```

## Tailwind

You can use Tailwind's [arbitrary variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants) to style the inner sub-components of a Frigade component:

```jsx
<Frigade.Banner className="[&_.fr-title]:text-fuchsia-500" {...} />
```


# Theming
Source: https://docs.frigade.com/sdk/styling/theming



The easiest way to get Frigade components integrated into your designs is by customizing the base theme that all of our components inherit from.

The base theme covers common style properties like colors, typography, spacing, and borders. If you need deeper customization, you can dig into CSS overrides or even custom components.

To override the base theme, pass the properties you want to change into the `theme` prop of the `Provider` component. In the example below we override the default blue primary color to be `#000000`:

```tsx
<Frigade.Provider
  apiKey="..."
  theme={{
    colors: {
      "primary": {
        "background": "#000000",
        "border": "#000000",
        "surface": "#000000",
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```

## Tailwind CSS and Shadcn

If you're using Tailwind CSS with Shadcn, you can use the `theme` mappings below to automatically match your existing theme.

```tsx
<Frigade.Provider
  apiKey="..."
  theme={{
    colors: {
      primary: {
        foreground: 'hsl(var(--primary-foreground))',
        background: 'hsl(var(--primary))',
        surface: 'hsl(var(--primary))',
        border: 'hsl(var(--primary))',
        hover: {
          background: 'hsl(var(--primary) / 0.9)',
          surface: 'hsl(var(--primary) / 0.9)',
          border: 'hsl(var(--primary) / 0.9)',
        },
      },
      secondary: {
        foreground: 'hsl(var(--secondary-foreground))',
        background: 'hsl(var(--secondary))',
        surface: 'hsl(var(--secondary))',
        border: 'hsl(var(--secondary))',

If using a `<ThemeProvider />` to enable theming such as dark mode, make sure the `<Frigade.Provider />` is a child of the `<ThemeProvider />` component.

## CSS Variables

Our theme runs on a set of [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) that map 1:1 to the properties in the theme. For any part of the theme, you can override the related CSS var and any themed value in that CSS scope will be changed accordingly.

This is especially useful in conjunction with the `css` prop, as it allows you to create temporary sub-themes that apply only to one Component, e.g.:

```tsx
<Frigade.Tour
  css={{
    // Change primary elements (i.e. buttons) in this Tour to be black
    "--fr-color-primary-surface": "var(--fr-colors-black)",
  }}
/>
```

The full list of CSS variables used in our theme can be found [here](/sdk/styling/css-variables).

## Finding a specific theme variable

You can use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS properties of any Frigade component. For instance, to find the theme variable for the secondary text in the [Form](/component/form) component, you can inspect the element and look for the `color` property:

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/frigade-docs/images/sdk/finding-colors.png" className="rounded-md" style={{border: '1px solid #E8EBF0',}} />

In the above example, we see that the theme variable is `--fr-colors-neutral-400`, which also corresponds to `colors.neutral.400` in the theme object.
