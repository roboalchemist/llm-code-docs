# Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

<details>

<summary>How can I start using Ideogram to generate AI images?</summary>

Sign up for a free account at [ideogram.ai](https://ideogram.ai/) and start generating images. Ideogram works directly in your browser, with no need to download any additional applications or software.

For more information, go to: [signup-and-registration](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/signup-and-registration "mention") and [generating-images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/generating-images "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much does Ideogram cost to use?</summary>

With a free account, you get 10 weekly credits - that's up to 40 images per week. You can also subscribe to a paid plan to access premium features like shorter wait-times, private generation, image upload, and way more generation credits.

For more information, go to: [plans-and-pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use Ideogram to generate images for commercial use?</summary>

We do not claim any ownership rights over the images generated, nor do we restrict your ability to use them. You are free to use the images as you wish. However, you are responsible for ensuring that your content does not violate any laws or third-party rights or our Terms of Service. Please review our full [Terms of Service](https://ideogram.ai/legal/tos), especially Section 2.1.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When do the <strong>Slow credits</strong> for <strong>Free Plan users</strong> reset?</summary>

**Slow credits** for **Free Plan users** reset every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (overnight from Friday to Saturday).

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I get access to the Ideogram API?</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the priority queue?</summary>

The priority queue is Ideogram’s fastest processing path and ensures your image gets processed immediately. Priority generation requires priority credits. The number of priority credits you have depends on the subscription plan you are subscribed to. You can also purchase top-up credits.

For more information, go to: [plans-and-pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens when I run out of priority credits?</summary>

Paid subscribers who have no priority credits remaining will generate on the slow queue. The slow queue has wait times that vary based on available server capacity and how much you've used it.

At this point, you can either: upgrade to a higher-tier plan that offers more priority prompts, purchase top-ups to get more priority prompts without changing your plan, or wait for your priority prompts to replenish on your next monthly billing period.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I choose between generating in slow queue or using my priority queue credits?</summary>

There is currently no way to toggle between the two queues. You will use your priority queue credits until they are exhausted, then switch to the slow queue. If you don't want to wait until your next monthly credit refresh, you can purchase top-up credits for more priority prompts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can other people see the images I generate?</summary>

All images generated on Ideogram are public by default to support the sharing of creative images generated by the community. If you want to hide your creations from others, [private generations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations) are available as a feature on the Ideogram Plus and Ideogram Pro plans.

For more information, go to: [private-generations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I change the cover image?</summary>

To change the automatically assigned cover image, simply click the heart icon to like the image you prefer. This will set it as the cover image. If you like multiple images in the same generation, the first one in the list will be chosen as the cover image.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I correct text in my image?</summary>

Although Ideogram excels at generating text in images, errors like spelling mistakes or missing words can occur. Depending on the error, there are various ways to correct it.&#x20;

Please read our full guide here: [text-and-typography](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/2-prompting-fundamentals/text-and-typography "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I download images in PNG format?</summary>

Paid subscribers can download images in PNG format as part of their plan benefits. Navigate to the image you want to download, click the Menu button, and then select Download -> PNG.

If you directly Right Click -> Save As on the image, you will download a WEBP format image. Please use the method outlined above to download images in PNG format.

For more information, go to: [downloading-images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/downloading-images "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I download images in SVG format?</summary>

At the moment, we do not support SVG or any other vector image formats. However, you can use third-party software or websites to convert bitmap images to vector formats, such as SVG.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I remove the background on my generated images?</summary>

You can use the [Background Removal](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/replace-remove-background) feature to remove the background from an image.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I integrate my logo or photo without modifications into an image?</summary>

</details>

***

[managing-your-subscription](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/account-settings/managing-your-subscription "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do my unused Priority credits roll over to the next month if I don’t use them?</summary>

Unused priority credits from the monthly subscription plans will not roll over to the next month of your subscription. Also, if you cancel your subscription, any unused credits will expire at the end of the current billing period. The same applies to Slow credits for Basic plan subscribers.

Priority credits from Top-up purchases will rollover to the next month, but only if your account continues to have a valid subscription plan. Else, they will become inaccessible because Free users cannot use priority credits. These credits will become accessible again as soon as you re-subscribe to a paid plan.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I changed my mind. Can I get a refund on my subscription payment?</summary>

</details>

# Getting Started


# Signup & Registration

Experience the magic of turning a text description into visual form in a matter of seconds, using Ideogram!

## 1. Signup

To generate images on Ideogram, you will need to first create an account.

Visit [<mark style="color:blue;">Ideogram.ai</mark>](https://ideogram.ai) and sign up using a Google or Apple account. At the moment, Ideogram only supports signup through Google or Apple. When you click “Continue with Google” or “Continue with Apple,” you will be redirected to the respective login page and then back to Ideogram. **Be sure to select the correct Google or Apple account when signing up, as it cannot be changed later.**

## 2. Pick a Username (Display Handle)

Once you log in, you will be prompted to choose a username that will be associated with your account and will be visible to other Ideogram users. The username must be unique, only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore, and be between 3 and 16 characters. Please note that your Google or Apple account's profile picture will be used as your Ideogram profile picture by default, but you can change your picture to any of your own generations later. **Be sure to choose a username you like, as you won't be able to change it later**. Once you've chosen a username, you're ready to experience the magic of text-to-image!

# Generating Images

Ideogram is a web application that allows you to browse and generate images from text. Within the user interface, you can generate images, browse and filter previously generated images, curate your user profile, manage your subscription, and more.

### Generation

To create an image in the simplest way, type the description of what you want to see in the prompt box, then hit **Generate**.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Desktop" %}

At the top of the screen, click the input text box to type a description of what you want Ideogram to generate, then hit **Generate** to start the process.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS app / Mobile" %}

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FM1k3HYdrFVM2hpQIDOhY%2FIMG_5555.PNG?alt=media&#x26;token=61bf3a92-6b92-4b9d-a391-9ebcdab53f86" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fa3a6H3eoo5o1ly2MydY6%2FIMG_5556.PNG?alt=media&#x26;token=2e3ed220-6526-474a-b83b-f07fb90ca38c" alt="" width="320"></picture><figcaption><p>The Ideogram user interface on mobile platforms.</p></figcaption></figure>

At the bottom of the screen, you can click on the "+" button to pull up the generation panel and start typing in a description of what you want Ideogram to generate. Hit the **Generate** button to start the generation.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Prompts and generations are visible to everyone on Ideogram unless you choose to generate in [Private Mode](https://docs.ideogram.ai/features-and-tools#private-generations)<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>
{% endhint %}

Ideogram generates four images at a time using graphical processing units (GPUs) on remote servers. While the generation is happening, you will see previews of the final images with a progress indicator above them.

After waiting a few seconds, your generation is complete!

### Generation Actions

When you click on one of the generated images, an information panel will appear—on the right side if you’re on a desktop computer, or below if you’re on a mobile device—offering several additional actions.

# The Basics, Step-by-Step

Here is a brief guide to help you understand how to prompt on Ideogram, step by step.

The prompts provided will always be written in the following format:

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A rough pencil sketch featuring a boy with sandy hair and blue eyes, wearing a&#x20;*~~*<mark style="color:purple;">hoodie</mark>*~~ *<mark style="color:green;">checked shirt</mark> and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day.*

The <mark style="color:green;">text in green</mark> means this text is new or was added to a prompt previously used.\
~~<mark style="color:purple;">Strikethrough purple text</mark>~~ means this text has been removed or replaced from a prompt previously used.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For all examples below, we'll use the following settings:\
• [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) set to OFF\
• [Aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratios-and-resolutions) of 1:1\
• [Model](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/available-models) v2.0 (unless otherwise stated)\
• [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/styles/styles-in-older-models) Realistic (unless otherwise stated)
{% endhint %}

## 1- A Very Basic Prompt

Let's start with a very basic prompt:

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair on a grey background.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F6SdnPm3bIKs2g6wlsBdM%2F01-a-boy-with-blond-hair-on-a-grey-backgrou_Ly2nLPPoQ9y1z6LIcw3XFA_PaBnaSuPS-avUkgh963fdg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3e7cb25f-f683-4817-a4be-f2ce3cba380b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Nothing complicated here. The image of a boy and a grey background as requested. Now let's add more details...

## 2- Adding Details

Let's add some specific details like eye colour, and maybe he's wearing a wearing a denim jacket over a light blue shirt, and how about a more interesting background.

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair <mark style="color:green;">and blue eyes,</mark>&#x20;*~~*<mark style="color:purple;">on a grey background.</mark>*~~*&#x20;<mark style="color:green;">wearing a denim jacket and a checked shirt, against a backdrop of wooden planks.</mark>*

<div align="center" data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FOdryg28QNCv9HAT1eLoS%2F02-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_ErLgiSIuTLOIeP6_wEowOA_FdSygSBYQg2RamlTZSsXKg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=334d2a1b-0a61-42ce-b20c-4c4dd656b05d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Nice! Now let's try to make it a bit more dynamic...

## 3- A Point of View

Perhaps changing the angle and/or the point of view would produce a more interesting image?

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a denim jacket and a checked shirt, <mark style="color:green;">seen partially in profile</mark>, against a backdrop of wooden planks.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FEKzo3JopwfJrRE4aJMV4%2F03-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_w2SHXqZkSPmG6C_kJIcCUw_J7uxTxO6Sk-1A7No-GTVng.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5799b398-b5ab-4aa1-8b18-2c3041f59c06" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Almost a studio photo but still very natural, isn’t it?

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: there are also other terms used to achieve this pose, such as <mark style="color:green;">three-quarter pose</mark>, or <mark style="color:green;">slightly turned to the left</mark>, etc.
{% endhint %}

## 4- Adding Elements

Let's add a few elements to make the overall image more attractive?

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a denim jacket, a checked shirt <mark style="color:green;">and jeans, sitting cross-legged on the floor, beside a friendly dog. Between them both there is a house plant in a pot. The entire scene is set</mark> against a backdrop of wooden planks.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQlylTfS4nF0sGuSP0RS0%2F04-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_k4xIQmBRRz63zQZJUZI8sA_zhke1hkFSa2O2ffdEoV9Xg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=74668586-9c07-4fc3-b61e-777618522544" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Observe how effectively the AI has rendered the requested elements and their precise positioning within the image composition. Now, let’s shift the mood…

## 5- Make a Lively Scene

Prompt:\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing* ~~*<mark style="color:purple;">a denim jacket,</mark>*~~*&#x20;a checked shirt and jeans, <mark style="color:green;">playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day</mark>.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fs99zJjCi2CNs0WERLVIy%2F05-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_CxEC3eNFTOibsmMPfSOTDw_glodCDWlTHuawMwuJYYDmw.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6a848ab3-3dd6-48fb-888b-17bd671b2bd6" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The addition of an environment contributes greatly to the atmosphere of a picture. And everyone knows that the Golden Retriever is a child's best friend. 😉

## 6- Using Available Pptions

As you may have noticed, Ideogram provides several options for generating images. From [Aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratios-and-resolutions) and [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/styles/styles-in-older-models) to [Color palette](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/color-palette) and other features, these options are invaluable for creating unique and diverse visuals.

Let’s explore some of these possibilities to create various outputs.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0gSfbdmjCwas0Sci7LMM%2F6a-washed-out-soft-watercolour-painting-fea_tr8MFtTWQuqXdEyhmGkk-g_wLlBWoqVQby0KFVjLj8oXg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9208a445-ed0d-4ef8-a0e3-d3626500e4ee" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em><mark style="color:green;">Washed-out soft watercolour painting featuring</mark> a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day.</em><br><strong>Model</strong>: v2.0<br><strong>Style</strong>: General<br><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: 4:5<br><strong>Color Palette</strong>: Pastel</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FRp0tvlFklFY9tZ23VsbA%2F6b-an-anime-illustration-featuring-a-boy-wi_47x_QrUXSZWrei7GJoi2hg_dUPo5DZlQ96xWioteT4BUw.png?alt=media&#x26;token=99fa807d-46ff-4f8f-b280-023b37cfcf85" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em><mark style="color:green;">An anime illustration featuring</mark> a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day.</em><br><strong>Model</strong>: v2.0<br><strong>Style</strong>: Anime<br><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: 4:5<br><strong>Color Palette</strong>: None</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FSuzU14dx9NzYbYPxUsPA%2F6c-a-cartoon-like-3d-boy-with-blond-hair-an_w5x5BIvySSKPtBGTAsKcGA_rMfJBRtPTjyNqXRSaONLNA.png?alt=media&#x26;token=44ca65de-b958-4ab6-b84d-23be7c838549" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em><mark style="color:green;">A cartoon-like 3D</mark> boy with sandy hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a paper-art park on a sunny day.</em><br><strong>Model</strong>: v2.0<br><strong>Style</strong>: 3D<br><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: 4:5<br><strong>Color Palette</strong>: None</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Difference between v1.0 styles and v2.0 styles.**

**In v1.0, the styles are really just words added at the end of the prompt** to specify the style you want, nothing more. So if you select 'illustration', it is the very same as if you've added the word 'illustration' at the end of your prompt. This works even better if you describe the style you want in the context of the prompt rather than a simple word at the end of it.

**In v2.0, the different styles utilize slightly different models to generate the images.** It is as though you are using a model better suited to the style you want, rather than relying on a generic AI model.

For more information, refer to the [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/styles/styles-in-older-models) section of this documentation.
{% endhint %}

## 7- Add Some Text

Let's say you want to make a cover for a children book, give it a title and also add the author's name.

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*Washed-out soft watercolour painting featuring a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day. <mark style="color:green;">At the top of the image, the book title is: "Michael and his dog" in a fun painted typography. At the bottom, the author's name: "John Johnson".</mark>*\
**Model**: v2.0\
**Style**: General\
**Aspect ratio**: 3:4\
**Color Palette**: None

# Downloading Images

Once you have created one or more images, you might want to download them to your computer. There are different ways to download images generated on Ideogram.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You shouldn't download images using a right-click in browser or by any other means as this may result in downloading smaller or more compressed images than those provided by the official methods below.
{% endhint %}

## Single-Image Download

When browsing images from any page, you can access the download function simply by hovering your cursor above the image. You will then see the **Download** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F17QQkV8mxayfk2IvQIUN%2FCleanShot%202024-07-19%20at%2007.36.31%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ed676281-683d-4fc7-9087-f420dde50dce" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3guIOcClDSxISyo2A3T7%2FCleanShot%202024-07-19%20at%2007.35.19%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1cdf7a07-5e8f-4b71-a47c-7c6b1e15cd1c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> that you can click to download the image.

You will have two options:

1. **JPEG (70% quality)**\
   This format is **available to everyone**. It is a compressed image format that provides smaller file sizes. The 70% quality means the compression might introduce some artifacts, usually visible only at the pixel level. These shouldn’t be noticeable when viewing the image normally.
2. **PNG (100%)**\
   This format is available for **Basic Plan users and up**. It is an uncompressed image format that provides the best quality with no artifacts, as it is the exact image that was generated. This ensures the highest quality possible.

# Prompting Guide


# In a Nutshell

## Ideogram Prompting in a Nutshell

Want to quickly start prompting with Ideogram? Here are the basics you need to know.

***

## Use Natural Language Only

Ideogram understands plain, everyday language. No need to use weights, parameters, or technical syntax—just describe what you want as clearly as possible, the way you’d describe something to a person.

***

## Be Clear and Visually Grounded

The more your prompt describes things that can actually be seen—like shapes, colors, materials, lighting, and background—the better the AI can understand and render them.

Focus on:

* The main subject (who or what is it?)
* What it’s doing (pose or action)
* Where it is (setting or background)
* How it looks (style, color, emotion, lighting)

Example: *“A watercolor painting of a fox curled up in snow under a pine tree, with soft blue shadows and falling snowflakes.”*

***

## Use a Structure

You don’t need perfect grammar, but to get the best results, structure your prompt using a clear format. Section 3 walks you through each part, but here's the general idea:

* **Image summary**: A concise phrase describing the type of image
* **Main subject**: Who or what the image is about
* **Pose or action**: What the subject is doing
* **Secondary elements**: Anything else around the main subject
* **Setting & background**: Where it’s taking place
* **Lighting & atmosphere**: How the scene feels
* **Framing & composition**: Camera angle or layout (optional)

Here’s a complete structure that works well:

> *\[Image summary]. \[Main subject details], \[Pose or action], \[Secondary elements], \[Setting & Background], \[Lighting & Atmosphere], \[Framing & Composition]*

For example:

> *A watercolor painting of a girl flying a kite on a hill at sunset, wearing a red dress, wind blowing through her hair, with trees in the background and soft golden lighting.*

No need to use every part—keep it short when exploring, and add more parts/details when you need control.

***

## Main Ideas First

Ideogram tends to give slightly more importance to parts placed earlier in the prompt. This is where to write the subject.

***

## Generating Text in Images

If you want text in your image, describing it near the beginning of the prompt usually leads to better results with fewer errors than if it is near the end. Using quotes `“ ”` around the desired text also helps. Keep in mind that the longer and more complex the text, the more likely it is to produce errors.

***

## Visually Grounded vs. Abstract Prompts

* **Visually Grounded**: Clear, detailed prompts get you precise images (e.g., *“A smiling woman wearing sunglasses at the beach”*).
* **Abstract/Poetic**: Vague or symbolic prompts lead to creative, surprising images (e.g., *“The feeling of summer captured in a moment”*).

***

## Handle Negatives

* Don’t say *“no people,” “man without a beard,” “no background”* or *“without trees.”*
* Instead, say exactly what you want (*“empty street,” “clean-shaven man,” “a plain white background,” or “desert landscape”*).

***

## Be Specific, Detailed, But Not Overloaded

Ideogram generally performs best with prompts under approximately 150 words (around 200 tokens). If the prompt is longer, the AI may begin to misinterpret or ignore the content beyond that point.

***

## Try, Iterate, Tweak

If something looks off, tweak one thing at a time:

* Reword key phrases, try synonyms or analog concepts
* Emphasize or remove a detail
* Use a different style
* Change the aspect ratio to change framing

Prompting is a creative process—experiment, learn, and have fun.

***

## Use Creative Tools

* **Magic Prompt**: Enhances and expands your original prompt.
* **Reference Style**: Applies the visual style from an image (generated or uploaded) to the image you are generating.
* **Random Style**: Same as Reference Style but with a random image. Perfect for wild visual explorations.
* **Remix**: Adjust and tweaks existing images using similar or different prompts.

Combine all of these for surprising, creative outcomes.

***

That’s it! Once you’re comfortable, the full guide below can help you go deeper and get even better results. But for now, just start prompting and see what happens. **Have fun!**

# 1- What is Prompting

## Prompting? What's That Exactly?

Prompting is the process of providing a description or instruction to an AI model to generate a specific output. In the context of Ideogram, you write a textual description of the image you want to create, and the AI generates an image based on that description.

For example:

> *“A serene landscape with rolling hills under a starry night sky.”*

This prompt guides the AI to produce an image matching the described scene.

A good prompt can be short or detailed, precise or poetic, depending on your goals. You'll learn how to choose the best approach based on the type of image you want.

***

## Why Prompting Matters

Prompting is how you describe to a text-to-image AI exactly what you want to see. The words you choose directly influence the result—whether you're aiming for something precise or exploring a creative idea. A clear, well-structured prompt helps the AI produce accurate and visually appealing images.

This guide teaches you effective prompting techniques, balancing clarity and creativity to get the best results possible.

***

## Why Structure and Wording Matter

Text-to-image AI models like Ideogram don’t interpret meaning intuitively like people do. They follow your instructions literally and try to visually represent every word in your prompt. Because of this, your prompt’s wording and structure significantly affect image quality.

A clear prompt structure helps Ideogram:

* Understand the main subject clearly.
* Focus on important visual attributes.
* Separate foreground from background elements.
* Accurately apply artistic style, lighting, and atmosphere.

***

Prompting with Ideogram is both a skill and a creative process. Whether you’re aiming for a specific visual or simply exploring artistic ideas, writing clear, thoughtful prompts gives you more control over the results. As you’ve seen throughout this guide, even small changes in structure, wording, or strategy can make a big difference. With practice, experimentation, and the right tools, you’ll learn how to shape the AI’s output to better match your intent—or discover something unexpectedly brilliant along the way.

**Happy prompting!**

# 2- Prompting Fundamentals

This section covers the key concepts that will help you write effective prompts for Ideogram. Whether you're aiming to generate the exact image you have in mind or to explore more creative, open-ended interpretations, these fundamentals apply to both prompting styles.

## Prompting Uses Natural Language

Ideogram uses **plain natural language** to interpret prompts. There are **no hidden parameters, weights, or coded instructions** you can embed in the prompt—everything must be described the way you would say it to another person.

This means:

* You **can’t assign weights** to parts of a prompt (e.g., `::1` or `(important)`
* You **can’t use hex codes or RGB values** for colors (e.g., `#E4BC73` ). Describe them instead with ordinary words (e.g., *“deep red,” “pale blue,” “golden-yellow”*). You can still influence the color in the image to be generated with the **Color** function.
* You **can’t use technical flags or shortcuts** like `--ar` or `--v` or `--style`

**Positioning still matters**: things written earlier in the prompt tend to be given more importance. So place the most important subject or idea near the beginning whenever possible.

If you’re coming from other text-to-image tools, this may feel simpler—but that simplicity is also what makes Ideogram especially good at interpreting well-structured, natural descriptions.

**You can write your prompt in your preferred language**: Ideogram generally understands prompts in any language, but for the most reliable results—especially when including text—write in English. Non-Latin scripts (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic) often render incorrectly. Using Magic Prompt will automatically translate your prompt into English.

While short, tag-like prompts (such as *“a man in the forest, fire, dramatic, painting”*) may work in some cases, **Ideogram—especially version 2.0 and higher—responds better to natural, sentence-style prompting.** Full sentences or clearly structured phrases help the AI understand context, relationships, and composition more reliably. Writing your prompt the way you'd describe the image to another person generally produces better results. Ordinary grammar, punctuation, and descriptive flow help the model understand context, relationships, and visual intent more accurately.

***

## How Ideogram Interprets Prompts

When you write a prompt, Ideogram doesn’t guess what you mean like a person might—it tries to visually represent every word. It reads your words literally, and each one affects what appears in the image.

> *A tall man in a red coat walking through a snowy forest.*

Ideogram will try to include all of those elements: the height, the red coat, walking action, snow, and the forest.

The clearer and more specific your wording, the better chance the AI has of generating an image that matches what you imagined.

***

## The Importance of Visual Grounding

Visual grounding refers to including concrete, observable details in your prompts—such as colors, shapes, objects, and settings—that the AI can accurately render.

For example, instead of saying:

> *A beautiful scene.*

Provide specific details:

> *A sunset over the ocean with orange and pink hues reflecting on the water.*

This specificity helps the AI generate more accurate and visually coherent images.

Even when you’re being creative or poetic, including some visually grounded elements gives Ideogram a stronger base to work from.

***

## Prompt Length and Clarity

The length of your prompt affects how Ideogram interprets your request. Longer prompts can give you more control and precision, but only if they’re well structured. Short prompts, on the other hand, leave more room for artistic or unexpected outcomes.

Prompt adherence is influenced by the clarity and specificity of your prompt. Longer, well-structured prompts with detailed descriptions can guide Ideogram to produce images that closely match your vision. However, overly complex or ambiguous prompts may lead to unexpected results.

### When to Use a Short Prompt

Short prompts are useful when you want to explore creative or poetic ideas without strict control over the result. They often work best when paired with tools like Magic Prompt or Random Style.

* **Short and creative:**

  > *A woman drifting through a quiet dream, shapes and colors shifting gently around her.*

This kind of prompt leaves much up to the AI’s interpretation. You might get surreal, abstract, or symbolic results—great for inspiration or exploration.

### When to Use a Longer Prompt

Longer prompts help when you want to control multiple parts of the image: the subject, background, lighting, mood, or style. They’re ideal when you already have a specific result in mind.

* **Visually grounded and detailed:**

  > *A red fox standing beneath bright autumn trees, surrounded by golden leaves falling onto a quiet forest floor.*

This kind of prompt tells the AI exactly what to render, and how to stage the visual.

### Tips for Using Longer Prompts Effectively:

* Break the prompt into logical pieces: subject, details, background, atmosphere.
* Put the most important ideas near the beginning.
* Avoid packing in too many unrelated concepts—this can confuse the AI.

### About the number of words:

Ideogram supports prompts up to **approximately 150 – 160 words (around 200 tokens)**. Prompts longer than this may be ignored or generate less accurate results. Make every word count, and always lead with what matters most.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Prompt length isn’t tied to prompting style. You can write short or long prompts whether you're using visually grounded, abstract, or hybrid language.

* Use **short prompts** when you want looser interpretation, to spark creative exploration or want to use Magic Prompt.
* Use **longer prompts** when you want to guide specific elements like subject, background, style, or lighting.

Start simple, lead with what's most important, and build up detail only as needed.

## **Visually Grounded vs. Abstract Prompts**

Ideogram responds well to both visually grounded and abstract prompts—but not in the same way. The way you phrase your prompt has a major impact on the kind of image you get, and how closely it matches your intent.

### **Visually Grounded Prompts**

These prompts focus on what can literally be seen in the image: the subject, setting, lighting, style, colors, and composition. They’re best when you have a specific image in mind and want the AI to render it as clearly and accurately as possible.

> * *A stone lighthouse standing on a rocky cliff in heavy fog, its beam shining across calm gray waves at dusk.*
> * *A woman sitting in a dark room beside a table, reading a book under the warm glow of a single candle.*

Visually grounded prompts tend to produce **more consistent and accurate results**, **stronger prompt adherence**, and **better layout control**, especially when generating images that include text.

### **Abstract or Poetic Prompts**

These prompts use figurative language, emotion, or symbolism to guide the image in a more open-ended way. They’re ideal for **creative exploration**, **unexpected results**, or **evoking a feeling rather than a scene**.

> * *A lighthouse fading into the mist, its light barely reaching the waves as the sea swallows the horizon.*
> * *A woman reading by candlelight, her face half-shadowed, as time seems to pause around her.*

Ideogram handles abstract prompts surprisingly well—especially when they include **some visual or emotional anchors**. The results may be unpredictable, but often striking.

### **Hybrid Prompts**

You can also blend both approaches: use a clear visual structure with a poetic tone, or add symbolic elements to an otherwise grounded prompt. This lets you guide the AI while leaving room for interpretation.

> * *A watercolor of a ballerina mid-spin on a quiet stage—like a moment of silence captured in motion.*
> * *A detailed ink sketch of an old lighthouse on a cliff. The sea below vanishes into mist like a forgotten memory.*
> * *A portrait of a young woman in a red cloak, standing still. The forest behind her blurs into colors like wet paint on glass.*

This style is especially useful when:

* You want a **specific subject** but an open-ended or expressive background.
* You want **artistic interpretation** while keeping a core idea intact.
* You want to inspire **variation in mood or atmosphere** while locking down style or composition.

Use hybrid prompts when you want the best of both worlds: direction *and* discovery.

**Tip:**

* Use **visually grounded prompts** for accuracy and control
* Use **abstract prompts** for creativity and exploration
* Use **hybrid prompts** when you want something expressive but anchored

## Generating Text in Images

Ideogram excels at rendering text within images—especially for posters, logos, titles, labels, headers, and other designs that incorporate typograpy—making it a powerful tool for any project that combines visuals and words.

The way you phrase your prompt can influence how well Ideogram renders the text within an image. Below are a few natural-language examples that show how to include quoted text early in your prompt, while keeping the description visually grounded and realistic.

> * *On the wall behind the artist, the phrase “Inspire Daily” is painted in large brush strokes across a mural, at the back of a vibrant and creative studio.*
> * *A vintage poster design with the words “Ride Free” curving along the bottom in retro lettering, featuring a smiling woman on a bicycle on a countryside road.*
> * *A chalkboard sign outside the bakery reads “Fresh Bread Daily” in handwritten white letters, surrounded by loaves and pastries arranged on rustic wooden shelves.*

**To achieve the best results:**

* **Use Visually Grounded Prompts**: Clearly describe the text's appearance, placement, and style within the image.
* **Position Text Early in the Prompt**: Mention the desired text near the beginning of your prompt to get better results.
* **Enclose Text in Quotation Marks**: Use quotation marks to specify the exact text you want to appear in the image.
* **Break longer text into chunks.**\
  If you're trying to generate more than one line of text, it's often better to split the content into sections with specific visual placement:

  > *A restaurant sign with the title “La Pasta” at the top, and the phrase “Fresh handmade Italian dishes” written below.*

  This gives Ideogram clearer structure and lowers the risk of spelling errors.
* **Reduce visual complexity if possible.**\
  The more intricate the rest of the scene is—busy backgrounds, multiple subjects, fine textures—the harder it is for the AI to cleanly render text. Simple backgrounds and good contrast between text and its surroundings improve results.

That said, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

* **Text length matters.**\
  The longer the text you want to include, the higher the chance of spelling errors, distortions, or incomplete words. Think of it like taking a group photo: the more people in the shot, the greater the chance someone will blink. Short, punchy phrases work best.
* **Not suitable for layouts with full textual content**\
  Ideogram is not designed to generate complete, text-heavy documents—such as full restaurant menus, website mock-ups with all copy in place, or multi-paragraph flyers. It can create the overall design and insert titles or short blocks of text, but long passages should be added later in a graphic editor or page layout application.
* **Foreign language support is limited.**\
  While you can write prompts in your own language, Ideogram’s text rendering is most accurate in **English**. Other languages, especially those that don’t use the Latin alphabet (like Chinese, Arabic, or Cyrillic scripts), often produce unpredictable or unreadable results.

If precise, readable text is important to your design, consider using Ideogram to generate the visual concept and then add the text manually using graphic editing tools afterward.

# Text and Typography

One of the areas in which Ideogram excels is in the generation and integration of text into an image. Whether as an overlay (e.g. a meme), as a typographic design (e.g. a t-shirt design) or as an integral part of various image elements (e.g. the name of a bottle of perfume), it's easy to get good results, often on the very first try.

To do this, all you need to do is write your prompt using complete sentences and punctuation, and indicate the text to be written by putting it in quotation marks and describing the context.

Here's an example:

**Prompt**:\
\&#xNAN;*A poster on a wall with text that reads: "Everything you can imagine is real. – Pablo Picasso"*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FfO4lAMxbqFuRZtHZWAqv%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a8e1fa55-cf26-4463-a80b-b2af30b1d12c" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The AI generated the requested text on a poster, on a wall.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
In the image above, the AI has decided on the style and type of wall and poster that will be generated, as well as other visual aspects. Of course, you can describe these or any other elements you'd like to appear in the image yourself in the prompt, and the AI will generate them accordingly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For the time being, text that you would like to be written using a non-Latin alphabet or accented Latin characters may have some difficulty being generated correctly, if at all.
{% endhint %}

## Various types of text renderings

As you will see in the examples below, Ideogram can easily integrate text in just about any situation.

## Fonts and styles

There are times when you would like to use a particular font or typographic style. Although it is not currently possible to specify a typeface by name, it is possible to describe certain stylistic properties in order to obtain a satisfactory result.

Bear in mind that the AI will also do its best to find an appropriate font style or typography for the image it needs to render. The result will be even better if you activate the [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) function. Here are two examples:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Flnc6lF8xA1xkqicV0e1G%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ef5d13da-8008-4007-9a5a-3e6675447940" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Prompt</strong>:<br>A fun whimsical birthday card design featuring a rabbit offering a cake and the text: "Happy Birthday"</td><td><strong>Magic Prompt</strong>:<br>A delightful and whimsical birthday card illustration featuring an adorable rabbit, wearing a cute chef's hat and apron, proudly offering a sumptuous cake with lit candles on it.

The background features a holographic sky filled with multicolored clouds and a crescent moon. A few flying vehicles can be seen in the distance, adding to the bustling city atmosphere.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Fonts and copyrights

It is important to know that the Ideogram's AI doesn't use real fonts to generate images the same way you use font in your computer. To put it simply, the AI learns by looking at lots of different text images and how it looks and what are the actual styles. As it learns, it figures out how to make text that matches those different styles. So, when you ask it to make text, it uses what it's learned to make text that looks like it's from a specific style or font, even if it's not using that exact font.

## Errors and misspelled words or phrases.

Although Ideogram excels at generating text in images, an image can sometimes contain a spelling error, a missing or extra word or letter. Depending on the nature of the error, it is possible to correct the situation in various ways.

* Simply generate your prompt again a few times and see if you get the text you want.
* Change some of the longer, more complex words for shorter synonyms.
* Use the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor) to modify the text, adding or deleting parts and then remix the image.
* Use the Typographic [Style Tag](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/styles/styles-in-older-models) with version 1.0 as it helps to achieve better results.
* Upload an image containing the desired text, which will serve as a starting point and composition source for the image to be created by remixing it.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's a well-known fact that long, complex words and long sentences are harder to generate correctly than short, everyday words. But don't despair, it can be done with patience, and it will get easier as the AI is updated and gets better.

It is often easier to remix an image to fix the image content itself while keeping the text right rather than trying to remix to fix the text while keeping the rest of the image.
{% endhint %}

Here's an example on how to fix text with the editor:

# 3- Prompt Structure

## Why a Prompt Structure?

A prompt structure is simply the way you organize your words when asking the AI to create an image. It helps the AI understand exactly what you want to see, like what kind of image it should be, what’s in it, and how it should look or feel.

When your prompt is clearly structured, the AI has a much better chance of generating something that matches your idea. It’s like giving good directions—you don’t need to be an expert, but the more clearly you guide the AI, the better the results will reflect what you have in mind.

***

## The Different Parts of a Prompt

Each part of a prompt adds structure and clarity. A clear structure also helps with prompt adherence, making it more likely that Ideogram will follow your description accurately and generate results that reflect your intent.

Each part below includes three numbered examples. Each number represents a part of a different image prompt, which will later be assembled into full, complete prompts in section 3.2.

### **1- Image Summary**

**Purpose**: This is where the entire image is described in a single sentence. Think of it as how someone might describe the image after glancing at it for just two seconds. <mark style="color:blue;">**If you could only write one sentence for the prompt, this is the part you’d want to get right.**</mark> It also works well with tools like **Magic Prompt** to expand on. It establishes the visual form (e.g., photo, logo, painting), identifies the main subject, and gives a hint of the visual tone or context of the image.

**Examples**:

1. *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup.*
2. *A whimsical watercolor painting of a little girl playing with her bunny in a flower-filled field.*
3. *A logo design for a local football team called “Rhinos” in green, blue, and white.*

### **2- Main Subject Details**

**Purpose**: This part gives more information about the main subject in the image. What does it look like? What color is it? What shape, material or texture? Whether it’s a person, animal, or object, this section ensures that the subject is described clearly and specifically so the AI can generate it precisely. This is also the best place to include any text you want rendered in the image, such as titles, signs, or labels. For best results, enclose the exact wording in quotation marks `“ ”` and place it early in the prompt when possible. Describe where the text appears and how it looks to increase accuracy.

1. *The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass, a matte black cap, and silver lettering. The text “Nightlife for men” appears on the label in bold, modern font.*
2. *The girl has short brown hair, a yellow dress, and rosy cheeks. She holds a fluffy white bunny in her arms, and both are smiling.*
3. *The main graphic shows a strong, stylized rhino head viewed from a three-quarter angle, with sharp lines and a bold expression. The word “Rhinos” appears in large, blocky letters beneath the icon.*

### **3- Pose or Action**

**Purpose**: This section describes what the main subject is doing — or how it’s placed. If it’s a person, maybe they’re smiling or sitting. If it’s an object, is it standing upright or tilted? This adds life and personality to the image, even when it’s still.

1. *The bottle stands upright with a slight reflection on the surface below.*
2. *The bunny is leaning into her, with its ears flopping gently.*
3. *The rhino’s horn points slightly forward and up, adding a sense of motion.*

### **4- Secondary Elements**

**Purpose**: These are the smaller things around or near the main subject. They help tell the story, establish relationships or complete the scene, but they don’t steal the spotlight. Think of things like props, background objects, accessories, ambient visual details, or smaller characters that make the image feel fuller.

1. *A wristwatch and a pair of sunglasses sit nearby, adding a masculine vibe.*
2. *Wildflowers, butterflies, and a toy picnic basket surround them.*
3. *Stars and shield shapes accent the logo without crowding it.*

### **5- Setting & Background**

**Purpose**: This part explains where the image takes place. Is it outside or indoors? In a forest, a city, a room, or an empty space? You can also say if it’s daytime, sunset, or a certain time in history. Whether highly detailed or minimalistic, the background contributes to anchor the image in a coherent visual context.

1. *The scene is set on a smooth black surface with blurred city lights in the background.*
2. *They are outdoors in a grassy meadow, under a wide blue sky.*
3. *The background is flat white, with no scene or setting.*

### **6- Lighting & Atmosphere**

**Purpose**: This is about how the light looks and how the image feels. Is the light soft or bright? Is it warm and cozy, or dramatic and dark? Atmosphere includes mood-related descriptors like ethereal, cozy, ominous, cinematic, etc. This helps set the mood of the image and makes it feel more real or more emotional.

1. *Lighting is moody and cool, with soft blue highlights and deep shadows.*
2. *The light is soft and sunny, with warm pastel tones and a dreamy atmosphere.*
3. *The color palette is vivid, with deep blue outlines, white highlights, and green fills.*

### **7- Framing & Composition**

**Purpose**: This describes how the subject and elements are visually arranged within the frame. It can describe the camera or viewer angle (top-down, low angle), shot type (close-up, wide), and subject placement (centered, rule of thirds). For non-photographic works, it still applies—e.g., how a figure is balanced in a painting or how elements are spaced in a logo. It enhances clarity, focus, and aesthetics.

1. *The bottle is centered in the frame, captured at eye level.*
2. *The girl and bunny are slightly off-center, framed from a gentle downward angle.*
3. *The logo is center-aligned with a tight, symmetrical layout.*

### **8- Technical Enhancers**

**Purpose**: These are the extra details that make the image look more polished or professional. They don’t change the content, but they improve how it looks — like lens type, lighting effects, bokeh, brush textures, or rendering style. These are useful when you want a certain artistic finish.

1. *A shallow depth of field gives the image a polished, professional look.*
2. *The brush strokes are loose and textured, with light color bleeds that add charm and softness.*
3. *The lines are clean, the edges sharp, and the style is vector-based with a modern, sporty look.*

**It is not necessary to use all the parts described above**. For example, when prompting for a logo design, you might not need to add anything about any secondary elements. Your prompt can be short or detailed, depending on your goal. The more parts you include, the more control you’ll have — but sometimes, a short or abstract prompt is the best way to explore creative results.

Now that you’ve seen each part in isolation, let’s bring them together.

***

## Assembling the Parts

Here’s a basic prompt template that is making use of all the parts described above:

> *\[Image summary]. \[Main subject details], \[Pose or action], \[Secondary elements], \[Setting & Background], \[Lighting & Atmosphere], \[Framing & Composition], \[Technical enhancers]*

By combining all the example parts from the example in section 3.1 above, we can build the following three complete prompts:

1. > *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup. The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass, a matte black cap, and silver lettering. The text “Nightlife for men” appears on the label in bold, modern font. The bottle stands upright with a slight reflection on the surface below. A wristwatch and a pair of sunglasses sit nearby, adding a masculine vibe. The scene is set on a smooth black surface with blurred city lights in the background. Lighting is moody and cool, with soft blue highlights and deep shadows. The bottle is centered in the frame, captured at eye level. A shallow depth of field gives the image a polished, professional look.*
2. > *A whimsical watercolor painting of a little girl playing with her bunny in a flower-filled field. The girl has short brown hair, a yellow dress, and rosy cheeks. She holds a fluffy white bunny in her arms, and both are smiling. The bunny is leaning into her, with its ears flopping gently. Wildflowers, butterflies, and a toy picnic basket surround them. They are outdoors in a grassy meadow, under a wide blue sky. The light is soft and sunny, with warm pastel tones and a dreamy atmosphere. The girl and bunny are slightly off-center, framed from a gentle downward angle. The brush strokes are loose and textured, with light color bleeds that add charm and softness.*
3. > *A logo design for a local football team called “Rhinos” in green, blue, and white. The main graphic shows a strong, stylized rhino head viewed from a three-quarter angle, with sharp lines and a bold expression. The word “Rhinos” appears in large, blocky letters beneath the icon. The rhino’s horn points slightly forward and up, adding a sense of motion. Stars and shield shapes accent the logo without crowding it. The background is flat white, with no scene or setting. The color palette is vivid, with deep blue outlines, white highlights, and green fills. The logo is center-aligned with a tight, symmetrical layout. The lines are clean, the edges sharp, and the style is vector-based with a modern, sporty look.*

{% hint style="warning" %}

> **Note:** Ideogram supports prompts **up to roughly 150-160 words or about 200 tokens** depending on the vocabulary. Anything beyond that limit may be **less effective or ignored entirely** by the AI when generating the image. To avoid losing key details, make sure the most important parts of your prompt come near the beginning. The assembled examples above approach that upper limit and are designed to give the AI strong visual and stylistic guidance while staying concise and well-structured.

# 4- Handling Negatives

## Why Negative Phrasing Often Fails

Ideogram, like many text-to-image AIs, struggles with understanding negation. When you describe something in terms of what it shouldn't include, the AI often misinterprets or ignores the negation. Instead, it focuses on the keywords themselves. For example, prompting *“a man without a beard”* may result in an image of a man with a beard, as the AI emphasizes the word *“beard”* without processing the *“without”* modifier.

This issue arises because these models are trained to associate words with visual elements, but they don't inherently grasp the concept of absence or exclusion. Therefore, using negative terms like *“no,”* *“without,”* or *“not”* can lead to unintended results.

***

## Turn Negatives Into Positives

When people want to exclude something from the image, they usually write the prompt using negative concept and phrasing of what they don't want—*“no people,” “without clouds,” “not dark.”* That’s completely natural in everyday language, but it doesn’t work well with text-to-image AI like Ideogram.

Instead, try to shift your thinking: describe the *positive visual opposite* of the thing you want to exclude.

Ask yourself: *“If this thing wasn’t there, what would I see instead?”*

For example:

* Don't write *“no people in the room”* but write *“an empty room with chairs neatly arranged”*
* Avoid *“without hair”* and replace it by “a bald figure with smooth skin”
* Instead of *“a beach without people”* use *“an empty beach at sunrise”*
* Rather than *“a robot with no eyes”* try *“a robot with a smooth, featureless face”*
* Don't write *“no cars on the street”* but opt for *“a quiet pedestrian-only street”*

This might feel less intuitive at first, but it gets easier with practice and is far more effective. If you're unsure how to flip your idea into a positive phrase, turn on Magic Prompt—it will often converts the sentence to a positive phrase—or use a Large Language Models AI (LLM) like ChatGPT to suggest an affirmative rewrite.

# 5- Common Pitfalls & Fixes

##

Even with a good understanding of prompting, it’s easy to make small mistakes that lead to strange or disappointing results—especially when you're trying to get a very specific image from the AI. This section highlights some of the most common issues users run into when they want precise results and shows how to fix them with simple changes.

These tips are especially useful when you have a clear image in mind and want Ideogram to follow your descriptions closely. If you're prompting more for creative discovery or artistic exploration, some of these “mistakes” may actually lead to interesting results—so feel free to experiment.

## Vague Adjectives

**Issue:** Using non-specific descriptors like *“beautiful,” “interesting,” “nice”* or *“cool”* can lead to unpredictable outcomes, as the AI lacks a clear visual reference for these terms.

**Fix:** Replace vague adjectives with specific visual details.

> **Instead of:** *“A beautiful forest”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A dense forest with tall pine trees and soft rays of sunlight filtering through the branches”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“A beautiful dress.”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A red satin evening gown with intricate lace details.”*

***

## Generic Style Terms

**Issue:** Using broad style descriptors like “artistic” or “modern”—often seen at the beginning of the prompt to define the medium and style of the image—may not provide the AI with enough guidance to what kind of art you expect.

**Fix:** Specify the desired style using well-known art movements, techniques, or mediums.

> **Instead of:** *“a modern painting of a landscape”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “An impressionist painting of a rolling countryside with thick brushstrokes and pastel tones”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“an artistic photo of a dancer”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A soft-focus photo of a ballet dancer mid-leap on a dimly lit stage”*

***

## Contradictory Descriptions

**Issue:** Writing conflicting information in a prompt can confuse the AI, leading to inconsistent or nonsensical images.

**Fix:** Ensure all elements of the prompt are coherent and compatible.

> **Instead of:** *“A minimalist sculpture with fine and intricate details”*\
> **Try:** *“A minimalist sculpture with smooth, simple geometric shapes in white marble”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Or:** “A detailed sculpture carved with delicate patterns and ornamental features, displayed on a minimal white pedestal”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“A clean, empty room cluttered with artifacts”*\
> **Try:** *“A clean, empty room with plain white walls and a single wooden chair”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Or:** “A room filled with ancient artifacts, displayed on simple white pedestals in a clean, open space”*

***

## Abstract Concepts Tied to a Subject

**Issue:** Prompts centered on abstract ideas without concrete visual elements can lead to a wide variety of results.

**Fix:** Anchor abstract concepts with tangible visuals.

> **Instead of:** *“A symbol of hope”*\
> **Try*****:** “A single flower blooming through a crack in the concrete”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“*&#x41; child caught in a moment of wonde&#x72;*”*\
> **Try*****:** “A child staring up at a night sky filled with stars, mouth slightly open in awe”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“An old man lost in regret”*\
> **Try*****:** “An old man sitting alone on a park bench, staring down at a faded photo in his hands”*

***

## Aspect Ratio Influence on Framing

Even with the exact same prompt, Ideogram may generate very different results depending on the aspect ratio you choose.

This is because the AI tries to fill the entire canvas based on the image it was trained with, and different aspect ratios naturally suggest different types of framing. For example:

A prompt like *“A woman walking on a busy city street sidewalk”*

* In **portrait (1:2)**, the result may show her full body from head to toe.
* In **landscape (2:1)**, the framing may shift closer—showing her from the waist up or knees up to fit the wider format.

If you're aiming for a specific composition—like a wide scenic view, a full-body portrait, or a tight close-up—it helps to:

* **Choose an aspect ratio** that matches your intent
* **Include clear framing cues** in your prompt, such as *“full-body,” “head and shoulders,” “wide establishing shot,”* and so on

However, even with a matching prompt and aspect ratio, the AI may still frame your subject differently than expected. For example:

* You might ask for a **full-body view** in landscape format, but the result shows only the upper body
* Or you might want a **close-up** in portrait format, but the AI includes the full body anyway

To guide the framing more precisely, here are two simple strategies that work in both cases:

1. **Include visual elements that hint at how much of the subject should be shown**
   * For **full-body results**, describe things near the feet—like shoes, sidewalk texture, shadows, or puddles
   * For **close-ups**, focus only on upper-body features—like eyes, lips, hands, or shoulders
2. **Adjust the focus of the prompt**
   * For wider framing, make the **environment** the main subject (e.g., *“a crowded city sidewalk”*) and describe the person as a key detail within it
   * For tighter framing, keep the **person** as the main subject and avoid describing large-scale surroundings that suggest a wide shot

These small changes help steer the AI toward the type of framing that fits your goal—whether it’s a full scene or a focused portrait. Combining descriptive language with the right aspect ratio gives you much better control over what appears in the final image.

***

In conclusion, learning to spot these small issues—and knowing how to fix them—can make a big difference in how well your prompt is understood. With just a few adjustments, you'll start getting images that feel a lot closer to what you had in mind.

In the next section, you’ll see how to iterate and refine your prompt step by step.

# Importance of Precision

Ideogram, particularly sensitive to how your prompt is constructed, the words you use, the semantics and punctuation. Here, we will cover some few tips to get the most out of your prompts and generate the best possible results.

## Precision to avoid confusion

In your prompt, if you write: “*<mark style="color:green;">A painting of a cat.</mark>*” you will probably get something painterly. But being precise might get you better results.

As you can see, precision determines the kind of painting you want. The same applies to just about everything you want to put in your prompt. The more precise you are, the more likely you are to generate the image you want.

## In that order, please

Ideogram AI, version 1.0 and up, will be very observant of the instructions you put in your prompt. Here are a few examples:

See how Ideogram can adhere to what you describe in your prompt, often with great precision. Of course, there are times when Ideogram can't seem to generate exactly what you describe in your message. The following section may be able to provide you with some help.

## Avoid contradictions

In this example we will see how a simple notion or a simple word may affect the image being generated.

Here we want a photographic portrait of a young boy, from the waist up. We also want to describe as many elements and other aspects as possible.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FO1nzQUBjrO5bMIPqhoLT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c14417e0-a93c-4e6d-9fe1-d9b9c05b1a7d" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Portrait photo of a young boy blond boy, with blue eyes, wearing headphones, a deep red hoodie and jeans, and red sneakers, in front of a music store.</em></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FD2Hj2E781uUC10ZXlawh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bade4418-49cf-418a-88bd-65fe833a53de" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Portrait photo of a young boy blond boy, with blue eyes, wearing headphones, a deep red hoodie and jeans, </em><del><em><mark style="color:purple;">and red sneakers</mark></em></del><em>, in front of a music store.</em></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FVGxkS4jXkGJsqcVjVYLf%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7701f75a-4353-49c1-9f80-fbfb60d761dc" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Portrait photo of a young boy blond boy, with blue eyes, wearing headphones, a deep red hoodie </em><del><em><mark style="color:purple;">and jeans, and red sneakers</mark></em></del><em>, in front of a music store.</em></p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Can you see the difference? If you describe something, the AI will **always** try to show it to you, even if you've specifically asked for a certain style that usually prevent you from seeing it. By simply removing some unnecessary descriptions, we were able to get exactly what we wanted.

## Gradation and relative sizes

Huge, big, normal, small, minuscule… Using the right qualifier to describe the importance of an element in an image is a simple way of defining an order of proportion. Let's look at an example:

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A striking and vivid magazine cover, featuring an anthropomorphic cat exuding wealth and success sitting on an armchair, a paws on each arm. The cat is dressed in a tailored suit and dark sunglasses, striking a confident pose in an opulent living room. The huge magazine modern title in sans-serif font of "Cat Life" dominates the cover, a smaller mention "magazine" just under it on the right side, while the big headline "How I Make Them Clean the Litter Box Every Day" piques the reader's curiosity. The second smaller headline read: "The full story". The dynamic lighting enhances Mr. Whiskers' regal presence, making this a truly unique and memorable cover.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FHWjSeIUXTFCUatLwaINA%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=628f1c4c-72ad-40cf-90d2-90378086294e" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The simple way of describing the relative sizes for each text element was sufficient to produce an expected result.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the complexity of the text and visual composition, this image needed more than one attempt to get it done like this.
{% endhint %}


# 6- Prompt Iteration & Refinement

Even with a well-structured prompt, the first image you generate might not be exactly what you envisioned. That's perfectly normal. Refining your prompt through small, thoughtful changes can help you get closer to your desired result.

This section covers practical strategies for adjusting and improving your prompts to achieve better outcomes.

***

## Why Iterate?

Each prompt you write is a starting point. If the result isn't quite right—maybe the composition feels off, or the subject isn't clear—making small adjustments can lead to significant improvements. Iteration helps you fine-tune your prompt to guide the AI more effectively.

***

## The One-Change Rule

When refining your prompt, it's helpful to change only one thing at a time. This approach allows you to see how each specific change affects the outcome, making it easier to understand what works and what doesn't.

> **Original:**\
> \&#xNAN;*“A black cat sitting on a windowsill during a storm”*\
> **Possible changes:**\
> 1\. *“A black cat sitting on a windowsill during a **light drizzle**”*\
> 2\. *“A black **dog** sitting on a windowsill during a light drizzle”*\
> \&#xNAN;*3. “A black dog sitting on a **porch** during a light drizzle”*

By altering just the nature of the storm, you can observe how this single change impacts the image.

***

## Prompt Chaining (Progressive Detailing)

Start with a simple prompt and gradually add more details in subsequent iterations. This method helps you build complexity step by step, ensuring each addition enhances the image without overwhelming it.

> **Step 1:** *“A medieval castle”*\
> **Step 2:** *“A medieval castle on a hilltop”*\*\
> **Step 3:** *“A medieval castle on a hilltop at sunset”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Step 4:** “A medieval castle on a hilltop at sunset with a dragon flying overhead”*

Each step adds a new element, allowing you to monitor how the image evolves.

***

## Try Alternate Wording

Sometimes a specific word or phrase just doesn't produce the result you're looking for. When that happens, try swapping it with a synonym, rephrasing the idea in a different way, or using a slightly different expression. Even a small change in wording can lead to very different outcomes—especially if the new term is more visually recognizable to the AI.

> **Instead of** “*lush jungle*”, **try** “*dense rainforest*” **or** “*tropical forest*”\
> **Instead of** “*futuristic city*”, **try** “*sci-fi metropolis*” **or** “*neon cyberpunk skyline*”\
> **Instead of** “*sad expression*”, **try** “*a face with downturned eyes and a slight frown*”

If something isn’t working right, it doesn’t mean your idea is wrong—just that the phrasing might need a small nudge.

A quick thesaurus search—or even asking a language model—can help you find wording that triggers the look you really want. Keep experimenting, one small change at a time, and you’ll quickly discover what works best.

***

## Emphasize Important Parts of the Image

Sometimes the AI might generate your image correctly in general, but miss something that feels too small, unbalanced, or visually incorrect. In these cases, two small techniques can make a big difference: **repetition** and **description for emphasis**.

### **Repeat Key Elements**

You can repeat the same element in different parts of the prompt to reinforce its importance. This doesn’t mean saying the exact same thing twice, but rather **referencing the same subject in multiple ways**.

> *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup. The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass… The bottle stands upright… The bottle is centered in the frame…*

By mentioning the bottle multiple times — in the summary, the details, and the framing — the AI is more likely to understand it’s the focal point and treat it with more visual weight.

### **Add Extra Description to Reinforce Details**

If the AI keeps omitting or downplaying something important, try **describing it more fully**:

* Add more visual detail about size, color, texture, or placement
* Mention it in different parts of the prompt (e.g., summary and composition)
* Reinforce its relationship to the rest of the image

For example, if the shoes of a person are missing or awkward, adding *“wearing black leather boots that cast a shadow on the sidewalk”* gives the AI both a visual anchor and spatial context.

These two techniques are especially helpful when:

* The AI misplaces or forgets a key detail
* You’re generating a busy or layered scene
* You want to draw focus to a specific object or subject

Use them as subtle tools to guide the AI’s attention — without needing to rewrite the entire prompt.


# 7- Creative Tools in Ideogram

Ideogram comes with several built‑in helpers that can *shift* or *amplify* whatever your prompt says. Think of them as “prompt modifiers.” They don’t replace good wording, but they can change the direction, polish, or diversity of the result.

Below is what each tool *does* to your prompt or image—and when to reach for it. (Full button locations and step‑by‑step instructions live in the official docs.)

***

## Describe – “Image to Prompt”

* **What it does**: Reads an existing image (uploaded or generated) and writes a fresh prompt that would recreate something similar.
* **Why use it**:
  * Kick‑start a new idea when you don’t know how to word it.

## Magic Prompt

* **What it does**: Expands or beautifies your text with an on‑device LLM. Short prompts grow; long prompts change only slightly.
* **Why use it**:
  * Add richer adjectives, lighting cues, or stylistic hints automatically.
  * Translate your ideas from any language into well‑formed English if desired.
* **Best practice**:
  * Short, exploratory prompt? Let Magic Prompt run wild.
  * Highly detailed prompt? Expect tiny tweaks—review to be sure it hasn’t added unwanted elements.
* **Examples**:

  > **Short prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*Photo of a cat sitting, gazing outside at the falling snow.*
  >
  > **Magic Prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*A cozy, warm photograph of a fluffy Persian cat sitting on a window sill, gazing intently at the falling snow. The cat has long, luxurious white fur, bright emerald-green eyes, and a slightly flattened face, creating a charming and endearing expression. Outside the window, large snowflakes gently drift down, partially obscuring a blurred landscape of snow-covered trees and rooftops. Soft, diffused light illuminates the cat’s fur from within, casting a gentle glow on its face and creating a peaceful, tranquil atmosphere.*

  > **Long prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*A cozy indoor photo of a black-and-white cat sitting peacefully on a wooden windowsill. The cat has thick, fluffy fur and green eyes, looking outside with a calm expression. Snow is falling gently outside the window, creating a soft wintery backdrop. A leafy houseplant in a terracotta pot sits nearby, and light condensation covers the lower edge of the glass. The scene is lit by natural morning light, with soft shadows and a warm, quiet atmosphere. The cat is centered in the frame, captured at eye level, and the background is slightly blurred to focus attention on the subject.*
  >
  > **Magic Prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*A serene, soft-focus photograph of a black-and-white cat perched gracefully on a weathered wooden windowsill, its thick, fluffy fur contrasting with the aged wood. The cat's bright green eyes gaze thoughtfully outwards, reflecting the gentle snowfall beyond the windowpane with a calm, almost contemplative expression. Outside, delicate snowflakes drift past a frosted window, while inside, a vibrant fiddle-leaf fig in a terracotta pot provides a splash of life near a softly blurred stack of antique books. Natural morning light illuminates the scene, creating a cozy and quiet atmosphere with subtle shadows and a delicate layer of condensation on the lower edge of the glass.*

## Random Style & Reference Style

* **Reference Style**: Lets you supply an image (uploaded or existing Ideogram output) whose *look* guides the next image.
* **Random Style**: Injects an unpredictable and random image as a reference style before generation—ideal for visual experimentation.

**Why use them:**

* **Random Style** pushes a familiar prompt into new artistic territory—great for concept discovery.
* **Reference Style** anchors colours, textures, or composition to a source image—useful when you want variation without losing a core aesthetic.\\

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro tip**: Combine a **short prompt** + **Magic Prompt** + **Random Style** and get ready to explore a variety of wild images and possibilities.
{% endhint %}

## Remix

* **What it does**: Use an existing image (uploaded or generated) as a parent image for the AI to regenerate while re‑using the prompt and other settings to make small or big changes.
* **Why use it**:
  * Fix small flaws without re‑writing the entire prompt.
  * Try minor lighting, color, or pose changes but keep overall composition.
* **Best practice**:
  1. Identify what you like in the current image.
  2. Change one phrase in the prompt (see Section 6).
  3. Hit Remix to preview the tweak side‑by‑side.

# Using Magic Prompt

The [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) feature in Ideogram can be very helpful to provide additional content, details, ambiance and stylistic information in a prompt. The more basic is the prompt, the more Magic Prompt will add to it.

{% hint style="info" %}
To find out more about the Magic Prompt function and familiarize yourself with it, you can also visit the section linked below.

[magic-prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt "mention")
{% endhint %}

## From basic to magic

Let's use a simple prompt and used it to explore what the Magic Prompt would come up with.&#x20;

**Original prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with a dog in a park.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FY2OJrRjzddvghl0xvPaj%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=80b2d47f-7ca6-4add-99c3-e82d47068bb5" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When used, the Magic Prompt function generates a new, improved and embellished prompt based on your original prompt, then sends it to the AI to generate an image based on this new prompt. Here are two examples:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FsMw3lFRvS5KFaRamk80h%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1fed4da9-3d06-4fbc-a13b-fcf301c44942" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Magic Prompt:</strong><br><em>A heartwarming scene of a young boy playing with his happy, wagging dog in a lush, green park. The boy has a playful smile on his face while he tosses a bright yellow ball for his furry friend to fetch. The park is filled with beautiful flowers and trees, creating a serene atmosphere for this bonding moment between boy and dog.</em></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaQnexqjZEsz99w4OrYxT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eb3462c1-01d3-4545-ad9a-cf5934993dff" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Magic Prompt:</strong><br><em>A charming image of a young boy playing with a cute, wagging-tail dog in a lush green park. The boy's joyful smile and the dog's playful eyes convey a sense of happiness and connection. The park is full of colorful flowers and trees, with a sunny sky overhead. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and uplifting.</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Even if there is no mention of any style in the original prompt or in the Magic Prompts, the AI decided to generate the images in styles that seemed appropriate for the text.
{% endhint %}

## Styles with Magic Prompt

The Magic Prompt also allows you to illustrate and explain in greater detail a basic style that you can request in your prompt. Here an example:

**Original prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with a dog in a park, <mark style="color:green;">abstract art</mark>.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8mKyTHOZ040Fkdbc48N7%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2c412387-4f5c-4eb5-a7a1-b46573df89a0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The boy is holding a ball, and the dog is running with a playful expression. The park is full of vibrant colors, with trees, flowers, and a winding path. The overall atmosphere of the painting is lively and joyful.</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fpz0NTCnunCck2VW0C1wP%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0853be95-4f97-4374-98c2-2418f8876695" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Magic Prompt:</strong><br><em>A vibrant abstract painting of a boy playing with a dog in a lush park. The background is a swirl of vivid colors, representing the park's foliage and sky. The boy and the dog are in a dynamic pose, with the dog's ears flapping and the boy's arm extended. The overall art piece exudes a joyful and playful atmosphere.</em></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

As you can see, the Magic Prompt has expanded on the original prompt while expanding and refining certain aspects of the requested style. Each proposal gave a relatively different image, while remaining within the parameters of the original prompt.

## Magic Prompt for inspiration

We all suffer from a lack of inspiration, the so-called blank page syndrome. To help you get started and stimulate your creativity, there's nothing like using the Magic Prompt. Let's look at a few examples.

# 8- Troubleshooting

##

Even with a well-structured prompt, the AI may not always interpret your intent exactly as expected. This section highlights common issues that can occur while prompting, along with practical fixes and links to relevant sections of the guide where you can learn more.

<details>

<summary>The AI adds something I specifically said I didn’t want.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Prompt uses negative phrasing (e.g., “*no hair*,” “*no people*”).
* AI fails to process negation and focuses on the mentioned object instead.
* The unwanted object or concept is inadvertently suggested elsewhere in the prompt.
* Use of Magic Prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Rewrite using **affirmative descriptions** (e.g., “*bald*” or “*empty city*”).
* Use **visual substitution** to describe what *is* present instead of what isn’t.
* Double check you prompt for possible contradiction, even subtle.
* Turn Magic Prompt off.

→ **See:** [Handling Negatives](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/4-handling-negatives), [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/7-creative-tools-in-ideogram#magic-prompt)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Text appears broken, misspelled, or missing.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Text isn’t properly indicated in prompt.
* Text placed too late in the prompt.
* Too much or too complex text.
* Text in foreign language or non-Latin characters.
* Conflicts with visual complexity.

**Fixes:**

* Put the text in **quotes** (e.g., *a sign that says “Open 24 Hours”*).
* Place the text early in the prompt.
* Limit the amount of generated text.
* Break long text into chunks with placement cues.
* Use **Magic Fill** to correct errors after generation.
* For long copy, add it later in a third party editor.

→ **See:** [Generating Text in Images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#generating-text-in-images)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Facial features, hands, or limbs look distorted (especially from a distance).</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Subject appears too small or far away in the frame for the AI to render detail properly.
* Low emphasis on face or limbs in the prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Move the subject closer by adjusting framing (“*close-up*,” “*portrait*”).
* Emphasize details explicitly (e.g., hands, eyes, facial features).
* Fix imperfections afterward using **Magic Fill**, recommended if you like the image.

*\*This isn't really a problem of wording or style, but rather the fact that most AIs struggle to handle fine detail at a distance, partly because of the lack of available pixels the AI has to work with.* [*Magic Fill*](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) *can help fixing this as it can work with greater pixel density over small areas.*

</details>

<details>

<summary>The subject is cropped when it should be shown fully (or vice versa).</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Aspect ratio doesn't match intended framing.
* The aspect ratio isn't commonly used for that type of image.
* Insufficient framing cues in prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Explicitly include framing cues like “full body,” “head and shoulders,” or “wide view.”
* Describe elements near the cropped area (feet, shoes, ground) to encourage full framing.
* Adjust the **aspect ratio** to better fit your subject and match intended composition.

→ **See:** [Aspect Ratio Influence on Framing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/5-common-pitfalls-and-fixes#aspect-ratio-influence-on-framing)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Important words or concepts are not visually present in the image.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Important ideas are too abstract, ambiguous, or visually unclear.
* Terms used are not visually grounded enough.

**Fixes:**

* Use alternate, more visually concrete wording or synonyms.
* Add more explicit visual cues or repetition of terms.

→ **See:** [Try Alternate Wording](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/6-prompt-iteration-and-refinement#try-alternate-wording), [Emphasize Important Parts of the Image](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/6-prompt-iteration-and-refinement#emphasize-important-parts-of-the-image)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Unwanted object, person or text appears in the image.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Vague or overloaded prompt.
* Ambiguous language indirectly suggesting extra items.
* Uses of Magic Prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Simplify or clarify your prompt to remove ambiguity.
* Emphasize the desired subject and exclude unnecessary ideas.
* Use visual substitution (e.g., “empty field” instead of “no one around”).
* Turn off Magic Prompt.

→ **See:** [Prompt Length and Clarity](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#prompt-length-and-clarity), [Handling Negatives](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/4-handling-negatives), [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/7-creative-tools-in-ideogram#magic-prompt)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Non-English or non-Latin text is incorrect or unreadable.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* AI has limitations rendering non-Latin alphabets (Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese).

**Fixes:**

* Use English for best text rendering.
* Add add non-Latin text manually afterward (if necessary).
* Keep non-Latin text very short (logo-length).

→ **See:** [Prompting Uses Natural Language](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#prompting-uses-natural-language), [Generating Text in Images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#generating-text-in-images)

</details>

<details>

<summary>A phrase isn’t giving the result I expected.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Wording is too vague or abstract.
* Phrase not visually grounded.
* Uses of Magic Prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Use more **visually grounded** synonyms or phrasing.
* Try alternate wording or rephrasing of the concept.
* Turn Magic Prompt off.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The AI ignores important parts of my prompt.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Important details placed too late in the prompt.
* Lack of emphasis for key features.
* Prompt length exceeds \~150 words.

**Fixes:**

* Place important elements early in the prompt.
* Repeat or describe the key elements with more detail.
* Use **descriptive emphasis** to draw attention.

→ **See:** 6.5 [Emphasize Important Parts of the Image](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/6-prompt-iteration-and-refinement#emphasize-important-parts-of-the-image).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Changing one word doesn’t seem to help.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* The new word is not visually strong or grounded.
* Other words in the prompt might conflict with it.

**Fixes:**

* Change **multiple related terms** for better alignment.
* Try synonyms that are more visual.
* Use a **thesaurus or LLM** to brainstorm variations.

→ **See:** [Try Alternate Wording](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/6-prompt-iteration-and-refinement#try-alternate-wording)

</details>

<details>

<summary>The style or visual mood isn’t right.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Style or mood not specified or vague (*“artistic,” “modern”*).

- Contradictions between subject and style.

**Fixes:**

* Mention specific style and moods: *“watercolor,” “digital painting,” “dreamy,*” etc.

- Use a visually grounded detailed description for the style and mood you want.
- Try **Magic Prompt** to explore or **Style Reference** to better control styles and moods.

→ **See:** [Visually Grounded vs. Abstract Prompts](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#visually-grounded-vs.-abstract-prompts), [Creative Tools in Ideogram](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/7-creative-tools-in-ideogram)

</details>

<details>

<summary>The image doesn’t match the emotion or concept I had in mind.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Emotion or concept described too abstractly for AI recognition.
* Missing concrete visual cues.

**Fixes:**

* Translate emotional or conceptual language into visual or facial/body language cues.
* Blend abstract phrasing with visually grounded language.

→ **See:** [Visually Grounded vs. Abstract Prompts](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#visually-grounded-vs.-abstract-prompts), [Abstract Concepts Tied to a Subject](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/5-common-pitfalls-and-fixes#abstract-concepts-tied-to-a-subject)

</details>

This section doesn’t cover every possible scenario, but these are the most frequent issues users run into and most image issues can be fixed with one of these strategies. With time and a little experimentation, you’ll find the right combination of clarity and creativity to make each prompt work better. If something still isn’t working, try breaking your idea into smaller parts and building it up again, one step at a time.

**Androgynous / Gender-Neutral**\
Androgynous figure, gender-neutral body, flat chest, minimal curves, straight waist, soft features, unisex appearance, balanced proportions.


# Memory Colors for Naming Color Nuances

When describing colors in a prompt, using specific, visually grounded references is much more effective than generic terms like “red” or “green.” Since Ideogram doesn’t understand numerical color codes (like RGB or hex) in prompts yet, using familiar, real-world references — often called *memory colors* — helps convey a more accurate color nuance. These references evoke a mental image based on shared visual experience, such as “cherry red” or “sky blue.”

The list below groups memory-based color terms by base color. Each one can help you fine-tune your prompt and get closer to the exact hue you’re aiming for.

**🔴 Red**\
Apple, cherry, cranberry, blood, scarlet, ruby, wine, burgundy, brick, rose, garnet, fire engine, tomato, coral, blush, pomegranate, strawberry, chili, paprika, beet, firelight, jam, sangria, red velvet, ember

**🟠 Orange**\
Pumpkin, tangerine, apricot, rust, amber, carrot, marmalade, clay, copper, burnt orange, squash, paprika, cantaloupe, butternut, saffron, cheddar, flame, tiger, persimmon, ginger, ochre

**🟡 Yellow**\

#### Descriptive Modifiers for Color

To further refine the color you're describing, you can combine memory-based color terms with descriptive modifiers. These help define the **intensity**, **temperature**, **finish**, or **lighting** of the color — allowing for more control and expressiveness in your prompts.

Here are common categories and examples of useful modifiers:

* **Intensity or Brightness**\
  Pale, light, soft, faint, pastel, bright, deep, vivid, bold, dark, muted, rich, intense
* **Warmth and Temperature**\
  Warm, cool, neutral, icy, frosted, fiery, dusky, earthy
* **Finish or Surface Quality**\
  Glossy, matte, metallic, shimmering, iridescent, pearlescent, velvet-like, translucent, silky, powdery
* **Light and Shadow Modifiers**\
  Sunlit, shadowed, backlit, faded, dimmed, glowing, reflective, foggy, moonlit

**Examples**\
You can combine these with memory-based color terms for added clarity and control:

> * *Powdery sky blue*
> * *Rich cherry red*
> * *Frosted mint green*
> * *Dusky rose pink*
> * *Shimmering sapphire blue*
> * *Matte ivory white*


# Angle of View and Perspective

In image generation, the angle from which a scene or subject is viewed can dramatically affect the composition, storytelling, and overall feel of the result. This appendix outlines a variety of useful terms for describing point of view — both for the scene as a whole, and for individual people, animals, or objects within it.

#### 📸 Scene-Level Perspective (Camera-to-Environment Angle)

These terms describe how the viewer is positioned relative to the entire scene or environment.

* **Bird’s-eye view** — looking down from high above (also: aerial view, top-down perspective)
* **Worm’s-eye view** — looking up from ground level (also: low-ground view)
* **Overhead view** — directly above the subject (similar to: bird’s-eye, top-down)
* **Aerial view** — wide view from a high altitude (drone-style)
* **Isometric view** — angled top-down with parallel lines and no distortion (also: game map view, simulated 3D)
* **Wide-angle view** — expansive field of vision (also: cinematic wide shot, landscape framing)
* **Establishing shot** — broad scene-setting view (also: intro frame, scene overview)
* **Panoramic view** — ultra-wide horizontal framing (also: 360° view, landscape sweep)
* **Side view** — looking across from the left or right (also: lateral view, profile of the scene)
* **Tilted angle (Dutch angle)** — slanted horizon (also: skewed angle, off-kilter frame)
* **Point of view (POV)** — from a character’s visual perspective (also: first-person view)
* **Over-the-shoulder** — behind a subject, viewing what they see (also: behind POV)
* **Distant view** — subject seen from afar (also: far-shot, wide establishing)

#### 👁️ Subject-Level Perspective (Viewing a Person, Animal, or Object)

These terms describe how the subject itself is being viewed or framed in the composition.

* **Front view** — directly facing the subject (also: straight-on view)
* **Side profile** — side of the face or body (also: profile view, lateral angle)
* **Back view** — viewing the subject from behind (also: rear angle)
* **Three-quarter view** — angled between front and side (also: partial side view)
* **Close-up** — tightly framed (also: portrait crop, detail view)
* **Extreme close-up** — single facial feature or small detail (e.g., just eyes, lips, hand)
* **Full-body shot** — head to toe (also: wide crop of the subject)
* **Headshot** — upper torso and face (also: bust shot, portrait frame)
* **Low angle** — looking up (also: heroic angle, upward shot)
* **High angle** — looking down (also: downward shot, overhead crop)
* **Eye-level** — neutral, straight-on framing (also: natural perspective)
* **Overhead angle** — directly above the subject (like from a drone or ceiling)
* **Underside view** — from beneath the subject (also: under-angle, worm’s/ant's perspective)
* **Behind-the-subject** — subject turned away (also: back-facing composition)
* **Obscured or cropped view** — subject partially hidden or off-frame (also: partial view)

You can combine these terms with emotional cues, lens types, or action words for even more control.\
For example:

> * *Aerial view of a foggy village*
> * *Over-the-shoulder shot of a warrior facing the horizon*
> * *Three-quarter close-up of a woman smiling*
> * *Low-angle view of a tree glowing in moonlight*
> * *Full-body front view of a seated child*

#### Be Careful With Conflicting Perspective Elements

When using angle or point-of-view terms in your prompts, make sure the other details you describe make sense from that same viewpoint. Since the AI tries to include everything you mention, asking for something that wouldn’t normally be visible from a specific angle can confuse it — and may cause the model to ignore the perspective altogether.

**Examples of possible contradictions:**

> * *A top-down bird’s-eye view of a city \[…] the sky is filled with fluffy white clouds.*
> * *A rear view of a man walking away \[…] he is smiling at the camera.*
> * *An extreme close-up of a woman’s face \[…] she is wearing a knee-length red dress.*


# Describing Age and Life Stage

When prompting for people, describing age clearly can shape the outcome just as much as physical features or clothing. However, many AIs don’t reliably interpret numeric ages (e.g., “a 7-year-old girl”) with visual accuracy. Instead of specifying numbers, it’s more effective to use descriptive, life stage–based terms. This appendix breaks those terms into two parts per group: age terms and modifiers to help communicate the age and physical traits more accurately.

You can mix and match across each category for more controlled image generation.

#### **Infant (0–1)**

* **Age Terms**\
  Newborn, baby, infant

* **Youth-Oriented Modifiers:**\
  Youthful, baby-faced, radiant with youth, fresh-faced, full of life, soft-featured, innocent-looking
* **Neutral or Crossover Modifiers:**\
  Mature presence, confident, refined, composed, healthy-looking, well-groomed, graceful
* **Age-Related or Elder-Oriented Modifiers:**\

# Character Reference

Creating visually consistent characters across multiple images has always been a challenge in AI image generation—until now. With **Character references**, you can define and reuse distinctive characters, ensuring that facial features, hairstyles, and other key traits remain consistent from one image to the next.

This powerful feature gives you greater creative control and continuity, whether you’re illustrating a story or simply exploring different settings with the same character. Once defined, your characters can be easily customized and reused with new prompts, helping you build cohesive image series with ease.

In the sections below, you’ll learn how to create, manage, and use your Character references effectively, along with tips for combining them with other features like Remix and Magic Fill to achieve your desired results.

## Accessing Character Reference

### From the Prompt Box

1. **Tap or click the prompt box** to reveal the options at the bottom. &#x20;
2. **Select the Character tab** to access existing character references or create a new one.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FdeRdzMV5IDFizUwDioxb%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b3466667-3524-4adf-a91a-5d293d735eec" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7JX9zz2AHTHMY5mshmB5%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=69689561-f8bc-4c7e-8b3d-7a613e742d79" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. If you choose an already-made character you will see the corresponding Character tab appear in the prompt box below the prompt.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FMGi4AXJhc1gRJqn6EInf%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=392021c3-2946-46c7-ab63-0c5930e60290" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fm2Vgl1AVIqKTHz8iviiP%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2b68c808-ba29-4e95-89f4-e0643c98c015" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you create a new character, you will be taken to the Character page.

### From Other Places

You can also open the Character page from several locations:

1. The **Left-Side Panel**.
2. The **Right-Side Panel** when viewing image details.
3. The **More icon** (...) when browsing images.

You can add a character reference image in 3 ways

1. **Camera**: This enables you to take a picture with your device/computer and use it as a character reference. Please note that you may need to authorize your browser or app to access your camera.
2. **Upload**: Browse images from your device or computer and upload one.
3. **Creations**: Browse your creations on Ideogram and select one as a reference.

Alternatively, you can select an already created character.

Your chosen image will appear in the top-left corner of the prompt box.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** A headshot or portrait-style image with a clear face and slight angle typically yields the best results.
{% endhint %}

When a character reference is present in the prompt box **on the homepage**, clicking on it and hovering your cursor over the image will display two icons:

* Describe icon: This icon will activate the Describe function, which will add a description of the image to the prompt box.
* Edit Mask icon: This icon allows you to modify the mask used by the AI for the selected character. *(More information on masking is provided below.)*

Clicking on the X icon will remove the character from the prompt box.

Alternatively, clicking on the image itself will bring you directly into the Edit Image Mask function.

### Personalizing Your Character

Now that you have your character reference image, here are the steps to generate an image with it:

1. Choose how you want to describe the image to be generated:
   1. **Write a prompt** describing in detail your character and the background, **or**
   2. **Choose a template** from the wide selection of predefined ones for a quick start.\
      \&#xNAN;*(Templates are available below the prompt box when you are in the Character page. If needed, you can access them again by clicking the Templates button located next to the Generate button in the prompt box.)*
2. Select the desired style:
   1. **Auto**: automatically selects the optimal style based on your prompt.
   2. **Realistic**: creates lifelike photography with authentic colors, textures, and lighting.
   3. **Fiction**: creates unique characters with a mix of imaginative and fictional elements.

3. Apply the other generation options such as **Public/Private**, **Aspect Ratio**, and others, except:
   1. **Unavailable options**: Color Palette, Negative Prompt, Seed Number.
   2. Any previously selected Style reference **will not be effective** when using character reference
4. Once ready, click **Generate** to create your image.

Here are a few examples:

## How Masking Works

When you choose an image as a Character reference, the AI automatically select the face and hair from that image.

Sometimes, it can be helpful to modify or adjust the mask to achieve better results—such as changing the character’s hairstyle.

For example, consider the following prompt:

> *A woman with vibrant blue pixie cut hair.*

With the default mask, the generated image doesn’t reflect the requested hairstyle, and only a small amount of color is applied over the original hair.

<div><figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FidbSGEHTPD8zEQOSBZ5X%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2015ccc5-7000-4f37-b277-d8e1a5d4ba82" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxtGwXaCiLj1T6iiwTwWn%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=992a0cbc-9542-4177-93ad-b0cfe0281516" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>Default mask.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fi2OKi15TSspTVDNTvYdD%2Fpixie-1.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4c03c230-62c7-42be-b182-a6714562484e" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Generated image using the default mask.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

By excluding the hair from the default mask, it was possible to replace the hairstyle and achieve a uniform color more easily.

Conversely, you can also keep a larger portion of the image to better preserve certain elements—for example, a cap, a piece of jewelry, and so on.

Consider the following prompt:

> *A woman wearing a red ruby pendant and a red evening gown.*

With the default AI mask, the generated image doesn’t preserve the look of the pendant and generates one with a different appearance.

## Using a Character Reference with Other Features

While **Character reference** is a powerful feature on its own, combining it with tools like [Magic Fill](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) and [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) help you create the exact image you have in mind.

For example, you might have already generated an image that meets most of your requirements—except for the character depicted in it. Below are two methods you can use, depending on your needs.

### Using a Character Reference with Remix

If you just need to preserve the overall look of the environment and the composition of the original image, [**Remix**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) can be an excellent solution. Here's how:

1. **Select the image** you want to remix and click **Remix** in the right-side panel.
2. In the prompt box, **click the Character tab** to access existing characters or create a new one.
3. **Provide a detailed prompt** describing the character’s physical appearance and the environment.
4. **Adjust the image weight** for the remixed image (usually between 60–80; some experimentation may be needed to find the optimal value).
5. **Set the other options** to your liking (it’s recommended to turn off Magic Prompt to preserve the intended character and environment).
6. Click **Remix** to generate the images.

### Using a Character Reference with Magic Fill

If you need to preserve as much of the background and environment as possible, [**Magic Fill**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) can be an excellent solution. There are many ways to proceed—here’s one of them:

1. **Click on an original image** of your choice where you want to change the character.
2. **Click Open in Canvas** in the right-side panel.
3. **Click Magic Fill** in the left-side panel.
4. **Mask** the area of the character you want to replace.
5. **Click Next**.
6. **Click Character** at the bottom of the prompt box.
7. **Select or create** a Character reference.
8. **Write a detailed prompt** describing the new character’s physical features and the environment.
9. **Click Magic Fill** to generate the images.

# Color Palette

Available to all users, the **Color palette** function allows you to set the overall color scheme for your image generation. Think of this function more as a way to influence the outcome rather than as a precise tool for achieving exact color matching. When used in conjunction with detailed color descriptions in your prompts, this function can produce stunning and color-consistent images.

To access the **Color palette** popup menu, click or tap the prompt box to reveal the options at the bottom, then click the **Color tab** to open a popup menu with the available choices.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how applying a color palette might affect the outcome of a prompt:

Prompt:\
\&#xNAN;*A photo of the moon rising above the tree line near a lake at night. The moon is partially obscured by clouds. A wooden cabin is located near the lakeshore. The lake is calm, reflecting the sky and the trees. The ground is covered with pine needles. The background contains mountains.*

## Custom Color Palette

Users with a Plus or Pro subscription can create their own custom color palette. To do so, simply go to the bottom of the color palette menu and select "Custom." You can then enter up to five colors to use in your custom palette.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FlYOHDlxIJBDHeA9ZxXPL%2FCleanShot%202024-08-20%20at%2015.53.48%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1db61aa7-4f73-40a9-83af-1f200639b30f" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaAxUCs6ezIQGTouiBezb%2FCleanShot%202024-08-20%20at%2015.53.12%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d972d20e-7b22-46e9-94d6-41b9becef2c0" alt="" width="375"></picture><figcaption><p>Choosing the colors to use in a custom color palette</p></figcaption></figure>

You can choose a color using the convenient color selector, by entering the hexadecimal RGB values below it or directly below the custom color palette. Make sure to place a “#” in front of each hexadecimal number and separate them with a space.

## Creativity and Experimentation

Using the Color Palette not only affects the overall color but also impacts the visual aspect and composition of the generated image. Here’s a good example:

Prompt:\
\&#xNAN;*A minimalist single-line cat design in gold on a black background*

The Color Palette function adds more than just color to your images; it also opens up new avenues for experimentation and exploration of the possibilities available to you.


# Magic Prompt

**Magic Prompt** uses a locally hosted LLM (Large Language Model AI) as your personal prompt assistant. It interprets your original prompt then optimizes and embellishes it (when needed), to maximize the variety and beauty of the images generated.

This feature also allows you to write your prompts in your native language for greater accuracy and ease of use by users worldwide.

## Magic Prompt Options

To select one of the **Magic Prompt** options, simply click or tap the prompt box to reveal the options at the bottom, then click the **forth tab** to open a popup menu with the available choices.

* **Auto**: When set to “Auto,” Magic Prompt will decide how many of the images will use the enhanced prompts based on the length of your initial prompt.
* **On:** When set to “On,” each of the four images generated by Ideogram will benefit from the enhanced prompt provided by Magic Prompt.
* **Off**: When set to “Off,” the four images generated by Ideogram will exclusively use your original prompt as-is.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the Magic Prompt feature in action, along with the prompts it generates and the resulting images.

**Original Prompt:** `A cat on the right side of a beach ball on a sunny beach`

#### With Magic prompt off:

With the Magic Prompt disabled, the AI generated four images in a photographic style, adhering to the instructions provided in the original prompt.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fqwq1jbLVksOgYAarolPu%2FOFF%20images.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=37b42cd8-a10f-46cf-8f63-617c52156fcb" alt=""><figcaption><p>When Magic Prompt is turned off, your original prompt is used as is.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### With Magic Prompt set to auto

In this example, Magic Prompt used the original prompt as is for two images, while enhancing the other two. For those two enhanced images, it added elements commonly seen at the beach and introduced some artistic flair and a humorous atmosphere.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fw0gpByPrFQAeiKb4OMmm%2F2024-04-11_06-03-46.033.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e3837209-5284-4abe-81e6-fe700b8da44a" alt=""><figcaption><p>When Magic Prompt is set to auto, it will decide how many images will use enhanced prompts.</p></figcaption></figure>

When you select an image, certain information will appear either on the right side of your screen (on desktop) or below the image (on mobile devices). When Magic Prompt is used, you can see both the original prompt and the enhanced prompt. In the example above, you can see the Magic Prompt used to generate the first image:

<div align="center"><figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FM0pxmcLcJFSTlO7iIQgf%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20philozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=24e29b33-78cf-49ff-b58a-59ef2643aa13" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPTwxMturQGlIrMcDxApK%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20philozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b4d2bacd-0e8e-460d-896e-c1b8f1cfef06" alt="" width="370"></picture><figcaption><p>The original and generated Magic Prompt</p></figcaption></figure></div>

The image was generated by the AI according to the enhanced prompt below:

`A playful cat is sitting on the right side of a vibrant beach ball, situated on a sunny, sandy beach. The beach is dotted with sunbathers and colorful umbrellas. Waves gently lap at the shore, and a pristine blue sky is adorned with a few fluffy white clouds. Seagulls soar overhead, adding to the lively and carefree atmosphere.`

To copy one of the prompts, simply click or tap the icon to the right of it.

# Negative Prompt

The **Negative prompt** feature guides the AI away from generating specific types of images or content. It essentially instructs the AI on what to avoid or exclude in the generated image.

For example, if you’re using an AI to create landscape images but want to avoid beaches, you could use a negative prompt like "beach" or "beach, sand, water, ocean." This helps the AI understand your preferences and constraints, allowing it to produce images that more closely match your intended outcome.

To access **Negative prompt**, click or tap the prompt box to reveal the options at the bottom and click the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>  located at the end of the prompt box option tabs to open a popup menu with the available choices.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here are some tips to get the most out of the feature:

* Try to use more than one keyword to describe what you don't want.
* Be as precise as possible without providing excessive detail.
* It's often simpler and more effective to design prompts that avoid using negative prompts, rather than the opposite approach.
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your negative prompt doesn't seem to be working, check if there’s anything in the prompt that might interfere with or contradict your negative prompt. The content of the regular prompt will always be favored over the negative prompt. For example, a prompt asking for a classical guitar will almost always imply a guitar with strings. Trying to generate a guitar without strings could prove difficult.
{% endhint %}


# Private Generations

With an Ideogram Plus plan or higher, you can generate images privately. When an image is marked as private, only you can see it. Any privately generated images will remain private even after your subscription ends. You will still have access to them, but you will only be able to download them in JPG format unless you resubscribe to a Plus plan or higher.

For more details about purchasing an Ideogram subscription, visit our [Plans & Pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing) page.

## Generating Private Images

You can choose whether you want your generation to be private or public by using the **Visibility** toggle in the Prompt box.

# Render Speed

The **Render speed** option, available to any paid subscription user, is used to tell the AI to spend more or less time generating an image, which also have an effect on the overall amount of details and quality of the image.

To select a specific **Render speed**, click or tap the prompt box to reveal the options at the bottom, then click the **third tab** to open a popup menu with the available choices. The available options are located at the bottom of the popup menu.

The **Render speed** settings allows you to adjust the amount of time the AI spends fine-tuning the requested image. There are three possible render speeds:

**Turbo**: Generates images quickly and is best used for ideation when you want a quick look at the composition. Sometimes useful for achieving a sketchy look.

**Default**: The standard render speed used by default.

**Quality**: Offers better detail and overall image quality. It can sometimes correct imperfections that might be visible in the Default mode.

{% hint style="info" %}
Speed will vary between different models. For example, Model 2a is faster than Model 2.0 when using equivalent rendering settings.

# Seed Number

The **Seed number** functionality acts as a unique numerical identifier or starting point for image generation within the AI model. Think of it as a special code or number that establishes the initial conditions used by the AI to create an image. It is typically used to produce the same image output, ensuring consistency in results for reproducibility.

## How to Use the Seed Number

To access the **Seed number** functionality, click or tap the prompt box to reveal the options at the bottom and click the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>  located at the end of the prompt box option tabs to open a popup menu with the available choices.

If you dont enter any seed number in the field, the AI will use a random one and generate the image based on that seed number. You can enter any number to serve as a seed number in the corresponding field.

When you click on a particular image, its seed number can be found in the panel on the right (on PC) or below the image (on mobile devices).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Seed number feature won’t produce the exact same image when changing the Render speed in Ideogram version 3.0, as it did in older models. However, the image will be similar if the same prompt is used.
{% endhint %}

## Seed Number Use Case

One use case would be to keep the same seed number and generate an image from the same prompt with different renderings. For example:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seed: 406220<br>Rendering: Fast</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FYz0LcGrTj58en9FZ3CQe%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a3abb3de-b326-4ce9-97a7-bde06f325253" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Seed: 406220<br>Rendering: Default</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0ZxfLbi2t3aum0amBSeN%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b2d4ed15-8b50-4d20-87d0-85ba83e45c44" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Seed: 406220<br>Rendering: Quality</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8hugIeBdZcmhoUJlChvI%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=57d209e3-405a-4431-8591-c4042f3d2747" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

This feature can also be used to make small modifications to a prompt while keeping most of the image the same as before.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>... The background is a dark <mark style="color:green;">blue</mark> gradient, ...</em><br><strong>Seed</strong>: 406220<br><strong>Rendering</strong>: Default</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FWxQSzpQIymJVeZEYveZF%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=59f180f6-fd6e-4665-a80c-1775773e9b0b" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>...

The background is a dark <mark style="color:green;">red</mark> gradient, ...</em><br><strong>Seed</strong>: 406220<br><strong>Rendering</strong>: Default</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FdoCz9dSrZ6R0nDkFIjFA%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6c7f08c2-077f-4bdc-a623-027b340148c2" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

As you can see, the images are not identical, but they have the same composition and general appearance, with only the background modified as requested.

{% hint style="warning" %}
By using this technique and modifying the prompt—for example, by replacing the word "photography" with "painting" or changing the AI model—you’ll generate different images even when using the same seed number.

### Tips & Tricks

#### Tips to generate the best images using Styles:

* Turn **Magic Prompt** off to avoid unintended stylistic additions to your original prompt.
* Avoid adding style keywords in your prompt to give the model stylistic freedom.
* Avoid including **style-related keywords** in your prompt that may contradict the intended style.
* Shorter, focused prompts typically work best when using styles.
  {% endhint %}

### Creating Your Own Style

In addition to using preset styles, you can also create your own custom styles to achieve a personalized aesthetic.

How to create a style:

1. Click **Style** in the prompt box.
2. Open the **My styles** tab.
3. Click **Create new style**
4. Upload or select **up to three images** to use as style references.
5. Name your style and click **Create**.

Your custom style will appear under **My Styles** and can be reused in any prompt.

{% hint style="success" %}

### Tips & Tricks

#### **Tips for selecting the best images for custom styles:**

* **For a strong, unified style:** Choose images that share a similar look, mood, aesthetic and composition.
* **For creative, unexpected results:** Mix diverse references to let the AI blend aesthetics to experiment and be surprized.
* **Using gradients to control color:** Upload gradient-based image as one of your three references to influence overall tone.
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Source images from your created styles **can't be changed after creation**. This ensures that anyone who uses your style in the future will see consistent results based on the images you originally uploaded.
{% endhint %}

## Combine Styles With Other Features

**Ideogram Styles** becomes even more powerful when combined with other features:

* [**Describe**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe): Generate prompts from existing images and apply a style to them.
* [**Remix**](#remix): Reimagine existing images with a chosen style.
* [**Character**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/character-reference): Maintain a consistent subject across different aesthetics.
* [**Color Palette**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/color-palette): Match your prompt to a specific mood or tone.

### Describe + Styles

Use **Describe** to generate detailed text prompts from existing images, then apply a style to create a fresh version.

{% hint style="success" %}
Remove any stylistic keywords from Describe results for cleaner, more controlled outputs.

Example using the image below:&#x20;

<div align="center"><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FfleZYHu1wg2HK6Hcsz0h%2FGuitarist%20original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bb026913-ded1-401b-9991-b4413d33944a" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

**Original Describe prompt:**

> A dynamic ~~indoor photograph~~ of a young man playing an electric guitar with intense emotion. The musician wears a <mark style="color:green;">burgundy red</mark> hoodie and <mark style="color:green;">light blue</mark> jeans, displaying an enthusiastic expression with eyes closed and mouth open in a passionate singing pose. He holds a <mark style="color:green;">cream-colored</mark> Fender electric guitar with a <mark style="color:green;">black</mark> pickguard. The setting features a <mark style="color:green;">dark green</mark> wall with two black and white framed photographs visible in the background. A <mark style="color:green;">brown</mark> leather couch is partially visible in the lower portion of the frame. ~~The lighting creates a warm, indoor atmosphere, highlighting the musician's features and the guitar's cream finish. The composition captures a moment of musical expression, with the subject positioned slightly left of center in the frame.~~

~~Strikethrough~~ words and sentences, of stylistic nature, were removed or replaced to optimize how the AI interprets and applies **Styles**. Additionally, any words highlighted in <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> — which indicated the colors of elements in the image — have also been removed.

**Describe adjusted prompt:**

### Remix + Styles

Use **Remix** with **Styles** to bring new life to existing images while preserving their structure. This method usually matches the composition better than using **Describe** alone.

* **Higher remix weight** → Keeps composition closer to the original.
* **Lower remix weight** → Leans more heavily into the chosen style.

Example using Remix with a weight of 60% with the same original image and same Describe adjusted prompt:

### Character + Styles

Combine **Character** with **Style** to maintain a consistent subject across multiple images while experimenting with different looks and aesthetics. Perfect for creating variations while maintaining consistency

Example using the same adjusted prompt with a Character reference:

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FYEiB3w9wMPmUzI2tLWlC%2FGuitarist%20-%20Character.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4d86382c-c8eb-4928-837f-75ed21f95cdb" alt=""><figcaption><p>Character reference.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F2m9YPVgBKInEQaTeakwB%2FMixed%20media.png?alt=media&#x26;token=24c97361-b0b4-428f-a0eb-557cc28e5dbf" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: Mixed Media.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F72ZZFLwhbTLFoKG57nmE%2FGuitarist%20-%20Monochrome.png?alt=media&#x26;token=26a76238-8895-42d8-9097-1661a5dd161c" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: Monochrome.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Color Palette + Styles

Pair **Styles** with **Color palette** to influence the overall tone and mood of your image. When a palette is applied, the selected colors are incorporated while maintaining the style visual identity.

The examples below show the color palette used in the lower-left corner of the images:

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3KzcFd5vOBVoz22sAN6u%2FGuitarist%20-%20Original%20colors.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f7607314-19f6-4665-98e5-89864534a2e8" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: Analog Nostalgia</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FSdF5aPyvgFstlM8fozY2%2FGuitarist%20-%20Pastel%20colors.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b4ca6794-8e46-4149-a7c9-915733a81c10" alt=""><figcaption><p>Analog Nostalgia with Pastel.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FBSzML0fiuHjbONZyCA62%2FGuitarist%20-%20Aquamarine%20colors.png?alt=media&#x26;token=74de8659-5860-429f-a308-5b0ed4d259b1" alt=""><figcaption><p>Analog Nostalgia with Aquamarine.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

In version 1.0, using a **Style** effectively adds the corresponding keywords to the end of your prompt just before generating the image, ensuring that the AI understands the type of image you are looking for.

Click on a style to apply it. With Version 1.0, you can select and apply multiple styles at once.

# Tile

## What is the Tile Function

The **Tile** feature, available to any paid subscription user, allows you to create images that can be seamlessly tiled without visible borders or interruptions. This can be particularly useful for image creators, providing an easy way to generate seamless backgrounds, textures, and patterns directly from a prompt.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **Tile** function is only available in Ideogram version 1.0. Make sure the 1.0 model is selected; otherwise, the Tile option in the More menu will be greyed out.
{% endhint %}

To access the **Tile** function and select a specific tiling pattern,  or tap the prompt box to reveal the options at the bottom and make sure that version 1.0 is selected. Then, click the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>  located at the end of the prompt box option tabs to open a popup menu with the available choices.&#x20;

Here are the available tile arrangments:

* **Off**:
  * This option will not use the tile functionality.
* **Grid**
  * The images will be arranged in a checkered grid.
* **Vertical brick**
  * Each image in a column will be offset vertically by half the height of the image in relation to the adjacent ones on the left and right.
* **Horizontal brick**
  * Each image in a row will be offset horizontally by half the width of the image in relation to the adjacent ones above or below.
* **Column**
  * This option will tile the images in a single column.
* **Row**
  * This option will tile the images in a single row, which is useful for creating banners.

Here are some visual examples of each grid style:

When you click the "Download" button, the 1x1 and 2x2 tile images will be automatically downloaded in a .ZIP file.

Sometimes you come across a beautiful image that you think you could use as a banner, gift wrap or website background. In such cases, it can be a good idea to use the [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) function in conjunction with the [Tile](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/tile) function to obtain the perfect image you’re looking for. Here are a few examples:

# Features & Tools


# Batch Generation

Save time and create images in bulk with **Batch generation**. Simply upload a spreadsheet with your prompts and settings, then come back to finished images. Only available on [**Ideogram Pro**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans) and  [**Ideogram Team**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing).

## Using Batch Generation

1. Click the **Batch** icon in the left-side panel.
2. Click **Download template** to download a simple template that you can fill out. You can download the full template instead by clicking on the right-arrow to reveal a dropdown.&#x20;

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FlK3k11vH9WKhClICZW6k%2FBatch%20Generation%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e07a481d-4785-4caf-a765-1c09358036ff" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fb8v1HkvMQSBQGiOsB0Xh%2FBatch%20Generation%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=111f4986-5c2c-4ba6-991b-31068432afed" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>Select which template you want to download.</p></figcaption></figure>

3. Following the template, fill in the rows of the spreadsheet with your prompts and parameters, using the [expected values](#expected-values) for each column. Be sure to remove the example rows.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a limit of <mark style="color:red;">500</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**rows**</mark> per uploaded file, <mark style="color:red;">**including the header row**</mark>.
{% endhint %}

4. When finished, save the file. If possible, save it in the CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format. This will help with errors in case your file contains special characters.
5. Upload it to Ideogram by clicking **Upload spreadsheet** in the Batch Generation page. We accept .csv, .xls, and .xlsx formats.
6. Check for error messages. If any appear, make the necessary changes and upload the file again.

6. Once there are no errors, review the details of your uploaded CSV file. You will see:

## Useful Tips

{% hint style="info" %}

1. If you are seeing a general "Sorry, something went wrong" error when uploading your CSV file, try saving your file in the CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format.
2. Make sure the names in the header row (first row) are entered exactly as in the template file or as described above. Do not change the capitalization.
3. The capitalization of words (except the header row) does not matter.
4. The order of the columns does not matter.
5. When editing the file, make sure the cells are in text format. The automatic formatting might interfere with writing some values. For example, entering a new aspect ratio might be interpreted as a date/time format, causing the value to be rewritten and invalidated. For instance, 2:3 might be rewritten as 2:03.

## Combining Ideogram Batch Generation With Other AI Tools

Did you know that you can combine the power of Ideogram Batch Generation with other AI tools to efficiently iterate and inspire new design concepts?

Here’s an example:

#### Goal: Generate a variety of Christmas stickers.

Let’s pretend you want to create nice-looking Christmas sticker designs. We will use ChatGPT in this example.

1. Download a CSV template file from the Batch Generation page.
2. Ask ChatGPT to produce a CSV file following the same structure.
3. Provide instructions to ChatGPT, including:
   1. A clear design task.
   2. A few effective prompt examples that work for you.
   3. The settings you want/need (the other column values).
4. Upload the template to ChatGPT along with your instructions (see the example below).
5. Download the CSV file generated by ChatGPT.
6. Upload it to the Batch Generation page. Ideogram will handle the rest.

Here’s an example of what can be sent to ChatGPT as instructions:

<pre data-overflow="wrap" data-full-width="false"><code>Task: Generate a CSV file with 20 prompts following the template of the provided CSV file.
<strong>
</strong><strong>Context: The prompts will be used to create sticker designs for the Christmas Holidays. Ensure the prompts are diverse, creative, and engaging.
</strong>
Settings: Use 1:1 aspect ratio, set visibility to private, model to 2.0, rendering to "default", magic prompt to "on" and use "design" as style.

Please follow the language style of the following examples:

1- A sticker design of a cartoon-like figure with a cheerful expression holding a brain upright. The figure is standing on a cloud. There is a speech bubble above its head that reads, "HEY, YOU DROPPED THIS!".

2- A sticker design of a stylized, cartoon-like depiction of a fox. The fox appears to be curled up, with its tail wrapped around its body. Its eyes are closed, giving it a peaceful or sleepy expression. The fox is predominantly orange with white accents, especially around its muzzle and eyes. The fox is set against a white background.

3- A sticker design of a cute cat with a curious expression peeking out of a cardboard box where it barely fits. The cat is sitting on the edge of the box. The text "If I Fits, I Sits" is written in a quirky font below the cat. The background is white.

4- A sticker illustration of a whimsical and adorable cartoon sloth relaxing in a hammock, hanging between two palm trees on a beach. The sloth is wearing stylish sunglasses and has a relaxed grin. The background contains a serene blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and a few other palm trees.

5- A charming and whimsical sticker design featuring a sleepy owl perched on a book, its eyes half-closed. The background neutral grey and the sticker has a thick white outline.

6- A vibrant, retro-inspired sticker with bold white outlines. The motivational phrase "NEVER GIVE UP!" is written in a dynamic, flowing cursive font reminiscent of 1950s Americana signage. The text has a subtle neon glow. The phrase is surrounded by playful, abstract shapes and vintage-inspired patterns. The overall design is bright, cheerful, and evokes energy and optimism.

## Examples of Descriptions

When you activate the Describe function, the AI will analyze your image and generate a suitable prompt that describes the content of the submitted image.

Below are examples of real photographs where the Describe function was used, and Ideogram’s AI was asked to generate the corresponding images **without** using the [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) or [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) features.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FRWTMdPCrShqpJsgqIR2l%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=805829cd-ed37-46ce-8e09-8361dea5c854" alt=""><figcaption><p>Original photo.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### **Prompt from Describe v3.0:**

A close-up photograph of an American Goldfinch perched on a dark brown tree branch. The bird has vibrant yellow plumage on its head, back, and wings, with distinctive black and white wing bars. The goldfinch's beak is bright orange-yellow, and its eye is dark and alert. The bird is positioned facing right, gripping the rough-textured branch with its feet. In the background, there are green leaves visible, slightly out of focus, creating a natural bokeh effect. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the bird's bright yellow feathers. The composition is sharp and detailed, with the goldfinch positioned in the left two-thirds of the frame. The background has a blue-green tint, suggesting a summer or late spring setting.

#### **Prompt from Describe v2.0:**

A vibrant yellow bird perched on a slender brown branch. The bird has black and white markings on its wings and tail. The backdrop consists of green leaves, suggesting that the bird is in a tree. The blue sky forms the upper portion of the image, providing a serene backdrop to the bird's bright plumage.

#### **Prompt from Describe v3.0:**

An aerial photograph of a small town during autumn, captured from a high drone perspective. The main road runs through the center of the image, a two-lane asphalt road with yellow center lines. The town is nestled between dense forested hills covered in vibrant fall foliage featuring orange, yellow, and red leaves. The buildings are predominantly white and gray residential homes with pitched roofs, scattered along both sides of the main road. A large body of water, a lake, is visible on the right side of the image, with dark blue water and a rocky shoreline. The sky is bright blue with wispy white cirrus clouds stretching across it. The landscape shows a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees, with the foliage displaying various shades of autumn colors. The terrain rises from the town toward the hills in the background. The image has natural lighting from a clear day, creating strong contrast between the bright foliage and the deep blue sky. The photograph captures the entire town layout, from the dense residential area to the waterfront, showing the natural integration

#### **Prompt from Describe v2.0:**

A picturesque town nestled between a dense forest and a serene lake. The town is characterized by a main road that runs through it, flanked by houses on both sides. The houses vary in size and color, with some having red roofs. The forest is ablaze with autumn colors, ranging from golden yellows to fiery reds and deep oranges. In the background, majestic mountains rise, partially obscured by the mist. The sky above is clear with a few wispy clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day.

{% hint style="info" %}

1. Describe will give you a different result depending on which model version you previously selected. Version 3.0 will generate a more detailed and slightly longer prompt, while versions 2.0, 2a, and 1.0 will all produce the exact same slightly shorter description.
2. If the result you get from Describe doesn’t meet your expectations, try using the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor) to crop your original image to a different [aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratios-and-resolutions) or zoom in on the main subject. This may generate a slightly different prompt that could lead to a better image.

# Remix

The **Remix** tool is invaluable for making changes to an existing image, whether it was generated in Ideogram or uploaded. The AI uses the original image as a basis to generate a new one, allowing you to control how much influence the original image has on the final result.

## How to Use Remix

When viewing or uploading an image, you can access the Remix feature in different ways:

* Click the **Remix** button in the image details panel when viewing an image.
* When browsing images, hover the cursor over the image and click the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQv2bkEyP7H3Ox3wbdrXJ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ddf39952-d74d-4c02-854d-3bbb2ebf5637" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> and select **Remix** from the popup menu.

When using **Remix**, the prompt used to generate the **parent image** or the automatically generated description from the **Describe** function of an uploaded image will automatically populate the prompt box. Additionally, any style tags or other settings from the parent image will be reused. You can modify these elements to adjust and refine the parent image when generating the remixed image.

**Remix** allows you to specify how much influence, or **Image weight**, the parent image should have on the newly generated image. Clink on the Remix tab in the prompt box to reveal the available options. You can adjust this weight by moving the **Image weight** slider left or right. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value ranging from 1 to 100. The higher the value, the more significantly the parent image will influence the generated images. You also have the option to remove the parent image entirely, relying solely on the prompt and style tags to create a new image, just like a normal image generation.

# Replace/Remove Background

The **Replace/Remove background** feature lets you easily isolate the main subject of an image by removing or changing its background.

This feature is available to all paid plans:

* **Remove background** makes the background transparent, leaving only the main subject. This is free (no credits used).
* **Replace background** generates a new background based on your prompt. This uses credits, depending on:
  * The **Model** you selected.
  * The **Number of images** generated.
  * The **Render speed.**

## **How to Access Replace/Remove Background**

There are a few different ways to access the **Replace/Remove background:**

1. When viewing an image in detail, click the **Replace bg** button or the dropdown arrow to access **Remove bg**.
2. When browsing images, click the More menu <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> and select the desired function.

## Remove Background

There are two slightly different ways to use "Background Removal": either directly while viewing an image or by using the Canvas feature. Each behaves a bit differently.

### When Viewing an Image

* On the right-side panel, click the down arrow right next to the **Replace bg** button to access the popup menu and select **Remove bg**.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FwVgq1PMwuwASNEGppYym%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d641724f-cbeb-4cbd-b955-1efc149ec0a4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FouCFK7CrfYBjIYQPAT2Y%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e24ea367-1d5a-40f8-af6f-6b7b9866a94a" alt="" width="370"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The window will update with the new image, now with the background removed and transparent. This image is automatically saved in your Creations.

* The image is available for download as is.

The right-side panel will change to reflect the new options and information. To further refine the transparent background, click the **Edit background** button that has now replaced the former **Remove bg** button. You will then be transferred to the Canvas in [Edit Background mode](#edit-background-mode).

### When in Canvas

If you clicked **Open in Canvas** or if you were already in **Canvas** then:

* Select the image for which you want the background to be removed.
* Click on **Remove bg** on the right-side panel.
* You will enter [Edit Background mode](#edit-background-mode).&#x20;

### Edit Background Mode

When in **Edit background** mode, you have access to different tools to refine the background’s masked/transparent areas:

1. **Rectangle Mask**: Create a mask from a rectangular shape.
2. **Lasso Mask**: Create a mask from a freeform shape.
3. **Brush Mask**: Create a mask from a freeform round brush. You can increase or decrease the brush size using the bracket keys \[  ] or by clicking the dropdown menu (the little down arrow on the right) to access the size slider.
4. **Erase**: Toggle the erase mode, allowing you to restore parts of the deleted background using the mask tools.

When done editing the background, you can:

1. **Cancel**: Cancel any background removal or refinement and revert to the original image.
2. **Save**: Click to save the current image with the background removed. Alternatively, click the drop-down menu (the little down arrow on the right) and select "Save copy" to save a copy of the image with the background removed while keeping the original image intact.

Once the background has been removed, you can either download the image using the "Download" function in the left-hand panel, or continue working with the image in Canvas. In either case, the image will also be available in your Creations tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can achieve better results with "Background Removal" by enlarging your images using the "Upscale" feature beforehand. The outcome will be sharper and more precise with an image that has a higher number of pixels to begin with.

## Replace Background

The **Replace background** feature provides a quick and easy way to replace the background behind the main subject of an image with a new one based on a prompt.

For example, the background of a studio photo featuring a perfume bottle can be replaced with a more visually appealing scene, such as cascading water.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fn2Td1GACxg5dYM897wah%2FR-BG%20Original%20image.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9a917dd9-a243-4780-9d7f-37ca5343320d" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure>

After clicking **Remove bg**, you’ll be prompted to describe the new background you’d like to apply to the image in the prompt box.

# Search

With Ideogram, you can search for your own images or those generated by other users that are publicly available, by searching for specific words that would have been used in the prompts.

Users with a paid subscription can search for publicly available images across the entire website, while free users can only search their own images.

The images matching your search from your own generated images will then be displayed in the image area right below. You can also switch between Public and Private (available with Plus subscription and above) to display images corresponding to that category without having to launch a new search.


# Upscale

The Upscale feature, available to users with a Basic subscription plan or higher, enlarges the resolution of your Ideogram-generated images, as well as those you’ve uploaded using the [Image Upload](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/image-upload) function (available with the Plus subscription plan or higher), by up to two times (up to 2x).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Upscale function will crop any image to the nearest possible aspect ratio from the default values shown in the table below. This includes both default and custom aspect ratios available in Ideogram v2.0.
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="165">Aspect Ratio</th><th>Final dimension in pixels</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>1:3</code></td><td>1024 x 3072</td></tr><tr><td><code>9:16</code></td><td>1440 x 2560</td></tr><tr><td><code>10:16</code></td><td>1536 x 2464</td></tr><tr><td><code>2:3</code></td><td>1536 x 2304</td></tr><tr><td><code>3:4</code></td><td>1536 x 2048</td></tr><tr><td><code>1:1</code></td><td>2048 x 2048</td></tr><tr><td><code>4:3</code></td><td>2048 x 1536</td></tr><tr><td><code>3:2</code></td><td>2304 x 1536</td></tr><tr><td><code>16:10</code></td><td>2464 x 1536</td></tr><tr><td><code>16:9</code></td><td>2560 x 1440</td></tr><tr><td><code>3:1</code></td><td>3072 x 1024</td></tr></tbody></table>

For example, if you upload an image that is 1500 pixels by 1500 pixels, which has an aspect ratio of 1:1, the upscale will result in a 2048 pixels by 2048 pixels image. Another example would be if you generate an image with a custom aspect ratio of 17:12 (1088 pixels x 768 pixels), the Upscale function will crop it to the nearest available aspect ratio, which is 3:2, and the final image will be 2304 pixels by 1536 pixels.

### 1- Resemblance

This parameter determines how closely you want the enlarged image to resemble the original. A value of 1 allows the AI more freedom to be creative with the image, which can be useful for correcting certain defects or enhancing specific details. On the other hand, a value of 100 will produce a result that is as close as possible to the original image while still enlarging it and maintaining optimal sharpness.

# Canvas & Editing


# Canvas


# Canvas Overview

## What is Canvas?

Ideogram **Canvas** is an infinite creative board designed for generating, editing, and organizing images. It’s the ideal workspace for projects involving multiple images, whether they’re generated directly within Ideogram or uploaded from your computer.

With Canvas, you can:

* **Upload your own images** by clicking Upload, using copy-paste or simply dragging in an image.
* **Edit images** using two new powerful tools:
  * **Magic Fill** (inpainting) to add or modify elements within an image.
  * **Extend** (outpainting) to expand your image beyond its original edges.
* **Generate** images using text prompts.
* **Remix** images and compositions.
* Add **Text** to your images.
* **Download** your final composition/work as an image.

## Rendering and Masking Options

Each generative function—**Generate**, **Remix**, **Magic** **Fill**, and **Extend**—offers different options. These options are either **Rendering options** or **Masking** **options**, depending on the selected tool and the progression of its usage.

### Rendering Options

When using a generative function, rendering options appear below the prompt box at the top of the canvas. If they are not visible, click the **Options** icon on the right side of the prompt box to reveal them.

## Working with Canvas

### Renaming the Canvas

By default, each new canvas is named “Untitled canvas.” or a name based on the beginning of the prompt from the image opened in **Canvas**. To rename it, click the canvas name at the top-left corner, next to the **Menu** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpEtJqrsaDujCKZvnYSIB%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2010.15.13%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ce87b280-7cf9-483c-ae11-c0364ab2bb4f" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FXsvdb3ilYp1AdXju7KMA%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2010.13.00%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0eafa398-16ad-4af6-87ef-63a5fbc61c39" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>, and enter your desired name.

## Understanding the Generation Window and Image Frames

### Generation Windows

**Generation windows** are bounding boxes used by the **Magic Fill**, **Extend**, **Remix** and **Download** functions to define the size, aspect ratio, and placement of the image to be generated or downloaded.

**Resizing generation windows**:

* **By corners**: Preserves the actual aspect ratio.
* **By sides**: Snaps to the nearest supported [aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratios-and-resolutions#defaults-aspect-ratios-and-sizes).&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FmLFfqlfbRGG6cyPVwzyU%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9d096858-3c39-407b-92fd-9d9e3e44526a" alt="" width="152"><figcaption><p>A generation window</p></figcaption></figure>

### Image Frames

**Image frames** are the containers that hold already generated images. Each generative function produces four images per prompt.&#x20;

* **Generate** and **Remix**: All four images are placed separately on the canvas, each in its own image frame.
* **Magic Fill** and **Extend**: These tools place one selected image on the canvas, maintaining the size and position of the generation window used.

### Switching Between Generated Images

1\. Make sure the Select tool is active in the left-side panel.

2\. Click on the desired image frame to display a the image panel below it.

3\. Use the arrows in the menu to scroll through the four generated images.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fk3iqgLRYZHEtFR5tKAsH%2FCanvas%20-%20Image%20Select.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=9cefa9f6-7e0d-4c41-bc4c-eb6db93213b3" alt="" width="262"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Image frames can be freely resized and repositioned on the canvas.

## How to Download Images

To download your final composite image, use the **Download** function, which works like an adjustable screen capture.

* Click on the **Download** button on the left-side panel.
* Alternatively, if you have activated the **Always show download outline** option, click the download icon at the top left of the inactive download generation window on your canvas.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaQspCjj7dL5zwlxOGce4%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d474395d-dacd-48c1-aba0-a871f0b9ea9e" alt="" width="237"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Resize and position the download generation window to capture the final image you wish to download.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FTEkhRn0rl83YsfIkTFIk%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f13bd11e-2c82-434a-af8a-63e4e85c3830" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>The download context frame placed and resized.</p></figcaption></figure>

* On the left side, near the Download icon, a small panel will appear with the final dimensions of the image. You can adjust the size by manually editing the width and height, then click the arrow next to the Download button to choose the image format (for highest quality PNG downloads, you'll need [Ideogram Basic or above](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans). Finally, click Download to save the image.

## Canvas and Image Sizes

Consider the following aspects regarding image sizes on the canvas:

* **Canvas grid**: The canvas has an underlying pixel grid, visible when zoomed in at 2000% or more.
* **Image placement**: When uploading or generating images, they will at first align with the canvas grid, with one pixel on the image equaling one pixel on the grid.
* **Generation window sizes**: When you use the Remix, Magic Fill, or Extend tool, the generation window will adopt one of the default predefined aspect ratios, each with a fixed pixel size. **The generated image will have this specific size, regardless of how you resize the context frame on the canvas.**
* **Image scaling**: Images retain their original width and height in pixels, even if resized on the canvas.
* **Download dimensions**: The Download tool uses the canvas grid to define the size of the image to be downloaded.

{% hint style="info" %}
The most common aspect ratios and their corresponding sizes can be found in the[Aspect Ratios & Resolutions](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratios-and-resolutions#defaults-aspect-ratios-and-sizes) section of the documentation.
{% endhint %}

### Example

Let's start with an image generated in Ideogram at a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024 x 1024 pixels):

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FhxvRxcRYWr2Miq07SIRu%2FMadame%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5f558654-2bb9-40b6-94db-846cfebd5747" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The original image to be modified.</p></figcaption></figure>

Sometimes, faces and hands can be distorted when they are small in size, as seen in the generated image above. In such cases, you can use **Magic Fill** to correct these imperfections.

Here's how to do it:

* Mask the head and hands using **Magic Fill**.
* Resize the generation window to be smaller than the original image but large enough to include a significant portion of the image. This ensures the AI has enough context to analyze the image and accurately interpret the prompt.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why make the generation window smaller?** Using a smaller generation window gives the AI more pixels relative to the original image, resulting in a higher pixel density for the selected area. This leads to more detailed faces and hands.

However, keep in mind that some of these details or the apparent sharpness may be lost during processing. This happens because everything is interpolated or extrapolated to fit the pixel grid on the canvas when downloading the resulting composite image. More details in this [section below](#a-note-on-final-image-quality).
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaTjJxrVZnjIqBS6Xtm42%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=603bef76-7a3a-4b55-abd5-b5c4702eb9de" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Masked areas and the small generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Adjust the prompt based on the content of the generation window:\
  `A photo of an elderly woman with white hair wearing a floral dress and a necklace. She is seated in a wooden chair in a dimly lit room. The background reveals lush green plants. The overall ambiance is warm and nostalgic.`
* Click **Magic Fill**.

Here is the final result after downloading the image:

## A Note on Final Image Quality

When downloading your composite image, it’s important to understand how scaling and pixel density affect the final output because the final image is based on the canvas’s pixel grid. This means that any images you’ve scaled up or down will not retain their original resolutions in the downloaded image. Enlarged images won’t have extra detail, and reduced images won’t keep their apparent increased sharpness.

### Simple Examples to Illustrate This

#### Example 1: Enlarging a small image or generating in a bigger generation window than the canvas grid

Suppose you place a small photo (say, 200 x 200 pixels) on the canvas and enlarge it to double its size (400 x 400 pixels):

* **On the canvas**: It looks bigger, filling more space.
* **When downloaded**: That part of the image may appear blurry or pixelated because enlarging doesn’t add new details; it just makes the existing ones bigger and less clear. The small photo doesn’t have enough detail to look good at a larger size. Essentially, it **will not** act like the [Upscale](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/upscale) function does.

#### Example 2: Shrinking a large image or generating in a smaller generation window than the canvas grid

Now, you place a large photo (800 x 800 pixels) and shrink it down to half its size (400 x 400 pixels):

* **On the canvas**: It looks smaller but very clear and possibly sharper than the ones around that were not resized.
* **When downloaded**: This area will loose its sharpness and some details because the grid will have to transform an image from 800 x 800 pixels to 400 x 400 pixels, loosing details in the process.&#x20;

**In simple terms**: The final image you download captures everything within the download area roughly as it appears when the canvas is viewed at 100% zoom, but the overall resolution is determined by the canvas grid.

**For best results**

* **Avoid excessive resizing**: Don’t enlarge small images too much or shrink large images significantly.
* **Use appropriate generation window sizes**: When generating images, try to use generation windows that are not overly big or small relative to the canvas' pixel grid. Try to reach a good balance when, for example, you are fixing defect part of an image by using a smaller generation window than the original image.


# Extend

Extend, also known as outpainting, lets you expand your image beyond its original edges. It can also modify existing parts of the image, similar to Magic Fill.

## How to Use Extend

{% hint style="info" %}
It is best to review the [Canvas](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview) page beforehand to gain a better understanding of its interface and various elements. This will help you more easily follow the steps in the examples shown below.
{% endhint %}

### Extending an Image

In the example below, the Extend function is used to generate a visual extension and add context that seamlessly blends around the main image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8ZEcu2wAnnflBzFn6Fvi%2FCookies%20-%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=86fb4586-e5ee-439b-ab61-77cd8dfb9208" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure>

Here's how to do it:

1. Open or import the image in Canvas.
2. Click the Extend button on the left-side panel.
3. Reposition and resize the Extend generation window around the original image, leaving empty space around it where you want to add to the original image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaDbTsCtTs2qib3OA1PJT%2FCookies%20-%20inpaint.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=e626255e-92c6-495a-bf8d-c5d75b092b3e" alt=""><figcaption><p>Placement of the original image within the frame and the empty space left around it.</p></figcaption></figure>

4. Write a detailed prompt containing all visual aspect of the final image you want.

Here's the prompt used: `A photo of a young boy holding a chocolate chip cookie beside a rustic kitchen table with a cookie jar full of cookies, a plate with two cookies and a glass of milk. He is wearing a white t-shirt and green overalls. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting with a neutral color palette.`

5. Adjust any additional options, like Style and Magic Prompt, as desired.
6. Click Extend to generate the images.
7. Once the process is complete, you can cycle through the four generated images by selecting the generated image and clicking the left or right arrow in the menu at the bottom of the image.

### Refining While Extending an Image

In this example, two modifications will be done at the same time:

* A man cutting vegetables will be added to the left side of the image.
* The glass of water will be changed into a cup of coffee.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FIL3fqLAebEhH8eeHqiO1%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1ad34626-69ef-47b2-b63d-7978e25abc95" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The original image to be modified.</p></figcaption></figure>

Here's how to do it:

1. Click the Extend button on the left-side panel.
2. Reposition and resize the Extend generation window to your liking, trying to keep the generation window as small as possible while keeping visual context for the AI to work with.
3. Mask the glass of water with the [Masking Tools](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#masking-options) to indicate it should be replaced in the generated image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F503eWkehLRC8m2jW8fSx%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7d80d533-e593-4150-bd32-cc5de7c07d96" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Enter a prompt that describes:
   1. The part overlapping the original image.
   2. What should be generated where the image will be extended.
   3. The changes to be made to the masked areas.

Prompt used: `A photo of a middle-aged woman with short hair holding a cup of hot coffee in a modern, white kitchen with wooden countertops. She is wearing a blue shirt and a necklace. A man is chopping vegetables on the counter beside her.`

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3PM6Wqf6ISiPWC7DC3bq%2FMadame%20Cafe%CC%81%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=606e130f-54cb-46d6-87ea-88f7c371b634" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FBk4sD7cd5zjIfnSLvlnp%2FMadame%20Cafe%CC%81%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8e8d4f07-750d-4947-8545-fd45e3867e5c" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5. Adjust any additional options as desired.
6. Click Extend to generate the images.
7. Select the image and use the arrows at the bottom to view all four generated options and choose the one you like.

## Advanced and Creative Examples

The Extend tool can be used creatively to achieve impressive results. The examples below demonstrate how using the tool in creative ways can lead to surprising outcomes. For example, you can take an image of an object and create a whole environment around it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The advanced techniques presented below sometimes push the tool to its limits. They are more about creative exploration and achieving good results can be challenging at times. Indeed, many factors influence the final rendering of the image like the prompt, the original image, the options used, etc.

Experimenting with prompts and different options is often essential, but even then, results may vary. If you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help in the [#prompt-w-friend](https://discord.com/channels/1106248220687994911/1145120589955223602) channel on our Discord server. Simply share your prompt, the generated image, and a brief description of the issue. Other users may be able to help you achieve better results.
{% endhint %}

### Generate Context Around an Object

In this example, a whole environment will be created around the image of a wine bottle.

Here's how to do it:

1. Upload or copy/paste your image in Canvas.
2. If possible, use the remove background tool to get a transparent background.
   1. Alternatively, you can mask out the areas around the object manually using the mask tools that will be available in the Extend tool after the next step.
3. Click the Extend tool on the left-side panel.
4. Reposition and resize the Extend generation window to your liking with the object inside the generation window.

5. Write a detailed prompt that describe the image to be generated in details. Prompt used: `A bottle of red wine labeled 'CASTLE CELLARS' is in a dimly lit room, featuring a wooden table and a candle. A glass of wine is near the bottle, and a cork is on the wooden surface. In the background, there are red and blue grapes. The label is embossed with intricate designs and the castle logo is prominently displayed in the center.`
6. Select the image and use the arrows at the bottom to view all four generated images and choose the one you like.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8J8SXAKIMq7F2z4oL3ye%2FWine%203b%20Final.png?alt=media&#x26;token=830669b5-8ed5-4fe3-a4bc-39945e7b5bc1" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The final image of the bottle integrated into the decor.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Same Subject in Another Image Style

In the example below, a woman in a photo will be transformed into a caricature.

Here's how:

1. Open, upload or copy/paste your image in Canvas.
   1. It might be a good idea to have a good description of that image. If a prompt or description isn't already available, use the Describe feature to get one provided by the AI. It will be used later.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FjzGtAuOqZ7f1h7cnTNyf%2FTransfo%201%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f02a1f41-68ff-4d1d-bfd2-b1fda5dd7d16" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. Click Extend then resize an position the generation window in a way where the original image will be on one side and the other side will be about the same size as the original image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FWR9yS6WTiGwdXHwbRFMW%2FTransfo%202%20Generation%20Window.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=23bccd72-301b-4312-8034-4f291991bdc8" alt=""><figcaption><p>The generation window adjusted to overlap the original image and extend on the right side.</p></figcaption></figure>

3. Write a detailed prompt that describe both the original image and the image you want to generate.

Prompt used: `On the left, a woman with long, wavy, light brown hair and glasses. On the right, a hand drawn funny caricature portraying the same woman.`

Style used: General

4. Select the image and use the arrows at the bottom to view all four generated images and choose the one you like.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FW4ACSEEPipZWcq7PlURY%2FTransfo%20Caricature.png?alt=media&#x26;token=58a0445e-1a00-494e-b70b-1af7a683dddf" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Final image as caricature.</p></figcaption></figure>

Here are other examples that were generated with the same technique, simply by changing the last part of the prompt and using appropriate style options.

## Tips and Tricks for Best Results

Achieving great results with **Magic Fill** and **Extend**, especially with advanced techniques, takes a mix of creativity, experimentation, and a bit of patience. Here are some key factors that can impact the final outcome:

* **Craft precise and detailed prompts** – Clarity in wording helps the AI understand what to generate.
* **Experiment with synonyms and rephrase** - Changing a few words or testing different ways of expressing the same idea in a prompt can make big difference.
* **Start with a high-quality image** – The better the input, the better the output.
* **Consider the complexity of the image** – Simpler modifications often yield more accurate results.
* **Optimize the generation window size** – Keeping it as small as possible while including enough context leads to sharper and more realistic outcomes.
* **Manage your expectations** – AI-generated results can vary, so refining your approach and testing different options is key to success.

By experimenting with different approaches, adjusting prompts, and fine-tuning generation settings, you can push the boundaries of what's possible and create stunning images.


# Generate & Remix

## Generate

The **Generate** function in **Canvas** works just like it does in the standard website UI. You provide a detailed description of what you want to see, adjust some options, and the AI generates four images based on your input.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxnV7dxqo75SDJqXjBSI6%2FMadame%20Cafe%CC%81%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4ecbc6d3-b6a8-4080-928b-aea561542050" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpMV7MUvBnztNgSBhGpq2%2FA%20photo%20of%20an%20elder%20man%20with%20a%20beard%20with%20a%20thou%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e3fa1a08-e1d8-48d2-8fc0-ad94b6956ea0" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>The available options when using Generate in Canvas.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Remix

The **Remix** function in **Canvas** is similar to the standard Remix but offers more flexibility. You can select a specific portion of an image or composition using the generation window and remix just that area.

#### Example

Suppose you want to create a close-up of a particular image, such as the face of a thinking man.

* Click the **Select** tool on the left-side panel.
* Use the generation window to adjust the bounding box around the part of the image you want to remix. You can change the size and aspect ratio.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F6cBmUxydhMX6mg79RUee%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2f5c208d-9de4-437d-823d-f0d01285affe" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>You can make a selection using the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Enter a prompt that describes the desired result and adjust the options to your liking. Modify the Image Weight slider as needed.

# Magic Fill

Magic Fill, also known as inpainting, allows you to modify a part of an image while keeping the rest intact.

Using Magic Fill is a simple two-step process:

1. Create a mask using the [**Masking Tools**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#masking-options) over the areas you want to modify.
2. Adjust the generation window and available options in the **Prompt box**, then click **Magic Fill**.

## How to Use Magic Fill

### Replacing and Adding an Element

In the example below, the glass of water will be replaced by a glass of milk while a watch will be added to her left wrist.

Here’s how:

1. Click the Magic Fill button on the left-side panel.
2. Using the [**Masking Tools**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#masking-options)**,** Mask the hand holding the glass of water and the area where the watch should be placed.

3. Click Next to access the Magic Fill options at the top of the canvas.
4. Adjust the generation window to include both masked areas and some surrounding image content for context. In this case, the whole image area was used.
5. Enter a prompt describing the scene and the desired modifications. In this example:\
   `A photo of a middle-aged woman with short hair holding a glass of milk in a modern, white kitchen with wooden countertops. She is wearing a blue shirt, a necklace and a watch...`

### Adding Elements

In the example below, an image of a rabbit was generated first in Ideogram as a starting image. Using Magic Fill, a basket of carrots is added in the background, and a carrot is placed in front of the rabbit.

Original prompt: `Photo of a rabbit in a beautiful garden.`&#x20;

Magic Fill prompt: `Photo of a rabbit in a beautiful garden. There is a basket with carrots in the background and a big carrot in front of the rabbit.`

### Making Variations on an Element

Magic Fill can also be used to create variations of specific details while keeping other elements unchanged

For example, a woman’s hair color can be altered without modifying her face or the rest of the image.

The prompt used to generate the original image was modified each time in Magic Fill to request a different hair color.

Original prompt: `A close-up three-quarter shot of a young woman with a sharp,`` `**`platinum blonde`**` ``pixie cut. She has icy blue eyes and a hit of a playful smirk. She has metallic earrings on her ears. The background is blurred and hints at a sleek, futuristic setting. She gazes directly at the camera with confidence.`

### Fixing Parts of an Image

Magic Fill is great for refining AI-generated images where small details like faces and hands may appear distorted due to the limited number of pixels.

Here’s how to easily fix those issues using Magic Fill.

Below is an image generated with Ideogram v2.0 using a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024 × 1024 pixels). The original prompt was: `A dynamic photo of a family standing on the lawn in front of a well-maintained house. The sky is clear with scattered clouds. Overlaying the top of the image, there's a text that reads 'Welcome' in a curvy font. The family consists of four members in that order: a young boy, a father, a mother and a teenager girl. The house in the background has a classic design with a gabled roof.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FV1piELRiQjaKr5g6d6eV%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e01b6855-7e47-4d5d-a4c1-723e5a8a6fe3" alt=""><figcaption><p>Original image generated with a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024 × 1024 pixels).</p></figcaption></figure>

Notice how the faces and hands appear very small in relation to the whole image. Because of this, the AI had difficulty rendering them correctly.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FwsPJM8q7xzzVa3ZplbU4%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png%20%40%20400%20(RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b269bedf-dade-4f19-95e9-97ad85610b31" alt=""><figcaption><p>400% zoomed-in detailed view.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FuHLpoGPd0XO92owvIRjS%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png%20%40%20400%20(RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=21e2e1d2-25dc-4106-bc7b-98087852a992" alt=""><figcaption><p>400% zoomed-in detailed view.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FIYuOqWU5bEgdNVQ7vOPg%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png%20%40%20400%20(RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=86a238b2-e2bc-4120-a87d-d00d2d22c6d0" alt=""><figcaption><p>400% zoomed-in detailed view.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

To fix this:

* Mask the areas that need correction.
* Adjust the generation window to be as small as possible, covering all masked areas while keeping some unmasked visual references to help the AI understand the context.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because the aspect ratio dictates the dimensions (in pixels) of the generated image, it can be leveraged to improve pixel density in specific areas. This technique is particularly useful for fixing small details that were not properly rendered in the original image.
{% endhint %}

In the example below, the generation window boundaries has a custom aspect ratio of 17:14, thus a dimension of 1088 × 986 pixels. The AI will have more pixels to work with for generating the faces and hands in masked areas.

The prompt was also simplified to reflect only the content within the generation window: `A dynamic photo of a family standing on the lawn in front of a well-maintained house. The family consists of four members in that order: a young boy, a father, a mother and a teenager girl.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FJu1l4QuakdQ0MAxAY2DP%2FA%20dynamic%20photo%20of%20a%20family%20standing%20on%20the%20lawn%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=be18e770-0fb8-4344-bfde-28a700d9c3ad" alt=""><figcaption><p>Masked areas to be generated. The generation window is kept as small as possible to achieve greater pixel density.</p></figcaption></figure>

The AI generated the updated image directly over the original, modifying only the masked parts while leaving the rest intact.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fegz5Rv7MeweRYK1gU8Zi%2FA%20dynamic%20photo%20of%20a%20family%20standing%20on%20the%20lawn%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8e119995-1b91-40e0-b683-a606202aff95" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

While the faces now look significantly better, there is still room for improvement—particularly for the father holding his son’s hand. To refine this further:

* Mask that specific part of the image again.
* Resize the generation window to be even smaller.
* Ensure the young boy is included in the generation window to provide the AI with proper proportions and context.

This time, the generation window was set to a 1:1 aspect ratio, meaning the newly generated section had a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FrsbfYoIgmM7HyJ63H9xZ%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%20intermediaire.png%20%40%20400%20(Layer%201%20RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d0d76e18-3759-4c36-98c7-1eb14f0183d8" alt=""><figcaption><p>The hands still require some adjustment.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FSVtFC9Uo760ZGoPWY39H%2FA%20dynamic%20photo%20of%20a%20family%20standing%20on%20the%20lawn%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=919dd91a-cb32-4a8a-b11e-180162bfbed4" alt=""><figcaption><p>The masked area and the small generation window. </p></figcaption></figure></div>

The final image below was downloaded using the Download feature. While the downloaded image retained a 1024 × 1024 resolution, areas with a higher pixel density were downscaled but still preserved the improvements made.

For more details on resolution and pixel density in Canvas, refer to the last two sections of the [Canvas documentation](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#canvas-and-image-sizes).

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FUx7Y8vOosjDf8o5pMmkg%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%20final.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0c73453d-9484-4445-acea-7a70cca5e5ec" alt=""><figcaption><p>The final image.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Getting even better results**

To further enhance image quality, consider using the Upscale feature before attempting any fixes. This will provide the AI with up to twice as many pixels to work with for the same selected area.

Keep in mind:

• The generation window has a fixed number of pixels based on its aspect ratio.

• If you upscale a 1:1 image (e.g., from 1024 × 1024 to 2048 × 2048), then use Magic Fill at a 1:1 aspect ratio (which generates a 1024 × 1024 image), it’s best to keep the generation window under half the size—both horizontally and vertically—of the upscaled image for optimal results.
{% endhint %}

## Advanced and Creative Examples

Magic Fill can be used creatively to achieve impressive results. The examples below demonstrate how pushing the limits of the tool can lead to surprising outcomes. For example, you can take an image of a product and seamlessly integrate it into another existing image.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The advanced techniques presented below sometimes push the tool to its limits. They are more about creative exploration and achieving good results can be challenging at times. Indeed, many factors influence the final rendering of the image like the prompt, the original image, the options used, etc.

Experimenting with prompts and different options is often essential, but even then, results may vary. If you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help in the [#prompt-w-friend](https://discord.com/channels/1106248220687994911/1145120589955223602) channel on our Discord server. Simply share your prompt, the generated image, and a brief description of the issue. Other users may be able to help you achieve better results.

### Inserting an Item from One Image into Another

In the example below, there is a photo of a decorative pillow with a geometric pattern and an image of a loveseat with some pillows in a living room. The goal is to modify the loveseat pillows so they match the design of the patterned pillow.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FbpfHOqDVlTqOEiQpAal7%2FUntitled%20Feb%2012%201156%20AM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=240c95bd-516f-48a7-85be-21e04bef6598" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FhDr3L9wKV0gy3jlQeXci%2FUntitled%20Feb%2012%201156%20AM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c4fef874-521b-497c-8257-cd841153d234" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

1. Obtain a good description of both images.
   1. These descriptions will later be merged and optimized into a single prompt.
   2. If the image was generated directly in Ideogram, you can reuse the original prompt.
   3. If not, it is strongly recommended to use the Describe feature to generate an accurate description.
2. Place the two images side by side and resize one if necessary.
3. Click Magic Fill and mask the pillows in the loveseat image.
4. Click Next and adjust the generation window to cover:
   1. The entire pillow with the geometric pattern image.
   2. The masked area and a sufficient portion of the loveseat image to provide proper context.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPIYmo0ymgyQrzHe7VzcF%2FUntitled%20Feb%2012%201156%20AM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e4e9f10d-b521-4434-ba18-73c8e0e6a8d7" alt=""><figcaption><p>The masked pillow on the right and the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

5. Merge and optimize the descriptions of both images:
   1. Description of the patterned pillow: `A decorative pillow with a geometric pattern. The primary color of the pillow is a soft and dark olive green, and the pattern consists of intertwined white lines forming intricate designs. The design appears symmetrical, with two mirrored patterns on either side of the pillow. The pillow is on a white background.`
   2. Prompt used to generate the loveseat image: `A close-up view of a cozy loveseat, without any pillow, in a modern living room. There are a few soft and dark olive green accents.`
   3. Merged and optimized prompt: **`On the left`**`, a decorative pillow with a geometric pattern. The primary color of the pillow is a soft and dark olive green, and the pattern consists of intertwined white lines forming intricate designs. The design appears symmetrical, with two mirrored patterns on either side of the pillow.`` `**`On the right`**`, a close-up view of a cozy loveseat with two pillows like the one on the left.`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why optimize the prompt?**

* The revised prompt removes unnecessary details and focuses on the most relevant elements for the AI.
* The pillow description is detailed since it is the main element being generated.
* The background context remains slightly less detailed, as long as it provides enough visual reference.
  {% endhint %}

6. Adjust other options such as Style and Magic Prompt (it is recommended not to use Magic Prompt, as it might alter your optimized prompt)
7. Click Magic Fill and wait for the generation to complete.
8. Once the image is generated, click on it to cycle through the four generated variations using the arrows at the bottom.

### Integrate Text and Logos in Images

It’s easy to overlay text on an image using the Text tool in Canvas, but seamlessly integrating text into the natural elements of an image can be more challenging.

In the example below, the goal is to make it look as if a message is handwritten in the sand on a beach.

Once a beach image is selected, the Text tool is used to choose a suitable font and position the text where it should appear in the final image.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxkOxl9ChMs6CV76rGypw%2FText%20on%20the%20beach%201.png?alt=media&#x26;token=20177f01-e03d-4374-8529-7b5b6e3f54bc" alt=""><figcaption><p>The original image.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FjN4VOcaPMob5GWGLrB3s%2FA%20close-up%20bird%20eye%20view%20of%20an%20undisturbed%20sandy%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d603ab43-f27a-460f-829e-29aab2ab124b" alt=""><figcaption><p>Positioning the text on the image.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

At this point, the text itself cannot be used directly to create the writing effect in the sand. Instead, follow these steps before proceeding to Magic Fill:

1. Move the text aside and make it completely black.
2. Use Remix on the text, setting the image weight to 100.\
   \&#xNAN;*This is necessary because a text box cannot be used directly in this technique—it must first be converted into an image.*
3. Place the newly created image near the beach image.

Now, apply the same technique used in the first example:

* Mask the area where the text should appear in the beach image.
* Adjust the Magic Fill generation window to include both the masked area and the black text image, ensuring the AI understands the reference.

Here's the prompt that was used:

**`On the left`**`, a text saying "Time for a little vacation?".`` `**`On the right`**`, the same text in the same style, roughly written by hand in the sand of an undisturbed sandy beach with seashells and other objects.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FHIiecse63rpLJXnbANKf%2FA%20close-up%20bird%20eye%20view%20of%20an%20undisturbed%20sandy%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=da608baf-750f-4add-a812-26733121c1f8" alt=""><figcaption><p>The rendered text on the left and the masked area on the right, both encompassed within the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important notes**

The final image may appear more blurry or pixelated compared to the original. This happens because the Magic Fill-generated section is often about twice the size of the original image.

**Why does this happen?**

The total number of pixels remains constant for any aspect ratio, regardless of the generation window size on the canvas. This is a current limitation of this technique.

However, to achieve the best possible results, consider the following:

* Minimize the generation window
  * Keep it as small as possible while maintaining enough visual context for the AI.
* Reduce the size of the reference text or object
  * The AI can work with a smaller image as long as the prompt description is detailed enough.
  * Reducing the reference image by half often works just as well while helping shrink the generation window.
* Use the Upscale feature on the final image
  * Upscale makes the image larger and sharper.
  * Don’t forget to provide a detailed prompt when using Upscale for the best results.
    {% endhint %}

Here’s another example where text was integrated as embroidery on a baseball cap using the same technique.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FiZcIYxwqGcnDcIToaHdj%2FBaseball%20word.png?alt=media&#x26;token=455433b1-8ce5-4c5d-8ea9-9b1ac965b8b6" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The word ‘Baseball’ in Lobster font and rendered using Remix.</p></figcaption></figure>

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FdH98BH4oR8BTwvrfXLci%2FBaseball%201.png?alt=media&#x26;token=642ace3e-9edf-433f-9bcf-5d20e59c2b63" alt=""><figcaption><p>Original baseball cap image.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FmBJ7kgw71uRa9tytXdNm%2FBaseball%202.png?alt=media&#x26;token=623a28f6-ff78-4ad2-b0c8-465b8aaaf440" alt=""><figcaption><p>Result after Magic Fill.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Here's the prompt that was used: **`On the right`**`, the word "Baseball" written in a bold script font.`` `**`On the left`**`, the same word and font style than the one on the right but embroidered in red on the front of a baseball cap.`

Finally, using the same technique, it’s easy to integrate a logo onto an object.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FL3r3E1PIO7xx2KgoQSl2%2FIron%20Helm%20logo.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6bba763b-5737-441f-b086-1f6f98172a12" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The original logo.</p></figcaption></figure>

Here's the prompt used for the example above: **`On the left`**`, logo for a brand of beer named "Iron Helm". At the center of the logo is a detailed illustration of a knight's helmet, which appears to be made of metal with rivets and a nose guard. The helmet is depicted in a frontal view. The logo is enclosed within a shield-like emblem, which is predominantly dark red and white.`` `**`On the right`**`, the exact same logo on a glass of beer.`

### Product Placement

In this example, a perfume bottle from a photo will be integrated into two different scenes:

1. A studio photography setup.
2. An image where a woman holds the bottle.

The original image of the perfume bottle was generated in Ideogram, but any image could be used. There is no need to remove the background, as long as the image isn’t cluttered with other objects.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FJZd75BZAH2mCt0Styr3F%2FProduct%201%20-%20Bottle.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9e52dde7-4e85-4b28-ba61-95461b313421" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image to be integrated, generated with Ideogram.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Integrating the perfume bottle into a studio setup

Using the same technique as described in the previous examples:

* An area was masked where the bottle should be integrated.
* A part of a plate was also masked, allowing the AI to transform it into a more suitable pedestal, which it successfully did.

The perfume bottle image was placed on the left side of the studio setup image, and the generation window was made as small as possible while keeping some context.

Prompt used: **`To the left`**`, a perfume bottle for women named 'Azure' stands out prominently. The bottle has a gem-like, faceted design, predominantly blue with a silver cap and a black neck. The word 'AZURE' is prominently displayed on both the bottle and the neck.`` `**`On the right`**`, a close-up view of the same bottle is captured, placed atop a short white pedestal in a studio photography setup.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FzZWxEvsBmx6ym6oErW3K%2FProduct%20placement%20%20-%20Studio%20mask.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=0b3ee674-bc4f-4001-9542-ad7b16d5ed4f" alt=""><figcaption><p>Masked areas and generation window size</p></figcaption></figure>

Note the subtle shadow and reflection.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

#### Integrating the perfume bottle into a lifestyle scene

For the next integration, an image of a woman holding a perfume bottle was generated in Ideogram. The goal was to create a suitable scene for integration.

As before:

* The perfume bottle image was placed to the left of the woman’s image.
* The affected areas (her hands and the existing bottle) were masked.
* The generation window was made as small as possible while keeping enough context for the AI, including part of the face and the base of the hands.

Prompt used: **`On the left`**`, a woman’s perfume bottle named 'Azure' features a unique, faceted design. The bottle is predominantly blue, with a silver cap and a black neck. The word 'AZURE' is prominently displayed on both the bottle and the neck.`` `**`On the right`**`, a chic woman holds the very same bottle of perfume.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FIidht8HzxwepdRsDWlWH%2FProduct%20placement%20-%20Woman%20mask.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=aa0ca827-f1ad-4482-9813-ec47e17b4a06" alt=""><figcaption><p>Masked areas and generation window size.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Tips and Tricks for Best Results

Achieving great results with **Magic Fill** and **Extend**, especially with advanced techniques, takes a mix of creativity, experimentation, and a bit of patience. Here are some key factors that can impact the final outcome:

* **Craft precise and detailed prompts** – Clarity in wording helps the AI understand what to generate.
* **Experiment with synonyms and rephrase** - Changing a few words or testing different ways of expressing the same idea in a prompt can make big difference.
* **Start with a high-quality image** – The better the input, the better the output.
* **Consider the complexity of the image** – Simpler modifications often yield more accurate results.
* **Optimize the generation window size** – Keeping it as small as possible while including enough context leads to sharper and more realistic outcomes.
* **Manage your expectations** – AI-generated results can vary, so refining your approach and testing different options is key to success.

By experimenting with different approaches, adjusting prompts, and fine-tuning generation settings, you can push the boundaries of what's possible and create stunning images.


# Text Tool

Part of the [Canvas](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview) feature, feature, the text tool adds text to an image or a composition on the canvas. Depending on how you use the feature—by writing, remixing, etc.—it might be really useful to:

1. Write formatted text the way you want, without any errors.
2. Get a specific typography style.
3. Replace/add text when it is not possible to do so via a prompt.
4. Add text in Ideogram rather than having to switch to another third-party app.
5. And more...

## Writing Text

1. While in Canvas, click the **Text tool** icon in the left-side panel.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FBYre95OACCfJlsg225dv%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=337eafe1-5c45-4387-b82a-2dc93e0f0269" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FlIL5jKEpOzlXulv6fXWq%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d11a42f0-2b73-4f2b-ba41-4c8e12155dac" alt="" width="96"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Click on the canvas to place the text at that position. A text box will then be placed on the canvas with a placeholder text already selected.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpAbb2MS8hg6vJw7fxd3f%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=17b854a5-82f9-4bf1-8bb0-48bbc6056643" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Type in the text you want to write.

## Text Options

When the text box is selected you get access to different options in the right-side panel.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7kbfcDU5MpyJwHL4kZQB%2FPhoto%20of%20a%20rabbit%20in%20a%20garden%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4d5c0bf3-9100-4932-bec3-6f3ca030a0af" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F31m1mUnHOsEH6mcvGm87%2FPhoto%20of%20a%20rabbit%20in%20a%20garden%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=183b9e0d-fa72-4596-99cd-f9ac46094308" alt="" width="366"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These options will enable you to:

* Select the font you want from a pop-up menu.
* Adjust the size of the text.
* Choose the font weight if different weights are available.
* Apply bold and italic text formatting.
* Align the text.
* Choose or change the color of the text.
* Arrange the text box relative to other elements: Bring to front/forward, Send to back/backward.

Most of these options can be applied to the whole text box at once or to specific words or letters.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FJeTPplBpZruRiKMuSaJA%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b87c923d-3001-4d54-b31e-aa11c401ba81" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of different colors and font weight applied on text.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Example

Of course, it would be easy to add text to an image using the Text tool. However, let’s explore a way to use it more creatively.

1. Generate or upload an image in [Canvas](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview). It’s important to have either the prompt used to generate the image or to run the Describe function on an uploaded image to get a suitable starting prompt.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FFvT2L2tWv7Hkbr1NX5II%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7134cbf3-6af5-4600-9ecf-e3f0b68fdbda" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. With the Type tool, write the text you want to appear. Choose your preferred font and adjust the size and color to your liking.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FhZdTjdmz9e7KvEL9G7Yt%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ceba4661-50d4-447f-b947-c4a29ac55976" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Use the Remix tool and adjust the generation window exactly over the originale image and text.

Here are the settings used to create the two images below:

**Prompt**: *A photo of a plain, dull dark blue baseball cap. The text: "Baseball" is embroidered in tan color on the front. The cap is placed on a wooden surface. The background is clean and neutral.*\
**Image weight**: 60-70/100 (your value may vary)\
**Style**: General\
**Magic Prompt**: Off\
**Color**: Auto

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FWz4UDzj3yESBjprucj2U%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=dad2fef7-dbb8-413e-8128-dc4a38b972d9" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FGeEa8qdQjDcgGWRnouLO%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=300fa854-a4a9-4b0a-8193-feb46114698b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Because this technique uses Remix, the generated image is expected to be slightly different from the original. However, it has the advantage of maintaining a font style very similar to the original without requiring a detailed description. Additionally, it realistically makes the design appear embroidered on the baseball cap.


# Editor

With Ideogram’s Editor feature, you can modify an image as you see fit, including cropping, resizing, tweaking, and making adjustments that will be considered along with your prompt the next time you remix it. You can even use it to design, from scratch, the visual composition of the image you want to achieve.

## Examples

### Draw an Image from Scratch

You can use the editor to create any image from scratch and let Ideogram generate an enhanced version based on your drawing and prompt.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FCUFRnwnCphxUzuO8TGxB%2F01%20-%20Sketch.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e3ddd70f-2121-4ce9-a183-fb1b076ec542" alt=""><figcaption><p>Basic drawing representing the subject, colour and composition of the elements of the prompt.</p></figcaption></figure>

Once the drawing is complete and saved, simply run a remix on it using a suitable prompt to describe what you want in the final image.

**Prompt:** *Illustration of a frog on a country road at sunset.* \
**Model**: Ideogram version 2.0 \
**Remixed image weight** of 45/100\
**Magic Prompt**: Off\
**Style**: General\
**Rendering**: Default

Result:

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FRJ44mgYZDRKcNNqQEtCH%2F02-Frog.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4df18062-729f-4705-be27-f7d3e93bc563" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Remove Unwanted Elements

You can remove unwanted elements from the image by using the pen tool and selecting the background color. In this example, the placeholder text on the menu design was removed, leaving space for a blank copywriting area.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FiYOluErQSkfTz3ezpK3P%2F04-menu.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3cba536a-72a2-411a-b2f3-96571d998cc0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fkes5ij7zkJWGUyzAPvNg%2F05-menu%20edited.png?alt=media&#x26;token=36cd6e70-8288-4c52-83ef-9696979754a9" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

In this case, the little spots around the pets were removed and a little patch of gold/brown removed from the dog's fur.

# Image Upload

Available to users on the Ideogram Plus plan and higher, the Image Upload feature allows you to upload your own images to Ideogram and use them in various ways.

## Uploading an Image

You can upload an image by simply pasting it into the prompt area or by clicking on the **Image upload** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxCWWXQ3us4HjDU254i1b%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6ef0042e-3762-4252-a6cd-737894de06a7" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0dn1LcMqBKWVY0MwqYUI%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a158fb11-b7b1-4e12-9279-9f8036129273" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> located on the right side of the prompt box. You can also upload images in **Canvas** as described [here](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas/canvas-overview#uploading-external-images).

{% hint style="info" %}
Uploaded images are private and can be found in the "Creations" section of the website or in the "Private" section of your profile page.
{% endhint %}

You will then be presented with three options:

1. [**Describe**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe): This option will use AI to generate a description of your image and use it as a prompt without retaining the original image.
2. [**Remix**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix): This option will also describe the uploaded image but will retain the image as a base for generating the new one.
3. [**Upscale**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/upscale): This option is used to enhance your image to a higher resolution.
4. **Style reference**: Use the image as a style reference when generating images.
5. Open in [**Canvas**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview): Open image in Canvas. You can alternatively click on the down arrow to:
   1. Select [**Magic Fill**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) to set-up Magic Fill with the image in Canvas.
   2. Select [**Extend**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/extend) to use Extend with the image in Canvas.
6. [**Remove bg**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/replace-remove-background): This option will remove the background from the main subject of the image.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FTO8sVJHwj93khBYls0Iw%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a1cc7afe-71fb-481d-abdb-3a99075d2431" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FTlgpSmymILapD5qsACo1%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e6c28925-da68-40c7-bb84-e0ba7b32b365" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this example, we will choose the **Remix** option.&#x20;

Selecting the [**Remix**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) option keeps the image in the prompt area, allowing it to be used as a base for the next remixed image. Additionally, the AI automatically provides a description of your image by using the [**Describe**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) function, which can serve as the starting point for your prompt.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fxn5aMj3cQhVIZP4Hgc3P%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=dae61dc3-e5db-4a07-91cc-dd5dc1cacaf3" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FP0X6xnw7k1zTAqJr2JBO%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=093ba66c-7e3a-4e63-8901-3f1248c911e5" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>The prompt box once you have chosen and ajusted the Remix option.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note a notification at the top of the prompt might appear when your image doesn't have a dimension similar to a default aspect ratio. It will indicate that your image will be automatically cropped to the nearest supported aspect ratio in Ideogram. If you wish to adjust the image manually before remixing, consider using the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor).
{% endhint %}

Once you have adjusted all the parameters and the prompt to your liking, simply press the "Remix" button to generate the image.

In this example, the prompt was modified to reflect the desired image and used in conjunction with the [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) feature to produce the result shown in the image below.

Titles are awarded to users based on [a number of metrics](#metrics-used). In order to be eligible for a title, you must have logged in recently, and produced images that align with our [<mark style="color:blue;">Terms of Service</mark>](https://ideogram.ai/tos).

When a user has a title, their profile image will be outlined with the colour (gold, silver or bronze) and the title will be displayed in their profile.

### Metrics Used

The metrics used to determine how titles are awarded include, but are not limited to:

* Total number of generations created
* Total number of distinct users that liked your generations
* Total number of followers
* Total number of times your generations have been remixed by other users

These metrics are computed on a weekly basis, and titles are assigned to the top users in each category for one week.

### Perks

By default, users on the free plan have 10 [Slow credits](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans#slow-credits) per week. When you have a title, this number increases:

<table><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Number of Slow credits / Week</th><th data-hidden>Number of Generations</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elite Creator</td><td>500</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Top Creator</td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leading Creator</td><td>100</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The [Slow credits](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans#slow-credits) associated with users who have earned a Creator title reset every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (overnight from Friday to Saturday).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a Plus plan and up, these titles won't matter much, as you already have an unlimited number of standard generations.
{% endhint %}


# Muting Other Users

We're committed to making Ideogram a safe and relaxing experience for everyone. If you don't want to see someone's images and notifications in your feed, you can mute them. They will not be notified that they have been muted by you.

## Muting a Creator

There are three methods to access this feature:

1. **When viewing a user profile page.**

When you're on a user's profile page, click the menu icon  <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQv2bkEyP7H3Ox3wbdrXJ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ddf39952-d74d-4c02-854d-3bbb2ebf5637" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> , then then click "Mute creator" within the menu.

Ideogram uses a credit system for all generations in all available templates and will depend on certain parameters used, such as [Rendering](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed), when generating images.

Ideogram uses a credit system for all image generations. The credit cost depends on various parameters, such as the Rendering setting, which determines the level of detail when generating images. Below are the details:

### Credit Costs

*The* [***Describe***](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) *feature cost 1 credit for users on the free tier* but is free for all paid subscriptions. *The* [***Batch Generation***](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/batch-generation) *tool will only use Priority credits to generate images, based on the selected model and Rendering option above.*

{% hint style="info" %}
The [**Rendering**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed) setting allows you to specify how much time the AI should dedicate to working on an image, which affects the level of detail in the final result.
{% endhint %}

### **Priority Credits**

Generations made with **Priority credits** are processed ahead of those made with Slow credits, ensuring minimal to no wait times. Certain tools, such as Batch Generation, exclusively use Priority credits.

### **Slow Credits**

Generations that are made with **Slow credits** may have wait times of up to several minutes, depending on 1- available server capacity and 2- your recent usage of the slow queue since the last billing date. This is to ensure a fair experience for all users in the slow queue.

{% hint style="danger" %} <mark style="color:red;">Any unused Priority credits awarded through the monthly plan will expire at the end of each monthly billing cycle</mark>. However, **Priority credits** purchased as a top-up will roll over to the next month and will only be used after your monthly **Priority credits** are depleted.

If you cancel your subscription, any unused credits will expire at the end of the current billing period. The same applies to **Slow credits** for Basic plan subscribers.
{% endhint %}

## Priority Credits Top-Up

When you exhaust your monthly allocation of Priority credits, you automatically switch to using Slow credits. If you wish, you can get more Priority credits by purchasing a Priority credits top-up.&#x20;

#### Benefits:

* Top-up credit packs cost $4 USD each. One pack adds 100 credits to Basic, 150 credits to Plus, or 250 credits to Pro/Team, making the cost per credit lowest for Pro/Team users. You may purchase up to 10 packs per transaction.
* Any unused **Priority credits** purchased via a top-up will roll over to the following month and will only be used if you exhaust your monthly Priority credits. These rolled-over credits will continue to carry over month-to-month until they are fully used.

#### Usage order:

Credits will be used in the following order:

Monthly Priority credits  >  Top-up Priority credits  >  Slow credits

#### How to Purchase Top-Up Priority Credits

1. Open the **Profile panel** by clicking your **Profile icon** located at the bottom of the left-side panel of the page.
2. Click on **Top up credits.**

# Team Plan

The **Team** subscription is extremely useful for sharing access to Ideogram with others. Whether it’s for family members, a few partners, or an entire production team, a Team plan enables one paid account to provide access to multiple users.&#x20;

## Overview

Here are some features of the Team subscription:

* **Centralized billing and administration** for multiple members under a single team account.
* **1,500 Priority credits per month** per member.
* Add Priority credits to members with **Top up credits**.
* **Unlimited slow credits** for every member.
* **Full access to all premium features** for you and your team.
* Full access to the **Batch Generation** feature.
* **Add or remove** **team members** as needed.
* And more...

## Team Owner

The **Team owner** is the user who created the team and manages its subscription. They have full control over team settings, including inviting and removing members, allocating more Priority credits to members through the **Top-up credits** feature, and overseeing team activity. The **Team owner** operates under a single account tied to the team subscription and does not have the option to switch to a personal account like the other members of the team.

### Managing the Team

Selecting **Manage team subscription** from the Profile menu, will lead to the team's page similar to the one below. This is where you will be able to do all the management of the team.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FoAOowcX0FaSc9G8zD6TK%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=fd7f7935-0a3f-4e31-ba2e-e780b0cfc3fe" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqukObBISjNk55fDu1DzI%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4533c0ee-7eaf-46fe-8f7e-ea4c5452d551" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>The Manage team subscription page.</p></figcaption></figure>

On the team's page, you will be able to:

1. **Set or change** your team's name and icon.
2. **View** and **manage** your subscription and billing.
3. **Manage** your team members.
   1. Invite members to join the team.
   2. Top up members' credits if necessary.
   3. Remove members from the team.

### Managing Billing

To manage the billing of the Team subscription, navigate to the Team’s page by clicking your **Profile icon** located at the bottom of the left-side panel and selecting **Manage team subscription.** From there, click on the **Manage Billing** button to access the billing information for the account.

### Inviting New Members

1. Click on **Invite members** on the team's page. An invite modal window will appear like the example below.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FciXvtKK4qUTMLYOvF52t%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=933a0464-1d65-4f71-bd9c-a91cc2b0a8f5" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fyc7oA34C61GDah0Fxdq4%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=50cdbf1b-6f89-4e85-94ff-c3c5d169865b" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>The modal window to invite new members to your team.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. You can invite a member in two ways:
   1. **By username**
      1. The username is the unique identifier for a person on Ideogram. It appears at the top when you click on your profile icon. As you enter the username, a list of user accounts may appear—ensure you select the correct one before sending the invitation. The person will receive an email and a notification in Ideogram, inviting them to join your team as a member.
   2. **By email**
      1. If the person is already on Ideogram and the email you specified to invite them is already associated with their account (via Google or Apple), they will receive **both an email and a notification** inviting them to join your team.
      2. If the person **is not** yet on Ideogram, they will receive **an email** inviting them to create an account (using Google or Apple) before joining your team.
3. Once the invitation is sent, a new row will appear in the member list with the status “Pending”, indicating that the person has not yet joined.
4. At the moment a member joins the team, they will immediately have all the privileges of team membership, **and the Team account will be charged for an additional member**.

### Managing Team Members

To top up credits for a particular member or remove a member from your team, click on the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> located at the right end of the member's row.

1. Select **Top up credits** to buy **Priority credits** for that member.
2. Choose **Remove from team** to remove a member from your team.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When **removing a member** from the team, <mark style="color:red;">**you will not receive any reimbursement**</mark> for unused credits or time remaining on the subscription.

**Re-inviting** the same user again <mark style="color:red;">**will incur a new charge**</mark> on the subscription.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing Your Team Members Images

Click on a team member’s name to access their profile page. To view images generated by that team member, they must set the image to public, allowing it to appear in the "All tab. They can also pin the image to make them appear in the "Pin" tab, as a mean of image management.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recognize the importance of sharing within the team while not making the image public. The Ideogram the team is working towards solutions to allow that.
{% endhint %}

***

## Team Members

Team members are users who have been invited to a team by the team owner. They receive a set amount of credits and full access to all premium features to generate images. Team members can make their images available for the team to view by setting them to public. They can also pin images for better organization and management within their profile.

### Being Invited

To join the team, they simply need to click the “Join Team” button in the email or select “Accept” in the notification.

### Personal Space vs Team Space

Members of a team can switch between their personal space and the team’s space when generating images. Once selected, the credits used to generate images will be deducted from the chosen account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **Team owner** operates under a single account tied to the team subscription and does not have the option to switch to a personal space like the other members of the team.
{% endhint %}

To switch between spaces, simply click on your profile icon, then select either your team’s name or “Personal” to choose the account you want to use. In the example below, the member also has a personal Plus subscription. Note how the number of Priority credits differs between the team space and the personal space.

A quick way to check which space you are currently using is to look at your profile icon. If it contains a square with the first letter of your team’s name, then you are using the team space. Otherwise, you are in your personal space.

## Generating Images

Generating images with a team account is the very same as generating images with a personal account. The only differences are:

* You are using your Team's account credits instead of your own.
* You'll have to make the images public so the other members can see them.


# Ideogram API

The Ideogram API offers powerful image generation and editing capabilities for developers and businesses looking to integrate Ideogram into their applications.

Read our API Docs to learn more: <https://developer.ideogram.ai>

Review API pricing here: <https://about.ideogram.ai/api-pricing>

## Signup&#x20;

To set up or access the Ideogram API, you first need to log in to your [Ideogram user account](https://ideogram.ai/). If you don’t have an account, you can easily create one by following [these steps](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/signup-and-registration).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Ideogram user subscriptions and API accounts are separate, each with its own payment system. Please note that you must log in to your Ideogram user account (which can be a free account) to set up or access your API account.
{% endhint %}

Once logged in, click your **Profile icon**, located at the bottom of the left-side panel, to access the **Profile panel** and then select **API Beta**.

You will need then need to accept the [Developer API Agreement and Policy](https://about.ideogram.ai/api-tos) to proceed.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FFhklauRSbOOcsVT1FMww%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.08.10%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f1b32de0-1d40-468f-a0f5-23a2ce76079e" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FNqKKsbxxvMnTdJ3vmqdU%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.07.52%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=154e0451-1d34-4fee-babf-2ebdec7da226" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>You need to accept the Developer API Agreement and Policy before continuing with the signup process.</p></figcaption></figure>

After accepting the agreement, you will be directed to the API dashboard. Select the "Manage Payment" button in the lower left corner to add your payment information, which will be linked and used to fund your API credit balance.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Foz4tNLFh3SlFhfnoyjPa%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.25.21%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=57a43ff1-e0c0-478d-b7fe-82d673c5b766" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPbnGKbP05kFlDq62oVo5%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.25.04%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=cd264005-941b-4ec4-b651-fcea9e734074" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, choose whether you are using the API for personal or business purposes.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FcC6lWLl9eRaY9TIpqljZ%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2010.40.39%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eef13563-92d6-4b5c-a1e2-eda739686744" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FMCs8DBTq2R8qLmPeeLy5%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2010.40.25%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=79df00b0-f849-4095-a2db-4f296d292f45" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will then be forwarded to the payment page, where you will need to provide all necessary payment information. You will only be charged when you create your first API key.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FtydERQ4FMjjFKdT2w1p6%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2010.59.40%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d498c328-a22a-4e4b-ae3b-4dd483fbb3c8" alt=""><figcaption><p>Provide all payment information here.

## Generating an API Key

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT**:\
• The full API key <mark style="color:red;">**will only be shown to you once**</mark>, at the time of its creation. You need to store it in a safe place immediately, as it will not be displayed again afterward.

• Generating the API key may take some time. Please <mark style="color:red;">**do not refresh or close the window**</mark> until the process is complete.
{% endhint %}

At this point, you will be ready to create your first API key, which will trigger an initial funding that will be added to your balance. As you use the API, funds will be deducted from your credit balance based on our [API pricing](https://about.ideogram.ai/api-pricing). Your balance will automatically top-up to a predetermined value when it drops below a certain threshold. In the example image below, the Top-up Balance is $20.00 and the Minimum Balance Threshold is $10.00.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7eBjqFOrDrG622QFTPYJ%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2011.17.34%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7105bee2-371e-4e0b-b92e-072e3aa7b965" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FBwAYCvHrkXeFtIAhLorD%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2011.14.57%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a714a663-19b3-44d8-a1e4-f3592e89ed6e" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can now click the "Create API key" button to generate your first API key, which will allow you to integrate Ideogram into your applications. You may create multiple API keys, and all  keys you generate will be billed under the same plan.

Once created, the keys will appear as partial keys, displaying only the first few characters as a security measure. They will appear as shown in the image below.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FdVcYlMPIwVKqEYEu6pX0%2FAPI%20Keys%20-%20Dark.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d8ce0b86-8b9e-4d3b-a9ef-a090fdc571a7" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FUUDoxRByuyuZDPRMrn2T%2FAPI%20Keys%20-%20Light.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5d80ad27-186a-4ded-8e74-e52f9730e120" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>This is how generated API keys appear in the Manage API </p></figcaption></figure>

You can click "Manage payment", located near the bottom of the API management window, at any time to update your linked payment information or billing details.

## Adjusting the Top-Up Balance and Threshold

You can adjust the minimum balance that triggers an automatic top-up. Additionally, you can set the account balance level that you want your automatic top-up to bring you to. By default, the minimum balance threshold is $10 and the top-up balance is $20. To adjust these values, click the Edit button and enter your desired amounts in the respective fields. Then, click Save to confirm your changes.

After that modification, every time the balance dips to $5.00 or below, it will automatically top-up to the predetermined amount of $80.00.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The minimum balance threshold must be above $2.00 and the top up balance must be above $10.00.
