Integrations allow you to combine separate applications and take advantage of their combined capabilities. Automation of these online processes increases your productivity. That's why we made Apify in a way that allows you to connect it with practically any cloud service or web app and make it part of your larger projects.

If you are building a service and your users could benefit from integrating with Apify or vice-versa then read the https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/integrate.md.

## Built-in integrations

Apify‘s RESTful API allows you to interact with the platform programmatically. HTTP webhooks notify you and your services when important events happen. By using the API, you can start Actors, retrieve their results, or basically do anything you can do on a platform UI

Apify offers easy-to-set-up solutions for common scenarios, like uploading your datasets to Google Drive when the run succeeds or creating an issue on GitHub when it fails.
