## Getting Started with Deployment Testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your data connection">
    To get started, first set up your [data connection](https://docs.datafold.com/integrations/databases) to ensure that Datafold can access and monitor your data sources.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate with code repositories">
    Next, integrate Datafold with your version control system by following the instructions for [code repositories](https://docs.datafold.com/integrations/code-repositories). This allows Datafold to track and test changes in your data pipelines.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Datafold to your CI pipeline">
    Add Datafold to your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to enable automated deployment testing. You can do this through our universal [Fully-Automated](../deployment-testing/getting-started/universal/fully-automated), [No-Code](../deployment-testing/getting-started/universal/no-code), [API](../deployment-testing/getting-started/universal/api), or [dbt](../integrations/orchestrators) integrations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: Connect data apps">
    Optionally, you can [connect data apps](https://docs.datafold.com/integrations/bi_data_apps) to extend your testing and monitoring to data applications like BI tools.
  </Step>
