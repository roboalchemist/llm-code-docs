## Integrations Page Overview

The Integrations page allows you to connect and manage external services with Giselle. Currently, GitHub integration is supported, enabling access to GitHub repositories and management of GitHub App installations.

## GitHub Integration

### Connecting Your GitHub Account

To set up GitHub integration for the first time:

1. Click the **Configure GitHub App** button on the Integrations page
2. Navigate to the [account authentication page](/en/guides/settings/account/authentication)
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate your GitHub account

<Note>
  When your GitHub account is not connected, you'll see "Not connected" displayed with a "Configure GitHub App" button.
</Note>

### GitHub App Installation

The GitHub App is required for Giselle to access your GitHub repositories.

#### New Installation

1. Click **Add Giselle's GitHub App** or **Configure Giselle's GitHub App** button on the Integrations page
2. A popup window will open with the GitHub installation page
3. Select where to install (personal account or organization)
4. Choose which repositories to grant access to:
   * All repositories
   * Only select repositories
5. Click **Install** to complete the installation
6. The popup window will close automatically and the page will refresh

#### Managing Installations

The Integrations page displays installed GitHub Apps in the following format:

* **Login status**: Displayed as "Logged in as (@username)"
* **Installation cards**: A card is displayed for each installation
  * Account/organization name where installed
  * Avatar image
  * List of accessible repositories
  * Repository visibility status (Private/Public badge)
  * Links to repositories (opens in GitHub)

<Warning>
  Each installation can retrieve up to 100 repositories. A warning will be displayed if the limit is exceeded.
</Warning>

### Authentication Status and Troubleshooting

#### Authentication Error

When your GitHub authentication token is expired or invalid, an "Authentication Error" will be displayed. In this case:

1. Review the displayed error message
2. Re-authenticate via the [account authentication page](/en/guides/settings/account/authentication)

#### Automatic Token Refresh

Giselle automatically refreshes your GitHub access tokens:

* Automatically checks token expiration
* Uses refresh tokens to auto-renew before expiration
* Displays an error if refresh fails

### Uninstalling GitHub App

To uninstall the GitHub App, use the GitHub settings:

1. Open your GitHub account settings
2. Navigate to **Settings > Applications > Installed GitHub Apps**
3. Find "Giselle"
4. Click **Uninstall** in the Danger Zone section

<Warning>
  Uninstalling the GitHub App will immediately revoke all access permissions from Giselle to those repositories. Related workflows and triggers may stop functioning.
</Warning>

### Disconnecting GitHub Account

To disconnect your GitHub account itself:

1. Navigate to the [account authentication page](/en/guides/settings/account/authentication)
2. Follow the disconnection steps

<Note>
  You can only disconnect your GitHub account if you have multiple authentication methods configured. The last authentication method cannot be removed.
</Note>

## Permissions and Access Control

### Team Member Access

* The Integrations page is accessible to all team members
* GitHub App installations are shared across the entire team
* Team members can access repositories selected in each installation

### GitHub App Permissions

The GitHub App has the following permissions configured:

* Read access to repository metadata
* Read access to repository contents
* Other permissions necessary for Giselle functionality

<Info>
  Specific permission details can be reviewed on the GitHub App installation page.
</Info>

## Leveraging Integrations

### Using Repository Information

Connected GitHub repositories can be utilized in the following features:

* **Vector Stores**: Ingest repository contents as a knowledge base
* **Workflow Triggers**: Execute workflows triggered by repository events

<Note>
  For vector store configuration, refer to the [Vector Stores documentation](/en/guides/settings/team/vector-stores).
</Note>

## Future Support

While currently only GitHub integration is supported, we plan to add more external service integrations in the future.
