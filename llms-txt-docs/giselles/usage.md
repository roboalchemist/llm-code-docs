## Usage Overview

Monitor your team's AI app usage clearly and efficiently. Recently, we've transitioned from calculating usage based on minutes to a credit-based system.

### Resource Metrics

Giselle tracks your team's AI app runtime in minutes for informational purposes only. This monitoring currently does not directly relate to your billing, as billing is now calculated through credits.

## Usage Limits

Your subscription plan includes AI model usage credits each month:

* **Free Plan**: 30 minutes per month (limited-time promotion)
* **Pro Plan**: Unlimited usage during the promotional period

Note: App runtime displayed in minutes is separate from your actual billed credits.

## Usage Reports

Detailed logs of recent app activities, including start time, end time, and total duration, are provided for easy tracking.

## Usage Monitoring

<Warning>
  Giselle continuously updates app usage throughout the day. We are currently transitioning from time-based to credit-based monitoring. Parts of the previous UI remain and might cause confusion.
</Warning>
