# Team Apps

> Collaborate and manage AI applications with your team

Team Apps are collaborative AI applications that enable multiple team members to create, edit, and manage applications together on the Giselle App Builder platform. With Team Apps, you can leverage the collective expertise of your team to build more sophisticated AI solutions by combining multiple AI models and data sources.

## Key Features

### Collaborative Application Building

* **Shared Editing Access**: Multiple team members can edit and refine the same application
* **Collaborative Configuration**: Team members can jointly configure AI models and data sources
* **Version History**: Track changes and contributions from different team members

### Team Management

* **Permission Controls**: Assign different roles and access levels to team members
* **Shared Visibility**: All team members can view application settings and configurations
* **Collective Ownership**: Applications belong to the team rather than a single creator

### Enhanced Integration Capabilities

Team Apps include all the GitHub integration features available in My Apps:

* **Repository Integration**: Connect with repositories such as GitHub
* **Automatic Execution Triggers**: Set up automatic application execution triggered by issue creation or pull request submission
* **Output Sharing**: Functions as a GitHub App, allowing all team members with access to the connected repository to share output results

## Differences Between My Apps and Team Apps

Team Apps offer several advantages over My Apps:

* **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple team members can edit the application, unlike My Apps where only the creator has edit access
* **Shared Viewing**: All team members can view application settings and configurations
* **Seamless Handoffs**: Team members can continue work started by colleagues

## Requirements for Team Apps
