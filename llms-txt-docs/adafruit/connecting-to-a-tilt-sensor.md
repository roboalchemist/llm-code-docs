## Connecting to a Tilt Sensor

Tilt switches are pretty hardy, you can easily solder to them, clip the leads, plug them into breadboards, use alligator clips, etc. The only care you should take is to avoid bending the leads too much as they may break off.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/496/medium800/force___flex_tiltbb.jpg?1396763564)

The "poor man's" accelerometer! Tilt sensors are switches that can detect basic motion/orientation. The metal tube has a little metal ball that rolls around in it, when its tilted upright, the ball rolls onto the contacts sticking out of end and shorts them together.
