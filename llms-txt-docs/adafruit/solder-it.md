# Adafruit Prototyping Pi Plate

## Solder it!

Check that you have all the parts - a PCB, a 2x13 female header, a 1x6 female header, two 1x8 female headers, bumper, three 3-pin terminal blocks and ten 2-pin terminal blocks  
  
You will also need a soldering iron and solder to assemble the kit

Place the single bumper underneath the SOIC breakout area. This will make the plate sit nicely on the Ethernet port

![raspberry_pi_bumper.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/616/medium640/raspberry_pi_bumper.jpg?1396764540)

Place the big 2x13 pin header onto the Raspberry Pi GPIO breakouts so that it covers every pin. The connector is symmetric so it will fit on either way.

![raspberry_pi_headerplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/659/medium640/raspberry_pi_headerplace.jpg?1396764820)

Place the proto plate PCB on so that the 2x13 header pins poke out through the matching 2x13 pads in the corner.

![raspberry_pi_pcbplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/661/medium640/raspberry_pi_pcbplace.jpg?1396764835)

Heat up the soldering iron to 650 &deg;F and wait for it to get up to temperature. Then heat a corner pad/pin with the iron tip and after two seconds poke in a small amount of solder. After the solder has melted into the pad/pin remove the iron.  
  
Start by soldering the two corner pins. This will allow you to make sure the plate is aligned properly and fix it if its crooked.

![raspberry_pi_tack.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/665/medium640/raspberry_pi_tack.jpg?1396764861)

Continue to solder all 26 pins!

![raspberry_pi_solder1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/666/medium640/raspberry_pi_solder1.jpg?1396764870)

![raspberry_pi_solder2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/667/medium640/raspberry_pi_solder2.jpg?1396764876)

![raspberry_pi_headered.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/668/medium640/raspberry_pi_headered.jpg?1396764885)

Find the terminal blocks, they're blue and come in 3-pin and 2-pin shapes. We'll need to slide the blocks together for the next step where we put the blocks into the proto plate. Slide them together to make 1x8 pin, 1x5 pin, &nbsp;and 3x4pin terminal blocks&nbsp;

![raspberry_pi_terminals.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/669/medium640/raspberry_pi_terminals.jpg?1396764891)

![raspberry_pi_slide.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/671/medium640/raspberry_pi_slide.jpg?1396764904)

![raspberry_pi_joined.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/672/medium640/raspberry_pi_joined.jpg?1396764907)

Place the blue terminal blocks around the perimeter of the Proto Plate&nbsp;PCB. Make sure you place them so that the open ends are facing out as shown.

![raspberry_pi_termplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/673/medium640/raspberry_pi_termplace.jpg?1396764916)

![raspberry_pi_termplace2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/674/medium640/raspberry_pi_termplace2.jpg?1396764926)

Carefully flip over the PCB, you may need to tape down the terminal blocks with scotch tape if they seem to fall out. With all the terminal blocks in place, it should sit flat on a table.

![raspberry_pi_termflip.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/675/medium640/raspberry_pi_termflip.jpg?1396764936)

Solder each terminal block connection to the PCB using plenty of solder to make a strong mechanical connection

![raspberry_pi_term1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/676/medium640/raspberry_pi_term1.jpg?1396764943)

![raspberry_pi_term2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/677/medium640/raspberry_pi_term2.jpg?1396764953)

![raspberry_pi_term4.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/678/medium640/raspberry_pi_term4.jpg?1396764960)

This part is optional, but if you want to have sockets for the GPIO pins so you can plug wires in and out easily, you can solder in the two 8-pin and single 6-pin header.  
  
Place the headers in the slots right next to the terminal blocks. You'll want to tape them in place so they don't fall over when you flip the PCB.

![raspberry_pi_socketplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/680/medium640/raspberry_pi_socketplace.jpg?1396764974)

![raspberry_pi_sockettape.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/681/medium640/raspberry_pi_sockettape.jpg?1396764980)

Solder in all 3 sockets

![raspberry_pi_socket1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/682/medium640/raspberry_pi_socket1.jpg?1396764989)

![raspberry_pi_socket2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/683/medium640/raspberry_pi_socket2.jpg?1396764996)

That's it! You're done assembling the proto plate, next up check the User manual for some ideas on how to use
