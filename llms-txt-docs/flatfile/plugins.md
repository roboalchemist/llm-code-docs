> Reusable functionality modules that extend Flatfile's capabilities

Plugins in Flatfile are reusable, modular components that extend the platform's data import and processing capabilities. They provide pre-built functionality for common data import/extraction, transformation, and processing tasks, integrations, and workflows, enabling rapid development of sophisticated import solutions.

## What are Plugins?

A Plugin is a self-contained module that:

* **Extends Functionality** - Adds new capabilities to your import workflows
* **Encapsulates Logic** - Packages complex operations into reusable components
* **Provides Integration** - Connects to external systems and services
* **Enables Customization** - Allows configuration for specific use cases

Plugins can be used by [Listeners](/core-concepts/listeners) to perform specialized tasks without writing custom code. You can also create your own plugins to extend Flatfile's capabilities.

For detailed guides on our available plugins, see the [Plugins](/plugins) section.
