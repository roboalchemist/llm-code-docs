# Moderated content

> Here are the current rules we apply to the content we moderate. 

<Info>
  Note that content restrictions only apply to Argil’s avatars. If you wish to generate content outside of our restrictions, please train your own avatar ([see how](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/training-tips))
</Info>

<Warning>
  Moderation from fiction is done by 3rd parties over which Argil has no control of. Videos generations which fails are automatically refunded.
</Warning>

On Argil, to protect our customers and to comply with our “safe synthetic content guidelines”, we prevent some content to be generated. There are 3 scenarios:

* Video generated with **your** avatar: no content is restricted
* Video generated with **Argil’s human avatars**: submitted to content restrictions (see below)

***

### Here’s an exhaustive list of content that is restricted:

You will not use the Platform to generate, upload, or share any content that is obscene, pornographic, offensive, hateful, violent, or otherwise objectionable, including but not limited to content that falls in the following categories:

### **Finance\***

* Anything that invites people to earn more money with a product or service described in the content (includes crypto and gambling).

**Banned:** Content is flagged when it makes unverified promises of financial gain, promotes get-rich-quick schemes, or markets financial products deceptively. Claims like "double your income overnight" or "risk-free investments" are explicitly prohibited.

**Allowed**: General discussions of financial products or markets that do not promote specific services or methods for profit. Describing the perks of a product (nice banking cards, easy user interface, etc.) not related to the ability to make more money.

### Illicit promotion\*

* Promotion of cryptocurrencies
* Promotion of gambling sites

**Banned:** Content is flagged when it encourages risky financial behavior, such as investing in cryptocurrencies without disclaimers or promoting gambling platforms. Misleading claims of easy profits or exaggerated benefits are also prohibited.

**Allowed**: General discussions of financial products or markets that do not promote specific services or methods for profit. Promoting the characteristics of your product (card

### Criminal / Illegal activies

* Pedo-criminality
* Promotion of illegal activities
* Human trafficking
* Drug use or abuse
* Malware or phishing

**Banned**: Content is banned when it provides explicit instructions, encourages, or normalizes illegal acts. For example, sharing methods for hacking, promoting drug sales, or justifying exploitation falls into this category. Any attempt to glorify such activities is strictly prohibited.

### Violence and harm

* Blood, gore, self harm
* Extreme violence, graphic violence, incitement to violence
* Terrorism

**Banned**: Content that portrays graphic depictions of physical harm, promotes violent behavior, or incites others to harm themselves or others is not allowed. This includes highly descriptive language or imagery that glorifies violence or presents it as a solution.

### Hate speech and discrimination

* Racism, sexism, misogyny, misandry, homophobia, transphobia
* Hate speech, defamation or slander
* Discrimination
* Explicit or offensive language

**Banned**: Hate speech is banned when it directly attacks or dehumanizes individuals or groups based on their identity. Content encouraging segregation, using slurs, or promoting ideologies of hate (e.g., white supremacy) is prohibited. Defamation targeting specific individuals also falls under this category.

### **Privacy and Intellectual Property**

* Intellectual property infringement
* Invasion of privacy

**Banned:** Content that encourages removing watermarks, using pirated software, or disclosing private information without consent is disallowed. This includes sharing unauthorized personal details or methods to bypass intellectual property protections.

### **Nudity and sexual content**

**Banned:** Sexual content is banned when it contains graphic descriptions of acts, uses explicit language, or is intended to arouse rather than inform or educate. Depictions of non-consensual or illegal sexual acts are strictly forbidden.

### **Harassment**

**Banned:** Harassment includes targeted attacks, threats, or content meant to humiliate an individual. Persistent, unwanted commentary or personal attacks against a specific person also fall under this banned category.

### **Misinformation** and fake news

**Banned:** Misinformation is flagged when it spreads false narratives as facts, especially on topics like health, science, or current events. Conspiracy theories or fabricated claims that could mislead or harm the audience are strictly not allowed.

### **Sensitive Political Topics**

**Banned:** Content is banned when it incites unrest, promotes illegal political actions, or glorifies controversial figures without nuance. Content that polarizes communities or compromises public safety through biased narratives is flagged.

**Allowed:** Balanced discussions on political issues, provided they are neutral, educational, and avoid inflammatory language.

**Why do we restrict content?**

We have very strong contracts in place with our actors that are used as Argil’s avatars.

If you think that a video has been wrongly flagged, please send an email to [support@argil.ai](mailto:support@argil.ai) (**and ideally include the transcript of said video**).

*Please note that Argil created a feature on the platform to automatically filter the generation of prohibited content, but this feature can be too strict and in some cases doesn’t work.*

### Users that violate these guidelines may see the immediate termination of their access to the Platform and a permanent ban from future use.
