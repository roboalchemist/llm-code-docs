# Day 20: GraphRAG with Neo4j - Relationship-Based Knowledge Discovery

> Explore GraphRAG using Neo4j for complex relationship reasoning and knowledge discovery. Build knowledge graphs dynamically and implement sophisticated graph-based retrieval systems.

<Card title="Day 20 challenge" icon="share-alt">
  **Goal**: build GraphRAG systems with Neo4j for relationship-based knowledge discovery

  **Theme**: context engineering week - graph-based retrieval and reasoning

  **Time investment**: \~30 minutes
</Card>

Welcome to Day 20! You've mastered structured and document-based RAG. Today
you'll explore **GraphRAG** - retrieval augmented generation using graph
databases. You'll learn to build knowledge graphs that capture relationships and
enable sophisticated reasoning about connected information.

GraphRAG excels when the connections between entities are as important as the
entities themselves.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Set up Neo4j Sandbox for graph database experimentation
* Construct a knowledge graph using web search and entity extraction
* Connect Neo4j to your agent for graph-based retrieval
* Understand GraphRAG principles and relationship reasoning
* Use Neo4j developer tools to explore and visualize graph structures

<Warning>
  This introduces graph database concepts and requires Neo4j Sandbox setup
  (free). Graph thinking is different from relational or document databases -
  focus on relationships and connections.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding GraphRAG

GraphRAG represents a fundamentally different approach to information retrieval:

### Traditional RAG and GraphRAG

**Traditional RAG**:

* Searches for similar content based on vector embeddings
* Retrieves isolated pieces of information
* Limited understanding of relationships between entities
* Good for finding relevant documents or data points

**GraphRAG**:

* Traverses relationships between connected entities
* Retrieves networks of related information
* Understands complex multi-hop relationships
* Excellent for answering questions that require reasoning across connections

### When to use GraphRAG

**Ideal for**:

* Knowledge domains with complex relationships (research, business intelligence)
* Questions requiring multi-step reasoning ("How are X and Y connected?")
* Recommendation systems based on similarity and relationships
* Analyzing networks, hierarchies, and influence patterns
* Connecting disparate pieces of information through shared entities

**Examples of GraphRAG queries**:

* "What companies have partnerships with our competitors' suppliers?"
* "How are these research papers connected through shared authors and
  citations?"
* "What are the indirect relationships between this customer and our product
  roadmap?"

<Tip>
  **Graph thinking** Instead of asking "What documents contain X?", GraphRAG
  asks "What's connected to X, and what does that network tell us?"
</Tip>

## Step 2: Set up Neo4j sandbox

Neo4j Sandbox provides a free, hosted Neo4j instance for learning:

### Create your Neo4j sandbox

1. **Visit [sandbox.neo4j.com](https://sandbox.neo4j.com)** and create a free
   account
2. **Create a new project** and select "Blank Sandbox"
3. **Note your connection details**: URL, username, and password
4. **Open Neo4j Browser** to start working with your graph database

### Understanding Neo4j concepts

* **Nodes** Entities in your graph (People, Companies, Products, Concepts)
* **Relationships** Connections between nodes (WORKS\_FOR, COMPETES\_WITH,
  INFLUENCES)
* **Properties** Attributes of nodes and relationships (name, date, strength)
* **Labels** Categories for nodes (Person, Company, Technology)

### Basic Cypher syntax

Cypher is Neo4j's query language for graphs:

```cypher
// Create nodes
CREATE (p:Person {name: "Alice", role: "Engineer"})
CREATE (c:Company {name: "TechCorp", industry: "Software"})

// Create relationships
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alice"}), (c:Company {name: "TechCorp"})
CREATE (p)-[:WORKS_FOR {since: 2020}]->(c)

// Query patterns
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company)
RETURN p.name, c.name
```

## Step 3: Construct knowledge graph using web search

You'll build a knowledge graph by extracting entities and relationships from web
research:

### Create a technology company knowledge graph

Let's build a graph about AI companies and their relationships:

```cypher
// Create AI companies
CREATE (openai:Company {name: "OpenAI", founded: 2015, industry: "AI Research"})
CREATE (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic", founded: 2021, industry: "AI Safety"})
CREATE (google:Company {name: "Google", founded: 1998, industry: "Technology"})
CREATE (microsoft:Company {name: "Microsoft", founded: 1975, industry: "Technology"})
CREATE (meta:Company {name: "Meta", founded: 2004, industry: "Social Media"})

// Create key people
CREATE (sam:Person {name: "Sam Altman", role: "CEO"})
CREATE (dario:Person {name: "Dario Amodei", role: "CEO"})
CREATE (demis:Person {name: "Demis Hassabis", role: "CEO"})
CREATE (satya:Person {name: "Satya Nadella", role: "CEO"})
CREATE (mark:Person {name: "Mark Zuckerberg", role: "CEO"})

// Create AI models/products
CREATE (gpt4:Product {name: "GPT-4", type: "Language Model", release_year: 2023})
CREATE (claude:Product {name: "Claude", type: "Language Model", release_year: 2022})
CREATE (gemini:Product {name: "Gemini", type: "Language Model", release_year: 2023})
CREATE (copilot:Product {name: "GitHub Copilot", type: "AI Assistant", release_year: 2021})
CREATE (llama:Product {name: "LLaMA", type: "Language Model", release_year: 2023})

// Create relationships - leadership
MATCH (sam:Person {name: "Sam Altman"}), (openai:Company {name: "OpenAI"})
CREATE (sam)-[:CEO_OF {since: 2019}]->(openai)

MATCH (dario:Person {name: "Dario Amodei"}), (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic"})
CREATE (dario)-[:CEO_OF {since: 2021}]->(anthropic)

MATCH (demis:Person {name: "Demis Hassabis"}), (google:Company {name: "Google"})
CREATE (demis)-[:LEADS_AI_AT {division: "DeepMind"}]->(google)

MATCH (satya:Person {name: "Satya Nadella"}), (microsoft:Company {name: "Microsoft"})
CREATE (satya)-[:CEO_OF {since: 2014}]->(microsoft)

MATCH (mark:Person {name: "Mark Zuckerberg"}), (meta:Company {name: "Meta"})
CREATE (mark)-[:CEO_OF {since: 2004}]->(meta)

// Create product relationships
MATCH (openai:Company {name: "OpenAI"}), (gpt4:Product {name: "GPT-4"})
CREATE (openai)-[:DEVELOPS]->(gpt4)

MATCH (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic"}), (claude:Product {name: "Claude"})
CREATE (anthropic)-[:DEVELOPS]->(claude)

MATCH (google:Company {name: "Google"}), (gemini:Product {name: "Gemini"})
CREATE (google)-[:DEVELOPS]->(gemini)

MATCH (microsoft:Company {name: "Microsoft"}), (copilot:Product {name: "GitHub Copilot"})
CREATE (microsoft)-[:DEVELOPS]->(copilot)

MATCH (meta:Company {name: "Meta"}), (llama:Product {name: "LLaMA"})
CREATE (meta)-[:DEVELOPS]->(llama)

// Create business relationships
MATCH (microsoft:Company {name: "Microsoft"}), (openai:Company {name: "OpenAI"})
CREATE (microsoft)-[:PARTNERS_WITH {investment: "10B", type: "Strategic Partnership"}]->(openai)

MATCH (google:Company {name: "Google"}), (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic"})
CREATE (google)-[:INVESTS_IN {amount: "300M", round: "Series B"}]->(anthropic)

// Create competitive relationships
MATCH (openai:Company {name: "OpenAI"}), (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic"})
CREATE (openai)-[:COMPETES_WITH {market: "Enterprise AI"}]->(anthropic)

MATCH (gpt4:Product {name: "GPT-4"}), (claude:Product {name: "Claude"})
CREATE (gpt4)-[:COMPETES_WITH {category: "Large Language Models"}]->(claude)

MATCH (gpt4:Product {name: "GPT-4"}), (gemini:Product {name: "Gemini"})
CREATE (gpt4)-[:COMPETES_WITH {category: "Large Language Models"}]->(gemini)
```

### Add research topics and trends

```cypher
// Create research areas and trends
CREATE (safety:Topic {name: "AI Safety", importance: "Critical"})
CREATE (alignment:Topic {name: "AI Alignment", importance: "High"})
CREATE (multimodal:Topic {name: "Multimodal AI", importance: "High"})
CREATE (reasoning:Topic {name: "AI Reasoning", importance: "Medium"})
CREATE (agents:Topic {name: "AI Agents", importance: "High"})

// Connect companies to research focus areas
MATCH (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic"}), (safety:Topic {name: "AI Safety"})
CREATE (anthropic)-[:FOCUSES_ON {priority: "Primary"}]->(safety)

MATCH (anthropic:Company {name: "Anthropic"}), (alignment:Topic {name: "AI Alignment"})
CREATE (anthropic)-[:FOCUSES_ON {priority: "Primary"}]->(alignment)

MATCH (openai:Company {name: "OpenAI"}), (agents:Topic {name: "AI Agents"})
CREATE (openai)-[:FOCUSES_ON {priority: "High"}]->(agents)

MATCH (google:Company {name: "Google"}), (multimodal:Topic {name: "Multimodal AI"})
CREATE (google)-[:FOCUSES_ON {priority: "High"}]->(multimodal)

// Connect products to capabilities
MATCH (claude:Product {name: "Claude"}), (safety:Topic {name: "AI Safety"})
CREATE (claude)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(safety)

MATCH (gpt4:Product {name: "GPT-4"}), (multimodal:Topic {name: "Multimodal AI"})
CREATE (gpt4)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(multimodal)
```

## Step 4: Connect Neo4j to your agent

Integrate graph database capabilities with your Hypermode agent:

### Add Neo4j connection

1. **Navigate to your agent's connections** in the About section
2. **Add Neo4j connection** with your Sandbox credentials
3. **Test the connection** by running a simple Cypher query

Refer to the [Neo4j connection documentation](agents/connections/neo4j) for more
information on how to add the Neo4j connection to your Hypermode agent.

### Create a GraphRAG agent

Create an agent specialized in graph-based reasoning:

```text
I want to create a knowledge graph analyst agent that helps users discover relationships and insights from connected data.

The agent should:
- Query graph databases to find complex relationships between entities
- Explain how different companies, people, and technologies are connected
- Discover indirect relationships and influence patterns
- Provide network analysis and relationship insights
- Help users understand competitive landscapes and partnership networks
- Reason about multi-hop relationships and their implications

The agent should think like a business intelligence analyst who specializes in relationship mapping and network analysis.
```

### Configure GraphRAG patterns

Add these instructions to enhance graph reasoning:

```text
Graph Analysis Guidelines:
1. Use Cypher queries to explore relationships between entities
2. Look for both direct and indirect connections (2-3 hops)
3. Identify patterns in networks (clusters, influential nodes, bridges)
4. Explain the significance of relationships, not just their existence
5. Consider relationship strength, direction, and properties
6. Provide visual descriptions of network structures when helpful
7. Connect graph insights to business implications and strategic value
```

## Step 5: Explore GraphRAG capabilities

Test sophisticated graph-based reasoning:

### Relationship discovery queries

```text
How are OpenAI and Anthropic connected through their business relationships and competitive positioning? What does this network tell us about the AI industry?
```

Your agent should:

1. **Query direct relationships** between the companies
2. **Explore indirect connections** through shared partners, investors, or
   competitors
3. **Analyze the network structure** and identify patterns
4. **Provide strategic insights** based on relationship analysis

### Multi-hop reasoning

```text
Find all the ways that Microsoft's investment in OpenAI might influence competition with Google's AI products. Consider indirect effects and network implications.
```

This requires:

* **Multi-step traversal** through the graph
* **Reasoning about implications** of connected relationships
* **Understanding competitive dynamics** through network analysis
* **Identifying strategic advantages** or vulnerabilities

### Network analysis

```text
Which companies or people are most central to the AI industry network? Who has the most influence based on their connections?
```

This tests:

* **Centrality analysis** using graph algorithms
* **Influence pattern recognition** based on relationship types
* **Network structure understanding** and strategic positioning
* **Competitive advantage assessment** through connectivity

<Tip>
  **GraphRAG insight** The most valuable insights often come from discovering
  unexpected connections or understanding how influence flows through networks
  of relationships.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Neo4j developer tools exploration

Use Neo4j's visualization and analysis tools to understand your graph:

### Neo4j Browser visualization

In Neo4j Browser, run these queries to explore your graph visually:

```cypher
// Visualize the entire company network
MATCH (c:Company)-[r]-(n)
RETURN c, r, n
LIMIT 50

// Find the most connected entities
MATCH (n)-[r]-()
RETURN n, count(r) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10

// Explore competitive relationships
MATCH (c1:Company)-[:COMPETES_WITH]-(c2:Company)
RETURN c1, c2

// Find partnership and investment networks
MATCH path = (c1:Company)-[:PARTNERS_WITH|INVESTS_IN*1..2]-(c2:Company)
RETURN path
```

### Graph algorithms for analysis

```cypher
// Find shortest paths between entities
MATCH path = shortestPath((openai:Company {name: "OpenAI"})-[*]-(meta:Company {name: "Meta"}))
RETURN path

// Discover communities in the network
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId
ORDER BY communityId

// Calculate centrality scores
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC
```

### Advanced graph patterns

```cypher
// Find triangular relationships (mutual connections)
MATCH (a:Company)-[:PARTNERS_WITH]-(b:Company)-[:COMPETES_WITH]-(c:Company)-[:INVESTS_IN]-(a)
RETURN a, b, c

// Discover influence paths
MATCH path = (p:Person)-[:CEO_OF]->(c:Company)-[:DEVELOPS]->(product:Product)-[:COMPETES_WITH]->(other:Product)
RETURN path

// Find similar companies based on shared relationships
MATCH (c1:Company)-[:FOCUSES_ON]->(topic:Topic)<-[:FOCUSES_ON]-(c2:Company)
WHERE c1 <> c2
RETURN c1.name, c2.name, collect(topic.name) as shared_interests
```

## What you've accomplished

In 30 minutes, you've mastered GraphRAG fundamentals:

**Graph database setup**: configured Neo4j Sandbox for graph-based knowledge
storage

**Knowledge graph construction**: built a comprehensive network of AI industry
relationships

**GraphRAG implementation**: connected graph reasoning capabilities to your
agent

**Relationship analysis**: explored multi-hop reasoning and network pattern
discovery

**Visualization tools**: used Neo4j Browser for graph exploration and analysis

## The power of GraphRAG

GraphRAG enables reasoning that traditional RAG can't:

**Traditional RAG**: "What companies work on AI safety?" → Returns individual
documents about AI safety companies

**GraphRAG**: "How does Anthropic's focus on AI safety create competitive
advantages through their Google partnership while positioning them against
OpenAI's Microsoft alliance?" → Returns network analysis of competitive
positioning through relationship patterns

This completes your foundation in context engineering fundamentals.

</Card>

## Pro tip for today

Experiment with graph pattern discovery:

```text
Using the AI industry knowledge graph we built, help me discover:
1. What unexpected relationships exist between seemingly unrelated entities?
2. Which entities serve as "bridges" connecting different parts of the network?
3. How would adding a new company or partnership change the network dynamics?
4. What competitive advantages emerge from specific relationship patterns?

Show me both the graph queries and the strategic insights they reveal.
```

This develops intuition for thinking in graphs and understanding network
effects.
