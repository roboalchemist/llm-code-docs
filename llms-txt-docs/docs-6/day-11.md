# Day 11: Finance & Revenue Operations - Stripe Integration

> Build a revenue operations agent that monitors payments, analyzes subscription metrics, and provides financial insights through Stripe integration.

<Card title="Day 11 challenge" icon="dollar-sign">
  **Goal**: create a revenue operations agent with Stripe integration

  **Theme**: domain specialization week - financial intelligence

  **Time investment**: \~20 minutes
</Card>

Welcome to Day 11 and Week 3! You've mastered agent creation and workflows. Now
you'll specialize in **domain-specific agents**—starting with finance and
revenue operations through Stripe integration.

This week is about building agents that don't just use tools, but understand the
business context and best practices of specific domains.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Build a revenue operations agent that understands financial workflows
* Connect Stripe for payment and subscription intelligence
* Create automated revenue reporting and customer insights
* Learn domain-specific patterns for financial agents

<Warning>
  This builds on your Week 2 agent creation skills. You'll need a Stripe account
  with appropriate permissions to complete today's integration.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding revenue agent patterns

Financial agents need specialized knowledge beyond basic tool usage:

### Domain expertise requirements

Revenue agents must understand:

* **Financial metrics**: MRR, churn, LTV, CAC, and their relationships
* **Customer lifecycle**: Trial → paid → expansion → renewal patterns
* **Risk indicators**: Failed payments, cancellations, downgrades
* **Compliance needs**: Data privacy, financial reporting requirements

<Tip>
  **Domain thinking** your agent should reason like a revenue operations
  manager, not just fetch Stripe data.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create your revenue operations agent

Work with Concierge to build a specialized financial agent:

```text
I want to create a revenue operations agent that monitors our Stripe payments and subscriptions.

The agent should:
- Track key revenue metrics (MRR, churn, new vs expansion revenue)
- Identify at-risk customers based on payment patterns
- Generate weekly revenue reports with insights
- Alert on significant revenue events (large cancellations, payment failures)
- Provide customer health scores based on payment history

It should think like a revenue operations manager who understands SaaS metrics.
```

## Step 3: Connect and configure Stripe

Add Stripe to your agent's connections:

1. **Navigate to Connections** in your agent settings
2. **Search for Stripe** and click "Add Connection"
3. **Authenticate** with your Stripe account
4. **Select appropriate permissions** (read access to payments, customers,
   subscriptions)

### Key Stripe capabilities for revenue agents

Your agent can now:

* **Analyze payment data**: Success rates, failure reasons, retry patterns
* **Monitor subscriptions**: New, upgraded, downgraded, cancelled
* **Track customer behavior**: Payment methods, billing cycles, usage patterns
* **Generate insights**: Revenue trends, cohort analysis, forecasting

## Step 4: Implement revenue intelligence workflows

Test your agent with real revenue scenarios:

```text
Can you analyze our revenue performance this month and identify any concerning trends?
```

Your agent should:

* Pull current month's transaction data from Stripe
* Calculate key metrics (MRR, churn rate, growth rate)
* Identify anomalies or concerning patterns
* Provide actionable recommendations

### Example revenue analysis

```text
What's our current MRR and how has it changed this quarter?
Which customers are at risk of churning?
```

The agent analyzes:

* **MRR trends**: Current MRR, growth rate, net new vs expansion
* **Churn indicators**: Failed payments, downgrades, usage decline
* **Customer health**: Payment reliability, engagement, upgrade potential
* **Action items**: Customers needing attention, upsell opportunities

## Step 5: Create automated revenue workflows

Build repeatable revenue tasks:

<Note>
  **Coming soon** daily and weekly scheduled tasks. For now, you'll need to
  interact with your agent through the UI to run these workflows.
</Note>

**Weekly revenue report**:

```text
Can you analyze last week's revenue performance including:
- New vs lost MRR
- Payment failure rate and recovery
- Top customers by revenue
- Churn risk assessment
- Week-over-week comparison

Format as an executive summary with key metrics and action items.
```

**Customer health monitoring**:

```text
Can you check for:
- Failed payments needing attention
- Customers with multiple failed attempts
- Sudden usage drops indicating churn risk
- Opportunities for upgrades based on usage

Alert me only for critical issues needing immediate action.
```

<Tip>
  **Pro tip** set calendar reminders to run your revenue report weekly and
  health checks daily until automated scheduling is available.
</Tip>

## What you've accomplished

In 20 minutes, you've built a domain-specific revenue operations agent:

**Financial intelligence** agent that understands revenue metrics and SaaS
business models

**Stripe integration** connected payment and subscription data for real-time
insights

**Manual workflows** revenue reporting and customer health monitoring that you
can run on-demand

**Domain expertise** agent that thinks like a revenue operations manager, not
just a data fetcher

## The power of domain-specific agents

Unlike generic agents, domain-specific agents:

* **Understand context**: Know what metrics matter and why
* **Identify patterns**: Recognize revenue risks before they become problems
* **Provide insights**: Actionable recommendations, not just data dumps
* **Automate expertise**: Scale revenue operations knowledge across your team

## Pro tip for today

Ask your revenue agent:

```text
Based on our payment patterns, what early warning signs should I watch for to prevent churn?
```

This helps your agent develop predictive capabilities specific to your business.
