# Basic Functions

> Implement simple functions with Modus

We built Hypermode first to make the easy things easy. Here you'll find a
collection of examples demonstrating how to implement basic functions using the
Modus framework. We designed these examples to help you get started quickly and
understand the core concepts of Modus.

## Set up

Before diving into the examples, make sure you have Modus installed and set up.
If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the
[quickstart guide](modus/first-modus-agent).

## Basic function implementations

### Hello world

Learn how to create a simple "Hello World" function using Modus. This example
covers the basics of setting up a function, deploying it, and invoking it.

### Data processing

Explore how to implement a function that processes data. This example
demonstrates how to handle input data, perform operations, and return results.

### API integration

See how to integrate external APIs into your Modus functions. This example shows
how to make API calls, handle responses, and use the data in your functions.

### Database operations

Understand how to perform database operations with Modus. This example covers
connecting to a database, executing queries, and managing data.

## Best practices

* **Modular Code**: Keep your code modular and organized to make it easier to
  maintain and extend.
* **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to ensure your functions
  can gracefully handle unexpected situations.
* **Logging**: Use logging to track the execution of your functions and
  troubleshoot issues.
* **Testing**: Write tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected
  and catch potential issues early.
