# Tech Stack

> The tech stack for this project includes Dgraph Cloud, React, Typescript, Apollo Client 3.x, Semantic UI React, Tailwind CSS, and Luxon.

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

The tech stack for the message board example app is as follows:

* [Dgraph Cloud](https://dgraph.io/cloud): backend database
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript UI framework
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): types for JavaScript
* [Apollo Client 3.x](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/): GraphQL client
  and React state management
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/): UI component framework
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS framework
* [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) : date and time formatting.

This app also uses the
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to generate
TypeScript-friendly React hooks for the GraphQL queries and mutations.

Now, let's [get started building](./react-app-boiler-plate).
