# Deep Mutations

> Perform deep mutations at multiple levels. Deep mutations don't alter linked objects, but add nested new objects or link to existing objects.

You can perform deep mutations at multiple levels. Deep mutations don't alter
linked objects, but they can add deeply nested new objects or link to existing
objects. To update an existing nested object, use the update mutation for its
type.

We use the following schema to demonstrate some examples.

## Schema

```graphql
type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @search(by: [hash])
  dob: DateTime
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  postID: ID!
  title: String! @search(by: [term, fulltext])
  text: String @search(by: [fulltext, term])
  datePublished: DateTime
}
```

### Example: Adding deeply nested post with new author mutation using variables

```graphql
mutation addAuthorWithPost($author: addAuthorInput!) {
  addAuthor(input: [$author]) {
    author {
      id
      name
      posts {
        title
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "author": {
    "name": "A.N. Author",
    "dob": "2000-01-01",
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "New post",
        "text": "A really new post"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Example**: Update mutation on deeply nested post and link to an existing author using variables

The following example assumes that the post with the postID of `0x456` already
exists, and isn't currently nested under the author having the id of `0x123`.

<Note>
  This syntax doesn't remove any other existing posts, it just adds the existing
  post to any that may already be nested.
</Note>

```graphql
mutation updateAuthorWithExistingPost($patch: UpdateAuthorInput!) {
  updateAuthor(input: $patch) {
    author {
      id
      posts {
        title
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "patch": {
    "filter": {
      "id": ["0x123"]
    },
    "set": {
      "posts": [
        {
          "postID": "0x456"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This example query can't modify the existing post's title or text. To modify the
post's title or text, use the `updatePost` mutation either alongside the this
mutation, or as a separate transaction.
