# Single Host Setup

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

To learn about Dgraph and the components, you can install and run Dgraph cluster
on a single host using Docker, Docker Compose, or Dgraph command line.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker">
    Dgraph cluster can be setup running as containers on a single host.

    ## Before you begin

    Ensure that you have installed:

    * Docker [Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) (required for windows or
      mac)
    * Docker [Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

    ## Launch a Dgraph standalone cluster using Docker

    1. Select a name `<CONTAINER_NAME>` for you Docker container and create a
       directory `<GRAPH_DATA_PATH>` that for Dgraph data on your local file system.

    2. Run a container with the dgraph/standalone image:

       ```sh
          docker run --name <CONTAINER_NAME> -d -p "8080:8080" -p "9080:9080" -v <DGRAPH_DATA_PATH>:/dgraph dgraph/standalone:latest
       ```

    3. Optionally launch [Ratel](dgraph/ratel/overview) using the `dgraph/ratel`
       docker image:

       ```sh
       docker run --name ratel  -d -p "8000:8000"  dgraph/ratel:latest
       ```

       You can now use Ratel UI on your browser at localhost:8000 and connect to you
       Dgraph cluster at localhost:8080

    ## Setup a Dgraph cluster on a single host using Docker

    1. Get the `<IP_ADDRESS>` of the host using:

       ```sh
          ip addr  # On Arch Linux
          ifconfig # On Ubuntu/Mac
       ```

    2. Pull the latest Dgraph image using docker:

       ```sh
          docker pull dgraph/dgraph:latest
       ```

    3. Verify that the image is downloaded:

       ```sh
          docker images
       ```

    4. Create a `<DGRAPH_NETWORK>` using:

       ```sh
          docker network create <DGRAPH_NETWORK>
       ```

    5. Create a directory `<ZERO_DATA>`to store data for Dgraph Zero and run the
       container:

       ```sh
       mkdir ~/<ZERO> # Or any other directory where data should be stored.

       docker run -it -p 5080:5080 --network <DGRAPH_NETWORK> -p 6080:6080 -v ~/<ZERO_DATA>:/dgraph dgraph/dgraph:latest dgraph zero --my=<IP_ADDRESS>:5080
       ```

    6. Create a directory `<ALPHA_DATA_1>` to store for Dgraph Alpha and run the
       container:

       ```sh
       mkdir ~/<ALPHA_DATA_1> # Or any other directory where data should be stored.

       docker run -it -p 7080:7080 --network <DGRAPH_NETWORK> -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -v ~/<ALPHA_DATA_1>:/dgraph dgraph/dgraph:latest dgraph alpha --zero=<IP_ADDRESS>:5080 --my=<IP_ADDRESS>:7080
       ```

    7. Create a directory `<ALPHA_DATA_2>` to store for the second Dgraph Alpha and
       run the container:

       ```sh
       mkdir ~/<ALPHA_DATA_2> # Or any other directory where data should be stored.

       docker run -it -p 7081:7081 --network <DGRAPH_NETWORK> -p 8081:8081 -p 9081:9081 -v ~/<ALPHA_DATA_2>:/dgraph dgraph/dgraph:latest dgraph alpha --zero=<IP_ADDRESS>:5080 --my=<IP_ADDRESS>:7081  -o=1
       ```

       To override the default ports for the second Alpha use `-o`.

    8. Connect the Dgraph cluster that are running using [https://play.dgraph.io/](https://play.dgraph.io/).
       For information about connecting, see [Ratel UI](/dgraph/ratel/connection).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dgraph Command Line">
    You can run Dgraph directly on a single Linux host.

    ## Before you begin

    Ensure that you have:

    * Installed [Dgraph](./download) on the Linux host.
    * Made a note of the `<IP_ADDRESS>` of the host.

    ## Using Dgraph CLI

    You can start Dgraph on a single host using the dgraph command line.

    1. Run Dgraph Zero

       ```sh
       dgraph zero --my=<IP_ADDRESS>:5080
       ```

       The `--my` flag is the connection that Dgraph alphas dial to talk to Zero.
       So, the port `5080` and the IP address must be visible to all the Dgraph
       alphas. For all other various flags, run `dgraph zero --help`.

    2. Run two Dgraph Alpha nodea:

       ```sh
       dgraph alpha --my=<IP_ADDRESS>:7080 --zero=localhost:5080
       dgraph alpha --my=<IP_ADDRESS>:7081 --zero=localhost:5080 -o=1
       ```

       Dgraph Alpha nodes use two directories to persist data and
       [WAL logs](/dgraph/concepts/consistency-model), and these directories must be
       different for each Alpha if they're running on the same host. You can use
       `-p` and `-w` to change the location of the data and WAL directories.To learn
       more about other flags, run `dgraph alpha --help`.

    3. Connect the Dgraph cluster that are running using [https://play.dgraph.io/](https://play.dgraph.io/).
       For information about connecting, see [Ratel UI](/dgraph/ratel/connection).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Docker Compose">
    You can install Dgraph using the Docker Compose on a system hosted on any of the
    cloud provider.

    ## Before you begin

    * Ensure that you have installed Docker
      [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
    * IP address of the system on cloud `<CLOUD_IP_ADDRESS>`.
    * IP address of the local host `<IP_ADDRESS>`.

    ## Using Docker Compose

    1. Download the Dgraph `docker-compose.yml` file:

       ```sh
       wget https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/raw/main/contrib/config/docker/docker-compose.yml
       ```

       By default only the localhost IP 127.0.0.1 is allowed. When you run Dgraph on
       Docker, the containers are assigned IPs and those IPs need to be added to the
       allowed list.

    2. Add a list of IPs allowed for Dgraph so that you can create the schema. Use
       an editor of your choice and add the `<IP_ADDRESS>` of the local host in
       `docker-compose.yml` file:

       ```txt
       # This Docker Compose file can be used to quickly boot up Dgraph Zero
       # and Alpha in different Docker containers.
       # It mounts /tmp/data on the host machine to /dgraph within the
       # container. You will need to change /tmp/data to a more appropriate location.
       # Run `docker-compose up` to start Dgraph.
       version: "3.2"
       services:
         zero:
           image: dgraph/dgraph:latest
           volumes:
             - /tmp/data:/dgraph
           ports:
             - 5080:5080
             - 6080:6080
           restart: on-failure
           command: dgraph zero --my=zero:5080
         alpha:
           image: dgraph/dgraph:latest
           volumes:
             - /tmp/data:/dgraph
           ports:
             - 8080:8080
             - 9080:9080
           restart: on-failure
           command: dgraph alpha --my=alpha:7080 --zero=zero:5080 --security whitelist=<IP_ADDRESS>
         ratel:
           image: dgraph/ratel:latest
           ports:
             - 8000:8000

       ```

    3. Run the `docker-compose` command to start the Dgraph services in the docker
       container:

       ```sh
       sudo docker-compose up
       ```

       After Dgraph is installed on Docker, you can view the images and the
       containers running in Docker for Dgraph.

    4. View the containers running for Dgraph using:

       ```sh
       sudo docker ps -a
       ```

       An output similar to the following appears:

       ```sh
       CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED
       4b67157933b6   dgraph/dgraph:latest   "dgraph zero --my=ze—"   2 days ago
       3faf9bba3a5b   dgraph/ratel:latest    "/usr/local/bin/dgra—"   2 days ago
       a6b5823b668d   dgraph/dgraph:latest   "dgraph alpha --my=a—"   2 days ago
       a6b5823b668d   dgraph/dgraph:latest   "dgraph alpha --my=a…"   2 days ago
       ```

    5. To access the Ratel UI for queries, mutations, and altering schema, open your
       web browser and navigate to `http://<CLOUD_IP_ADDRESS>:8000`.

    6. Click **Launch Latest** to access the latest stable release of Ratel UI.

    7. In the **Dgraph Server Connection** dialog that set the **Dgraph server URL**
       as `http://<CLOUD_IP_ADDRESS>:8080`

    8. Click **Connect** . The connection health appears green.

    9. Click **Continue** to query or run mutations.
