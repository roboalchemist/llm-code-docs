# Develop

> Build and iterate on your Apps locally or in Threads

Hypermode supports two complementary approaches for building Apps: **code-first
development** using Modus locally and **conversational development** using
Threads. For conversational development, see our Threads documentation.

## Code-first development with Modus

For developers who prefer working with code, Modus provides a complete local
development environment. This approach gives you full control over your App's
structure, version control integration, and the ability to work within your
existing development tools.

### Setting up local development

Install the Modus CLI to start building Apps locally:

```bash
npm install -g @hypermode/modus-cli
```

Create a new App:

```bash
modus new my-app
cd my-app
```

This scaffolds a complete App structure with:

* Agent definitions and configurations
* Function definitions for custom tools
* Model integrations and connections
* Environment configuration
* Testing framework

### Local development workflow

When developing locally, you get the full Modus runtime experience:

```bash
# Start local development server
modus dev

# Build your app
modus build
```

Your local environment includes:

* **Hot reload** for rapid iteration with fast refresh
* **Built-in debugging** with full observability
* **API Explorer** for testing functions and agents interactively
* **Model experimentation** with easy model swapping via Model Router
* **Environment management** with `.env` files

### Local development environment

When you run `modus dev`, you get:

* **Local server** running at `http://localhost:8686`
* **API Explorer** at `http://localhost:8686/explorer` for interactive testing
* **Automatic compilation** of your Go or AssemblyScript code to WebAssembly
* **Fast refresh** that preserves app state during development
* **Environment variable substitution** from `.env.dev.local` files

### Code structure

Apps follow the Modus project structure that scales from simple functions to
complex agent systems:

```text
my-app/
├── main.go              # Functions and agent definitions
├── modus.json           # App configuration and manifest
├── .env.dev.local       # Local environment variables
├── go.mod               # Dependencies (Go projects)
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

### Environment and secrets management

Modus handles environment variables and secrets securely:

```json modus.json
{
  "connections": {
    "external-api": {
      "type": "http",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set your environment variables in `.env.dev.local`:

```text .env.dev.local
MODUS_EXTERNAL_API_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Modus automatically substitutes `{{API_KEY}}` with `MODUS_EXTERNAL_API_API_KEY`
following the naming convention: `MODUS_<CONNECTION_NAME>_<PLACEHOLDER>`.

### Using Hypermode-hosted models

To access Hypermode's Model Router and hosted models locally:

```bash
# Install Hyp CLI for authentication
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli

# Authenticate with Hypermode
hyp login
```

Once authenticated, your local Modus environment automatically connects to
Hypermode's model infrastructure, giving you access to multiple AI models for
development and testing.

## Collaborative development

Both approaches support team collaboration:

### Code-first teams

* Standard Git workflows with branching and pull requests
* Shared development environments
* Code reviews for agent logic and function implementations
* Automated testing and CI/CD integration

### Mixed teams

* Subject matter experts build and refine using Threads (see our Threads
  documentation)
* Developers enhance and ship Modus code
* Seamless handoff between exploration and implementation
* Shared testing environments using `modus dev`

## Testing and debugging

Hypermode provides comprehensive testing tools for both development approaches:

### Built-in testing with Modus

* **API Explorer**: Interactive testing of functions and agents
* **Agent behavior tests**: Verify reasoning and decision-making
* **Function integration tests**: Test external API calls and data processing
* **Memory tests**: Validate state persistence and retrieval
* **End-to-end scenarios**: Test complete workflows

### Observability and debugging

* **Execution tracing**: See every step of agent reasoning
* **Function call monitoring**: Track all external interactions
* **Memory access logs**: Understand how agents use context
* **Performance metrics**: Monitor response times and resource usage
* **Real-time logs**: Debug issues as they happen during development

## Environment management

Apps support multiple environments throughout development:

### Local development

* Full-featured Modus runtime with `modus dev`
* Mock external services for testing
* Hot reload and instant feedback
* Local memory persistence
* API Explorer for interactive testing

Whether you're a developer who prefers code, Hypermode's development experience
provides the tools you need to build production-ready Apps using the power of
the Modus runtime.
