# User Management

> Add and remove users from your organization

Invite team members to your organization in Hypermode. To see who currently has
access to your organization and make changes, select the target organization
from the top navigation and then click **Users**.

## Inviting a user

You can add a new user to join your organization by sending an email invitation.
From the Users tab, click **Invite User**. In the side panel, enter the email
address of the user you wish to invite and click **Invite**.

The user is now listed as `Pending Invitation` in the `Date Joined` column of
the user list.

## Managing invitations

After sending an invitation, the user appears as `Pending Invitation` in the
organization user list.

If the user lost or didn't receive the initial invitation, click **Resend
Invite** from the `...` edit menu within the target user’s row.

If you need to cancel a sent invitation, click **Revoke Invite** from the `...`
edit menu within the target user’s row.

## Removing a user

To remove a user from your organization, identify the user you would like to
remove in the Users tab. Click the `...` to reveal the **Remove User** button.

Removing a user from your organization doesn't delete their Hypermode user
account or impact their access to other organizations.
