# Manage Schema

> Load and update the schema of your graph

  shipping weekly.

When working with Dgraph, defining a schema is optional! Start schema-less and
layer on a DQL or GraphQL-based modeling approach when needed.

## Schema-less default

Graphs running in Hypermode use Dgraph's `flexible` schema mode. This mode
allows you to run a mutation without declaring the predicate in your schema.

When a mutation introduces a new predicate, Dgraph automatically adds it to the
schema. This can be useful when you're in the early stages of a project and the
schema is evolving frequently and for allowing AI agents to augment your
knowledge graph.

## Deploy a DQL schema

To deploy a [DQL schema](/dgraph/dql/schema), place the schema in a file
(`schema.dql` in this case) and make a POST request to the `/dgraph/alter`
endpoint for your host.

```sh
curl -X POST https://<my-database>.hypermode.host/dgraph/alter \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json"  \
    --data-binary "@schema.dql"
```

## Deploy a GraphQL schema

To deploy a [GraphQL schema](/dgraph/graphql/schema/overview), place the schema
in a file (`schema.graphql` in this case) and make a POST request to the
`/dgraph/admin/schema` endpoint for your host.

```sh
curl -X POST https://<my-database>.hypermode.host/dgraph/admin/schema \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json"  \
    --data-binary "@schema.graphql"
```
