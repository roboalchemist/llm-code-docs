# Installing PHP extensions

You may add additional PHP extensions that are not included out of the box with Herd, by installing them via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and [pecl](https://pecl.php.net/). The reason for this is that most of these extension have dependencies and can not be statically compiled, and therefore shipped, with Herd.

## Adding extensions

To install additional extensions via Homebrew, you can compile them with the following commands. At first, Homebrew needs a base PHP for compiling the extension. This base PHP is only used for compiling the extension and Herd keeps using the static binaries, so you can still use the built-in Herd updater for PHP.

```bash  theme={null}
brew install php
```

Once PHP is installed via Homebrew, you may install the extension:

```bash  theme={null}
pecl install [extension-name]
```

This creates an `[extension].so` extension file that you can now activate and use with Laravel Herd.

On an M1/M2 Mac, the extension can be found at `/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl`.
On an Intel Mac, it will be at `/usr/local/lib/php/pecl`.

## Activating extensions

You may activate your custom extensions by editing your `php.ini` file.
This file is located at `~/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/<version>/php.ini.`.

```bash  theme={null}
# Absolute path to the extension.so file
extension=/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20220829/[extension].so
```
