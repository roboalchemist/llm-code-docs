Laravel Herd ships with a powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that can speed up your development process, by providing useful tools to your AI agents.
Your AI agent should make use of the tools automatically (when needed), but you can also manually trigger and use the available tools in your MCP client/IDE.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Herd MCP server is by making use of [Laravel Boost](https://boost.laravel.com). Boost automatically installs the Herd MCP server and makes it available in your IDEs.
If you are not using Boost, you may manually install the Herd MCP server.

## Manual Installation

<Note>While you may install the Herd MCP server globally, we recommend installing it per-project. This way, you gain access to more fine-grained tools which leads to better AI agent results.</Note>

## Manual configuration

This is the standard configuration that works in most MCP clients.
Make sure to replace `YOUR-SITE-PATH` with the base path to your Laravel project or remove the `env` key with the site path if you're using the global installation.

```json  theme={null}
{
    "herd": {
        "command": "php",
        "args": [
            "/Applications/Herd.app/Contents/Resources/herd-mcp.phar"
        ],
        "env": {
            "SITE_PATH": "YOUR-SITE-PATH"
        }
    }
}
```

    Use the Claude Code CLI to add the Herd MCP server. In the root of your project, run the following command:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude mcp add herd php /Applications/Herd.app/Contents/Resources/herd-mcp.phar -e SITE_PATH="$(pwd)"
    ```

    This will automatically set the `SITE_PATH` to the project root.

Start or stop a Herd provided service on your system.

Installs or updates a specific PHP version on your system

**Parameters:**
