# Hybrid search

> Combine semantic and lexical search for better results.

[Semantic search](/guides/search/semantic-search) and [lexical search](/guides/search/lexical-search) are powerful information retrieval techniques, but each has notable limitations. For example, semantic search can miss results based on exact keyword matches, especially in scenarios involving domain-specific terminology, while lexical search can miss results based on relationships, such as synonyms and paraphrases.

This page shows you how to lift these limitations by combining semantic and lexical search. This is often called hybrid search.

## Hybrid search approaches

There are two ways to perform hybrid search in Pinecone:

* [Use separate dense and sparse indexes](#use-separate-dense-and-sparse-indexes). This is the **recommended** approach because it provides the most flexibility.
* [Use a single hybrid index](#use-a-single-hybrid-index). This approach is simpler to implement but doesn't support a few useful features.

The following table summarizes the pros and cons between the two approaches:

| Approach                          | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Cons                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Use separate dense and sparse indexes

This is the recommended way to perform hybrid search in Pinecone. You create separate dense and sparse indexes, upsert dense vectors into the dense index and sparse vectors into the sparse index, and search each index separately. Then you combine and deduplicate the results, use one of Pinecone's [hosted reranking models](/guides/search/rerank-results#reranking-models) to rerank them based on a unified relevance score, and return the most relevant matches.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create dense and sparse indexes">
    [Create a dense index](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-a-dense-index) and [create a sparse index](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-a-sparse-index), either with integrated embedding or for vectors created with external models.

    For example, the following code creates indexes with integrated embedding models.

    ```python Python theme={null}
    from pinecone import Pinecone

    pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

    dense_index_name = "dense-for-hybrid-py"
    sparse_index_name = "sparse-for-hybrid-py"

    if not pc.has_index(dense_index_name):
        pc.create_index_for_model(
            name=dense_index_name,
            cloud="aws",
            region="us-east-1",
            embed={
                "model":"llama-text-embed-v2",
                "field_map":{"text": "chunk_text"}
            }
        )

    if not pc.has_index(sparse_index_name):
        pc.create_index_for_model(
            name=sparse_index_name,
            cloud="aws",
            region="us-east-1",
            embed={
                "model":"pinecone-sparse-english-v0",
                "field_map":{"text": "chunk_text"}
            }
        )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upsert dense and sparse vectors">
    [Upsert dense vectors](/guides/index-data/upsert-data#upsert-dense-vectors) into the dense index and [upsert sparse vectors](/guides/index-data/upsert-data#upsert-sparse-vectors) into the sparse index.

    Make sure to establish a linkage between the dense and sparse vectors so you can merge and deduplicate search results later. For example, the following uses `_id` as the linkage, but you can use any other custom field as well. Because the indexes are integrated with embedding models, you provide the source texts and Pinecone converts them to vectors automatically.

  <Step title="Search the sparse index">
    Perform a [lexical search](/guides/search/lexical-search).

    For example, the following code searches the sparse index for 40 records that most exactly match the words in the query. Again, because the index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the query as text and Pinecone converts the text to a sparse vector automatically.

    ```python Python theme={null}
    sparse_results = sparse_index.search(
        namespace="example-namespace",
        query={
            "top_k": 40,
            "inputs": {
                "text": query
            }
        }
    )

    print(sparse_results)
    ```

  <Step title="Merge and deduplicate the results">
    Merge the 40 dense and 40 sparse results and deduplicated them based on the field you used to link sparse and dense vectors.

    For example, the following code merges and deduplicates the results based on the `_id` field, resulting in 52 unique results.

    ```python Python theme={null}

        """Get the unique hits from two search results and return them as single array of {'_id', 'chunk_text'} dicts, printing each dict on a new line."""

        deduped_hits = {hit['_id']: hit for hit in h1['result']['hits'] + h2['result']['hits']}.values()
        # Sort by _score descending
        sorted_hits = sorted(deduped_hits, key=lambda x: x['_score'], reverse=True)
        # Transform to format for reranking
        result = [{'_id': hit['_id'], 'chunk_text': hit['fields']['chunk_text']} for hit in sorted_hits]
        return result

    merged_results = merge_chunks(sparse_results, dense_results)

    print('[\n   ' + ',\n   '.join(str(obj) for obj in merged_results) + '\n]')

  <Step title="Rerank the results">
    Use one of Pinecone's [hosted reranking models](/guides/search/rerank-results#reranking-models) to rerank the merged and deduplicated results based on a unified relevance score and then return a smaller set of the most highly relevant results.

    For example, the following code sends the 52 unique results from the last step to the `bge-reranker-v2-m3` reranking model and returns the top 10 most relevant results.

    ```python Python theme={null}
    result = pc.inference.rerank(

## Use a single hybrid index

You can perform hybrid search with a single hybrid index as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a hybrid index">
    To store both dense and sparse vectors in a single index, use the [`create_index`](/reference/api/latest/control-plane/create_index) operation, setting the `vector_type` to `dense` and the `metric` to `dotproduct`. This is the only combination that supports dense/sparse search on a single index.

    ```python Python theme={null}
    from pinecone.grpc import PineconeGRPC as Pinecone
    from pinecone import ServerlessSpec

    pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

    index_name = "hybrid-index"

    if not pc.has_index(index_name):
        pc.create_index(
            name=index_name,
            vector_type="dense",
            dimension=1024,
            metric="dotproduct",
            spec=ServerlessSpec(
                cloud="aws",
                region="us-east-1"
            )
        )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate vectors">
    Use Pinecone's [hosted embedding models](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#embedding-models) to [convert data into dense and sparse vectors](/reference/api/latest/inference/generate-embeddings).

  <Step title="Search the hybrid index with explicit weighting">
    Because Pinecone views your sparse-dense vector as a single vector, it does not offer a built-in parameter to adjust the weight of a query's dense part against its sparse part; the index is agnostic to density or sparsity of coordinates in your vectors. You may, however, incorporate a linear weighting scheme by customizing your query vector, as we demonstrate in the function below.

    The following example transforms vector values using an alpha parameter.

    ```Python Python theme={null}
    def hybrid_score_norm(dense, sparse, alpha: float):
        """Hybrid score using a convex combination

        alpha * dense + (1 - alpha) * sparse

        Args:
            dense: Array of floats representing
            sparse: a dict of `indices` and `values`
            alpha: scale between 0 and 1
        """
        if alpha < 0 or alpha > 1:
            raise ValueError("Alpha must be between 0 and 1")
        hs = {
            'indices': sparse['indices'],
            'values':  [v * (1 - alpha) for v in sparse['values']]
        }
        return [v * alpha for v in dense], hs
    ```

    The following example transforms a vector using the above function, then queries a Pinecone index.

    ```Python Python theme={null}
    sparse_vector = {
       'indices': [10, 45, 16],
       'values':  [0.5, 0.5, 0.2]
    }
    dense_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

    hdense, hsparse = hybrid_score_norm(dense_vector, sparse_vector, alpha=0.75)

    query_response = index.query(
        namespace="example-namespace",
        top_k=10,
        vector=hdense,
        sparse_vector=hsparse
    )
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
