# Monitor performance

> Monitor performance metrics in the Pinecone console or with Prometheus or Datadog.

Pinecone generates time-series performance metrics for each Pinecone index. You can monitor these metrics directly in the Pinecone console or with tools like Prometheus or Datadog.

## Monitor in the Pinecone Console

To view performance metrics in the Pinecone console:

1. Open the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects).
2. Select the project containing the index you want to monitor.
3. Go to **Database > Indexes**.
4. Select the index.
5. Go to the **Metrics** tab.

## Monitor with Datadog

To monitor Pinecone with Datadog, use Datadog's [Pinecone integration](/integrations/datadog).

<Note>
  This feature is available on [Standard and Enterprise plans](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/).
</Note>

## Monitor with Prometheus

<Note>
  This feature is available on [Standard and  Enterprise plans](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/). When using [Bring Your Own Cloud](/guides/production/bring-your-own-cloud), you must configure Prometheus monitoring within your VPC.
</Note>

To monitor all serverless indexes in a project, insert the following snippet into the [`scrape_configs`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) section of your `prometheus.yml` file and update it with values for your Prometheus integration:

<Note>
  This method uses [HTTP service discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/) to automatically discover and target all serverless indexes across all regions in a project.
</Note>

```YAML  theme={null}
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'pinecone-serverless-metrics'
    http_sd_configs:
      - url: https://api.pinecone.io/prometheus/projects/PROJECT_ID/metrics/discovery
        refresh_interval: 1m
        authorization:
          type: Bearer
          credentials: API_KEY
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: API_KEY
```

* Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the unique ID of the project you want to monitor. You can [find the project ID](/guides/projects/understanding-projects#project-ids) in the Pinecone console.

* Replace both instances of `API_KEY` with an API key for the project you want to monitor. The first instance is for service discovery, and the second instance is for the discovered targets. If necessary, you can [create an new API key](/guides/projects/manage-api-keys) in the Pinecone console.

For more configuration details, see the [Prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).
