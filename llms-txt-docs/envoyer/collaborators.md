# Collaborators

> Manage who can collaborate on your projects.

## Overview

Collaborators can be added to projects to help manage projects and deployments. Note that collaborators are not permitted to invite additional collaborators or delete a project.

<Note>
  In addition, you can invite collaborators to your project who do not have a paid Envoyer subscription plan. This means that your company or team only need one active subscription to Envoyer.
</Note>

## Inviting Collaborators

On a project's **Collaborators** tab, you can click the **Add Collaborator** button. Envoyer will present you with a modal dialog window asking for the email address of the collaborator you wish to add. The email address must belong to a registered Envoyer user.

<Info>
  Only project owners are able to manage project collaborators.
