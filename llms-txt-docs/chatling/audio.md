> Learn about the Audio block and how to set it up in the builder

The Audio block allows you to play an audio file to the user in the conversation. It can be used for various purposes, such as playing a welcome message, providing information, or playing music.

## Adding an audio file

To add an audio file, you can either upload an audio file directly or provide a link to a file hosted online. The supported audio formats are `MP3`, `WAV`, and `OGG`.

You can enable the `Autoplay` option to automatically play the audio file when the block is displayed to the user.
