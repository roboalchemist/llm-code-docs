# Playground

The Playground is your sandbox to experiment with your AI agent in real time. You can tweak core settings—like AI model, enabled actions, temperature, and instructions—then chat with the agent to see exactly how those changes affect behavior.

You can also run side-by-side comparisons of up to 5 instances of your agent, each with different settings, to quickly identify the configuration that performs best.

## How to compare multiple variations of your agent?

To test with different variations of your agent, click the `Compare` button in the top right corner of the playground. A new instance of your agent will be created with default settings.

You can then tweak the settings of the new instance and chat with it to see how it performs.

All inputs to agents are synced between the instances, so you can see how the agent behaves with different settings. If you want to disable this, you can toggle the `Sync` button above one of the agents.

To remove an agent, click the `X` button above it.
