* **Headers** (optional): Data to be sent as the headers of the request, such as Content-Type and Authorization.

### `Test Request`

Run a live test with sample input values to confirm that it's working.

The request must succeed before the action can be created. A request is considered successful if it returns a 2xx status code and a valid JSON response.


# AI Actions
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai-agent/actions/introduction



Actions unlock the true power of AI Agents. Instead of only generating replies, the agent can actively carry out tasks during a conversation. This might involve saving details of potential leads, interacting with external systems to fetch or store data, creating support tickets, and more.

By using actions, you give your agent the power to handle practical steps on its own. This transforms the chatbot experience from a simple Q\&A into an interactive assistant that can streamline processes, save time, and improve outcomes for both your team and your users.

## Available Actions

* **[Lead Form](/ai-agent/actions/lead-form)**: displays a form to collect the user's details and save them as a contact.
* **[Buttons](/ai-agent/actions/buttons)**: displays a set of buttons in the chat, such as URL buttons to open a webpage or text buttons to send preset replies that keep the flow moving.
* **[HTTP Request](/ai-agent/actions/http-request)**: sends a request to an external API to fetch or store data, or perform an action. This allows you to connect your agent to external tools and services.
* **[Cal.com Booking Widget](/ai-agent/actions/cal-booking)**: Lets users book appointments directly within the chat.
* **[Send Email](/ai-agent/actions/send-email)**: sends a custom email to any recipient.

## How to create an action

1. Go to your AI agent's dashboard.
2. Click on the `Actions` menu from the sidebar.
3. Click the `New` button.

# 1. Fetch and Email Order Confirmation
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai-agent/actions/tutorials/fetch-and-email-order-confirmation



In this tutorial, you'll build a simple but real-world flow that (1) fetches order data from an API via the [HTTP Request action](/ai-agent/actions/http-request), and (2) sends an email confirmation to the user with the [Send Email action](/ai-agent/actions/send-email).

By the end, your agent will automatically collect the user's email and order number, call your API to verify and fetch the order, and deliver a personalized confirmation email.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/send-email-action-sample-chat.jpg" width="350" alt="Send Email action preview" />

## Setup Guide

1. Open your agent dashboard and go to Actions.

2. Click the `New` button and choose `HTTP Request`.

3. Set up the action as follows:

**Action name**: get\_order

**When to use**: When user asks to get an email of their order confirmation, first use this action to fetch the order before using email\_order\_confirmation.

**Frequency**: Whenever applicable

**Input parameters**: Add the parameters that are required to fetch the user's order. In this case, we will add the following parameters:

* `email`: The email address of the order. Save it to a variable, such as "email".
* `order_number`: The user's order number. Save it to a variable, such as "order\_number".

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/tutorial-1-http-request-input-parameters.jpg" width="600" alt="input parameters" />

**Request**: Configure the request by defining the API URL, method, payload, and headers that will be used to fetch the user's order.

For this tutorial, we'll use a dummy API that returns an order. However, in a real app, you'd point the HTTP Request to your own or third-party API, include auth (e.g., Bearer token), and the relevant payload such as the user's email and order number.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/tutorial-1-http-request-configuration.jpg" width="450" alt="HTTP Request configuration" />

4. Click the `Test Request` button to verify that the request runs successfully and that the agent receives a valid JSON response.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/tutorial-1-test-http-request.jpg" width="450" alt="test http request" />

5. Click `Create action` to save the action.
6. Go back to the `Actions` page.
7. Click the `New` button and choose `Send Email`.
8. Set up the action as follows:

**Action name**: email\_order\_confirmation

**When to use**: Use this action to send the order confirmation to the user. First use the get\_order action to get the user's order, then use this action to email the order confirmation to the user.

**Frequency**: Whenever applicable

**Input parameters**: We'll add the following parameters that are required to send the email:

* `email`:
  * Description: The email address where the order confirmation should be sent.
  * Save to variable: email
* `order_number`:
  * Description: The order number of the user's order.
  * Save to variable: order\_number
* `order_details`:
  * Description: The details of the order that you retrieve from the get\_order action. Format it as HTML with bullet points.
  * Save to variable: order\_details

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/tutorial-1-send-email-input-parameters.jpg" width="600" alt="input parameters" />

**Email Setup**: configure the email as follows:

* Sender name: A name of your choice, for example `Apple`
* To: Type in `{{email}}` and press Enter to use the email address of the user.
* Subject: `Order confirmation for #{{order_number}}`
* Message:

```
Hi there!

As requested, here is your confirmation for order #​{{order_number}}​:

​{{order_details}}​
```

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/tutorial-1-email-setup.jpg" width="600" alt="email setup" />

9. Click the `Create action` button to save the action.

## Test the actions

Now that you've set up the actions, it's time to test them.

From the `Actions` page, enable both the actions.

Go to the `Playground` page to start a chat with your agent. Ask the agent to email your order confirmation. It should fetch the order details from the API and email the order confirmation to the email address you specify.

Here's an example of how the agent would respond:

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/send-email-action-sample-chat.jpg" width="350" alt="Send Email action preview" />


# AI settings
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai-agent/ai-settings



To configure the agent's AI settings, click the `Settings` button in the sidebar and select `AI`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/access-agent-ai-settings.jpg" width="450" alt="Agent AI settings" />

## Available settings

### AI Model

The AI model that the agent will use to think, plan, and generate answers to the user queries.

Every model has different capabilities and costs. We recommend testing with different models in the [Playground](/ai-agent/playground) to see which one works best for your agent.

### Temperature

Controls randomness/creativity in the Agent's writing and decision-making.

Lower = more deterministic; Higher = more varied.

* **0.0-0.3 (Precise)**: Best for support, policy-bound replies, data extraction, or when strict adherence to facts and formats is required.

* **0.4-0.6 (Balanced)**: Good general setting for helpful responses with light creativity.

* **0.7-1.0 (Creative)**: Use for brainstorming, marketing copy, or when variety is desirable. Expect less consistency.

**Tips**

* If your Agent must follow exact steps (e.g., collecting parameters for an HTTP Request), keep temperature low.
* Raise temperature only where tone/creativity matters and accuracy isn't compromised.

### Instructions

Define the Agent's role, goals, guardrails, and style (often called the "system prompt").

Here's some of the things you can include in the instructions:

* **Role & purpose**: What the Agent is for and what success looks like.
* **Scope & boundaries**: What it should/shouldn't answer.
* **Tone & language**: Brand voice, formality level, and multilingual behavior (auto-detect language; reply in user's language).
* **Compliance & safety**: Any legal disclaimers, restricted topics, PII handling, and masking sensitive values.
* **Formatting**: Preferred reply structure (short summaries, bullet points, tables).

# AI Agent
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai-agent/introduction



AI Agents are intelligent, configurable assistants that can understand user intent, take actions, and deliver outcomes—not just answers.

An Agent combines your instructions, knowledge, and integrations to hold natural conversations, collect the right data, and execute tasks like creating tickets, checking order status, or showing buttons for next steps.

You can train AI Agents on your own data, such as your company website, documents, policies, and more, to deliver accurate and relevant responses to your users.

## Typical use cases

* **Customer support**: Answer FAQs, verify orders, troubleshoot issues, create/route tickets, and surface KB answers with links.
* **Sales & lead gen**: Qualify prospects, save leads, book appointments and demos, and push them into your CRM.
* **Account tasks**: Update profiles, check balances/usage, manage subscriptions, and more (with your APIs).

## Key features

* **Train on your data**: Ingest your website, docs, FAQs, policies, or third-party knowledge bases (Zoho, Zendesk) to train the AI Agent.
* **AI Actions**: Actively carries out tasks during a conversation, such as collecting user's details, displaying buttons, interacting with external APIs and services, and more.
* **No-code builder**: Create and manage Agents without technical expertise.
* **Simple installation**: Drop the widget on any site (WordPress, Squarespace, Shopify, etc.) with a single line of widget code.
* **Lead capture & CRM sync**: Collect contacts or push to your CRM via Zapier.
* **Multilingual AI**: Auto-detect and reply in the user's language.
* **Playground**: Safely test, iterate, and roll out changes.
* **Analytics & monitoring**: Track conversations, leads, top pages, and fine-tune answers.
* **Security & compliance**: GDPR-ready; encryption in transit and at rest.
* **AI model choice**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more.

## How does it differ from AI Chatbots?

Chatbots rely on prebuilt flows whereas AI Agents plan steps dynamically based on context and your rules—no rigid flow design required. They can decide on the tasks to carry out while conversing with users.


# Playground
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai-agent/playground



The Playground is your sandbox to experiment with your AI agent in real time. You can tweak core settings—like AI model, enabled actions, temperature, and instructions—then chat with the agent to see exactly how those changes affect behavior.

You can also run side-by-side comparisons of up to 5 instances of your agent, each with different settings, to quickly identify the configuration that performs best.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/agent-playground.jpg" width="600" alt="AI Agent Playground" />

## How to compare multiple variations of your agent?

To test with different variations of your agent, click the `Compare` button in the top right corner of the playground. A new instance of your agent will be created with default settings.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/compare-agents.jpg" width="600" alt="Compare different variations of your agent" />

You can then tweak the settings of the new instance and chat with it to see how it performs.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/playground-compare-multiple-agents.jpg" width="600" alt="Compare multiple variations of your agent" />

All inputs to agents are synced between the instances, so you can see how the agent behaves with different settings. If you want to disable this, you can toggle the `Sync` button above one of the agents.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/playground-sync-agents.jpg" width="600" alt="Sync agents" />

To remove an agent, click the `X` button above it.

# AI credits
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai/ai-credits

Understanding AI credits and how they are consumed

AI credits are used to manage and track AI usage. These credits are consumed each time a chatbot or AI agent generates an AI response.

The number of credits consumed per response varies based on the AI model you use. Below's a breakdown of credit usage by model.

<Note>
  For chatbots, credits are not consumed for normal messages sent and received by users. It is only used when the chatbot uses AI to generate responses (such as when you use the [AI block](/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response)).
</Note>

## Credits usage by AI model

* Claude Sonnet 4.5: 3 credits
* Claude Haiku 4.5: 2 credits
* Claude Sonnet 4: 3 credits
* Claude Opus 4: 15 credits
* Claude Haiku 3.5: 2 credits
* Gemini 2.5 Pro: 1.5 credit

# Fixing incorrect AI answers
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/ai/fix-incorrect-answers

Learn how to fix incorrect AI responses using the fine-tuning feature in Chatling.

Although the AI is trained on the data you add to the knowledge base, it may not always get the answer right, such as when it's asked a question that is not in the knowledge base or when it hallucinates.

To fix this, you can use the fine-tuning feature on Chatling's conversations page. This feature is designed to help improve the chatbot's performance by refining incorrect responses.

When you're viewing a conversation, you'll see a "Fine-tune this answer" button below every AI response. This feature allows you to fix incorrect AI responses so that it will learn to answer correctly in the future.

## How to use the fine-tuning feature

1. From the chatbot dashboard, click on the "Conversations" menu.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-chatbot-conversations.jpg" alt="Open conversations page from chatbot dashboard" width="350" />

2. Find and open a conversation where the AI has responded incorrectly.

3. Click the `Fine-tune this answer` button below the AI response you want to fix.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/click-finetune-answer-button.jpg" alt="Click the fine-tune answer button" width="350" />

4. A dialog will appear where you can edit the AI's answer or replace it with a correct one.

# API Introduction
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/api-reference/v2/intro

The Chatling API allows you to manage your chatbots programmatically.

Integrate Chatling into your application or interact with your chatbots programmatically using our API.

This documentation guides you through creating your API key, authenticating requests, and sending requests to the API.

## Generate your API key

To send requests to the API, you must include your API key. Here's how to create it:

1. Go to your Chatling account and open the Project Settings.
2. Click the API Keys tab.
3. Press the `New API key` button.
4. Enter a name for the key and press `Generate key`.
5. Copy the newly created key. For security purposes, the API key will be displayed once only. Note it down and store it in a secure place.

If you forget your API key, you must delete it and generate a new one.

## Authentication

Your API key acts as the Bearer token and must be supplied in the `Authorization` header of every request.

<Accordion title="Example">
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
  ```
</Accordion>

## Retrieving the chatbot ID

Some endpoints require that you pass a chatbot ID as the path parameter. Here's a couple of ways to retrieve it:

* **Recommended method**: Using the `List chatbots` endpoint, you can fetch all the chatbots along with their IDs.
* Open the chatbot's settings in your account and you will find its ID listed there.

# Rate limiting
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/api-reference/v2/rate-limiting

Our API has rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

We enforce rate limits to balance the load on our servers and provide a fair environment for all developers to interact with the Chatling API.

Therefore, the number of requests you send to the API will be measured and throttled if you surpass the allowed rate limit.

## Rate limit

The default rate limit is **300 API calls per minute** for each API key. We may adjust these limits in the future.

When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 status code with the following response:

```json  theme={null}
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Too many requests"
}
```

## When does the rate limit reset?

The rate limit lasts 1 minute, and the number of requests you've sent within that window will reset at the next minute.

# Instructions
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/ai/instructions

A guide on what AI Instructions are and how to use them.

Instructions are a way to provide guidance to the AI on how to respond.

You can use instructions to tailor the AI's responses to your specific needs, such as providing more detailed responses, using a specific tone, have a specific personality, or avoiding certain topics.

Here are a few examples:

* Your name is "Joanne" and you are our customer support assistant. When referring to yourself, do not mention anything about being an AI assistant or AI model. Instead, refer to yourself as "Joanne".
* Keep your answers short and to the point, and do not provide unnecessary information.
* Use a friendly and casual tone when responding to users.
* You must act as a professional customer support agent. NEVER break character.
* When responding in English, use American English spelling and grammar.
* Promote special offers or promotions when appropriate. For example, if a customer asks about a product, you can mention that we have a store-wide promotion of 50% off.
* Limit your answers to a maximum of 5 sentences.
* You are a lead generation assistant for a Digital Marketing agency and you are communicating with a prospective customer.
* Do not discuss politics, religion, or any other sensitive topics.

## How to add instructions

The method for adding instructions depends on the [Response Source](/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response#what-is-the-response-source) that you've set for the [AI Response](/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response) block.

### Response Source: Knowledge Base

# Setting the AI model
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/ai/set-ai-model

Learn how to set the LLM model used by the AI.

There are various [AI models](/ai/supported-ai-models) available in Chatling that you can use to generate responses for your chatbot.

We recommend testing with different models to see which one works best for your chatbot and provides the most accurate responses. Each model uses a different amount of credits per response.

## How to set the AI model?

The method for choosing the AI model depends on the [Response Source](/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response#what-is-the-response-source) that you've set for the [AI Response](/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response) block.

Below are the instructions based on the response source you've selected.

### 1. Response Source: Knowledge Base

If you are using the Knowledge Base as the response source, you can set the AI model using the [AI Configuration menu](/chatbot/builder/sidebar#ai-configuration) in the Builder's sidebar.

1. Click on the AI Configuration menu in the sidebar.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-ai-configuration-menu-from-sidebar.jpg" alt="Open AI Configuration menu from sidebar" width="350" />

2. Go to `Settings`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/ai-configuration-settings-menu-sidebar.jpg" alt="Open Settings page from AI Configuration sidebar menu" width="350" />

3. Select the AI model you want to use from the dropdown list.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/set-ai-model-kb-ai-configuration-sidebar.jpg" alt="Select AI model in AI Configuration settings sidebar menu" width="350" />

Once you've selected the AI model, all AI Response blocks that use the Knowledge Base as the response source will use this model to generate responses.

#### Setting the model on a per-block basis

If you want to set the AI model on a per-block basis, you can do so by opening the AI Response block's editor and settings the `Model` option. This will override the default model set in the AI Configuration settings.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/override-ai-model-setting-kb-ai-response.jpg" alt="Override AI model setting in AI Response block" width="450" />

### 2. Response Source: AI Model

If you are using the "AI Model" as the response source, you can set the AI model from the block's editor using the `Model` option.

# Quick Replies
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/block-options/quick-replies



Quick replies are messages that will help users respond quickly without having to type out a full response. They are displayed as buttons above the input field and users can click on them to send a message.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/quick-reply-demo.gif" alt="Quick Replies demo" width="300" />

## Supported blocks

Quick replies are available for the following Capture Response blocks:

* Text
* Number
* Email
* URL

## Setting up Quick Replies

Here's how to add quick replies to a supported block:

* Open the block editor for a block that supports quick replies.
* Under the "Quick Replies" section, click `Add` to add a new quick reply.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/quick-replies-editor.jpeg" alt="Add a quick reply" width="300" />

* Enter the label for the quick reply. This is the text that will be displayed on the button.
* Enter the message that will be sent when the user clicks on the quick reply button.

For example if the label is "Pricing" and the message is "Tell me about your pricing", the user will see a button with the text "Pricing" and when they click on it, the message "Tell me about your pricing" will be sent.


# Voice Input
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/block-options/voice-input

Allow users to speak to your chatbot using Voice Input.

Voice Input is a speech-to-text feature that allows users to record voice messages and transcribes them into text. Rather than typing their message, users can speak to your chatbot and it will automatically be converted to text.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/voice-input-demo.gif" alt="Voice Input demo" width="450" />

## Supported blocks

Currently, Voice Input is available for the Text input block only.

## How to enable Voice Input

Open the block editor for a Text input block and toggle on the "Voice Input" option.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/enable-voice-input-toggle.jpg" alt="Enable Voice Input" width="300" />

The chatbot will then display a microphone icon when the block is displayed. Users can click on the microphone icon to record a voice message.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/chatbot-voice-input-icon.jpg" alt="Chatbot Voice Input" width="300" />

## What happens when I run out of Speech to Text credits?

When you're out of credits, the voice recording icon will be removed and users will not be able to access the feature. You can upgrade your plan to increase the credits limit or wait until the next billing cycle for the credits to reset.


# Create Contact Block
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/create-contact

Learn about the Create Contact block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The `Create Contact` block can be used to save a user's information as a contact. All saved contacts are displayed on the `Contacts` page in your dashboard.

When a contact is created, it is associated with the user and the information persists across multiple chat sessions. The information can be used to personalize the conversation, skip repetitive questions, and tailor the flow accordingly.

The block consists of the following components:

* **Contact details**: Define which fields you want to collect and save—such as first name, email, etc. These can be mapped from variables captured in the conversation flow (e.g. from a form or user input).
* **Deduplication**: Allows you to define how Chatling handles duplicate contacts during the creation process.


# Delete Contact Block
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/delete-contact

Learn about the Delete Contact block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The `Delete Contact` block can be used to delete a contact and dissociate it from the user.

The block consists of the following components:

* **Search**: Specify the field and value to use to look up the contact. You can enter a variable to search dynamically.


# Get Contact Block
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/get-contact

Learn about the Get Contact block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The `Get Contact` block can be used to retrieve a contact's information.

The block consists of the following components:

* **Search**: Specify the field and value to use to look up the contact. You can enter a variable to search dynamically.
* **Contact details**: Define the properties to retrieve and the variables to store the values in.


# HTTP Request Block
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/http-request

Learn about the HTTP Request block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The HTTP Request block is used to send HTTP requests to external APIs and services. You can use it to fetch data, send data, or perform other actions by interacting with APIs.

The block consists of the following components:

* **Request method**: The HTTP method to use for the request, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
* **URL**: The URL of the API endpoint to send the request to.
* **Request options**: You can configure additional options for the request, such as headers, query parameters, and request body.
* **Capture Response**: You can capture the responses from the API and store them a variable. The response must be in JSON format.

## Method and URL

In order to send a request, you must provide the endpoint URL and select the appropriate request method. The following request methods are supported:

* **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
* **POST**: Send data to the server.
* **PUT**: Update data on the server.
* **PATCH**: Partially update data on the server.
* **DELETE**: Delete data from the server.

As an example, an endpoint URL might look like this:

`https://openlibrary.org/works/OL45804W.json`

## Request Options

When sending requests to external APIs, you may need to provide additional options such as headers, query parameters, and request body. Here are the available options:

* **Headers**: You can set headers for the request, such as Content-Type, Authorization, and Accept.
* **Query Params**: The URL query parameters to include for the request.
* **Request Body**: The request payload which can be passed as form data, form URL encoded, or raw JSON.

### How to use variables in JSON payload

To use variables in the request payload, you must enclose the variable's name in double curly braces within quotes. Here's an example:

```json  theme={null}
{
    "name": "{{contact_name}}",
    "age": 21,
    "email": "{{contact_email}}"
}
```

Some points to note:

* Make sure that the variables exist and that their name is correct. Otherwise, they will not be replaced with the actual value.
* If you change a variable's name, you must also update the JSON payload to reflect the change.
* Variables must be enclosed in double curly braces as shown in the example above.

## Capture Response

Responses from the API can be captured and stored in one or more variables. In order for this to work, the response from the endpoint must be in JSON format.

Click the `Add` button to add a new row for capturing a value. You must specify the key and the variable where the value will be stored.

The naming convention for the key is as follows:

* **Top level data**: use the key, such as name or age.
* **Nested data**: use dot notation, such as user.name or profile.address.city.
* **Array data**: use the index, such as users\[0].name or countries\[1].cities\[0].population.

Let's take a look at an example. Below is a sample JSON response from an API endpoint:

```json  theme={null}
{
    "title": "Fantastic Mr Fox",
    "permalink": "/works/OL45804W",
    "authors": [
    {
        "author": {
            "name": "Roald Dahl"
        },
    }
    ],
    "description": "The main character of Fantastic Mr. Fox is an extremely clever anthropomorphized fox named Mr. Fox. He lives with his wife and four little foxes. In order to feed his family, he steals food from the cruel, brutish farmers named Boggis, Bunce, and Bean every night.\r\n\r\nFinally tired of being constantly outwitted by Mr. Fox, the farmers attempt to capture and kill him. The foxes escape in time by burrowing deep into the ground. The farmers decide to wait outside the hole for the foxes to emerge. Unable to leave the hole and steal food, Mr. Fox and his family begin to starve. Mr. Fox devises a plan to steal food from the farmers by tunneling into the ground and borrowing into the farmer's houses.\r\n\r\nAided by a friendly Badger, the animals bring the stolen food back and Mrs. Fox prepares a great celebratory banquet attended by the other starving animals and their families. Mr. Fox invites all the animals to live with him underground and says that he will provide food for them daily thanks to his underground passages. All the animals live happily and safely, while the farmers remain waiting outside in vain for Mr. Fox to show up.",
    "meta": {
        "published_at": "1970-06-01"
    },
}
```

To capture the title, date of publication, and author name from the response, you would use the following keys:

* **Title**: `title`
* **Published date**: `meta.published_at`
* **Author Name**: `authors[0].author.name`

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/http-request-capture-response-example.png" alt="HTTP Request capture response example" width="300" />

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/add-additional-variable-to-set-variable-block.jpg" alt="Add additional variable" width="350" />

## Example

Let's say you're building a lead generation chatbot for a real estate brokerage. You want to prompt the AI to ask the customer three questions about their requirements and forward the answers to the team. You can do this by using a counter variable that increments each time the user answers a question.

Below is a sample flow that demonstrates how to use the Set Variable block.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/set-variable-real-estate-example-chatbot-flow-1.png" alt="Real estate sample chatbot flow using Set Variable block" />

We're using a variable called `counter` to keep track of the number of questions that have been asked. This variable is incremented by 1 each time the user answers a question.

Then, we're using the Condition block to check if the counter is greater or equal to 3. If it is, a message is displayed to inform the user that their inquiry has been forwarded to the team. Else, the AI asks the next question.


# Update Contact Block
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/update-contact

Learn about the Update Contact block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The `Update Contact` block can be used to update an existing contact.

The block consists of the following components:

* **Search**: Specify the field and value to use to look up the contact. You can enter a variable to search dynamically.
* **Contact details**: Define the properties you want to update.


# AI Response Block
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response

Learn about the AI Response block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The AI Response block is used for generating responses to user input using AI. It can provide answers based on the information you have added to the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base/overview) or from the AI's pretrained data.

The AI uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the user's input and generate relevant responses.

## What is the "Response Source"?

The Response Source determines where the AI will look for answers to user queries. You can choose from the following options:

* **Knowledge Base**: The AI will search the data you've uploaded to the Knowledge Base for the relevant information and return the corresponding answer.
* **AI Model**: The AI will use its pretrained data to generate a response based on the user's query. This is ideal for a general-purpose AI that can answer a wide range of questions without limiting its responses to the data in the knowledge base.

## Configurations for Knowledge Base Response Source

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/ai-knowledge-base-response-source-settings.png" alt="AI block knowledge base settings" />

When you select the "Knowledge Base" as the Response Source, you can configure the following settings:

* **Question**: The user's input or query that the AI will process to generate a response. You can use variables to make the question dynamic. For example, you can capture the user's input using a Text input block and store it in a variable called `user_input`. Then, you can use this variable in the "Question" field to make the AI response dynamic.
* **Store response in variable**: You can store the AI response in a variable to use it in other blocks.
* **Stream**: When enabled, the AI response will be streamed to the user in real-time as it is generated. This provides a more interactive experience for the user.
  * When Stream is enabled, some features that require post-processing, such as "Not Found path" will be disabled.
* **Not Found path**: The path to follow if the AI does not find a relevant answer in the Knowledge Base.
* **Model**: The AI model to use for generating responses.
* **Language**: The language in which the AI will respond to the user. If you set it to "Auto," the AI will detect the language of the user's input and respond in the same language.
  * If you want the AI to respond in a certain dialect or accent, you can specify it in Instructions section of the [AI Configuration](/chatbot/builder/sidebar#ai-configuration).
* **Temperature**: The randomness of the AI's responses. A higher temperature value will result in more diverse and creative responses, while a lower value will produce more accurate responses.

### What does "Use global AI settings" mean?

When you set an option, such as the AI model, language, or temperature to "Use global AI settings", the AI will use the settings defined in the [AI Configuration](/chatbot/builder/sidebar#ai-configuration) menu in the [sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar). This allows you to define global settings that will be applied to all AI blocks in your bot.

## Configurations for AI Model Response Source

When you set the Response Source to "AI Model", you can configure the following settings:

* **Prompt**: The message or query that the AI will use to generate a response. You can use variables to make the prompt dynamic.
* **Store response in variable**: You can store the AI response in a variable to use it in other blocks.
* **Instructions**: Additional instructions for the AI to follow when generating a response. For example, you can specify its personality, tone, or style, or provide specific context for the response.
* **Model**: The AI model to use for generating responses.
* **Max Length**: Maximum number of tokens to generate, shared between the prompt and the response. One token is roughly 4 characters.
* **Temperature**: Randomness of the AI's responses. A higher temperature value will result in more diverse and creative responses, while a lower value will produce more focused and deterministic responses.
* **Top P**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered.
* **Frequency Penalty**: How much to penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far. Decreases the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
* **Presence Penalty**: How much to penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far. Increases the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

## How to set up the AI block to respond from the knowledge base?

Here's a high level overview of how the AI generates responses using the knowledge base:

* The user inputs a question or query, which is saved in a variable of your choice.
* The stored input is passed to the AI which uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the user's query and the context of the conversation.
* The AI searches the knowledge base for relevant information.
* The AI generates the response and displays it to the user.

To set up the AI block, follow these steps:

1. Add a Text input block to the canvas. We'll use this block to capture the user's input and store it in a variable so it can be passed to the AI block.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/add-text-input-block-to-canvas.gif" alt="Adding text input block to the builder" />

2. Click on the Text block to open the editor. In the `Store answer in variable` field, enter a variable where the user's input will be stored. In this example, we'll create and use a variable called `user_query`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/create-new-variable.jpg" alt="Storing user input in a variable" width="350" />

3. Next, drag and drop the AI Response block onto the canvas.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/setting-up-ai-kb-response.jpg" alt="Setting up AI block for knowledge base response" width="350" />

4. Connect the Text input block to the AI block by dragging the connector from the Text block to the AI block.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/setting-up-ai-kb-response-1.gif" alt="Connecting text input to AI block" />

5. Click the AI Response block to open the editor. In the `Question` field, enter the variable where the user's input is stored. In step 2, we used the `user_query` variable, so we'll enter `{user_query}` in the Question field.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/setting-up-ai-kb-response-2.jpg" alt="Setting up AI block for knowledge base response" width="350" />

6. Set up the global AI settings by going to the `AI Configuration` in the sidebar. You can define settings such as the AI model, instructions, language, and business name.

7. Lastly, set up the block connections accordingly. For example, a setup like below will allow the user to continually ask questions and receive responses from the AI.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/setting-up-ai-kb-response-3.png" alt="Setting up AI block for knowledge base response" width="650" />

Learn how to use the Language condition block in Chatling

The Language condition block is used to define flows based on the user's browser language. This can be useful for creating multilingual bots that respond in the user's preferred language.

Let's say you want to create a bot that supports English, Spanish, and French languages. You can use the Language condition block to define different responses or actions based on the user's preferred language setting in their browser.

Below is an example of such a flow. The Else path is a fallback for users whose language is not supported by the bot. In this case, it falls back to the English language.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/condition/overview

Learn about the condition blocks and how to use them

Condition blocks are used to create conditional logic in your bot. You can use it to check if a certain condition is met and then perform different actions based on the result.

Similar to an "if-else" statement in programming, condition blocks evaluate a condition and executes different paths based on whether the condition is true or false.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/condition-block.jpeg" alt="Condition block" width="500" />

## Types of condition blocks

There are two types of condition blocks available in Chatling:

* [**Variable**](./variable): Compares a variable with a value or another variable.
* **Language**: Checks if the user's language matches a specific language. Useful for creating multilingual bots.

## How do condition blocks work?

Condition blocks consist of two main parts:

* **Conditions**: The conditions that the block will evaluate. You can use variables, languages, comparison operators, and logical operators to create complex conditions.
* **Paths**: The paths that the block will follow based on the result of the conditions. Every condition you add will have a corresponding path that the block will follow if the condition is true.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/condition-block-components.jpeg" alt="Condition block components" width="600" />

Here's an example of how a condition block works:

1. The block evaluates conditions in the order they are added.
2. If a condition is true, the block follows the path associated with that condition.
3. If none of the conditions are true, the block follows the "Else" path.

## The Else condition

The `Else` condition is executed if none of the other conditions are met. You can use it to define a fallback path that the block will follow if none of the other conditions are true.

## Comparison operators

Conditions support a variety of comparison operators that you can use to compare values. Here are some of the operators you can use:

* **Equals**: Checks if the variable is equal to the value.
* **Not equals**: Checks if the variable is not equal to the value.
* **Contains**: Checks if the variable contains the value.
* **Not contains**: Checks if the variable does not contain the value.
* **Greater than or equals**: Checks if the variable is greater than or equal to the value.
* **Less than**: Checks if the variable is less than the value.
* **Less than or equals**: Checks if the variable is less than or equal to the value.
* **Starts with**: Checks if the variable starts with the value.
* **Ends with**: Checks if the variable ends with the value.
* **Is empty**: Checks if the variable is empty.
* **Is not empty**: Checks if the variable is not empty.

## Group and child conditions

Conditions are grouped together to create complex logic using logical operators like "AND" and "OR". Every group contains one or more conditions that are evaluated together.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/group-and-child-conditions.jpg" alt="Group and child conditions" />

Conditions within a group are evaluated together to determine if the group is true or false. You can use logical operators such as "AND" and "OR" to combine conditions within a group.

For example, you can create a group with two conditions and set it to "AND" to require both conditions to be true for the group to be true. On the other hand, you can set it to "OR" to require only one of the conditions to be true for the group to be true.

By default, condition blocks have one group with one condition. To add additional groups, click the `Add group condition` button.

## Logical operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditions within a group. You can choose from the following logical operators:

* **AND**: Requires all conditions in the group to be true for the group to be true.
* **OR**: Requires at least one condition in the group to be true for the group to be true.

<Accordion title="Example">
  - Group 1:
    * Condition 1: Variable A equals 5
    * Condition 2: Variable B equals 10
    * Logical operator: AND

  - Group 2:
    * Condition 1: Variable C contains "hello"
    * Condition 2: Variable D contains "world"
    * Logical operator: OR

  In this example, Group 1 will be true only if Variable A equals 5 and Variable B equals 10. Group 2 will be true if either Variable C contains "hello" or Variable D contains "world".
</Accordion>


# Variable
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/condition/variable

Learn how to use the Variable condition block in Chatling

The Variable condition block is used to compare a variable with a value or another variable. You can use it to create conditional logic in your bot based on user inputs, stored values, or system variables.

## Components of a variable condition

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/variable-condition-components.jpg" alt="Components of a variable condition" width="400" />

* **Label**: A descriptive label for the condition, which will be displayed in the block on the canvas. This is optional and can be skipped.
* **Variable**: The variable or value that the block will evaluate. The variable can be a user input, a stored value, or a system variable.
* **Comparison operator**: The operator that the block will use to compare the variable with the value you specify. You can choose from a list of comparison operators, such as "equals," "greater than," "contains," etc.
* **Value**: The value that the block will compare with the variable. This can be a static value or a variable for dynamic comparisons.

## Examples

### 1. Real estate bot

In a real estate bot, you can use conditions to check if the user is looking to buy or rent a property and display properties accordingly.

You can create two conditions:

* Condition 1: User input contains "buy"
* Condition 2: User input contains "rent"

Here's how to set it up in the editor:

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/real-estate-bot-condition-setup-example.jpeg" alt="Real estate conditions setup example" width="400" />

Once you have set up the conditions, you can define the paths for each condition. Here's an example:

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/real-estate-bot-condition-block-example-1.png" alt="Real estate conditions example" />

Based on the above, here's how the bot will respond:

* If the user input contains "buy," the bot will respond with `Great! Let me show you our available properties for sale`.
* If the user input contains "rent," the bot will respond with `Sure! We've got amazing properties for rent. Here's the list`.
* Else if none of the conditions are met, the bot will respond with `I'm sorry, I didn't understand. Please respond by typing "Buy" or "Rent"`.

### 2. Filtering job application candidates

Let's say a candidate is applying for a job through the bot and you want to qualify them based on the following criteria:

* Location: New York
* Willing to relocate: Yes
* Years of experience: 3 or more

You can set up the following conditions:

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/job-application-condition-setup.png" alt="Job application conditions setup" />

Once you have set up the conditions, you can define the paths for each condition. Here's an example:

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/job-application-condition-block.png" alt="Job application condition block" />

Based on the above, here's how the bot will respond:

* If the candidate is from New York, willing to relocate, and has 3 or more years of experience, the bot will respond with `Congratulations! You've been shortlisted for the next round of interviews`.
* Otherwise, the bot will respond with `Sorry, you are not qualified for this job opening. We'll keep your application on file for future opportunities`.

# Triggers
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/blocks/trigger/overview

Learn about triggers in Chatling and how to use them effectively in your chatbot flows.

Triggers are events that automatically start a specific flow in your chatbot based on user behavior. They enable you to create more dynamic and responsive chatbot experiences.

## Types of Triggers

The following triggers are currently available:

1. Returning Visitor: This trigger is activated when a visitor returns to your website after a period of time.
2. Specific Webpage Opened: This trigger is activated when a visitor opens a specific page on your website.
3. Intent: Triggered when there's a matching intent in the user's message.

## How Triggers Work

Triggers are automatically invoked when their conditions are met. When a trigger is activated, the chatbot will follow the conversation flow connected to that trigger in the builder.
For example, if you have a "Returning User" trigger set up, and a user comes back to your website after being away for a certain period, the chatbot will automatically start the conversation flow linked to this trigger.

## How to Use Triggers

To use triggers in your chatbot:

1. Open your chatbot builder.
2. From the Blocks page in the sidebar, look for the "Triggers" section.
3. Drag and drop the desired trigger onto your canvas.
4. Connect the trigger to the subsequent blocks in your conversation flow.
5. Configure the trigger settings if necessary (e.g. specifying the trigger frequency).

Learn about the Builder and how to create conversational flows for your chatbot.

Chatling's Builder is a visual interface that allows you to create and manage conversational flows for your chatbot. It's where you define how the chatbot interacts with users and responds to their queries.

## Builder Interface

![Builder interface](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/chatling-builder-interface.jpg)

The Builder consists of the following components:

* **[Canvas](/chatbot/builder/canvas)**: The main area where you add and connect blocks to build the conversational flow.
* **[Sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar)**: Contains menus for adding blocks, managing variables, and configuring the AI and general settings.
* **Toolbar**: Appears at the top and contains controls for zooming in/out, saving, preview, and publishing the chatbot.

# Sidebar
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/sidebar

Learn about the Sidebar and its functionalities in the Builder.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/Sidebar.jpg" width="300" />

The sidebar contains four menus:

* Blocks
* Variables
* AI Configuration
* Settings

## Sidebar Menus

### Blocks

The Blocks menu contains all the blocks you can add to your flow. [Blocks](/chatbot/builder/blocks/overview) build up the conversational flow of your chatbot.

You can drag and drop blocks onto the canvas to add them to your flow.

![Adding blocks](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/Drag%20blocks.gif)

Here are the different categories of blocks that are available:

* **Send message**: Display a message to the user.
* **Capture response**: Capture answers from the user, such as text, email, form submission, and more.
* **AI**: Use AI to generate responses to user's questions.
* **Logic**: Add conditions and logic to your flow.
* **Integration**: Connect your chatbot to external services.

### Variables

Variables are placeholders that store information during the conversation. You can use variables to store user inputs, API responses, and more. These variables can be used to personalize the conversation and make it more dynamic.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/variables-sidebar-menu.png" width="350" />

There are two types of variables:

* **System variables**: These are predefined variables that store system information or can be used to perform a specific action. For example, the `contact_email` variable can be used to store the user's email address and save them as a lead.

  If you click on a system variable, you can view its purpose.

  There are also additional system variables that aren't imported by default. To view and import them, click the `Import system variables` button.

* **Custom variables**: These are variables you create to store information specific to your chatbot. For example, you can create a custom variable to store the user's question and use it in the `AI Response` block to generate a response from the AI.

### AI Configuration

The AI Configuration menu allows you to configure the default AI settings for your chatbot. These settings are used when the chatbot generates AI responses using the Knowledge Base.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/ai-configuration-sidebar-menu.png" width="350" />

You can configure the following settings:

* **Instructions**: Provide instructions to the AI to tailor its responses. For example, you can instruct the AI to provide more detailed responses or to use a specific tone. You can click the `View examples` button to see examples of instructions you can provide.
* **Settings**:
  * **Business, product, or brand name**: This will be used by the AI to generate more relevant responses and avoids answering off-topics questions that aren't related to your business, product, or brand, such as questions related to your competitors, weather, etc.
  * **AI Model**: The AI model to use for generating responses. Every model uses a different amount of credits per response. We recommend testing with different models to see which one works best for your chatbot.
  * **Language**: The language in which the AI should generate responses. If you set it to Auto, the AI will detect the language of the user's question and generate a response in the same language.
  * **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the responses. A higher temperature will generate more creative responses, while a lower temperature will generate more accurate responses.

### Settings

The Settings menu allows you to configure the chatbot's general settings. Here's what you can configure:

* **Message Delay**: The time delay in seconds between chatbot's messages.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/create-new-variable-from-sidebar.jpg" alt="Create variable from sidebar" width="400" />

3. Enter a name for the variable and click `Create`. The name must be alphanumeric and can include underscores, such as `first_name`, `firstName`, or `First Name`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/define-new-variable-name.jpg" alt="Define name for new variable" width="400" />

Note that variable names are case-sensitive. For example, `first name` and `First Name` are considered different variables.


# How to use variables
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/variables/how-to-use-variables

A guide on how to use Variables in your chatbot

Variables can be used for capturing information, displaying dynamic content, and processing data in your chatbot.

## How to store data in variables

You can store data in variables using the `Store answer in variable` or a similar option that's available for certain blocks in the builder. This option appears in the [block editor](/chatbot/builder/block-editor).

Let's take the [Text input block](/chatbot/builder/blocks/inputs/text) as an example. This block allows users to enter text. To store the user's response in a variable, click the dropdown below the `Store answer in variable` option and select a variable.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/store-answer-in-variable-option-text-input-block.jpg" alt="Store answer in variable option in Text Input block" width="400" />

## How to display variables in messages

You can display variables in messages using the `{variableName}` syntax. The variable name should be enclosed in curly braces.

As an example, let's you have a variable called `first_name` and you want to greet the user by their name. Here's how to do it:

1. Add a [Text output block](/chatbot/builder/blocks/send/text) to your chatbot.
2. Click the block to open the editor.
3. Type `Hello, {first_name}!` in the message field.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/inserting-variable-in-text-block.png" alt="Display variable in message in Text Output block" width="400" />

4. When the chatbot displays this block, it will replace `{first_name}` with the value stored by the variable.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/displaying-variables-in-output-text-messages.png" alt="Display variable in message" width="400" />

Note that the values stored are on a per-conversation basis. This means that the value of a variable is unique to each conversation and is not shared across different conversations.


# Import system variables
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/variables/import-system-variables

Learn how to import system variables that aren't available by default in your chatbot.

Not all system variables are available by default when you create a chatbot. If you require additional system variables that aren't available, you can import them from the `Variables` menu in the builder's [sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar).

## How to import additional system variables

1. Go to the `Builder` in your chatbot.
2. Click the `Variables` menu in the sidebar.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/import-system-variables-1.jpg" alt="Open variables menu" width="400" />

3. Click `Import system variables`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/import-system-variables-2.jpg" alt="Import system variables button" width="400" />

4. A list is displayed with all the additional system variables that you can import. Select the ones you want to import.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/import-system-variables-3.jpg" alt="Import system variables" width="400" />

5. Click the `Import` button.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/import-system-variables-4.jpg" alt="Import system variables" width="400" />

6. The selected system variables are now available to use in your chatbot.


# Types of variables
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/variables/variable-types

There are two types of variables: System Variable and Custom Variable. Learn how to use them in your chatbot.

Variables in the Builder are of two types:

* System Variable
* Custom Variable

## System Variable

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/system-variables-sidebar-menu.png" alt="System variables" width="400" />

System variables are predefined variables that contain system information or which can be used to perform specific actions. These variables are automatically created by the Builder.

To learn what a specific system variable does, you can open it from the Variables menu in the [sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar) and read its description.

There are also additional system variables that aren't imported by default. To view and import them, go to the Variables menu from the [Sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar) and click the `Import system variables` button.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/import-system-variables-page.jpg" alt="Import system variables" width="400" />

## Custom Variable

These are variables that you create to store information specific to your chatbot.

For example, you can create a custom variable to store the user's query and pass it to the AI for generating a response from the knowledge base.


# What are variables?
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/builder/variables/what-are-variables

Learn about Variables, the different types, and how to use them

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/variables-sidebar-builder.png" alt="Variables sidebar menu" width="400" />

Variables are placeholders that store information during the conversation. You can use variables to store user inputs, API responses, and more. These variables can be used to personalize the conversation and make it more dynamic.

For example, you can store the user's name in a variable and use it to greet the user. This way, you can make the conversation more engaging and interactive.

In the next section, you will learn about the different types of variables and how to use them in your chatbot.


# Save contacts from chatbot conversations
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/contacts/create



You can collect user information at any point in your chatbot flow and save it as a contact using the [Create Contact](/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/create-contact) block. The contact is automatically associated with the user and retained across future chat sessions.

The example below shows a flow that collects the user's name, email, and phone number using a form. Once submitted, it is used to create a new contact.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/create-new-contact-sample-flow.png" width="600" />

All contacts created by the chatbot are displayed in the `Contacts` page in your dashboard.


# Identify users across multiple chats
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/contacts/identify-users



When you save a contact, it's associated with the user and persists across multiple chat sessions. This information can be used to personalize the conversation, skip repetitive questions, and tailor the flow accordingly.

## How it works

The [Get Contact](/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/get-contact) block can be used to fetch the contact information associated with the current user.

The example below shows a flow that identifies the user and takes different actions based on whether their contact details exist.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/identify-returning-users-sample-flow.png" width="600" />

Here's how the above flow works:

1. When the chat starts, the `Get Contact` block is executed to check if a contact exists for the current user.
   <Note>We're using the `user_id` variable to search for the associated contact. This is a system variable that contains the user's unique ID. If this variable doesn't exist in your builder, you can [import it from the Variables menu](/chatbot/builder/variables/import-system-variables).</Note>
2. If a contact is found, the information is stored in variables. For example, we're storing the contact's first name and email in the `first_name` and `email` variables.
3. Next, the [Variable condition block](/chatbot/builder/blocks/condition/variable) is used to check if the `email` and `first_name` variables are not empty.
   * If they're not empty, it means the user is a returning user. In this case, we skip the form and greet the user by name.
   * If they're empty, it means the user is new. In this case, we show the form to collect the user's name and email.


# Overview

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/name%20your%20chatbot.png" />

Congrats! You've created your first chatbot. Now you can start building it based on your requirements.

## 2. Building your chatbot

For your chatbot to be functional, you need to build its conversational flow. This can be done using the Builder.

From your chatbot's dashboard, click on the `Builder` menu to open it.

![Open the builder](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/builder-menu.jpg)

The [Builder](/chatbot/builder/introduction) is where you can create and manage your chatbot's flow. It's a visual interface that allows you to add and connect blocks to create a conversational flow.

All chatbots contain a default `Start` block, which is the entry point of the conversation.

![Builder canvas](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/canvas.png)

### Sidebar

On the left sidebar, you'll find the following menus:

* **[Blocks](/chatbot/builder/blocks/overview)**: Contains all the blocks you can add to your flow. Blocks build up the conversational flow of your chatbot.
  You can drag and drop blocks from this menu to the canvas to add them to your flow.
  ![Adding blocks](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/Drag%20blocks.gif)
* **Variables**: These are like containers that store information during the conversation. You can use variables to personalize the conversation and make it more dynamic.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/variables-sidebar-menu.png" />

* **AI Configuration**: Configure the default AI settings for your chatbot. These settings are used when the chatbot generates AI responses using the Knowledge Base.
* **Settings**: Configure the general settings for your chatbot.

### Connecting blocks

Once you add blocks to the [canvas](/chatbot/builder/canvas), you must connect them to create a flow that guides users through the conversation. Failure to do so will result in the chat ending prematurely.

![Connect blocks](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/connect-blocks-1.gif)

### Configuring blocks

Each block has its own configuration settings that you can customize. To configure a block, click it and its settings will appear on the right side of the screen.

![Configure block](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/block-configuration.jpg)

### Testing your chatbot

While you're building the chatbot, you can test it to see how it works. This allows you to identify any issues and make improvements before publishing it.

Click the `Preview bot` button in the top right corner of the screen to launch the chatbot for testing.

![Testing your chatbot](https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/testing-your-chatbot.jpg)

Your work is saved automatically as you build your chatbot. You can also save it manually by clicking the `Save` button in the top right side of the screen.

### Saving your work

Your work is saved automatically as you build your chatbot. You can also save it manually by clicking the `Save` button in the top right side of the screen.

Any changes you make to the chatbot are saved as drafts until you publish them. This allows you to work on the chatbot and test it without affecting the live version.

### Publish your chatbot

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/publish-chatbot.jpeg" width="400" alt="Publish your chatbot" />

## 3. Populate the AI knowledge base

The Knowledge Base is where you upload information that the AI uses to generate responses to user queries.  It uses this information to provide accurate and relevant responses to users.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/knowledge-base.jpg" width="600" alt="Knowledge base" />

You can add websites, documents, texts, FAQs, and many more data sources to the knowledge base. When a user asks a question, the AI searches the knowledge base for relevant information and generates a response based on the data it finds.

Therefore, if your chatbot contains an AI Response block and it's "Response Source" is set to "Knowledge Base", you need to populate the Knowledge Base with information that the AI can use to generate responses.

## 4. Customize and deploy your chatbot

Once you've built your chatbot, it's time to customize the widget and deploy it to your website. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure that you've published your chatbot. You can publish it from the Builder page.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/publish-chatbot.jpeg" width="400" alt="Publish your chatbot" />

2. Go back to the dashboard and click the `Deploy` button in the sidebar menu.

6. Copy the chatbot widget code.
7. Paste the code into the `head` or `body` section of your website's HTML.

* If you selected the `Inline` mode, you must paste the code where you want the chatbot to appear on your website.

That's it! Your chatbot is now live on your website, ready to engage with your visitors.


# Intents
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/intents/introduction

Learn about intents and how they work in Chatling

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/intents-page.jpg" alt="Intents page" width="600" />

## What are Intents?

Intents identify what users are trying to accomplish and capture the meaning behind their messages, regardless of how they phrase them.

For example, when users ask "Where's my order?" or "Track package", they share the same underlying goal - to locate their order.

Intents can be used to define how your chatbot should respond when it recognizes these user goals. Each intent can be linked to specific conversation flows, data collection requirements, and response templates, enabling the chatbot to take appropriate action.

## How Intents Work

Intents are defined in the `Intents` section of your chatbot's builder. Each intent consists of:

* **Name**: A clear, descriptive identifier (e.g., "Order Tracking", "Submit ticket").
* **Description**: Explains the user's goal or purpose this intent represents.
* **Sample phrases**: Collection of sample messages that would trigger this intent. This helps the chatbot understand the intent and accurately match it to user messages.


# Manage intents

# Using intents
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/intents/using-intents

Learn how to use intents to create more complex chatbot flows

To make your intents work, there are two essential steps:

1. Enable intent matching in blocks to tell the chatbot which intents to look for in user messages.
2. Define the flow of the chatbot when an intent is matched.

## 1. Intent matching

Currently, intent matching can be enabled in [Text input blocks](/chatbot/builder/blocks/inputs/text).

When users send messages using the Text block, you can configure whether these messages should be checked against one or more defined intents. This allows you to control when intent matching occurs and trigger appropriate flows based on the matches.

### Enabling intent matching

1. Open the editor for a text block.
2. Next to the `Match intent` option, click the `+` button.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/match_intent_block_option.jpg" alt="Match intent option" width="400" />

3. Select the intents you want user messages to be checked against.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/add-intents-to-intent-matcher-block-option.jpg" alt="Select intents for intent matcher" width="400" />

When a user sends a message, the chatbot will check if the message matches any of the selected intents and trigger the appropriate flow. If there are no matches, the flow will continue normally.

## 2. Defining intent flows

There are two ways to define the actions for an intent:

1. Intent trigger block (global)
2. Local trigger

### Intent trigger block

Intent triggers are flows that will be executed when an intent is matched. These triggers are global, meaning that they will be executed by any block that matches the intent. This is useful if you want to create a standard response for an intent that can be used in multiple places in your chatbot.

For example, if you create an Intent trigger for `Order Tracking`:

* Any block that matches this intent will start this flow.
* The same flow runs whether matched in a welcome message or support conversation.
* Flow can include actions like fetching order status, asking for order number, etc.

This provides a consistent response when users ask about order tracking anywhere in your chatbot.

**To add the trigger:**

1. Open `Blocks` from the sidebar.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-blocks-menu-builder-sidebar.jpg" alt="Open Blocks menu" width="400" />

2. Under the `Triggers` section, drag and drop the `Intent` block onto the canvas.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/intent-trigger-block-sidebar.jpg" alt="Drag and drop Intent trigger" width="400" />

3. Click on the block to open the editor.

4. Select an intent this trigger belongs to.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/select-intent-in-intent-trigger.jpg" alt="Select intent for trigger" width="600" />

5. Define the flow to run when the intent is triggered.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/intent-trigger-sales-sample-flow.jpg" alt="Define flow for intent trigger" width="450" />

### Local trigger

Sometimes you want different flows for the same intent depending on where in the conversation it was matched. This is where local triggers come in.

* Open the block where you want to enable local trigger for an intent.
* Find the intent under the `Match intent` option and click the `Local trigger` icon as shown below. For example, we will enable local trigger for the `Order status` intent.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/local-trigger-order-status-intent.jpg" alt="Enable local trigger for intent" width="350" />

* Define the specific flow for this intent. For example, we will ask the user for their order number before fetching the order status. As such, whenever the input in this block matches the `Order status` intent, the flow defined here will be executed instead of the global trigger.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/order-status-local-flow-example.jpg" alt="Define flow for local trigger" width="500" />

Note that the local trigger takes precedence over the global trigger when enabled.

### Using both triggers

You can have both global and local triggers for intents:

* Use global triggers for standard responses
* Override with local triggers where context-specific flows are needed

This flexibility allows you to:

* Maintain consistent base responses
* Customize flows for specific conversation stages
* Create more dynamic user experiences

## What happens when no intents match?

If no intent is matched, the chatbot will continue with the flow as normal.


# AI Chatbot
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/chatbot/introduction



AI Chatbots are flow-based assistants you design with Chatling's visual, drag-and-drop builder. They follow the exact steps you define—messages, questions, buttons, conditions, and AI answers—to deliver predictable, on-brand conversations for support, sales, and guided self-service.

Unlike [AI Agents](/ai-agent/introduction) (which plan actions autonomously), Chatbots run the flow you create, making them ideal where compliance, consistency, and tight control matter.

Chatbots also come with built-in AI capabilities, which means you can use AI to generate responses to user's questions.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/chatbot-visual-builder.jpg" alt="Chatbot visual builder" width="600" />

## Key features

* **Visual builder**: Create conversational flows with a drag-and-drop interface.
* **Capture leads**: Collect name, email, phone, and custom fields; store values as variables and send to your CRM via Zapier or API calls to an external service.
* **Route with conditions**: Branch by user choices, variable values, device/page, or language.
* **Show buttons & media**: Present quick replies, links, and images to streamline choices.
* **Answer from your content**: Optionally insert an AI step that responds from your knowledge base (site, docs, FAQs, Zoho/Zendesk, etc.).
* **Escalate when needed**: Create tickets in email, Zendesk, HubSpot, or Zoho when human intervention is required.
* **Multilingual AI**: Auto-detect and reply in the user's language.
* **Analytics & monitoring**: Track conversations, leads, top pages, and fine-tune answers.
* **Security & compliance**: GDPR-ready; encryption in transit and at rest.
* **AI model choice**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more.

# What's the difference between AI Agents and AI Chatbots?
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/faq/difference-between-ai-agents-and-ai-chatbots



The main difference between an agent and a chatbot is how they handle conversations and tasks:

* **Chatbots** rely on prebuilt flows. This means their responses and actions follow a set, predefined path that you design in advance. They are great for handling straightforward, repetitive tasks where the conversation can be mapped out step by step.
* **AI Agents**, on the other hand, plan steps dynamically based on the context of the conversation and the instructions and actions you set. They do not require a rigid flow design. Instead, they can decide which tasks to carry out while interacting with users, making them more flexible and adaptive to complex or changing situations.


# How to hide the chatbot on specific pages
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/faq/hide-chatbot-on-specific-pages

Learn how to set the visibility of your chatbot on specific pages.

Sometimes you may want to hide your chatbot on specific pages of your website. This could be for various reasons, such as maintaining a distraction-free environment on certain pages, or to comply with specific page requirements. Chatling provides a simple way to control the visibility of your chatbot by allowing you to specify URLs where the chatbot widget should not appear.

## How to hide the chatbot on specific pages

1. From the chatbot dashboard, go to `Settings`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-chatbot-settings.jpg" width="300" alt="Open chatbot settings" />

2. Click the `Visibility` tab.
3. In the `Hide chatbot on specific pages` section, type the URL of the page where you want to hide the chatbot and press the Enter key.
4. Repeat the previous step for each page where you want to hide the chatbot.
5. Click `Save` to apply the changes.

You can also enter wildcard URLs to hide the chatbot on multiple pages. For example, if you want to hide the chatbot on the blog, you can enter `https://example.com/blog/*` to hide it from all pages in the blog.


# How to reset the chat on page load?
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/faq/reset-chat-on-page-load



By default, chat history is retained when users navigate away from the chatbot and return to it, refresh the page, or go to a different page. This means that when users return to the chatbot, they can see their existing chat and continue from where they left off.

If you want to disable this so that the chat is reset on page load, you can do so by following these steps:

1. From your chatbot dashboard, go to `Builder`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-builder-from-sidebar.jpg" alt="Open builder from sidebar" width="350" />

2. Click the settings icon in the sidebar.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-builder-settings.jpg" alt="Open builder settings from sidebar" width="350" />

3. Enable the the `Reset chat on page load` option.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/enable-reset-chat-on-page-load-option.jpg" alt="Toggle reset chat on page load" width="350" />


# What happens when AI credits are exhausted?
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/faq/what-happens-when-ai-credits-exhausted



When your AI credits are exhausted, users can still interact with the chatbot and send messages, but an error will be displayed saying "Insufficient AI credits".

When the usage exceeds the limit, you must top up your AI credits by purchasing the **Extra AI Credits** add-on from Billing & Usage > Add-ons page. Alternatively, you can upgrade your plan to get more credits.

You can enable the **AI Credit Usage** notification in your account to be alerted when your usage reaches a threshold such as 50%, 75%, 90% or 100%.


# Custom domain
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/general-settings/custom-domain

Learn how to add a custom domain to your chatbot.

You can use a custom subdomain for the chatbot widget and sharing link rather than the default one used by Chatling. This allows you to whitelabel your chatbots to maintain your brand identity or make them look like your team developed them.

## How to set a custom domain

1. Open the chatbot you want to set a custom subdomain for.
2. From the menu, click on `Settings` under the `Chatbot` section.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-chatbot-settings.jpg" width="300" alt="Open chatbot settings" />

3. Go to the `Custom Domain` tab.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-custom-domain-settings.jpg" width="450" alt="Open custom domain settings" />

4. Enter the custom domain you want to use for the chatbot, such as `sample.domain.com`, and click the `Save` button.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/enter-custom-domain.jpg" width="600" alt="Enter custom domain" />

5. Add the DNS records displayed on the page to your domain provider to activate the custom domain.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/custom-domain-dns-configuration-1.jpg" width="600" alt="DNS configuration" />

6. Once you add the DNS records, it may take up to 24 hours for the changes to propagate. You can click the `Verify` button to check if the records are active.

7. Once completed and the status is `Active`, the chatbot widget and sharing link will use the custom domain.


# How to delete a chatbot
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/general-settings/delete

Learn how to remove a chatbot permanently from your account.

If you no longer need a chatbot, you can delete it from the dashboard.

Deleting a chatbot will permanently remove it from your account, and you won't be able to recover it. All data associated with the chatbot, including contacts, conversations, and knowledge base will be removed permanently.

## How to delete a chatbot

1. Open the chatbot you want to delete.
2. From the menu, click on `Settings` under the `Chatbot` section.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-chatbot-settings.jpg" width="300" alt="Open chatbot settings" />

# How to duplicate a chatbot or agent
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/general-settings/duplicate

Learn how to duplicate a chatbot/agent to create a copy of it.

You can duplicate chatbots or agents and create copies of them to use as templates or to make changes without affecting the original bot. This can be useful if you want to experiment with different configurations or create a backup of your bot.

By duplicating a chatbot or agent, all its settings, appearance, and builder configurations will be copied to the new chatbot. You can then make changes to the duplicated chatbot without affecting the original one.

## Duplicating a chatbot

1. Go to your project's dashboard where you can view all your chatbots and agents.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/duplicate-chatbot-guide-list-chatbots.jpg" alt="Chatbots list" width="400" />

# Rate limit
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/general-settings/rate-limit

Learn how to set a rate limit for your chatbot to prevent it from being spammed.

Rate limiting allows you to limit the number of messages a user can send to your chatbot in a given period of time. This helps prevent end-users from spamming your chatbot and depleting your account credits.

## How to set a rate limit

1. Open your chatbot's dashboard.
2. Go to chatbot settings.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-chatbot-settings.jpg" width="300" alt="Open chatbot settings" />

3. Click the `Security` tab.
4. Under the `Rate limiting` section, add a rate limit, e.g. 10 messages per minute. You can add multiple rate limits for different periods of time, such as per minute, per hour, or per day.
   <Note>The rate limit is applied to individual users. For example, if you set a rate limit of 10 messages per minute, each user can send up to 10 messages per minute.</Note>
5. You can also add a custom error message to be displayed when the rate limit is exceeded. If left blank, a default error message will be displayed.
   <Note>The default error message is automatically translated into the language of your chatbot widget. If you override it with a custom message, it won't be translated.</Note>
6. Click `Save`.

Once you've set the rate limits, your chatbot will prevent end-users from sending more messages than the rate limit in a given period of time. If the rate limit is exceeded, an error message will be displayed.

Welcome to the Chatling documentation. This is your end-to-end guide to the platform that explains core concepts, walks you through setup and deployment, and helps you get the most out of the platform.

## What is Chatling?

Chatling is a no-code platform that lets you build conversational AI agents in minutes, trained on custom data, such as business websites, company policies, knowledge bases and documents.

Deploy your agents seamlessly on your website and other channels to automate customer support, capture and qualify leads, and deliver accurate answers.

## Products

There are two types of products available in the Chatling platform.

### 1. AI Agents

Outcome-driven assistants that understand intent and act autonomously. Agents follow your instructions, use your knowledge, and invoke custom actions to fetch/store/update data and complete tasks—no flow building required.

### 2. AI Chatbots

Flow-based bots you design with a visual builder. Define steps, branches, and messages to create predictable, guided experiences (menus, FAQs, forms) with optional AI answers—ideal where tight control and consistency matter.

# Types of data sources
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/knowledge-base/data-source-types

Learn about the different types of data sources you can add to the Knowledge Base.

Data sources are the sources of information you can add to the Knowledge Base. Together, they provide information the AI needs to respond accurately to user queries.

You can add the following types of data sources to the Knowledge Base:

* **Website**: When you add a website, our crawler will visit and extract all the pages from the website. You can then select the pages you want to add to the Knowledge Base.
  * The website crawler can extract up to 1,000 pages from a website. If your site contains more pages, you must use the Sitemap data source.
* **Sitemap**: Add a sitemap URL to fetch all the pages of your website. The sitemap is suitable when your website has more than 1,000 pages. Once the sitemap is fetched, you can select the pages to add to the Knowledge Base.
* **URL List**: Add a list of URLs to the Knowledge Base. This is useful when you want to add specific links instead of an entire website.
* **Document**: Upload documents such as PDF, DOCX, and TXT. The AI will extract the text from the document and use it to generate responses.
* **Text**: You can add text directly to the Knowledge Base. This is useful when you want to add custom information that isn't available on your website or documents.
* **FAQs**: You can add a list of questions and answers that users frequently ask. This is useful when the information is not available through other data sources. You can also use it for fine-tuning the AI responses, such as when it responds incorrectly to certain questions.
* **Zoho**: Import all or select articles from your Zoho account into the Chatling knowledge base.
* **Zendesk**: Import all or select articles from your Zendesk account into the Chatling knowledge base.

# Exclude webpage sections
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/knowledge-base/exclude-webpage-sections

Learn how to exclude certain sections of a webpage when adding a data source.

Websites often contain a lot of information that may not be relevant to the AI. When you add webpages to the knowledge base, you can exclude certain sections of the page from being crawled and indexed by the AI.

This can be useful for removing irrelevant information as well as preventing unnecessary characters from being counted towards your plan's limit.

## How to exclude sections of a webpage

1. Go to the `Knowledge Base`.
2. Click the `New Data Source` or `Add new` button.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/add-data-to-new-knowledge-base.jpg" />

4. Click the `Advanced Settings` button.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/new-website-data-source-advanced-settings.jpg" width="500" />

5. You can exclude sections by entering the HTML classes or IDs of the elements you want to exclude. You must press Enter after each class or ID to add it to the list.

You can also select the HTML tags you want to remove, such as `header` or `footer`.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/new-website-data-source-advanced-settings-1.png" width="500" />

You can now go ahead with entering the website, sitemap, or list of URLs that you want to add to the knowledge base. The crawler will exclude the sections you specified.


# Overview
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/knowledge-base/overview

Learn about the Knowledge Base and how it works.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/knowledge-base.png" />

The Knowledge Base is where you upload information that the AI uses to generate responses to user queries. You can add [data sources](/knowledge-base/data-source-types) such as websites, webpages, documents, texts, and FAQs to the knowledge base.

When a user asks a question, the AI searches the Knowledge Base for all relevant information and returns the best answer based on the data it finds.

If your chatbot contains an AI Response block and it's "Response Source" is set to "Knowledge Base", it's essential to populate the knowledge base with information that the AI can use to generate responses.


# Re-sync data sources
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/knowledge-base/re-sync-data-sources

Learn how to re-sync data sources in the Knowledge Base.

If you've made changes to your Link data sources (websites/webpages) or want to update the information in the Knowledge Base, you can re-sync the data sources to fetch the latest data. This process will re-fetch the data from the source and update the information in the Knowledge Base.

## Supported data sources

Re-syncing is available for Links data sources only, which include websites and webpages. Other data sources like Documents, Text, and FAQs do not require re-syncing as they are static and do not change unless you manually update them.

## How to re-sync a data source

To re-sync data sources in the Knowledge Base, follow these steps:

* Go to the `Knowledge Base`.
* Click on the `Link` tab to view all the links you have added.
* Next to every link is a re-sync icon, as shown below. Click on the icon to queue the link for re-syncing.

# Set the language of your chatbot widget
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/web-widget/language

Set the language of your chatbot widget.

The chatbot is available in over 45 languages. You can customize the language of your chatbot to match your audience's preferences. This affects all text elements in the chatbot widget, including placeholders, buttons, and system messages.

By default, the language is set to `Auto`. This means that the chatbot will automatically detect the user's language based on their browser settings.

## Set the language

1. From your chatbot's dashboard, go to **Appearance**.

# Operating hours
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/web-widget/operating-hours

Schedule the chatbot to be visible at certain times.

You can set the operating hours for your chatbot to define when it should be available to users. This is useful if you want to limit the chatbot's availability to certain times of the day or week, e.g during business hours or off-hours.

When outside of the operating hours, your chatbot will be automatically hidden, ensuring it's only live when you want it to be.

## Set operating hours

1. From your chatbot's dashboard, go to the **Settings** page.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/open-chatbot-settings.jpg" alt="Open chatbot settings" width="300" />

2. Click the `Visibility` tab.

To keep the chatbot visible throughout the day, leave the start and end times empty.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/define-chatbot-operating-hours.jpg" alt="Define chatbot operating hours" width="450px" />

5. Click the `Add` button to add the schedule.
6. Click the `Save` button to save the changes.

Once you define the operating hours, the chatbot will be visible during the specified times and hidden outside of these hours.

## Edit existing operating hours

To edit the operating hours, you have to delete one or more schedules that you want to edit and then add the new schedules.


# How to pass custom data to your chatbot
Source: https://docs.chatling.ai/web-widget/pass-custom-data

Learn how to send any data, such as customer information, to the chatbot widget.

With the widget's code snippet, you can pass any data to the chatbot. This is useful if you want to send customer information, such as name and email, or any other data to the chatbot and use them in your flow.

## Before you begin

* You must know how to use [variables](/chatbot/builder/variables) in the builder.
* You have to [create variables](/chatbot/builder/variables/how-to-create-variables) in the builder for the data you want to pass to the chatbot. If the variables already exist, you can skip this step.

## Pass custom data during launch

When you [install the chatbot](/web-widget/installation/overview) on your website, you get a code snippet similar to this:

```html  theme={null}
<script> 
window.chtlConfig = { 
    chatbotId: "<WIDGET_ID>" 
} 
</script>

<script async data-id="<WIDGET_ID>" id="chatling-embed-script" type="text/javascript" src="https://chatling.ai/js/embed.js"></script>
```

You can pass custom data during launch by adding the `variables` property to the `chtlConfig` object, and listing the variable names and their values.

```javascript  theme={null}
window.chtlConfig = { 
    chatbotId: "<WIDGET_ID>",
    variables: {
        "variable_name_1": "<VALUE>",
        "variable_name_2": "<VALUE>",
        "variable_name_3": "<VALUE>"
    }
}
```

### Example

Let's say you want to pass the user's name, email and age to the chatbot. First, you need to [create variables](/chatbot/builder/variables/how-to-create-variables) for them in the builder.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/variables-for-storing-custom-data-from-widget.jpg" width="350" />

Next, add the variable values to your widget's code snippet. You must make sure that the variable names match exactly as they are in the builder.

```javascript  theme={null}
window.chtlConfig = { 
    chatbotId: "<WIDGET_ID>",
    variables: {
        "contact_name": "John Doe",
        "contact_email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "age": 25
    }
} 
```

Now if you use the variables in your chatbot's flow, they will have the values you passed during launch.

<img src="https://chatling-assets.b-cdn.net/pass-custom-data-during-launch-example-3.jpg" width="400" />

## Pass custom data after launch

If at any point after launching the chatbot, you want to pass some data to it, you can do so by calling the `window.Chatling.setVariables` function.

```javascript  theme={null}
window.Chatling.setVariables({
    "contact_name": "Rick Astley",
    "contact_email": "rick.astley@example.com",
    "age": 30
}, function(success, errorMessage) {
    if (!success) {
        // handle error
    }
});
```

**Note:**

* The `setVariables` function must be called after the chatbot widget has loaded.

- Variables must be present in the builder and the names must match exactly.
- This will overwrite any existing values for the variables.
