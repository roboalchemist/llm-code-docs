# Voice Input

> Allow users to speak to your chatbot using Voice Input.

Voice Input is a speech-to-text feature that allows users to record voice messages and transcribes them into text. Rather than typing their message, users can speak to your chatbot and it will automatically be converted to text.

The chatbot will then display a microphone icon when the block is displayed. Users can click on the microphone icon to record a voice message.

## What happens when I run out of Speech to Text credits?

When you're out of credits, the voice recording icon will be removed and users will not be able to access the feature. You can upgrade your plan to increase the credits limit or wait until the next billing cycle for the credits to reset.
