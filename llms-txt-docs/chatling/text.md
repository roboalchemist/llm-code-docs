# Text Block

> Learn about the Text block and how to set it up in the builder

The Text block is used to display a text message to the user. You can use it to provide information, ask questions, or guide the user through the conversation.

## Adding text

Once you add a Text block to the canvas, click on it to open the block editor. You can then enter your message in the text editor and apply formatting using the toolbar.

## Inserting variables

You can insert variables into your text message to make it more dynamic and personalized.

To insert a variable, type `{` and a list of available variables will appear. Select the variable you want to insert and it will be added to the text message.

For example, if you have captured the user's name earlier in the conversation and stored it in a variable called `contact_name`, you can insert it into the text message by typing `{contact_name}`. When the message is sent to the user, the variable will be replaced with the user's name.
