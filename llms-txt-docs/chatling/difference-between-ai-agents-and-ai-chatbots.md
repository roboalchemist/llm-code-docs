# What's the difference between AI Agents and AI Chatbots?

The main difference between an agent and a chatbot is how they handle conversations and tasks:

* **Chatbots** rely on prebuilt flows. This means their responses and actions follow a set, predefined path that you design in advance. They are great for handling straightforward, repetitive tasks where the conversation can be mapped out step by step.
* **AI Agents**, on the other hand, plan steps dynamically based on the context of the conversation and the instructions and actions you set. They do not require a rigid flow design. Instead, they can decide which tasks to carry out while interacting with users, making them more flexible and adaptive to complex or changing situations.
