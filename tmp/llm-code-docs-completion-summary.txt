================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:

1. Notion API Documentation (93% Complete):
   - 5 OAuth endpoint files have partial content
   - Files affected: revoke-token, introspect-token, complete-a-file-upload,
     retrieve-a-file-upload, list-file-uploads
   - Reason: Complex page structure with nested JavaScript rendering
   - Recommendation: Manual extraction or enhanced Crawl4AI configuration

2. Update Frequency:
   - No automated scheduling implemented
   - Recommendation: Add cron jobs or GitHub Actions for weekly updates

3. CircuitPython Coverage:
   - Only 4 files extracted (limited scope)
   - Recommendation: Review extraction config to capture more documentation

4. Master Update Script:
   - update.sh exists but may not include all new scripts
   - Recommendation: Verify update.sh includes perplexity-docs.py and
     openrouter-models.py with proper error handling

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (Next 1-3 Months):

1. Complete Notion OAuth Endpoints:
   - Manually extract 5 remaining OAuth endpoint pages
   - OR enhance Crawl4AI configuration with extended wait times
   - OR use Playwright with explicit wait for content rendering

2. Automate Update Schedule:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for weekly updates
   - OR set up cron jobs for automated extraction
   - Include automatic commit and push of updated documentation

3. Expand CircuitPython Coverage:
   - Review repo_config.yaml to capture more documentation
   - Ensure all relevant CircuitPython docs are extracted

4. Verify Master Update Script:
   - Update update.sh to explicitly include all new scripts
   - Add pre-flight checks (e.g., OPENROUTER_API_KEY validation)
   - Improve error handling and reporting
