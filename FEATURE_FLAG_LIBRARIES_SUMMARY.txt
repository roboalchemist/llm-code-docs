DEPLOYMENT PREFERENCE TRENDS:
============================

Self-Hosted Preference: Unleash, GO Feature Flag, GrowthBook, FeatBit
Managed Cloud Preference: LaunchDarkly, PostHog, Statsig, ConfigCat
Hybrid Option: FeatBit, GrowthBook

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
===========================

Fastest Evaluation: Local evaluation clients (Unleash, PostHog, GrowthBook)
Most Reliable: LaunchDarkly (enterprise-grade)
Best for Microservices: GO Feature Flag (relay proxy)
Best for Single Language: Reflag (TypeScript), Statsig (Python)

DOCUMENTATION QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
=================================

Excellent (5/5):
- LaunchDarkly: Comprehensive across all SDKs
- Reflag: Clear TypeScript-focused documentation
- Unleash: Extensive guides and examples
- GO Feature Flag: Well-organized with examples

Good (4/5):
- PostHog: Good general coverage, analytical focus
- FeatBit: Growing documentation
- Flagsmith: Framework-specific guides

Adequate (3/5):
- Community gems (Ruby Rollout, etc.)
- Smaller open-source projects

OPEN QUESTIONS/GAPS:
====================

1. PHP ecosystem: Limited commercial options compared to other languages
2. Ruby: Community fragmented across multiple gem solutions
3. Real-time propagation: Limited discussion of flag update latency
4. Cost comparison: Limited pricing transparency for some platforms
5. Migration: Limited vendor-switching guidance

RECOMMENDATIONS BY SCENARIO:
============================

SCENARIO 1: Enterprise E-Commerce Site
RECOMMENDATION: LaunchDarkly
REASON: Mature, proven, multi-language, excellent documentation, enterprise support

SCENARIO 2: TypeScript SaaS Application
RECOMMENDATION: Reflag
REASON: Purpose-built for TypeScript, compile-time safety, self-cleaning flags

SCENARIO 3: Microservices Architecture
RECOMMENDATION: GO Feature Flag (open-source) or LaunchDarkly (commercial)
REASON: Multi-language support, relay proxy architecture, flexible deployment

SCENARIO 4: Cost-Conscious Startup
RECOMMENDATION: Unleash (self-hosted) or GrowthBook
REASON: Open-source, self-hosting friendly, no per-user pricing

SCENARIO 5: Analytics + Feature Flags
RECOMMENDATION: PostHog
REASON: Integrated analytics, comprehensive feature flags, single platform

SCENARIO 6: Python-Heavy Backend
RECOMMENDATION: Statsig (commercial) or Unleash (open-source)
REASON: Purpose-built for Python, mature, well-documented

SCENARIO 7: .NET/ASP.NET Core
RECOMMENDATION: FeatureManagement-Dotnet (lightweight) or LaunchDarkly (enterprise)
REASON: Native integration, Microsoft backing, type safety
