# Graphite for Startups

> For companies looking to grow with Graphite.

The Startup program is for early stage startups. If it sounds like you may be eligible, you can apply by reaching out to [billing@graphite.com](mailto:billing@graphite.com) with the following information:

* Company name
* Domain name
* Total GitHub collaborators (inclusive of all roles)
* Fundraising rounds (pre-seed, seed, series A, Series B, etc.)

### What is offered in the startup program?

If you’re approved for the startup program, you’ll receive a \$1,500 credit and be put on the **Team** plan. **The credits are valid for 12 months, or until the credits are used.** These credits are only applicable for the **Team** plan, and cannot be used for the **Starter** plan.

After your credits expire (or are used up), you’ll remain on the Team plan at full price. You can read more about the features offered under the team plan in our pricing docs [here](/billing-plans) or on our pricing page [here](https://graphite.com/pricing).

### **Will I have to pay for Graphite if I use the Startup program?**

Yes. The Startup program is a one-time credit of \$1,500 that’s valid for 12 months, or until the credit is used. Once the credits are depleted, you’ll need to use Graphite through one of our paid plan options.

## **Graphite for open source**

If you are working on a free open source community-led project, you may qualify for a free Team plan. Reach out to [billing@graphite.com](mailto:billing@graphite.com) to find out if you’re eligible. Please include:

* A link to the GitHub org
* A link to the website
* A brief description of the project
