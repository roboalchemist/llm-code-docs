### What kinds of things should I use Celery for? {#faq-when-to-use}

**Answer:** [Queue everything and delight
everyone](https://decafbad.com/blog/2008/07/04/queue-everything-and-delight-everyone)
is a good article describing why you\'d use a queue in a web context.

These are some common use cases:

-   Running something in the background. For example, to finish the web
    request as soon as possible, then update the users page
    incrementally. This gives the user the impression of good
    performance and \"snappiness\", even though the real work might
    actually take some time.
-   Running something after the web request has finished.
-   Making sure something is done, by executing it asynchronously and
    using retries.
-   Scheduling periodic work.

And to some degree:

-   Distributed computing.
-   Parallel execution.

## Misconceptions {#faq-misconceptions}

### Does Celery really consist of 50.000 lines of code? {#faq-loc}

**Answer:** No, this and similarly large numbers have been reported at
various locations.

The numbers as of this writing are:

> -   core: 7,141 lines of code.
> -   tests: 14,209 lines.
> -   backends, contrib, compat utilities: 9,032 lines.

Lines of code isn\'t a useful metric, so even if Celery did consist of
50k lines of code you wouldn\'t be able to draw any conclusions from
such a number.

### Does Celery have many dependencies?

A common criticism is that Celery uses too many dependencies. The
rationale behind such a fear is hard to imagine, especially considering
code reuse as the established way to combat complexity in modern
software development, and that the cost of adding dependencies is very
low now that package managers like pip and PyPI makes the hassle of
installing and maintaining dependencies a thing of the past.

Celery has replaced several dependencies along the way, and the current
list of dependencies are:

#### celery

-   `kombu`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"}

Kombu is part of the Celery ecosystem and is the library used to send
and receive messages. It\'s also the library that enables us to support
many different message brokers. It\'s also used by the OpenStack
project, and many others, validating the choice to separate it from the
Celery code-base.

-   `billiard`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"}

Billiard is a fork of the Python multiprocessing module containing many
performance and stability improvements. It\'s an eventual goal that
these improvements will be merged back into Python one day.

It\'s also used for compatibility with older Python versions that don\'t
come with the multiprocessing module.

#### kombu

Kombu depends on the following packages:

-   `amqp`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"}

The underlying pure-Python amqp client implementation. AMQP being the
default broker this is a natural dependency.

::: note

To handle the dependencies for popular configuration choices Celery
defines a number of \"bundle\" packages, see `bundles`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Is Celery heavy-weight? {#faq-heavyweight}

Celery poses very little overhead both in memory footprint and
performance.

But please note that the default configuration isn\'t optimized for time
nor space, see the `guide-optimizing`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
guide for more information.

### Is Celery dependent on pickle? {#faq-serialization-is-a-choice}

**Answer:** No, Celery can support any serialization scheme.

We have built-in support for JSON, YAML, Pickle, and msgpack. Every task
is associated with a content type, so you can even send one task using
pickle, another using JSON.

The default serialization support used to be pickle, but since 4.0 the
default is now JSON. If you require sending complex Python objects as
task arguments, you can use pickle as the serialization format, but see
notes in `security-serializers`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

If you need to communicate with other languages you should use a
serialization format suited to that task, which pretty much means any
serializer that\'s not pickle.

You can set a global default serializer, the default serializer for a
particular Task, or even what serializer to use when sending a single
task instance.

### Is Celery for Django only? {#faq-is-celery-for-django-only}

**Answer:** No, you can use Celery with any framework, web or otherwise.

### Do I have to use AMQP/RabbitMQ? {#faq-is-celery-for-rabbitmq-only}

**Answer**: No, although using RabbitMQ is recommended you can also use
Redis, SQS, or Qpid.

See `brokers`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more information.

Redis as a broker won\'t perform as well as an AMQP broker, but the
combination RabbitMQ as broker and Redis as a result store is commonly
used. If you have strict reliability requirements you\'re encouraged to
use RabbitMQ or another AMQP broker. Some transports also use polling,
so they\'re likely to consume more resources. However, if you for some
reason aren\'t able to use AMQP, feel free to use these alternatives.
They will probably work fine for most use cases, and note that the above
points are not specific to Celery; If using Redis/database as a queue
worked fine for you before, it probably will now. You can always upgrade
later if you need to.

### Is Celery multilingual? {#faq-is-celery-multilingual}

**Answer:** Yes.

`~celery.bin.worker`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} is an implementation
of Celery in Python. If the language has an AMQP client, there
shouldn\'t be much work to create a worker in your language. A Celery
worker is just a program connecting to the broker to process messages.

Also, there\'s another way to be language-independent, and that\'s to
use REST tasks, instead of your tasks being functions, they\'re URLs.
With this information you can even create simple web servers that enable
preloading of code. Simply expose an endpoint that performs an
operation, and create a task that just performs an HTTP request to that
endpoint.

You can also use [Flower\'s](https://flower.readthedocs.io) [REST
API](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#post--api-task-async-apply-(.+))
to invoke tasks.

## Troubleshooting {#faq-troubleshooting}

### MySQL is throwing deadlock errors, what can I do? {#faq-mysql-deadlocks}

**Answer:** MySQL has default isolation level set to
[REPEATABLE-READ]{.title-ref}, if you don\'t really need that, set it to
[READ-COMMITTED]{.title-ref}. You can do that by adding the following to
your `my.cnf`{.interpreted-text role="file"}:

    [mysqld]
    transaction-isolation = READ-COMMITTED

For more information about InnoDB's transaction model see [MySQL - The
InnoDB Transaction Model and
Locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-transaction-model.html)
in the MySQL user manual.

(Thanks to Honza Kral and Anton Tsigularov for this solution)

### The worker isn\'t doing anything, just hanging {#faq-worker-hanging}

**Answer:** See [MySQL is throwing deadlock errors, what can I
do?](#mysql-is-throwing-deadlock-errors-what-can-i-do), or [Why is
Task.delay/apply\\\*/the worker just hanging?]().

### Task results aren\'t reliably returning {#faq-results-unreliable}

**Answer:** If you\'re using the database backend for results, and in
particular using MySQL, see [MySQL is throwing deadlock errors, what can
I do?](#mysql-is-throwing-deadlock-errors-what-can-i-do).

### Why is Task.delay/apply\*/the worker just hanging? {#faq-publish-hanging}

**Answer:** There\'s a bug in some AMQP clients that\'ll make it hang if
it\'s not able to authenticate the current user, the password doesn\'t
match or the user doesn\'t have access to the virtual host specified. Be
sure to check your broker logs (for RabbitMQ that\'s
`/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit.log`{.interpreted-text role="file"} on most
systems), it usually contains a message describing the reason.

### Does it work on FreeBSD? {#faq-worker-on-freebsd}

**Answer:** Depends;

When using the RabbitMQ (AMQP) and Redis transports it should work out
of the box.

For other transports the compatibility prefork pool is used and requires
a working POSIX semaphore implementation, this is enabled in FreeBSD by
default since FreeBSD 8.x. For older version of FreeBSD, you have to
enable POSIX semaphores in the kernel and manually recompile billiard.

Luckily, Viktor Petersson has written a tutorial to get you started with
Celery on FreeBSD here:
<http://www.playingwithwire.com/2009/10/how-to-get-celeryd-to-work-on-freebsd/>

### I\'m having [IntegrityError: Duplicate Key]{.title-ref} errors. Why? {#faq-duplicate-key-errors}

**Answer:** See [MySQL is throwing deadlock errors, what can I
do?](#mysql-is-throwing-deadlock-errors-what-can-i-do). Thanks to
`@howsthedotcom`{.interpreted-text role="github_user"}.

### Why aren\'t my tasks processed? {#faq-worker-stops-processing}

**Answer:** With RabbitMQ you can see how many consumers are currently
receiving tasks by running the following command:

``` console
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues -p <myvhost> name messages consumers
Listing queues ...
celery     2891    2
```

This shows that there\'s 2891 messages waiting to be processed in the
task queue, and there are two consumers processing them.

One reason that the queue is never emptied could be that you have a
stale worker process taking the messages hostage. This could happen if
the worker wasn\'t properly shut down.

When a message is received by a worker the broker waits for it to be
acknowledged before marking the message as processed. The broker won\'t
re-send that message to another consumer until the consumer is shut down
properly.

If you hit this problem you have to kill all workers manually and
restart them:

``` console
$ pkill 'celery worker'

$ # - If you don't have pkill use:
$ # ps auxww | awk '/celery worker/ {print $2}' | xargs kill
```

You may have to wait a while until all workers have finished executing
tasks. If it\'s still hanging after a long time you can kill them by
force with:

``` console
$ pkill -9 'celery worker'

$ # - If you don't have pkill use:
$ # ps auxww | awk '/celery worker/ {print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

### Why won\'t my Task run? {#faq-task-does-not-run}

**Answer:** There might be syntax errors preventing the tasks module
being imported.

You can find out if Celery is able to run the task by executing the task
manually:

``` python
>>> from myapp.tasks import MyPeriodicTask
>>> MyPeriodicTask.delay()
```

Watch the workers log file to see if it\'s able to find the task, or if
some other error is happening.

### Why won\'t my periodic task run? {#faq-periodic-task-does-not-run}

**Answer:** See [Why won\'t my Task run?](#why-wont-my-task-run).

### How do I purge all waiting tasks? {#faq-purge-the-queue}

**Answer:** You can use the `celery purge` command to purge all
configured task queues:

``` console
$ celery -A proj purge
```

or programmatically:

``` pycon
>>> from proj.celery import app
>>> app.control.purge()
1753
```

If you only want to purge messages from a specific queue you have to use
the AMQP API or the `celery amqp`{.interpreted-text role="program"}
utility:

``` console
$ celery -A proj amqp queue.purge <queue name>
```

The number 1753 is the number of messages deleted.

You can also start the worker with the
`--purge <celery worker --purge>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
option enabled to purge messages when the worker starts.

### I\'ve purged messages, but there are still messages left in the queue? {#faq-messages-left-after-purge}

**Answer:** Tasks are acknowledged (removed from the queue) as soon as
they\'re actually executed. After the worker has received a task, it
will take some time until it\'s actually executed, especially if there
are a lot of tasks already waiting for execution. Messages that aren\'t
acknowledged are held on to by the worker until it closes the connection
to the broker (AMQP server). When that connection is closed (e.g.,
because the worker was stopped) the tasks will be re-sent by the broker
to the next available worker (or the same worker when it has been
restarted), so to properly purge the queue of waiting tasks you have to
stop all the workers, and then purge the tasks using
`celery.control.purge`{.interpreted-text role="func"}.

## Results {#faq-results}

### How do I get the result of a task if I have the ID that points there? {#faq-get-result-by-task-id}

**Answer**: Use \`task.AsyncResult\`:

``` pycon
>>> result = my_task.AsyncResult(task_id)
>>> result.get()
```

This will give you a `~celery.result.AsyncResult`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} instance using the tasks current result backend.

If you need to specify a custom result backend, or you want to use the
current application\'s default backend you can use
`@AsyncResult`{.interpreted-text role="class"}:

``` pycon
>>> result = app.AsyncResult(task_id)
>>> result.get()
```

## Security {#faq-security}

### Isn\'t using [pickle]{.title-ref} a security concern?

**Answer**: Indeed, since Celery 4.0 the default serializer is now JSON
to make sure people are choosing serializers consciously and aware of
this concern.

It\'s essential that you protect against unauthorized access to your
broker, databases and other services transmitting pickled data.

Note that this isn\'t just something you should be aware of with Celery,
for example also Django uses pickle for its cache client.

For the task messages you can set the
`task_serializer`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting to \"json\"
or \"yaml\" instead of pickle.

Similarly for task results you can set
`result_serializer`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}.

For more details of the formats used and the lookup order when checking
what format to use for a task see
`calling-serializers`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### Can messages be encrypted?

**Answer**: Some AMQP brokers supports using SSL (including RabbitMQ).
You can enable this using the `broker_use_ssl`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} setting.

It\'s also possible to add additional encryption and security to
messages, if you have a need for this then you should contact the
`mailing-list`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Is it safe to run `celery worker`{.interpreted-text role="program"} as root?

**Answer**: No!

We\'re not currently aware of any security issues, but it would be
incredibly naive to assume that they don\'t exist, so running the Celery
services (`celery worker`{.interpreted-text role="program"},
`celery beat`{.interpreted-text role="program"},
`celeryev`{.interpreted-text role="program"}, etc) as an unprivileged
user is recommended.

## Brokers {#faq-brokers}

### Why is RabbitMQ crashing?

**Answer:** RabbitMQ will crash if it runs out of memory. This will be
fixed in a future release of RabbitMQ. please refer to the RabbitMQ FAQ:
<https://www.rabbitmq.com/faq.html#node-runs-out-of-memory>

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This is no longer the case, RabbitMQ versions 2.0 and above includes a
new persister, that\'s tolerant to out of memory errors. RabbitMQ 2.1 or
higher is recommended for Celery.

If you\'re still running an older version of RabbitMQ and experience
crashes, then please upgrade!
:::

Misconfiguration of Celery can eventually lead to a crash on older
version of RabbitMQ. Even if it doesn\'t crash, this can still consume a
lot of resources, so it\'s important that you\'re aware of the common
pitfalls.

-   Events.

Running `~celery.bin.worker`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} with the
`-E <celery worker -E>`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option will
send messages for events happening inside of the worker.

Events should only be enabled if you have an active monitor consuming
them, or if you purge the event queue periodically.

-   AMQP backend results.

When running with the AMQP result backend, every task result will be
sent as a message. If you don\'t collect these results, they will build
up and RabbitMQ will eventually run out of memory.

This result backend is now deprecated so you shouldn\'t be using it. Use
either the RPC backend for rpc-style calls, or a persistent backend if
you need multi-consumer access to results.

Results expire after 1 day by default. It may be a good idea to lower
this value by configuring the `result_expires`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} setting.

If you don\'t use the results for a task, make sure you set the
[ignore_result]{.title-ref} option:

``` python
@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def mytask():
    pass

class MyTask(Task):
    ignore_result = True
```

### Can I use Celery with ActiveMQ/STOMP? {#faq-use-celery-with-stomp}

**Answer**: No. It used to be supported by `Carrot`{.interpreted-text
role="pypi"} (our old messaging library) but isn\'t currently supported
in `Kombu`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"} (our new messaging library).

### What features aren\'t supported when not using an AMQP broker? {#faq-non-amqp-missing-features}

This is an incomplete list of features not available when using the
virtual transports:

> -   Remote control commands (supported only by Redis).
>
> -   Monitoring with events may not work in all virtual transports.
>
> -   
>
>     The [header]{.title-ref} and [fanout]{.title-ref} exchange types
>
>     :   ([fanout]{.title-ref} is supported by Redis).

## Tasks {#faq-tasks}

### How can I reuse the same connection when calling tasks? {#faq-tasks-connection-reuse}

**Answer**: See the `broker_pool_limit`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} setting. The connection pool is enabled by default since
version 2.5.

### `sudo`{.interpreted-text role="command"} in a `subprocess`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} returns `None`{.interpreted-text role="const"} {#faq-sudo-subprocess}

There\'s a `sudo`{.interpreted-text role="command"} configuration option
that makes it illegal for process without a tty to run
`sudo`{.interpreted-text role="command"}:

``` text
Defaults requiretty
```

If you have this configuration in your `/etc/sudoers`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} file then tasks won\'t be able to call
`sudo`{.interpreted-text role="command"} when the worker is running as a
daemon. If you want to enable that, then you need to remove the line
from `/etc/sudoers`{.interpreted-text role="file"}.

See: <http://timelordz.com/wiki/Apache_Sudo_Commands>

### Why do workers delete tasks from the queue if they\'re unable to process them? {#faq-deletes-unknown-tasks}

**Answer**:

The worker rejects unknown tasks, messages with encoding errors and
messages that don\'t contain the proper fields (as per the task message
protocol).

If it didn\'t reject them they could be redelivered again and again,
causing a loop.

Recent versions of RabbitMQ has the ability to configure a dead-letter
queue for exchange, so that rejected messages is moved there.

### Can I call a task by name? {#faq-execute-task-by-name}

**Answer**: Yes, use `@send_task`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

You can also call a task by name, from any language, using an AMQP
client:

``` python
>>> app.send_task('tasks.add', args=[2, 2], kwargs={})
<AsyncResult: 373550e8-b9a0-4666-bc61-ace01fa4f91d>
```

To use `chain`, `chord` or `group` with tasks called by name, use the
`@Celery.signature`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method:

``` python
>>> chain(
...     app.signature('tasks.add', args=[2, 2], kwargs={}),
...     app.signature('tasks.add', args=[1, 1], kwargs={})
... ).apply_async()
<AsyncResult: e9d52312-c161-46f0-9013-2713e6df812d>
```

### Can I get the task id of the current task? {#faq-get-current-task-id}

**Answer**: Yes, the current id and more is available in the task
request:

    @app.task(bind=True)
    def mytask(self):
        cache.set(self.request.id, "Running")

For more information see `task-request-info`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

If you don\'t have a reference to the task instance you can use
`app.current_task <@current_task>`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}:

``` python
>>> app.current_task.request.id
```

But note that this will be any task, be it one executed by the worker,
or a task called directly by that task, or a task called eagerly.

To get the current task being worked on specifically, use
`app.current_worker_task <@current_worker_task>`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}:

``` python
>>> app.current_worker_task.request.id
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Both `~@current_task`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}, and
`~@current_worker_task`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} can be
`None`{.interpreted-text role="const"}.
:::

### Can I specify a custom task_id? {#faq-custom-task-ids}

**Answer**: Yes, use the [task_id]{.title-ref} argument to
`Task.apply_async`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}:

``` pycon
>>> task.apply_async(args, kwargs, task_id='…')
```

### Can I use decorators with tasks?

**Answer**: Yes, but please see note in the sidebar at
`task-basics`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Can I use natural task ids? {#faq-natural-task-ids}

**Answer**: Yes, but make sure it\'s unique, as the behavior for two
tasks existing with the same id is undefined.

The world will probably not explode, but they can definitely overwrite
each others results.

### Can I run a task once another task has finished? {#faq-task-callbacks}

**Answer**: Yes, you can safely launch a task inside a task.

A common pattern is to add callbacks to tasks:

``` python
from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger

logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def log_result(result):
    logger.info("log_result got: %r", result)
```

Invocation:

``` pycon
>>> (add.s(2, 2) | log_result.s()).delay()
```

See `userguide/canvas`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for more
information.

### Can I cancel the execution of a task? {#faq-cancel-task}

**Answer**: Yes, Use
`result.revoke() <celery.result.AsyncResult.revoke>`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"}:

``` pycon
>>> result = add.apply_async(args=[2, 2], countdown=120)
>>> result.revoke()
```

or if you only have the task id:

``` pycon
>>> from proj.celery import app
>>> app.control.revoke(task_id)
```

The latter also support passing a list of task-ids as argument.

### Why aren\'t my remote control commands received by all workers? {#faq-node-not-receiving-broadcast-commands}

**Answer**: To receive broadcast remote control commands, every worker
node creates a unique queue name, based on the nodename of the worker.

If you have more than one worker with the same host name, the control
commands will be received in round-robin between them.

To work around this you can explicitly set the nodename for every worker
using the `-n <celery worker -n>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
argument to `~celery.bin.worker`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}:

``` console
$ celery -A proj worker -n worker1@%h
$ celery -A proj worker -n worker2@%h
```

where `%h` expands into the current hostname.

### Can I send some tasks to only some servers? {#faq-task-routing}

**Answer:** Yes, you can route tasks to one or more workers, using
different message routing topologies, and a worker instance can bind to
multiple queues.

See `userguide/routing`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} for more
information.

### Can I disable prefetching of tasks? {#faq-disable-prefetch}

**Answer**: Maybe! The AMQP term \"prefetch\" is confusing, as it\'s
only used to describe the task prefetching *limit*. There\'s no actual
prefetching involved.

Disabling the prefetch limits is possible, but that means the worker
will consume as many tasks as it can, as fast as possible.

You can use the
`--disable-prefetch <celery worker --disable-prefetch>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} flag (or set `worker_disable_prefetch`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} to `True`) so that a worker only fetches a task when one
of its processes is free. This feature is currently only supported when
using Redis as the broker.

A discussion on prefetch limits, and configuration settings for a worker
that only reserves one task at a time is found here:
`optimizing-prefetch-limit`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Can I change the interval of a periodic task at runtime? {#faq-change-periodic-task-interval-at-runtime}

**Answer**: Yes, you can use the Django database scheduler, or you can
create a new schedule subclass and override
`~celery.schedules.schedule.is_due`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}:

``` python
from celery.schedules import schedule

class my_schedule(schedule):

    def is_due(self, last_run_at):
        return run_now, next_time_to_check
```

### Does Celery support task priorities? {#faq-task-priorities}

**Answer**: Yes, RabbitMQ supports priorities since version 3.5.0, and
the Redis transport emulates priority support.

You can also prioritize work by routing high priority tasks to different
workers. In the real world this usually works better than per message
priorities. You can use this in combination with rate limiting, and per
message priorities to achieve a responsive system.

### Should I use retry or acks_late? {#faq-acks_late-vs-retry}

**Answer**: Depends. It\'s not necessarily one or the other, you may
want to use both.

[Task.retry]{.title-ref} is used to retry tasks, notably for expected
errors that is catch-able with the `try`{.interpreted-text
role="keyword"} block. The AMQP transaction isn\'t used for these
errors: **if the task raises an exception it\'s still acknowledged!**

The [acks_late]{.title-ref} setting would be used when you need the task
to be executed again if the worker (for some reason) crashes
mid-execution. It\'s important to note that the worker isn\'t known to
crash, and if it does it\'s usually an unrecoverable error that requires
human intervention (bug in the worker, or task code).

In an ideal world you could safely retry any task that\'s failed, but
this is rarely the case. Imagine the following task:

``` python
@app.task
def process_upload(filename, tmpfile):
    # Increment a file count stored in a database
    increment_file_counter()
    add_file_metadata_to_db(filename, tmpfile)
    copy_file_to_destination(filename, tmpfile)
```

If this crashed in the middle of copying the file to its destination the
world would contain incomplete state. This isn\'t a critical scenario of
course, but you can probably imagine something far more sinister. So for
ease of programming we have less reliability; It\'s a good default,
users who require it and know what they are doing can still enable
acks_late (and in the future hopefully use manual acknowledgment).

In addition [Task.retry]{.title-ref} has features not available in AMQP
transactions: delay between retries, max retries, etc.

So use retry for Python errors, and if your task is idempotent combine
that with [acks_late]{.title-ref} if that level of reliability is
required.

### Can I schedule tasks to execute at a specific time? {#faq-schedule-at-specific-time}

**Answer**: Yes. You can use the [eta]{.title-ref} argument of
`Task.apply_async`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}. Note that using
distant [eta]{.title-ref} times is not recommended, and in such case
`periodic tasks<guide-beat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} should be
preferred.

See `calling-eta`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more details.

### Can I safely shut down the worker? {#faq-safe-worker-shutdown}

**Answer**: Yes, use the `TERM`{.interpreted-text role="sig"} signal.

This will tell the worker to finish all currently executing jobs and
shut down as soon as possible. No tasks should be lost even with
experimental transports as long as the shutdown completes.

You should never stop `~celery.bin.worker`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}
with the `KILL`{.interpreted-text role="sig"} signal (`kill -9`), unless
you\'ve tried `TERM`{.interpreted-text role="sig"} a few times and
waited a few minutes to let it get a chance to shut down.

Also make sure you kill the main worker process only, not any of its
child processes. You can direct a kill signal to a specific child
process if you know the process is currently executing a task the worker
shutdown is depending on, but this also means that a `WorkerLostError`
state will be set for the task so the task won\'t run again.

Identifying the type of process is easier if you have installed the
`setproctitle`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"} module:

``` console
$ pip install setproctitle
```

With this library installed you\'ll be able to see the type of process
in `ps`{.interpreted-text role="command"} listings, but the worker must
be restarted for this to take effect.

### What purpose does the database tables created by `django-celery-beat` have? {#faq-django-beat-database-tables}

When the database-backed schedule is used the periodic task schedule is
taken from the `PeriodicTask` model, there are also several other helper
tables (`IntervalSchedule`, `CrontabSchedule`, `PeriodicTasks`).

### What purpose does the database tables created by `django-celery-results` have? {#faq-django-result-database-tables}

The Django database result backend extension requires two extra models:
`TaskResult` and `GroupResult`.

## Windows {#faq-windows}

### Does Celery support Windows? {#faq-windows-worker-embedded-beat}

**Answer**: No.

Since Celery 4.x, Windows is no longer supported due to lack of
resources.

But it may still work and we are happy to accept patches.
