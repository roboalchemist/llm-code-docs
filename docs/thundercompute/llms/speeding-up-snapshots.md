# Speeding Up Snapshots

> Optimizing snapshot creation and restoration.

The size of your instance's disk directly affects how long snapshots take to create and restore.

This guide focuses on simple, high-impact steps to reduce snapshot size and speed up restores. We’ll expand this guide as more snapshot features ship.

## Quick Wins

1. **Keep your instance disk lean**: Remove large, transient files before snapshotting.
2. **Exclude non-essential data**: Use `.thunderignore` to skip caches, build outputs, and generated assets.

## .thunderignore Files for Exclusion

Often, you may want to exclude certain heavy files, cache directories, or generated files from a snapshot. You can do this using a `.thunderignore` file. This will help speed up snapshot creation and restoration.

1. Create a `.thunderignore` file in the `/` directory of your instance.
2. Add all paths you would like to ignore (absolute paths or relative to `/`). Patterns are supported - the syntax for these is the same as [`filepath.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) in Go. Patterns are matched against paths, not just basenames, so use `/` to anchor from the root (for example, `/data/*.parquet`). `*` and `?` are supported; `**` is not special and is treated literally. Blank lines are ignored, and lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.
3. Create your snapshot. The `.thunderignore` file is included in the snapshot so your exclusions persist on restore.

<Tip>
  Start by excluding caches, build outputs, and temporary files. You’ll usually see the biggest size reductions there.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Make sure you don’t exclude anything required to run your workloads after restore, such as model weights or datasets you actually need.
</Note>

Example `.thunderignore`:

```
# Caches and build artifacts
.cache/*
*.tmp

# Large data
/data/*.parquet
/models/*.pt

# Common language build outputs
/node_modules/*
/dist/*
/target/*
```
