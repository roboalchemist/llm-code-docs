# JsonTableColumnFilter

## Description

Provides a table column filter based on a JSON configuration. The JSON configuration should be an array of objects, where each object represents a table and its column filter. The object should have the following properties: - schema: the schema name of the table - table: the table name - included: an array of column names to include - excluded: an array of column names to exclude - includedPattern: a regular expression pattern to include columns - excludedPattern: a regular expression pattern to exclude columns The schema and table must be provided for each object, and one or more of the `included`, `excluded`, `includedPattern`, or `excludedPattern` properties must be provided. If any column is included as both included and excluded, the column will be excluded. If only a single filter is provided, the JSON configuration may be a single JSON object, rather than an array.
