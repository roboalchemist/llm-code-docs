# Configure an Apache Iceberg™ REST catalog integration with outbound private connectivity

This topic explains how to configure a [catalog integration](tables-iceberg.md)
for [Apache Iceberg™ tables](tables-iceberg.md) managed in a remote catalog that complies with the
open source [Apache Iceberg™ REST OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml).

With this configuration, you can use the catalog integration to connect to a remote Iceberg REST catalog through a private IP address
instead of over the public internet.

The following diagram shows how an Iceberg table uses a catalog integration with an external Iceberg catalog.

For general information about outbound private connectivity in Snowflake, including
[outbound private connectivity costs](private-connectivity-outbound.md), see
[Private connectivity for outbound network traffic](private-connectivity-outbound.md).

This topic covers the configuration steps for the following catalog types:

* Generic Iceberg REST catalogs
* AWS Glue Data Catalog
* Databricks Unity Catalog

> **Note:**
>
> * Private connectivity is only supported for catalog integrations on AWS that use AWS PrivateLink and Azure that use Azure Private Link.
> * Private connectivity is only available within the same cloud provider; the catalog and the Snowflake deployment must be running in the same cloud provider.
> * Catalog-vended credentials aren’t supported when you configure a catalog integration with outbound private connectivity.

## Step 1: Gather private connectivity information for your catalog

You must gather private connectivity information to specify it later when you provision a corresponding private connectivity endpoint in the Snowflake VPC or VNet.
When you provision a corresponding private connectivity endpoint, you create an AWS PrivateLink endpoint in Snowflake when your Snowflake
account is hosted in AWS or you create an Azure private endpoint when your Snowflake account is hosted on Azure.

Generic Iceberg REST catalogAWS Glue Data CatalogDatabricks Unity Catalog

* To gather private connectivity information for your catalog, see the documentation for the remote REST Iceberg catalog.

  The following example is an AWS VPC Endpoint Service ID in AWS: `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-0123456789abcdef`.

You must find the provider service name and host name for your AWS Glue Data Catalog:

1. To obtain your *provider service name* (`<provider_service_name>`), copy `com.amazonaws.<region>.glue` into your text editor
   where `<region>` is the AWS region where your Iceberg tables are stored.

   An example of a provider service name is `com.amazonaws.us-west-2.glue`. For more information, see [Creating an interface VPC endpoint for AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/vpc-interface-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoint-create)
   in the AWS documentation.
2. To obtain your *host name* (`<host_name>`), copy `glue.<region>.amazonaws.com` into your text editor where `<region>` is the AWS
   region where your Iceberg tables are stored.

   An example of a host name is `glue.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. For more information, see [Connecting to the Data Catalog using AWS Glue Iceberg REST endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/connect-glu-iceberg-rest.html)
   in the AWS documentation.

> **Note:**
>
> Alternatively, to retrieve these values, you can use the describe-vpc-endpoint-services subcommand from the AWS command line. For
> more information, see [Provision private connectivity endpoints](private-manage-endpoints-aws.md).

AWSAzure

You must find the PrivateLink VPC endpoint service ID for your Databricks Unity
Catalog and your Databricks workspace host name:

1. To find your *PrivateLink VPC endpoint service ID* (`<vpc_endpoint_service_id>`), see [PrivateLink VPC endpoint services](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/resources/ip-domain-region#privatelink) in the Databricks documentation.

   This topic contains the list of
   the VPC endpoint service IDs for each AWS region.
2. Copy the endpoint service ID for the region where your tables are hosted,
   which is the value for *Workspace (including REST API)*, into a text editor.

   An example of a VPC endpoint service ID is `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-0129f463fcfbc46c5`.

   For more information about
   PrivateLink at Databricks, see [Configure Front-end PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/security/network/front-end/front-end-private-connect) in the Databricks documentation.
3. To find your *Databricks workspace host name* (`<databricks_workspace_host_name>`), follow these steps:

   1. Retrieve your Databricks workspace URL.

      For instructions, see
      [Get identifiers for workspace objects](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/workspace/workspace-details) in the
      Databricks documentation.

      This topic includes an example Databricks workspace URL.
   2. Copy your Databricks workspace URL into a text editor.
   3. Remove `https://` from your Databricks workspace URL.

      The resulting value is your Databricks workspace host name.

      For example, if your Databricks per-workspace URL is `https://dbc-a1a11111-1a11.cloud.databricks.com`, your
      Databricks workspace host name is `dbc-a1a11111-1a11.cloud.databricks.com`.

You must find the resource ID for your Databricks workspace in the Azure portal and your Databricks workspace host name:

1. To find the *resource ID for your Databricks workspace in the Azure portal* (`<databricks_workspace_resource_id>`), follow these steps:

   1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Databricks workspace.
   2. On the **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, select the **JSON View** link.

      The resource ID for your Databricks workspace is displayed in the **Resource ID** field. An example of this resource ID is
      `/subscriptions/1111-22-333-4444-55555/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.Databricks/workspaces/my-databricks-workspace`.
   3. Copy the resource ID into a text editor.
2. To find your *Databricks workspace host name* (`<databricks_workspace_host_name>`), follow these steps:

   1. Retrieve your Databricks per-workspace URL.

      For instructions, see
      [Determine per-workspace URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details#determine-per-workspace-url)
      in the Azure Databricks documentation.
   2. Copy your Databricks per-workspace URL into a text editor.
   3. Remove `https://` from your Databricks per-workspace URL.

      The resulting value is your Databricks workspace host name.

      For example, if your Databricks per-workspace URL is `https://adb-1234567890123456.12.azuredatabricks.net`, your
      Databricks workspace host name is `adb-1234567890123456.12.azuredatabricks.net`.

## Step 2: Provision a private connectivity endpoint

In this step, you provision a private connectivity endpoint in the Snowflake VPC or VNet to enable Snowflake to connect to the remote
Iceberg REST catalog by using private connectivity.

Generic Iceberg REST catalogAWS Glue Data CatalogDatabricks Unity Catalog

* To provision a private connectivity endpoint, call the [SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT](../sql-reference/functions/system_provision_privatelink_endpoint.md) system function.

  For instructions on specifying the arguments for this system function, see the documentation for the remote REST Iceberg catalog
  that you want to connect to through private connectivity.

  The following code block shows an example of provisioning an AWS PrivateLink endpoint:

  ```sqlexample
  SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
    'com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-0123456789abcdef',
    'my.catalog.com'
    );
  ```

* To provision a private connectivity endpoint, call the [SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT](../sql-reference/functions/system_provision_privatelink_endpoint.md) system function:

  ```sqlexample
  USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
    '<provider_service_name>',
    '<host_name>'
  );
  ```

  Where:

  * `<provider_service_name>` is the provider service name that you copied when you gathered private connectivity information for your catalog.
  * `<host_name>` is the host name that you copied when you gathered private connectivity information for your catalog.

  For example:

  ```sqlexample
  SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
    'com.amazonaws.<region>.glue',
    'glue.<region>.amazonaws.com'
    );
  ```

  > **Note:**
  >
  > You only need to provision one private connectivity endpoint in the Snowflake VPC. This is because, with AWS Glue, you can use one Glue private connectivity endpoint to
  > access everything managed by the AWS Glue Data Catalog in the same region. For more information, see [Creating an interface VPC endpoint for AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/vpc-interface-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoint-create)
  > in the AWS documentation.

You only need to provision one private connectivity endpoint. Unity requires just one private connectivity endpoint to access everything managed by the Unity Data Catalog in the same region.

AWSAzure

* To provision a private connectivity endpoint, call the [SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT](../sql-reference/functions/system_provision_privatelink_endpoint.md) system function:

  > ```sqlexample
  > USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  >
  > SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
  >   '<vpc_endpoint_service_id>',
  >   '<databricks_workspace_host_name>'
  > );
  > ```
  >
  > Where:
  >
  > * `<vpc_endpoint_service_id>` is the PrivateLink VPC endpoint service ID that you copied when you
  >   gathered private connectivity information for your catalog
  > * `<databricks_workspace_host_name>` is the Databricks workspace host name that you retrieved when you
  >   gathered private connectivity information for your catalog
  >
  >   > **Note:**
  >   >
  >   > If you have multiple Databricks workspaces in the same AWS region, you can use a wildcard with your Databricks workspace URL.
  >
  > For example:
  >
  > ```sqlexample
  > SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
  >   'com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-0129f463fcfbc46c5',
  >   'dbc-a1a11111-1a11.cloud.databricks.com'
  > );
  > ```

* To provision a private connectivity endpoint, call the [SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT](../sql-reference/functions/system_provision_privatelink_endpoint.md) system function:

  > ```sqlexample
  > USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  >
  > SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
  >   '<databricks_workspace_resource_id>',
  >   '<databricks_workspace_host_name>',
  >   'databricks_ui_api'
  > );
  > ```
  >
  > Where:
  >
  > * `<<databricks_workspace_resource_id>>` is the resource ID for your Databricks workspace in the Azure portal that
  >   you copied when you
  >   gathered private connectivity information for your catalog.
  > * `<databricks_workspace_host_name>` is the Databricks workspace host name that you retrieved when you
  >   gathered private connectivity information for your catalog.
  > * `databricks_ui_ap` is the sub-resource value for an Azure Databricks workspace.
  >
  > For example:
  >
  > ```sqlexample
  > SELECT SYSTEM$PROVISION_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT(
  >   '/subscriptions/1111-22-333-4444-55555/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.Databricks/workspaces/my-databricks-workspace',
  >   'adb-1234567890123456.12.azuredatabricks.net',
  >   'databricks_ui_api'
  > );
  > ```

## Step 3: Verify the endpoint status

In this step, you verify the endpoint status of the private connectivity endpoint in the Snowflake VPC or VNet that you provisioned in the
previous step.

* To verify the endpoint status, call the [SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO](../sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_endpoints_info.md) system function:

  ```sqlexample
  SELECT SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO();
  ```

  The endpoint is ready to use when the `status` changes from `pending` to `available`.

## Step 4: Additional catalog-specific configuration

Complete the additional configuration steps for your catalog type.

> **Note:**
>
> For some catalogs or some types of private connectivity endpoints, you also need to approve the connection or allowlist the private
> connectivity endpoints on the catalog server side.

Generic Iceberg REST catalogAWS Glue Data CatalogDatabricks Unity Catalog

* To complete the additional configuration steps, see the documentation for the remote REST Iceberg catalog, and then proceed
  to the next step.

No additional configuration is required. Proceed to the next step.

In this step, you register the Snowflake endpoint in Databricks to accept the traffic coming from the VPC endpoint.

AWSAzure

**Complete configuration steps in Databricks**

Before you register the Snowflake VPC endpoint, ensure that you complete the following configurations in Databricks:

* Your workspace must be located in a customer-managed VPC.
* Your Databricks account must be in the enterprise subscription.
* You must set up a private access configuration.

For more information, see [Azure Databricks: Configure Front-end PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/front-end/front-end-private-connect) in the Databricks documentation.

**Register the Snowflake VPC endpoint**

To register the VPC endpoint, complete the following steps:

1. In Snowflake, call the [SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO](../sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_endpoints_info.md) system function, and then copy the value for `snowflake_endpoint_name` in the response:

   ```sqlexample
   SELECT SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO();
   ```

   For example, the output to copy looks like `vpce-11111aaaa11aaaa11`. This value is the VPC endpoint ID in your Snowflake account.
2. In Databricks, register the Snowflake VPC endpoint ID by specifying the VPC endpoint ID value that you copied in the previous step.

   For instructions, see [Manage VPC endpoint registrations](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/classic/vpc-endpoints) in the
   Databricks documentation.
3. In Databricks, add a private access setting, and then specify the VPC endpoint that you registered in the previous step.

   For instructions, see
   [Manage private access settings](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/classic/private-access-settings) in the Databricks
   documentation.

**Complete configuration steps in Databricks**

Before you register the Snowflake VPC endpoint, ensure that you complete the required configurations in Databricks, which
includes deploying Azure Databricks in your Azure virtual network. For all these required configurations, see
[Requirements for configuring Front-end Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/front-end/front-end-private-connect#requirements)
in the Azure Databricks documentation.

**Approve the private connectivity from Snowflake**

To approve the private connectivity from Snowflake, complete the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Databricks workspace.
2. In the sidebar, click Networking.
3. Click Private endpoint connections.
4. From the list of private endpoint connections, click the checkbox next to the private endpoint connection that you want to approve.
5. Above the list, click the Approve button.

## Step 5: Create a catalog integration

In this step, to enable private connectivity, you configure a catalog integration for the catalog REST endpoint.

Generic Iceberg REST catalogAWS Glue Data CatalogDatabricks Unity Catalog

* To configure this catalog integration, run the [CREATE CATALOG INTEGRATION](../sql-reference/sql/create-catalog-integration-rest.md) command.

  For example:

  ```sqlexample
  CREATE OR REPLACE CATALOG INTEGRATION iceberg_rest_catalog_cat_int_private
    CATALOG_SOURCE = ICEBERG_REST
    TABLE_FORMAT = ICEBERG
    REST_CONFIG = (
      CATALOG_URI = '<rest_api_endpoint_url>'
      CATALOG_API_TYPE = PRIVATE
      CATALOG_NAME = '<catalog_name>'
    )
    REST_AUTHENTICATION = (
      TYPE = OAUTH
      OAUTH_TOKEN_URI = '<token_server_uri>'
      OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = '<oauth_client_id>'
      OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = '<oauth_client_secret>'
      OAUTH_ALLOWED_SCOPES = ('all-apis', 'sql')
  )
  ENABLED = true;
  ```

  > **Important:**
  >
  > To use outbound private connectivity, you must specify `CATALOG_API_TYPE=PRIVATE` when you create the integration.

  For more information, including the supported authentication methods, see [CREATE CATALOG INTEGRATION (Apache Iceberg™ REST)](../sql-reference/sql/create-catalog-integration-rest.md).

* To configure this catalog integration, follow the steps in [Configure a catalog integration for AWS Glue Iceberg REST](tables-iceberg-configure-catalog-integration-rest-glue.md).

  > **Important:**
  >
  > To use outbound private connectivity, you must specify `CATALOG_API_TYPE = AWS_PRIVATE_GLUE` when you create the integration
  > instead of `CATALOG_API_TYPE = AWS_GLUE`.

  For example:

  ```sqlexample
  CREATE CATALOG INTEGRATION glue_rest_catalog_int
    CATALOG_SOURCE = ICEBERG_REST
    TABLE_FORMAT = ICEBERG
    REST_CONFIG = (
      CATALOG_URI = 'https://glue.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/iceberg'
      CATALOG_API_TYPE = AWS_PRIVATE_GLUE
      CATALOG_NAME = '123456789012'
    )
    REST_AUTHENTICATION = (
      TYPE = SIGV4
      SIGV4_IAM_ROLE = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role'
      SIGV4_SIGNING_REGION = 'us-west-2'
    )
    ENABLED = TRUE;
  ```

* To create a REST catalog integration to connect to Databricks Unity Catalog, use the [CREATE CATALOG INTEGRATION (Apache Iceberg™ REST)](../sql-reference/sql/create-catalog-integration-rest.md) command.

  > **Important:**
  > * To use outbound private connectivity, you must specify `CATALOG_API_TYPE = PRIVATE` as one of the `REST_CONFIG`
  >   parameters when you create the integration.
  > * For `CATALOG_URI` and `OAUTH_TOKEN_URI`, you must use the standard public hostname, which is your Databricks workspace URL,

    REST_AUTHENTICATION = (
      TYPE = BEARER
      BEARER_TOKEN = 'eyAbCD...eyDeF...'
    )
    ENABLED = TRUE;
  ```

  **Example: OAuth authentication with service principal**

  The following example uses OAuth authentication with a Databricks service principal. You must have a service principal
  configured in Databricks with the necessary credentials, which are the `client_id` and `client_secret`. For instructions on adding a
  service principal, see [Databricks on AWS: Add service principals to your account](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/users-groups/manage-service-principals#-add-service-principals-to-your-account)

    For example, `https://adb-1234567890123456.12.azuredatabricks.net` is a Databricks per-workspace URL.

## Step 6: Verify your catalog integration

* To verify your catalog integration configuration, call the SYSTEM$VERIFY_CATALOG_INTEGRATION function.

  For more information, including an example, see [Use SYSTEM$VERIFY_CATALOG_INTEGRATION to check your catalog integration configuration](tables-iceberg-configure-catalog-integration-rest-check-config.md).

## (Optional) Step 7: Update your catalog configuration

We recommend that you update the configuration for your remote catalog so that it’s only accessible through private connectivity.

Generic Iceberg REST catalogAWS Glue Data CatalogDatabricks Unity Catalog

* To disable public access to your catalog, see the documentation for the remote catalog that you want to connect to through private connectivity.

AWS Glue Data Catalog doesn’t support restricting access to only allowlisted VPC endpoints.

AWSAzure

* To disable public access to your catalog, see [Databricks on AWS: Configure Front-end PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/front-end/front-end-private-connect)
  in the Databricks documentation.

* To disable public access to your catalog, see [Configure Front-end Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/front-end/front-end-private-connect)
  in the Azure Databricks documentation.

## Next steps

This section contains some tasks that you can perform after you configure your catalog integration:

* Monitor your private connectivity endpoints
* Configure an external volume with outbound private connectivity
* Create a catalog-linked database
* Write to your remote catalog

### Monitor your private connectivity endpoints

* To monitor your private connectivity endpoints, see [OUTBOUND_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS view](../sql-reference/account-usage/outbound_privatelink_endpoints.md)
  in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema.
* To explore the cost of your private connectivity endpoints, see [Outbound private connectivity costs](private-connectivity-outbound.md).

### Configure an external volume with outbound private connectivity

> * To enable private connectivity between Snowflake and your storage buckets, configure an [external volume](tables-iceberg.md)
>   with outbound private connectivity.
>
>   For more information about external volumes, see [Configure an external volume](tables-iceberg-configure-external-volume.md).
>
>   > **Note:**
>   >
>   > Catalog-vended credentials aren’t supported when you configure a catalog integration with outbound private connectivity.

* To configure an external volume with outbound private connectivity, follow the instructions for your cloud provider:

  * **AWS**: [Private connectivity to external volumes for Amazon Web Services](tables-iceberg-configure-external-volume-s3-private.md)
  * **Azure**: [Private connectivity to external volumes for Microsoft Azure](tables-iceberg-configure-external-volume-azure-private.md)

### Create a catalog-linked database

* To create a Snowflake database that is connected to your external Iceberg REST catalog, create a catalog-linked database.

  For more information, see [Create a catalog-linked database](tables-iceberg-catalog-linked-database.md).

  > **Note:**
  >
  > When you create the catalog-linked database, specify a catalog integration that is configured with outbound private connectivity.
