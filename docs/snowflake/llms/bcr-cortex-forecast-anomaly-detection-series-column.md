# Cortex ML Functions - New column in single-series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection results

The SERIES column now appears in all Time-Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection results, instead of just multi-series
results. This change was rolled out in phases and completed on May 10, 2024.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Before the change | The SERIES column appears only in multi-series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection results. It does not appear in single-series results. |
| After the change | The SERIES column appears in all Forecasting and Anomaly Detection results. In single-series results, this column is NULL in all rows. |
