# Fine-tuning `arctic-extract` models

You can now fine-tune `arctic-extract` models using the [Snowflake Cortex Fine-tuning](cortex-finetuning.md)
function and [Snowflake Datasets](../../developer-guide/snowflake-ml/dataset.md). The fine-tuned model can then be used for inference with the
[AI_EXTRACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_extract.md) function.

## Syntax

For specific syntax, usage notes, and examples, see:

* FINETUNE ('CREATE') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)
* FINETUNE ('DESCRIBE') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)
* [FINETUNE ('SHOW') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/finetune-show.md)
* [FINETUNE ('CANCEL') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/finetune-cancel.md)

### FINETUNE ('CREATE') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)

Creates a fine-tuning job.

#### Syntax

```sqlsyntax
SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.FINETUNE(
  'CREATE',
  '@<database>.<schema>.<model_name>',
  'arctic-extract',
  '<training_dataset>'
  [
    , '<validation_dataset>'
  ]
)
```

#### Required parameters

`'CREATE'`
:   Specifies that you want to create a fine-tuning job.

`'training_dataset'`
:   Dataset object to use for training. For more information, see Dataset requirements.

#### Optional parameters

`'validation_dataset'`
:   Dataset object to use for validation. For more information, see Dataset requirements.

> **Note:**
>
> The `options` parameter is not supported for fine-tuning `arctic-extract` models. The number of epochs is automatically
> determined by the system.

#### Access control requirements

| Privilege | Object | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USAGE or OWNERSHIP | DATABASE | The database that the Dataset object is stored in. |
| USAGE or OWNERSHIP | SCHEMA | The schema that the Dataset object is stored in. |
| READ or OWNERSHIP | STAGE | The stage that the document files are stored in. |
| USAGE or OWNERSHIP | SCHEMA | The schema that the fine-tuned model is stored in. |
| CREATE MODEL | SCHEMA | The schema that the fine-tuned model is stored in. |

Additionally, to use the FINETUNE function, the ACCOUNTADMIN role must grant the SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER database
role to the user who will call the function. See [LLM Functions required privileges](aisql.md)
topic for details.

#### Example

```sqlexample
  SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.FINETUNE(
  'CREATE',
  '@database.schema.model_name',
  'arctic-extract`,
  'snow://dataset/training_ds/versions/2',
  'snow://dataset/validation_ds/versions/4'
);
```

### FINETUNE ('DESCRIBE') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)

Describes the properties of a fine-tuning job.

For syntax and parameters, see [FINETUNE ('DESCRIBE') (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/finetune-describe.md).

An example output for a successful job when fine-tuning `arctic-extract` model:

```output
{
  "base_model":"arctic-extract",
  "created_on":1717004388348,
  "finished_on":1717004691577,
  "id":"ft_6556e15c-8f12-4d94-8cb0-87e6f2fd2299",
  "model":"mydb.myschema.my_tuned_model",
  "progress":1.0,
  "status":"SUCCESS",
  "training_data":"snow://dataset/training_ds/versions/2",
  "trained_tokens":2670734,
  "training_result":{"validation_loss":1.0138969421386719,"training_loss":0.6477728401547047},
  "validation_data":"snow://dataset/validation_ds/versions/4",
}
```

## Dataset requirements

The [Dataset](../../developer-guide/snowflake-ml/dataset.md) used for training and validation must contain the following columns:

File:
:   A string containing the file path to the document for extraction. For example: `@db.schema.stage/file.pdf`

Prompt:
:   A JSON value that specifies key and question pairs for extraction in one of the formats supported by the `responseFormat` argument of
    the [AI_EXTRACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_extract.md) function.

    For more information, see [AI_EXTRACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_extract.md).

Response:
:   A JSON object containing key and response pairs.

> **Note:**
>
> Column names are case-insensitive and can be in any order in the Dataset; however, all required columns
> (`File`, `Prompt`, and `Response`) must be present for the Dataset to be valid. Additional columns in the Dataset are ignored.

When preparing the Dataset, note the following:

* The schema of the fine-tuned model is the unique set of all questions in the Dataset.
* The answers in the `Response` column should match the questions in the `Prompt` column by matching keys in the `Prompt` and `Response` columns.
* You don’t have to specify the same set of questions for every document.
* To improve model accuracy, add a prompt and response row for each question, even if the model’s default response is correct. This action confirms that the default answer is accurate.

For more information about Datasets, see [Snowflake Datasets](../../developer-guide/snowflake-ml/dataset.md).

### Example Dataset

| File | Prompt | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file1.pdf` | `{"date": "What is the date?", "total": "What is the total amount?"}` | `{"date": "2024-06-30", "total": "82.50"}` |
| `file2.pdf` | `[["invoice_number", "What is the invoice number?"], ["vendor", "What is the vendor name?"]]` | `{"invoice_number": "543433434", "vendor": "Example Corp"}` |
| `file3.pdf` | ```output {   "schema":   {     "type": "object",     "properties": {       "deductions": {         "description": "Deductions",         "type": "object",         "properties": {           "deductions_name": {             "type": "array"           },           "current": {             "type": "array"           }         }       }     }   } }``` | ```output {   "deductions": {     "deductions_name": [       "Federal Tax",       "Wyoming State Tax",       "SDI",       "Soc Sec / OASDI",       "Health Insurance Tax",       "None"     ],     "current": [       "82.50",       "64.08",       "None",       "13.32",       "91.74",       "21.46"     ]   } }``` |

> **Note:**
>
> When you create the Dataset, set the response to `None` if the document does not contain an answer to the question.

## Usage notes

* Snowflake recommends using at least 20 documents for fine-tuning.
* Supported file formats for documents are:

  > * PDF
  > * PNG
  > * JPG, JPEG
  > * TIFF, TIF
* The maximum number of pages per document is:

  * 64 pages for AWS US West 2 (Oregon) and AWS Europe Central 1 (Frankfurt)
  * 125 pages for AWS US East 1 (N. Virginia) and Azure East US 2 (Virginia)
* The maximum number of unique document files in the Dataset is 1,000. You can reference the same document file multiple times.
* A limit exists on how many questions and documents can be in a fine-tuning job. Number of questions multiplied by total number
  of pages in all document files in the Dataset must be equal or less than 50,000.

  For example, some valid combinations are:

  | Number of questions | Number of pages | Number of document file references [1] |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 10 | 1 | 5,000 |
  | 100 | 1 | 500 |
  | 10 | 10 | 500 |
  | 25 | 10 | 200 |

[1]

The total number of document file references (including repeats). The maximum number of unique document files in the Dataset is 1,000. However, you can reference the same file multiple times.

## Create a fine-tuning job

To create a fine-tuning job, you must create a Dataset object that contains the training data. The following example shows how to
create a Dataset object and use the Dataset to create a fine-tuning job for an `arctic-extract` model.

1. Create the table which will contain the training data:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE my_data_table (f FILE, p VARCHAR, r VARCHAR);
   ```

2. Populate the table with the training data:

   ```sqlexample
   INSERT INTO my_data_table (f, p, r)
   SELECT TO_FILE('@db.schema.stage', '1.pdf'), '{"net": "What is the net value?"}', '{"net": "3,762.56"}';
   ```

3. Create the Dataset object:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE OR REPLACE DATASET my_dataset;
   ```

4. Create a new version of the Dataset that adds the training data, using the [FL_GET_STAGE](../../sql-reference/functions/fl_get_stage.md) and
   the [FL_GET_RELATIVE_PATH](../../sql-reference/functions/fl_get_relative_path.md) functions to get the file paths:

   ```sqlexample
   ALTER DATASET my_dataset
   ADD VERSION 'v1' FROM (
     SELECT FL_GET_STAGE(f) || '/' || FL_GET_RELATIVE_PATH(f) AS "file",
          p AS "prompt",
          r AS "response"
     FROM my_data_table
   );
   ```

5. Create a fine-tuning job:

   ```sqlexample
   SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.FINETUNE(
     'CREATE',
     'my_tuned_model',
     'arctic-extract',
     'snow://dataset/db.schema.my_dataset/versions/v1'
   );
   ```

## Use your fine-tuned `arctic-extract` model for inference

To use the fine-tuned `arctic-extract` model for inference, ensure you have the following privileges on the model object:

* OWNERSHIP
* USAGE
* READ

To use the fine-tuned `arctic-extract` model for inference with the [AI_EXTRACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_extract.md) function,
specify the model using the `model` parameter as shown in the following example:

```sqlexample
SELECT AI_EXTRACT(
  model => 'db.schema.my_tuned_model',
  file => TO_FILE('@db.schema.files','document.pdf')
);
```

You can overwrite questions used for fine-tuning by using the `responseFormat` parameter as shown in the following example:

```sqlexample
SELECT AI_EXTRACT(
  model => 'db.schema.my_tuned_model',
  file => TO_FILE('@db.schema.files','document.pdf'),
  responseFormat => [['name', 'What is the first name of the employee?'], ['city', 'Where does the employee live?']]
);
```

For more information, see [AI_EXTRACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_extract.md).

> **Tip:**
>
> You can copy your fine-tuned `arctic-extract` model between databases and/or schemas within an account or between accounts.
> For more information, see [Copy arctic-extract models between databases, schemas, and accounts](copy-arctic-extract-models.md).
