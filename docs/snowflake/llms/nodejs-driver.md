# Node.js Driver

> **Note:**
>
> This driver currently does not support GCP regional endpoints. Please ensure that any workloads using through this driver do not require support for regional endpoints on GCP. If you have questions about this, please contact Snowflake Support.

Written in pure JavaScript, the Node.js driver provides a native asynchronous Node.js interface to Snowflake.

For more information about Node.js, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

The driver supports the versions of Node.js supported by the Node.js Foundation. The driver supports the following Node.js versions:

* v18
* v20
* v22
* v24

See the [driver release timeline](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) for more information.

The typical workflow for using the driver is:

1. Establish a connection with Snowflake.
2. Execute statements, e.g. queries and DDL/DML commands.
3. Consume the results.
4. Terminate the connection.

> **Important:**
>
> To upload and download files from a Snowflake stage, you must use the following minimum versions of the driver:
>
> * Version 1.6.2 to upload files (using the [PUT](../../sql-reference/sql/put.md) command)
> * Version 1.6.6 to download files (using the [GET](../../sql-reference/sql/get.md) command)
