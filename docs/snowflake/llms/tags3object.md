## Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AWS Credentials Provider service | The Controller Service that is used to obtain AWS credentials provider |
| Append Tag | If set to true, the tag will be appended to the existing set of tags on the S3 object. Any existing tags with the same key as the new tag will be updated with the specified value. If set to false, the existing tags will be removed and the new tag will be set on the S3 object. |
| Bucket | The S3 Bucket to interact with |
| Communications Timeout | The amount of time to wait in order to establish a connection to AWS or receive data from AWS before timing out. |
| Custom Signer Class Name | Fully qualified class name of the custom signer class. The signer must implement com.amazonaws.auth. Signer interface. |
| Custom Signer Module Location | Comma-separated list of paths to files and/or directories which contain the custom signer’s JAR file and its dependencies (if any). |
| Endpoint Override URL | Endpoint URL to use instead of the AWS default including scheme, host, port, and path. The AWS libraries select an endpoint URL based on the AWS region, but this property overrides the selected endpoint URL, allowing use with other S3-compatible endpoints. |

| Region | The AWS Region to connect to. |
| SSL Context Service | Specifies an optional SSL Context Service that, if provided, will be used to create connections |

| Tag Key | The key of the tag that will be set on the S3 Object |
| Tag Value | The value of the tag that will be set on the S3 Object |
