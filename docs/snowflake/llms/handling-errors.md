# Getting details about an error

If the statement does not execute successfully, Snowflake returns one of the following response codes, as shown in the flow chart
below:

As shown in this flow chart:

* If the statement execution takes longer than the timeout period specified by the `timeout` field in the request (or the
  timeout specified by the [STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS](../../sql-reference/parameters.md) parameter, if the `timeout` field is not set),
  Snowflake returns the HTTP response code 408 with a [QueryStatus](reference.md) object.

  Use this object to get [details about the cancellation of the statement execution](handling-responses.md).
* If an error occurred when executing the statement, Snowflake returns the HTTP response code 422 with a
  [QueryFailureStatus](reference.md) object.

  You can get details about the error from this object.
