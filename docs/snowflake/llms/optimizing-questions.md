# Question optimization for extracting information with Document AI

This topic describes optimizing questions for the Document AI model to provide correct responses.

When you work with Document AI, use natural language to ask the model questions about your documents. To ask a question that
returns an accurate answer, follow these guidelines:

* Use plain English.
* For each question, know what answers you expect.
* Be specific; for example, if the document includes several dates (such as issuing date and signature date), do not ask
  “What is the date?” without including more details.
* Ask for a single value in each question.
* Do not expect Document AI to guess your intentions or have extended knowledge in a specific domain.

Consider the following document as an example. This purchase and sale agreement includes information such as the offer expiration date,
the names of the buyers and the seller, and the included items.

The following table provides examples of questions you can ask the Document AI model and the expected answers.

| Example question | Answer |
