# STAGE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY

This table function can be used to query the average daily data storage usage, in bytes, for all the Snowflake stages in your account within a specified date range. The output will include storage for:

* Named internal stages.
* Default staging areas (for tables and users).

> **Note:**
>
> This function returns stage storage usage within the last 6 months.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
STAGE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY(
      [ DATE_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
      [, DATE_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ] )
```

## Arguments

All the arguments are optional.

`DATE_RANGE_START => constant_expr` , . `DATE_RANGE_END => constant_expr`
:   The date range, within the last 6 months, for which to retrieve stage storage usage:

    * If an end date is not specified, then [CURRENT_DATE](current_date.md) is used as the end of the range.
    * If a start date is not specified, then `DATE_RANGE_END` is used as the start of the range (i.e. the default is one day of storage usage).

    If the range falls outside the last 6 months, an error is returned.

## Usage notes

* Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role or any role that has been explicitly granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege.
* When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see
  [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).

## Output

The function returns the following columns:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USAGE_DATE | DATE | Date (in the UTC time zone) of this storage usage record |
| AVERAGE_STAGE_BYTES | NUMBER | Number of bytes of stage storage used |

## Examples

Retrieve average daily storage usage for the past 10 days for all internal stages in your account:

```sqlexample
select *
from table(information_schema.stage_storage_usage_history(dateadd('days',-10,current_date()),current_date()));
```
