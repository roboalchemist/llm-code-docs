# Understanding data transfer cost

Data transfer is the process of moving data into (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake.

Snowflake charges a per-byte fee for data egress when users transfer data from a Snowflake account into a different region on the same
cloud platform or into a completely different cloud platform. Data transfers within the same region are free.

The per-byte rate for transferring data out of a region depends where your Snowflake account is hosted. For data transfer pricing, see
the [pricing guide](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/pricing-guide/).

> **Note:**
>
> Snowflake does not charge *data ingress* fees. However, a cloud storage provider might charge a data egress fee for transferring
> data from the provider to your Snowflake account.
>
> Contact your cloud storage provider (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure) to determine whether they apply data egress
> charges to transfer data from their network and region of origin to the cloud provider’s network and region where your Snowflake
> account is hosted.

## Snowflake features that incur transfer costs

Snowflake features that transfer data from a Snowflake account into a different region on the same cloud platform or into a completely
different cloud platform incur data transfer costs. For example, the following actions incur data transfer costs:

* [Unloading data](data-unload-overview.md) - Unloading data from Snowflake to Amazon, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.

  Typically this involves the use of [COPY INTO <location>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.md) to unload data to cloud storage in a region or cloud
  platform different from where your Snowflake account is hosted.
  In addition, unloading data typically involves a stage, with its associated costs.
* [Replicating Data](account-replication-intro.md) - Replication of databases, creating a snapshot of the database to a
  secondary database.

  Typically this involves replicating data to a Snowflake account in a region or cloud platform different from where your primary (origin)
  Snowflake account is hosted. See also [Replication Billing](account-replication-cost.md).
* [External network access](../developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-overview.md) - Accessing network locations
  external to Snowflake from procedure or UDF handler code using external access. See also
  [Costs of external network access](../developer-guide/external-network-access/external-network-access-billing.md).
* [Copy files](../sql-reference/sql/copy-files.md) - Copy files from a source stage to an output stage. For example, with [Writing files from Snowpark Python UDFs and UDTFs](../developer-guide/snowpark/python/creating-udfs.md), you can copy files to an external stage that is on a different region/cloud.
* [Writing external functions](../sql-reference/external-functions.md) - Use of external functions to transfer data from your Snowflake account to AWS, Microsoft
  Azure, or Google Public cloud. See also [External Functions Billing](../sql-reference/external-functions-introduction.md).
* [Cross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment](../collaboration/provider-understand-cost-auto-fulfillment.md) -
  Using auto-fulfillment to offer listings to consumers in other cloud regions.
* [FileOperation.put](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.FileOperation.put) - PUT calls to external stages from Snowpark stored procedures.
* [Cross-region/cross-cloud Iceberg writes](tables-iceberg.md) - When you [use Snowflake as the catalog](tables-iceberg.md),
  writing new data into the Iceberg table incurs costs for data transfer usage if the active storage location is in a different region or
  with another cloud provider. However, data transfers within the same region are free.

> **Note:**
>
> Snowflake does not apply data egress charges when a Snowflake client or driver retrieves query results across regions within
> the same cloud platform or across different cloud platforms.
