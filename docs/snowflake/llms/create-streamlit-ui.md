# Create and deploy Streamlit apps using Snowsight

Streamlit in Snowflake provides a Python editor in Snowsight where you can write, edit, and run
code for a Streamlit app. The editor provides auto-completion and displays documentation for Streamlit
and Snowpark functions.

Ensure that you’ve reviewed the [prerequisites](overview.md) before you use Snowsight to work with Streamlit apps.

## Create a Streamlit app by using Snowsight

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. Select + Streamlit.

   The Create Streamlit App window opens.
4. Enter a name for your app.
5. In the Warehouse dropdown, select the warehouse where you want to run your app and execute queries.
6. In the App location dropdown, select the database and schema for your app.
7. Select Create.

   The Streamlit in Snowflake editor opens an example Streamlit app in Viewer mode. Viewer mode allows you to see
   how the Streamlit application appears to users.

## Edit a Streamlit app

> **Note:**
>
> For Streamlit apps created using the [ROOT_LOCATION parameter](../../../sql-reference/sql/create-streamlit.md), multi-file editing is not supported.

The Streamlit in Snowflake editing interface is divided into three panes:

* Object browser:

  * The Files tab allows you to see the files of your Streamlit app.
  * The Databases tab allows you to see the databases, schemas, and views you have permissions to access.
* Streamlit editor: Provides a Python editor for your Streamlit code.
* Streamlit preview: Displays the running Streamlit app.

> **Tip:**
>
> To change the display, use the show/hide buttons in the lower-left corner of the Streamlit in Snowflake editor.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. Select the Streamlit app you want to edit.

   The main Streamlit app opens in the Streamlit in Snowflake viewer.
4. Select Edit.

   The Streamlit editor opens.
5. In the Files tab, select a file to edit.
6. Update the file.
7. To view the changes you made to the app, select Run.

### Add files to your Streamlit app from local computer

You can upload files from your local computer to be used in your Streamlit app.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. In the Files tab, next to the database object explorer, select the  icon to select files to upload.
4. Browse and select or drag and drop files into the dialog.
5. Select Upload to upload your file.

Uploaded files are saved to the Streamlit app’s internal stage and persisted between sessions. You can reference uploaded files using their
local paths.

> **Note:**
>
> * Load files before starting your Streamlit app. If you load files after a session has started, you have to restart your session to access the files.
> * The size limit per file is 250 MB or less.

## Run a Streamlit app in Streamlit in Snowflake

* To update the content in the Streamlit preview pane, select Run.

## Manage packages for a Streamlit app

You can view, add, and remove external Python packages
for your Streamlit app by using the Streamlit editor in Snowsight.

## View a Streamlit app

For information about the privileges required to view a Streamlit app, see [Privileges required to view a Streamlit app](../object-management/privileges.md).

## Manage Streamlit apps

After creating a Streamlit app, you can perform additional related tasks that are described in the
following sections.

### Share a Streamlit app

You can share your Streamlit app with other Snowflake users assigned to a specific role. Sharing
your Streamlit app lets other users interact with your application when it is running.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. Select the Streamlit app you want to share.
4. Select Share.

   The Share Streamlit window opens.
5. Begin typing the name of the role you want to share your Streamlit app with.
6. Select the name of the role.

   The new role appears in the list of roles. Add additional roles as necessary.
7. To copy the URL to your Streamlit app, select Copy to clipboard.

   You can then send this URL through email or text.
8. Select Done.

### Rename a Streamlit app

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. Select the Streamlit app you want to rename.
4. Select Edit.
5. Select the name of the app in the upper-left corner.
6. Enter the new name in the text box.
7. Click outside the text box to commit the change.

### Change the warehouse of a Streamlit app

While developing, testing, and running a Streamlit app, you might want to modify the warehouse used to run the app and
queries. For example, you might need to use a warehouse with more capacity to handle queries run by the app.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. Select the Streamlit app whose warehouse you want to change.
4. Select the name of the app in the upper-left corner.
5. Select the new warehouse from the dropdown list.

### Delete a Streamlit app

Deleting a Streamlit app permanently removes it from Snowflake. Any users with whom you have shared the app
will no longer be able to view and interact with the Streamlit app. Before deleting a Streamlit app, ensure that you have
saved your application code outside of Snowflake.

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Streamlit.
3. Select the Streamlit app you want to delete.
4. Select Edit.
5. Select the name of the app in the upper-left corner.
6. Select Delete, and then select Delete App.

Snowflake deletes the Streamlit app and displays the updated list of available apps.
