# Configuring a client, driver, library, or third-party application to connect to Snowflake

To configure a client, driver, library, or third-party application to connect to Snowflake, you must specify your Snowflake
account identifier. In addition, you might need to specify the warehouse, database, schema, and role that should be used.

You can find this information in Snowsight or by executing SQL commands:

* Using Snowsight to get connection settings
* Using SQL commands to get connection settings

## Using Snowsight to get connection settings

To get the settings that you can use to configure a client, driver, library, or third-party application:

1. [Sign in](ui-snowsight-gs.md) to Snowsight.
2. Open the user menu by selecting your user name.
3. From the user menu, select Connect a tool to Snowflake to display the Account Details dialog.

   > **Tip:**
   >
   > You can also display the account details from the [account selector](ui-snowsight-gs.md).
4. Select one of the following tabs:

   * If your client, driver, library, or third-party application supports using a TOML configuration file (for example,
     [Snowflake CLI](../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/connecting/configure-cli.md),
     [Snowflake Python APIs](../developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-connecting-snowflake.md), or the
     [Snowflake Connector for Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect.md):

     1. Select the Config file tab.
     2. To specify a warehouse in the configuration file, select the warehouse from the Warehouse menu.
     3. To specify a database and schema in the configuration file, use the Database menu to select the database
        and schema.
     4. From the Connection Method menu, select the method that you plan to use to authenticate:

        * To use [browser-based single sign-on (SSO)](admin-security-fed-auth-use.md), select Web Browser.
        * To use a password, select Password.
        > **Note:**
        >
        > Clients, drivers, libraries, and third-party applications support additional authentication methods not listed in
        > the menu. For information, see [Securing Snowflake](../guides-overview-secure.md).
     5. Select the copy icon () to copy the content for the configuration file.
     > **Note:**
     >
     > For the [Snowflake Python APIs](../developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-connecting-snowflake.md), underscores are not supported in the
     > `account` setting. If the account identifer includes underscores, replace them with dashes.
   * If your client, driver, library, or third-party application supports specifying a connection string (for example,
     the [ODBC Driver](../developer-guide/odbc/odbc-parameters.md), [JDBC Driver](../developer-guide/jdbc/jdbc-configure.md),
     [Go Snowflake Driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Connection_String), or
     [.NET Driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/blob/master/doc/Connecting.md)):

     1. Select the Connectors/Drivers tab.
     2. From the Select Connector or Driver menu, select the driver that you want to use.
     3. To specify a warehouse in the connection string, select the warehouse from the Warehouse menu. (Note that this menu
        is not present for ODBC and .NET.)
     4. To specify a database and schema in the connection string, use the Database menu to select the database
        and schema.
     5. From the Connection Method menu, select the method that you plan to use to authenticate:

        * To use [browser-based single sign-on (SSO)](admin-security-fed-auth-use.md), select Web Browser.
        * To use a password, select Password.
        > **Note:**
        >
        > Clients, drivers, libraries, and third-party applications support additional authentication methods not listed in
        > the menu. For information, see [Securing Snowflake](../guides-overview-secure.md).
     6. Select the copy icon () to copy the resulting connection string.
   * To execute SQL commands to get the configuration information:

     1. Select the SQL Commands tab.
     2. Select the copy icon () next to the command that provides the information that you need, paste the
        command into a worksheet, and execute the command.

## Using SQL commands to get connection settings

You can execute SQL commands to get the following information needed to configure your client, driver, library, or application:

| Setting | SQL command |
| --- | --- |
| Account identifier for the current account | * To get the `organization_name-account_name` form of your account identifier:  ```sqlexample   SELECT CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME() || '-' || CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME();   ``` * To get the [account locator](admin-account-identifier.md) form of your account identifier: ```sqlexample   SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT();   ``` |
| Current user name | ```sqlexample SELECT CURRENT_USER();``` |
| Current role | ```sqlexample SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();``` |
| Current region | ```sqlexample SELECT CURRENT_REGION();``` |
| Current warehouse | ```sqlexample SELECT CURRENT_WAREHOUSE();``` |
| Current database | ```sqlexample SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE();``` |
| Current schema | ```sqlexample SELECT CURRENT_SCHEMA();``` |

## Account formats used by clients and drivers

For different clients and drivers, you use different syntaxes for specifying your account.

In general, you should use the variation that includes the organization name (`orgname`) and account name
(`account_name`).

One exception to this rule is when you’re using the [Client Redirect](client-redirect.md) feature. If you’re
using this feature, replace the name of the account (`account_name`) with the name of the connection
(`connection_name`). For examples of this syntax, see [Using a connection URL](client-redirect.md).

To configure a private connection to the Snowflake service, add `.privatelink` to either the account name or the account
locator syntax. To determine which value you should use to connect to Snowflake when using private connectivity, call the
[SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG](../sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_config.md) function in your Snowflake account.

If you need to use the account locator, you might also need to specify the cloud region ID, the cloud, and the level of government
compliance as additional segments after the account locator. For the format to use, see [Format 2: Account locator in a region](admin-account-identifier.md). In the
examples below, `account_locator_with_additional_segments` represents the account location with any additional segments
that are required.

Snowflake CLI:
:   *Account name: `snow sql --account orgname-account_name`
    * Account locator: `snow sql --account account_locator_with_additional_segments`

    You can also specify this information in the `account` parameter for the connection in the Snowflake CLI `config.toml` configuration file.
