# NOTIFICATION_HISTORY

This table function can be used to query the history of notifications sent through Snowflake. These notifications include:

* [Notifications about errors in tasks](../../user-guide/tasks-errors.md).
* [Notifications about errors in Snowpipe](../../user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-errors.md).
* [Notifications sent by calling SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL or SYSTEM$SEND_SNOWFLAKE_NOTIFICATION](../../user-guide/notifications/about-notifications.md).

The rows returned represent:

* Requests that are being processed.
* Failed attempts at sending notifications.
* Notifications that were sent successfully.

The STATUS column indicates what each row represents. See
Examples of output from the function.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
NOTIFICATION_HISTORY(
  [ START_TIME => <constant_expr> ]
  [, END_TIME => <constant_expr> ]
  [, INTEGRATION_NAME => '<string>' ]
  [, RESULT_LIMIT => <integer> ] )
```

## Arguments

All the arguments are optional.

`START_TIME=> constant_expr` , . `END_TIME=> constant_expr`
:   Time range (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format) when the notification is sent out.

    * If START_TIME is not specified, the range starts 24 hours prior to the END_TIME.
    * If END_TIME is not specified, the default is [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP](current_timestamp.md).

    The maximum time range is 14 days.

`INTEGRATION_NAME => 'string'`
:   The fully qualified name of the integration that is tied with the notification. If you omit this argument, the function returns
    all notifications.

    Default: An empty string.

`RESULT_LIMIT => integer`
:   A number specifying the maximum number of rows returned by the function.

    Range: `1` to `10000`

    Default: `100`

## Output

The function returns the following columns:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CREATED | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Timestamp when the notification was created. |
| PROCESSED | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Timestamp of the last attempt to send the notification. |
| MESSAGE_SOURCE | VARCHAR | Type of object or feature that generated the notification. Valid values include:   *`BUDGET` (for [notifications from budgets](../../user-guide/budgets.md))* `TASK` (for [notifications from tasks](../../user-guide/tasks-errors.md)) *`SNOWPIPE` (for [notifications from Snowpipe](../../user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-errors.md))* `STORED_PROCEDURE` (for email notifications sent by   [calling the SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL or SYSTEM$SEND_SNOWFLAKE_NOTIFICATION stored procedure](../../user-guide/notifications/about-notifications.md)) |
| INTEGRATION_NAME | VARCHAR | Name of the [integration used for this notification](../sql/create-notification-integration.md). |
| STATUS | VARCHAR | Status of the notification. Valid values are:   *`QUEUED`: The request to send the notification is being processed.* `SUCCESS`: The notification was sent successfully. *`RETRIABLE_FAILURE`: The attempt to send the notification failed, and the system will attempt to send the   notification again.* `FAILURE`: Multiple attempts to send the notification failed, and there will be no more attempts to send the   notification. |
| ERROR_MESSAGE | VARCHAR | If the notification failed, provides details about why the notification failed.  **Note:** For webhook notifications, this column contains the body of the HTTP response, which might contain sensitive data. Before using this data, make sure to sanitize it. |
| ID | VARCHAR | Unique ID of a request to send a notification.  If Snowflake fails to send a notification and attempts to send the notification again, the function returns a row for each attempt. Each row for an attempt has the same value in the ID column but a different value in the ATTEMPT column. |
| ATTEMPT | INTEGER | Number of the attempt made to send the notification. |
| MESSAGE_SOURCE_INFO | OBJECT | Object containing information about the source of the notification. The fields in this object depend on the type of the source.   *For notifications for budgets, the object contains the following fields:    + `budget_id`: Identifier for the budget.   + `budget_name`: The name of the budget.* For error notifications for tasks, the object contains the following fields:    + `name`: The name of the task   + `graph_run_group_id`: Identifier for the graph run.   + `attempt_number`: Integer representing the number of the attempt to run this task. *For error notifications for Snowpipe, the object contains the `pipe_name` field, which specifies the name of the pipe.* For notifications sent by calling the SYSTEM$SEND_SNOWFLAKE_NOTIFICATION or SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL stored procedure, the   object contains the `query_id` field, which specifies the ID of the statement that called the stored procedure. |

## Usage notes

* Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role, the integration owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the
  integration) or a role with the USAGE privilege on the integration.
* When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the
  function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).

## Examples

The following sections contain examples of calling the function and examples of output from the function:

* Examples of calling the function
* Examples of output from the function

### Examples of calling the function

The following examples demonstrate how to call this function:

* Retrieving the most recent notifications
* Retrieving notifications by time and integration name

#### Retrieving the most recent notifications

Retrieve the most recent notifications that were created in the past 24 hours.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.NOTIFICATION_HISTORY());
```

#### Retrieving notifications by time and integration name

Retrieve the most recent notifications that were created in the past hour and sent using the integration named `my_integration`.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.NOTIFICATION_HISTORY(
  START_TIME=>DATEADD('hour',-1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()),
  END_TIME=>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
  RESULT_LIMIT=>100,
  INTEGRATION_NAME=>'my_integration'));
```

### Examples of output from the function

The following examples explain the output returned by this function for notification requests in different states:

* Example of the output when two attempts fail and a third attempt is in progress
* Example of the output when two attempts fail and a third attempt succeeds

#### Example of the output when two attempts fail and a third attempt is in progress

This example selects a subset of the columns in the output:

```sqlexample
SELECT id, attempt, created, processed, status
  FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.NOTIFICATION_HISTORY());
```

The output includes the rows that represent the attempts to send one notification. In the output:

* The ID column identifies the notification that is being sent.
* The first two attempts to send the notification have failed, but the system can attempt to send the notification again (as
  indicated by the value `RETRIABLE_FAILURE` in the STATUS column).
* A third attempt is being processed, as indicated by the value `QUEUED` in the STATUS column.
