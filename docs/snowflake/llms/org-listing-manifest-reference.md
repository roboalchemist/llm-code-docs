# Organization listing manifest reference

As a provider, you can use organizational listings to share data products securely within your organization.
A manifest, written in YAML (<https://yaml.org/spec/>) is required to create organization listings programmatically.
Use the information provided here to learn about the manifest format and its individual fields.

Organization listing fields are part of the larger [Listing manifest reference](../../../../progaccess/listing-manifest-reference.md).
To add or modify organizational listing fields programatically locate and modify the listing manifest using
[DESCRIBE LISTING](../../../../sql-reference/sql/desc-listing.md) and [ALTER LISTING](../../../../sql-reference/sql/alter-listing.md) commands.

## Organization listing manifest

> **Note:**
>
> Organizational listing fields can be one of the following:
>
> * Optional - Optional for organizational listings.
> * Required - Required for organizational listings.

The general format of a organization listing manifest is:

### `organization_targets`

The **required** `organization_targets` field defines who can discover and access the listing.

Contains the `discovery` and `access` fields, one of which must be specified.

`discovery`
:   **Required** when `access` isn’t specified, but otherwise **optional**.
    Defines who can discover the listing. When not present no accounts can discover the listing.

`access`

    Defines who can access the listing.

Both `discovery` and `access`, contain the same child fields.

Either:

Or an array of accounts, followed by the optional `roles` array within the specified accounts.
:   `- account: "<account_name>"`

When `roles` is present, it specifies a list of roles within the account that can access or discover the listing. For example:

> …
> `roles: [ 'role1','role2']`
> …

### `organization_target` examples

The following examples show various combinations of the `discovery` and `access` fields.

#### All internal accounts in the organization can discover and access the listing

```yaml
. . .
organization_targets:
   discovery:
   - all_internal_accounts : true
   access:
   - all_internal_accounts : true
. . .
```

#### Discoverable but only accessible by limited accounts

organization_targets:
   discovery:
   - all_internal_accounts : true
   access:
   - account: 'finance'
. . .
```

#### Discoverable but accessible by only select accounts

All internal accounts within the organization can discover the listing, but only accounts in the `finance` or `credit` account can access the listing.

```yaml
. . .
organization_targets:
   discovery:
   - all_internal_accounts : true
   access:
   - account: 'finance'
   - account: 'credit'
. . .
```

#### Discoverable but only accessible by limited accounts and specific roles

All internal accounts within the organization can discover the listing,
but only accounts in the `finance` account which have the `accounting` or `debit` role can access the listing.

```yaml
. . .
organization_targets:
    discovery:
    - all_internal_accounts : true
    access:
    - account: 'finance'

      roles: [ 'accounting','debit']
. . .
```

. . .
```

### `approver_contact`

The email address for the listing approver.

**Required** when the `discovery` field is specified.

> ```yaml
> . . .
>   approver_contact: "approver@exampledomain.com"
> . . .
> ```

### `request_approval_type`

Define whether approval requests and approvals will happen inside or outside of Snowflake. Specify one of the following values:

* `NULL`
* `REQUEST_AND_APPROVE_IN_SNOWFLAKE` indicates access requests are submitted and approved within the Snowflake environment.
* `REQUEST_AND_APPROVE_OUTSIDE_SNOWFLAKE` indicates the provider manages access request submissions and approvals independently.

The value for external listings is always `NULL`.

> ```yaml
> . . .
>   request_approval_type: "REQUEST_AND_APPROVE_IN_SNOWFLAKE"
> . . .
> ```

### `locations`

Specifies the **optional** `locations` which can discover or access the listing.

The `access_regions` field is **required** when `locations` is specified and it must include one of the following sub-fields:

* `ALL` - All regions can discover or access the listing.
* An array of regions names prefixed with `PUBLIC` which can discover or access the listing.
  For example `access_regions: - name: PUBLIC.AWS_US_WEST_2`.

  ```yaml
  . . .
  locations:
    access_regions:
    - name: "<names | ALL>"
  . . .
  ```

For a complete list of regions, see [SHOW REGIONS](../../../../sql-reference/sql/show-regions.md).

## `auto_fulfillment`

Cross-Cloud Auto-fulfillment allows the data product associated with a listing
to be automatically fulfilled to other Snowflake regions.
The `auto_fulfillment` field defines how that auto-fulfillment takes place.

For more information on Cross-Cloud Auto-fulfillment, see [Auto-fulfillment for listings](../../../../collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment.md).

Auto-fulfillment is only required if you’re sharing data to multiple regions.
Do not enable it if you are sharing to accounts in the same region.

If you share data across multiple regions, the `auto_fulfillment` is:

* Required if your data product is an application package.
* Required if your data product is shared through a private listing.
* Recommended if your data product is shared through a public listing.

Contains the following name value pairs:

* `auto_fulfillment.refresh_schedule`

  * `<num> MINUTE` - Number of minutes. Minimum 10 minutes, maximum 8 days, or 11520 minutes.

    If `refresh_type` is specified as `SUB_DATABASE_WITH_REFERENCE_USAGE`, do not include this setting.
    The refresh schedule for application packages must be defined at the account level and cannot specified at the listing level.

    For more information see [Set the account-level refresh interval](../../../../collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-set-refresh-interval.md).
* `USING CRON <expression>` - Defines the data product auto-fulfillment refresh schedule.

  > The syntax for `USING CRON` and `REPLICATION SCHEDULE` are the same. See [Parameters](../../../../sql-reference/sql/create-replication-group.md).
* `auto_fulfillment.refresh_type` (required when using `auto_fulfillment`): Must be one of -

  * `SUB_DATABASE` - database replication (object level) - recommended.
  * `SUB_DATABASE_WITH_REFERENCE_USAGE` - application package.
  * `FULL_DATABASE` - database replication (for the entire database). (Deprecated.)
* `auto_fulfillment.refresh_schedule_override` (optional): Overrides the defined update refresh frequency for all listings that use the same database. When this value is `FALSE`, listing updates fail when multiple listings sharing the same database have different refresh frequencies.

  * `TRUE` - enables the refresh frequency override.
  * `FALSE` - (default) disables the refresh frequency override.

See also [Auto-fulfillment for listings](../../../../collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment.md).

### `auto_fulfillment.refresh_schedule` examples

The following example refreshes the data product associated with a listing every 10 minutes:

```yaml
. . .
listing_terms: . . .
. . .
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_schedule: 10 MINUTE
  refresh_type: SUB_DATABASE
. . .
```

The following example refreshes the data product associated with a listing on specific days and times in specific regions:

```yaml
. . .
listing_terms: . . .
. . .
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_schedule: USING CRON  0 17 * * MON-FRI Europe/London
  refresh_type: SUB_DATABASE
. . .
```

The following example enables the refresh frequency override for listings that share the same database but have different refresh frequencies:

```yaml
. . .
listing_terms: . . .
. . .
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_schedule: 10 MINUTE
  refresh_type: SUB_DATABASE
  refresh_schedule_override: TRUE
. . .
```

### Snowflake Native App `auto_fulfillment` example

`SUB_DATABASE_WITH_REFERENCE_USAGE` can only be used with application packages
and cannot be combined with `auto_fulfillment.refresh_schedule`.

```yaml
. . .
listing_terms: . . .
. . .
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_type: SUB_DATABASE_WITH_REFERENCE_USAGE
. . .
```

### Object level `auto_fulfillment` example

```yaml
. . .
listing_terms: . . .
. . .
auto_fulfillment:
  refresh_type: SUB_DATABASE
. . .
```
