# Introduction to OAuth

Snowflake enables OAuth for clients through integrations. An integration is a Snowflake object that provides an interface between Snowflake
and third-party services. Administrators configure OAuth using a
[Security integration](../sql-reference/sql/create-security-integration.md), which enables clients that support OAuth to redirect
users to an authorization page and generate access tokens (and optionally, refresh tokens) for accessing Snowflake.

Snowflake supports the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol for authentication and authorization using one of the options
below:

* [Snowflake OAuth](oauth-snowflake-overview.md)
* [External OAuth](oauth-ext-overview.md)

The following table compares Snowflake OAuth and External OAuth:

| Category | Snowflake OAuth | External OAuth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modify client application | Required | Required |
| Client application browser access | Required | Not required |
| Programmatic clients | Requires a browser | Best fit |
| Driver property | `authenticator = oauth` | `authenticator = oauth` |
| Security integration syntax | `create security integration type = oauth ...` | `create security integration type = external_oauth` |
| OAuth flow | OAuth 2.0 code grant flow | Any OAuth flow that the client can initiate with the External OAuth server |

## Auditing OAuth logins

To query login attempts by Snowflake users, Snowflake provides a login history:

* [LOGIN_HISTORY , LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER](../sql-reference/functions/login_history.md) (table function)
* [LOGIN_HISTORY view](../sql-reference/account-usage/login_history.md) (view)

When OAuth is used to authenticate (successfully or unsuccessfully), the FIRST_AUTHENTICATION_FACTOR column in the output has the value
OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN.

## Private connectivity

Snowflake supports External OAuth with private connectivity to the Snowflake service.

Snowflake OAuth and Tableau can be used with private connectivity to Snowflake as follows:

> Tableau Desktop:
> :   Starting with Tableau 2020.4, Tableau contains an embedded OAuth client that supports connecting to Snowflake with the account URL
> for private connectivity to the Snowflake service.
>
>     After upgrading to Tableau 2020.4, no further configuration is needed; use the corresponding private connectivity URL for either AWS
>     or Azure to connect to Snowflake.
>
> Tableau Cloud:
> :   Starting with Tableau 2020.4, users can optionally configure Tableau Cloud to use the embedded OAuth Client to connect to Snowflake
> with the account URL for private connectivity to the Snowflake service.
>
>     To use this feature, create a new [Custom Client](oauth-custom.md) security integration and follow the
>     [Tableau instructions](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/config_oauth_snowflake.htm).
>
> > **Important:**
> >
> > To determine the account URL to use with private connectivity to the Snowflake service, call the
> > [SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG](../sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_config.md) function.
>
> Looker:
> :   Currently, combining Snowflake OAuth and Looker requires access to the public Internet. Therefore, you cannot use Snowflake OAuth and
> Looker with private connectivity to the Snowflake service.

## Clients, drivers, and connectors

Supported clients, drivers, and connectors can use OAuth to verify user login credentials.

Note the following:

* It is necessary to set the `authenticator` parameter to `oauth` and the `token` parameter to the
  `oauth_access_token`.
* When passing the `token` value as a URL query parameter, it is necessary to URL-encode the `oauth_access_token` value.
* When passing the `token` value to a Properties object (e.g. JDBC Driver), no modifications are necessary.

For more information about connection parameters, refer to the reference
documentation for the following clients, drivers, or connectors:

* [Snowflake CLI](../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/connecting/configure-connections.md)
* [SnowSQL](snowsql-start.md)
* [Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect.md)
* [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Connection_Parameters)
* [JDBC](../developer-guide/jdbc/jdbc-configure.md)
* [ODBC](../developer-guide/odbc/odbc-parameters.md)
* [Spark Connector](spark-connector-use.md)
* [.NET Driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/blob/master/README.md#create-a-connection)
* [Node.js Driver](../developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver-authenticate.md)

## Client Redirect

Snowflake supports using Client Redirect with Snowflake OAuth and External OAuth, including using Client Redirect and OAuth with supported
Snowflake Clients.

For more information, refer to [Redirecting client connections](client-redirect.md).

## Replication

Snowflake supports replication and failover/failback with both the Snowflake OAuth and External OAuth security integrations from the source
account to the target account.

For details, refer to [Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts](account-replication-security-integrations.md).
