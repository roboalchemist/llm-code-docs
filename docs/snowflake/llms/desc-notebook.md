# DESCRIBE NOTEBOOK

Describes the properties of a [notebook](../../user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks.md).

DESCRIBE can be abbreviated to DESC.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
{ DESC | DESCRIBE } NOTEBOOK <name>
```

## Parameters

`name`
:   Specifies the identifier for the notebook to describe.

    If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed in double quotes.
    Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.

    For more information, see [Identifier requirements](../identifiers-syntax.md).

## Output

The output of the command includes the following columns, which describe the properties and metadata of the object:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `created_on` | Date and time when the notebook was created. |

## Access control requirements

A [role](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md) used to execute this operation must have the following
[privileges](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md) at a minimum:

| Privilege | Object | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USAGE or OWNERSHIP | Notebook | OWNERSHIP is a special privilege on an object that is automatically granted to the role that created the object. Notebook ownerships cannot be transferred. |

## Usage notes

* To post-process the output of this command, you can use the [pipe operator](../operators-flow.md)
  (`->>`) or the [RESULT_SCAN](../functions/result_scan.md) function. Both constructs treat the output as a
  result set that you can query.

  For example, you can use the pipe operator or RESULT_SCAN function to select specific columns from the SHOW
  command output or filter the rows.

  When you refer to the output columns, use [double-quoted identifiers](../identifiers-syntax.md) for
  the column names. For example, to select the output column `type`, specify `SELECT "type"`.

  You must use double-quoted identifiers because the output column names for SHOW commands are in lowercase.
  The double quotes ensure that the column names in the SELECT list or WHERE clause match the column names
  in the SHOW command output that was scanned.

## Examples

The following example describes the notebook named `mybook`:

```sqlexample
DESCRIBE NOTEBOOK mybook;
```
