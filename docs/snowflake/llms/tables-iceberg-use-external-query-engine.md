# Use an external query engine with Apache Iceberg™ tables

Snowflake offers the following two options for using an external query engine to query Apache Iceberg™ tables:

* External query engines through Snowflake Horizon Catalog
* Microsoft Fabric

## External query engines through Snowflake Horizon Catalog

You can query Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg™ tables by using any
external query engine that supports the open Iceberg REST protocol, such as Apache Spark™. To ensure this interoperability with
external engines, [Apache Polaris™ (incubating)](https://github.com/apache/polaris) is integrated into Horizon Catalog. You can query
these tables in a Snowflake account by using a single Horizon Catalog endpoint and you can use your existing users, roles, policies,
and authentication in Snowflake.

For more information, see [Query Apache Iceberg™ tables with an external engine through Snowflake Horizon Catalog](tables-iceberg-query-using-external-query-engine-snowflake-horizon.md).

## Microsoft Fabric

To view Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables in [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/), you can connect a standard Snowflake
database to Fabric, which syncs the database with Fabric. You can then view any Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables in the database in Fabric.

For more information, see [Query Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg™ tables by using Microsoft Fabric](tables-iceberg-query-using-microsoft-fabric.md).
