# Security definitions injection

You can inject the Security Definitions widget anywhere in your API description file's `info.description`:


```markdown
...
## Authorization

Some description

<!-- Redoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->
...
```

The inject instruction is wrapped in an HTML comment, so it is **visible only in Redoc CE** and not visible, for instance, in the SwaggerUI.

## Default behavior

If the injection tag is not found in the description, it is appended to the end of description under the `Authentication` header.

If the `Authentication` header is already present in the description, Security Definitions are not inserted or rendered.
