Transforms control where a video block sits in the composition and how its content is framed. In CE.SDK, there are two families of transforms:

- **Block-level transforms** change the block container (position, rotation, size, flip).
- **Content-level transforms** (the `crop*` family) control how the video fills that container (pan, zoom, and content rotation).

This overview explains the mental model and points you to focused sub‑guides for implementation details.

## What you’ll learn

- The difference between **block** and **content (crop)** transforms.
- Coordinate systems, anchor points, and units used in transforms.
- Essential APIs & UI toggles for transform workflows.
- How to restrict or lock transformations in templates.
- Troubleshooting common issues.

## Understanding Transform Layers

Each block in a scene has a transform that determines within the page:

- The block’s position
- Its rotation
- Its scale

Changing these values moves or rotates the block **relative to its parent**.

When the block has a **video fill**, a second, content-level transform applies to the media *inside* the block. Use it to crop, pan, and zoom without changing the block’s geometry.

In CE.SDK, all properties and methods beginning with `crop` belong to the **content-level transform**, such as:

- `setCropScaleX`, `setCropScaleY`
- `setCropRotation`
- `setCropTranslationX`, `setCropTranslationY`

These control how the video fills the block’s frame rather than altering the block’s geometry itself.

Use `crop` methods for these actions within a clip:

- Reframing
- Punch-in

Use **block transforms** to apply actions within a scene:

- Moving
- Rotating

![Block vs Content Transforms](assets/transform-overview-rotate.png)

The preceding diagram compares block-level and content-level transforms:

- The **left** frame shows a block rotated.
- The **right** frame shows crop rotation of the video within its block frame.

## Coordinate Systems and Units

- **Position:** absolute or percentage modes.
- **Rotation:** radians (positive = counterclockwise).
- **Scale:** uniform; optional anchor in normalized 0–1 space (0=left/top, 0.5=center, 1=right/bottom).
- **Crop translation/scale:** normalized so pan/zoom behave consistently across resolutions.
- **UI vs API spaces:** gizmo movements operate in canvas/screen space, while API values are normalized or scene‑space; always verify the mode before mixing.

## Built-in Transform UI

The editor provides optional gizmos and gestures for direct manipulation:

- Handles: `controlGizmo/showRotateHandles`, `/showResizeHandles`, `/showMoveHandles`, `/showScaleHandles`, `/showCropHandles`.
- Gestures: `touch/rotateAction`, `touch/pinchAction`.
- Limits: `controlGizmo/blockScaleDownLimit` prevents accidental shrinking to zero size.

These can be read or set using:

```swift
try engine.editor.setSettingBool(key: "controlGizmo/showRotateHandles", value: true)
try engine.editor.setSettingFloat(key: "controlGizmo/blockScaleDownLimit", value: 0.4)
```

**Defaults:** If not configured, the editor exposes a safe, minimal set of handles; crop handles only appear when the selected block is croppable.

## Transform API Map (Quick Reference)

| Action | Methods |
|--------|----------|
| Move | `setPositionX`, `setPositionY`, `setPositionXMode`, `setPositionYmode` |
| Rotate | `setRotation` |
| Flip | `setFlipHorizontal`, `setFlipVertical` |
| Scale | `scale` |
| Resize | `setWidth`, `setHeight`, `setWidthMode`, `setHeightMode` |
| Crop | `setCropRotation`, `setCropScaleRatio`, `setCropTranslationX/Y`, `adjustCropToFillFrame`, `resetCrop` |

See the dedicated sub‑guides for full examples and edge cases.

## Animated Transforms

All transform properties in CE.SDK can be animated over time in video scenes. You can keyframe changes to create:

- Movement

- Zooms

- Transitions

- Keyframes live on the **timeline** associated with each block.

- Interpolation curves (easing) control how values change between keys.

- Programmatic animation uses standard transform methods but attached to timeline events.

- **Crop UI gating:** Crop handles appear only when a selected block is croppable (e.g., a `.video` fill).

- **Performance:** Transforms are GPU‑accelerated at playback; avoid heavy, stacked effects ahead of transform‑driven motion.

The [Animation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/mac-catalyst/animation-ce900c/) guide shows how to add keyframes, adjust easing, and preview animations.

***

## Permissions and Locking

You can restrict or disable transforms in templates to prevent accidental edits:

```swift
try engine.block.setScopeEnabled(blockID, key: "layer/rotate", enabled: false)
try engine.block.setTransformLocked(blockID, locked: true)
```

These controls affect both UI gestures and API calls.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause |
|--------|----------------|
| Rotation appears wrong | Check radians vs degrees |
| Block not responding | Transform locked or scope disabled |
| Crop handles missing | Ensure block fill is croppable (e.g., `.video`) |
| Unexpected scaling | Verify anchor and percentage mode |
| Transforming group has no effect | Ensure blocks are grouped correctly |
