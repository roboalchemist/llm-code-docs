Rotation is a common transform you apply to images to:

- straighten horizons
- add dynamic tilt
- correct orientation issues

Learn how to programmatically and interactively rotate images in your app using CE.SDK. Rotation applies at the block level, rotating the entire graphic on the canvas. This differs from [crop rotation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/edit-image/transform/crop-f67a47/), which rotates the content inside the block frame. This guide focuses on block rotation and shows how to wire interactive controls into your SwiftUI app.

## What you'll learn

- How to rotate an image as a user using the handles
- Rotate an image block by a specific angle
- How to lock image rotation
- How to rotate multiple images as a group

## When You’ll Use It

Use rotation when:

- Straightening an image or aligning it with other design elements.
- Adding expressive tilt to photos or stickers.
- Correcting imported images that appear sideways.
- Building custom editing experiences where users can freely or incrementally rotate media.

## Understanding Rotation in CE.SDK

Rotation’s center is the block’s center point, and its definition is in radians.

### Block Rotation vs Crop Rotation

- Block rotation moves the whole block on the canvas.
- Crop rotation turns the content inside the crop region and is part of the crop API.

Usage depends on your goal:

- To **tilt the image visually** on the canvas, use block rotation.
- To **rotate the content** inside a zoomed or constrained frame, use crop rotation.

See the Crop guide: [Crop](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/edit-image/transform/crop-f67a47/).

### Content Fill Mode

Rotation can change how your content fits inside its frame: for example, a rotated image using `.contain` may reveal empty areas that `.cover` would fill. You rarely need to update fill mode for rotation, but know that rotated images sometimes behave differently.

## Rotate an Image Using the UI

By default selecting a block will show handles for resizing and rotating. You can freeform rotate a block by dragging the rotation handle.

## Rotate an Image Using Code

You can rotate an image block using the `setRotation` function. It takes the `id` of the block and a rotation amount in radians.

```swift
try engine.block.setRotation(star, radians: .pi / 4)
```

If you need to convert between radians and degrees, multiply the number in degrees by pi and divide by 180.

```swift
let angleInRadians: Double = angleInDegrees * Double.pi / 180

let angleInDegrees: Double = angleInRadians * 180 / Double.pi
```

You can discover the current rotation of a block using the `getRotation` function.

```swift
let rotationOfStar = try engine.block.getRotation(starID)
```

Reset the rotation at any time by setting the `radians` to `0`.

```swift
try engine.block.setRotation(blockID, radians: 0)
```

You can rotate a block incrementally by reading it’s current value and then adjusting it and setting the new value.

```swift
let delta = 0.26
let currentRotation = try engine.block.getRotation(imageID)
try engine.block.setRotation(imageID, radians: currentRotation + delta)
```

## Lock Rotation

You can remove the rotation handle from the UI by changing the setting for the engine. This will affect *all* blocks.

```swift
try engine.editor.setSettingBool("controlGizmo/showRotateHandles", value: false)
```

Though the handle is gone, the user can still use the two finger rotation gesture on a touch device. You can disable that gesture with the following setting.

```swift
try engine.editor.setSettingBool("touch/rotateAction", value: false)
```

When you want to lock only certain blocks, you can toggle the transform lock property. This will apply to all transformations for the block.

```swift
try engine.block.setTransformLocked(star, locked: true)
```

To lock just the rotation transform for a block, set its rotation scope to `false`.

```swift
try engine.editor.setScopeEnabled(imageID, key: "layer/rotate", enabled: false)
```

Refer to the template constraints guide for more detailed examples.

## Rotate a Group of Images

To rotate multiple elements together, first add them to a `group` and then rotate the group.

```swift
let groupId = try engine.block.group([star, textBlock])
engine.block.setRotation(groupId, radians: pi / 2)
```

## Update UI During User Interaction (Advanced)

Users can tap an image to select it and rotate it with the gizmo handle or a gesture. To keep any UI in sync with these updates, you’ll need to subscribe to block update events using the CE.SDK’s `event` api.

```swift
//Event subscription
func watchForUpdates() {
  guard let engine, let imageID else { return }

  Task {
    for await events in engine.event.subscribe(to: [imageID]) {
      // Look for updates to this specific block
      guard events.contains(where: { $0.type == .updated && $0.block == imageID }) else {
        continue
      }

      // Read the updated rotation value from the engine and update the
      //view's rotation variable
      //this will fire on _all_ updates, not just rotation
      if let newValue = try? engine.block.getRotation(imageID) {
        rotation = newValue
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The preceding code subscribes to updates from a single block. Whenever that block updates, it reads the block’s rotation value and updates a `rotation` variable. You would call a function like this one at the end of your setup code for the `View`.

## Troubleshooting

|Symptom|Likely Cause|Solution|
|----|----|----|
|Rotation does nothing|Block has rotation scope disabled or incorrect block ID|Enable layer/rotate or unlock transform. Check block ID value. Ensure block has been appended to the page|
| Image appears offset after rotation |Pivot point isn’t at image center|Make sure the pivot point is centered (default is center).                      |
|Rotation resets unexpectedly|Setting crop rotation instead of block rotation|Use `setRotation`, not crop APIs|
|Image shows empty areas after rotation|Content fill mode exposing background|Use .cover or adjust frame|
| Rotation handle not visible|Gizmo settings disabled| Check that interactive UI controls are enabled in the settings.                 |

Continue shaping your transform workflow with these related guides:

- [Crop](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/edit-image/transform/crop-f67a47/) lets you control the visible region of an image.
- Use [Resize](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/edit-image/transform/resize-407242/) to change a block's width and height independently.
- Use [Scale](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/edit-image/transform/scale-ebe367/) to scale a block uniformly from its center.
- [Flip](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/edit-image/transform/flip-035e9f/) mirrors content horizontally or vertically.
- Learn how to subscribe to block updates and sync UI state using [Events](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/macos/concepts/events-353f97/).
