## What is the Video Editor Solution?

The Video Editor is a prebuilt solution powered by the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) that enables fast integration of high-performance video editing into web, mobile, and desktop applications. It’s designed to help your users create professional-grade videos—from short social clips to long-form stories—directly within your app.

Skip building a video editor from scratch. This fully client-side solution provides a solid foundation with an extensible UI and a robust engine API to power video editing in any use case.

## Supported Platforms

The Flutter SDK leverages a single creative engine to ensure seamless support across iOS and Android.
This guarantees consistent features, interoperable designs, and uniform rendering across all platforms.

## Prerequisites

This version requires Flutter 3.16.0, Dart 2.12.0, iOS 16, Swift 6.2 (Xcode 26.0.1), and Android 7 as the minimum specifications.
Ensure your `pubspec.yml` file contains the required dependencies:

```
dependencies:
    flutter:
        sdk: flutter
    imgly_editor: $UBQ_VERSION$
```

## Supported Media Types

[IMG.LY](http://img.ly/)'s Creative Editor SDK enables you to load, edit, and save **MP4 files** directly on the device without server dependencies.

### Importing Media

### Exporting Media

### Importing Templates

## Understanding CE.SDK Architecture & API

The following sections provide an overview of the key components of the CE.SDK video editor UI and its API architecture.

If you're ready to start integrating CE.SDK into your Flutter application, check out our [Implementation Guide](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/flutter/prebuilt-solutions/video-editor-9e533a/).

### CreativeEditor SDK Mobile Video UI

The CE.SDK video editor UI is a specific configuration of the CreativeEditor SDK, focusing on essential video editing features.
It includes robust tools for video manipulation, customizable to suit different use cases.
Key components include:

- **Canvas:** The main workspace where users interact with their video content.
- **Timeline:** Provides control over the sequence and duration of video clips, images, and audio tracks.
- **Tool Bar:** Provides essential editing options like adjustments, filters, effectsi, layer management or adding text or images in order of relevance.
- **Context Menu:** Presents relevant editing options for each selected element, simplifying the editing process for users.

Learn more about interacting with and customizing the video editor UI in our design editor UI guide.

### CreativeEngine

At the core of CE.SDK is the CreativeEngine, which handles all rendering and video manipulation tasks.
It can be used in headless mode or alongside the CreativeEditor UI.
Key features and APIs provided by CreativeEngine include:

- **Scene Management:** Create, load, save,
  and manipulate video scenes programmatically.
- **Block Management:** Manage video clips,
  images, text, and other elements within the timeline.
- **Asset Management:** Integrate and manage
  video, audio, and image assets from various sources.
- **Variable Management:** Define and
  manipulate variables for dynamic content within video scenes.
- **Event Handling:** Subscribe to events
  like clip selection changes or timeline updates for dynamic interaction.

## Customizing the Flutter Video Editor

CE.SDK provides extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the UI and functionality to meet your specific needs.
This can range from basic configuration settings to more advanced customizations involving callbacks and custom elements.

### Basic Customizations

Configure the editor by passing a configuration object during initialization:

```dart
    final settings = EditorSettings(
        license: "YOUR_LICENSE",
        userId: "YOUR_USER_ID",
        baseURL: URL(string: "https://cdn.img.ly/packages/imgly/cesdk-engine/$UBQ_VERSION$/assets")!
    );
```

## Framework Support

CreativeEditor SDK’s video editor is compatible with Flutter, making it easy to integrate into your application.
