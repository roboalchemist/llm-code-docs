--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **ctest** executable is the CMake test driver program. CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the [`enable_testing()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/enable_testing.html#command:enable_testing "enable_testing") and [`add_test()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_test.html#command:add_test "add_test") commands have testing support. This program will run the tests and report results.

[Run Tests](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id18)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#run-tests "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--preset<preset>,--preset=<preset>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-preset "Link to this definition")
Use a test preset to specify test options. The project binary directory is inferred from the `configurePreset` key. The current working directory must contain CMake preset files. See [`preset`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#manual:cmake-presets(7) "cmake-presets(7)") for more details.

--list-presets[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-list-presets "Link to this definition")
Lists the available test presets. The current working directory must contain CMake preset files.

-C<cfg>,--build-config<cfg>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-C "Link to this definition")
Choose configuration to test.

Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build configurations in the same tree. This option can be used to specify which one should be tested. Example configurations are `Debug` and `Release`.

--progress[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-progress "Link to this definition")
Enable short progress output from tests.

When the output of **ctest** is being sent directly to a terminal, the progress through the set of tests is reported by updating the same line rather than printing start and end messages for each test on new lines. This can significantly reduce the verbosity of the test output. Test completion messages are still output on their own line for failed tests and the final test summary will also still be logged.

This option can also be enabled by setting the environment variable [`CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT.html#envvar:CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT "CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT").

-V,--verbose[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-V "Link to this definition")
Enable verbose output from tests.

Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is displayed. This option will show all test output.

-VV,--extra-verbose[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-VV "Link to this definition")
Enable more verbose output from tests.

Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is displayed. This option will show even more test output.

--debug[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-debug "Link to this definition")
Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.

This feature will result in a large number of output that is mostly useful for debugging dashboard problems.

--output-on-failure[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-output-on-failure "Link to this definition")
Output anything outputted by the test program if the test should fail. This option can also be enabled by setting the [`CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE.html#envvar:CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE "CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE") environment variable

--stop-on-failure[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-stop-on-failure "Link to this definition")
Stop running the tests when the first failure happens.

-F[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-F "Link to this definition")
Enable failover.

This option allows CTest to resume a test set execution that was previously interrupted. If no interruption occurred, the `-F` option will have no effect.

-j[<level>],--parallel[<level>][¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-j "Link to this definition")
Run tests in parallel, optionally limited to a given level of parallelism.

Added in version 3.29: The `<level>` may be omitted, or `0`, in which case:

*   Under [Job Server Integration](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#job-server-integration), parallelism is limited by available job tokens.

*   Otherwise, if the value is omitted, parallelism is limited by the number of processors, or 2, whichever is larger.

*   Otherwise, if the value is `0`, parallelism is unbounded.

This option may instead be specified by the [`CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL.html#envvar:CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL "CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL") environment variable.

This option can be used with the [`PROCESSORS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/PROCESSORS.html#prop_test:PROCESSORS "PROCESSORS") test property. See the [Label and Subproject Summary](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-and-subproject-summary).

--resource-spec-file<file>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-resource-spec-file "Link to this definition")
Run CTest with [resource allocation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-allocation) enabled, using the [resource specification file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-specification-file) specified in `<file>`.

When **ctest** is run as a [Dashboard Client](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client) this sets the `ResourceSpecFile` option of the [CTest Test Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-test-step).

--test-load<level>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-load "Link to this definition")
While running tests in parallel (e.g. with [`-j`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-j)), try not to start tests when they may cause the CPU load to pass above a given threshold.

When **ctest** is run as a [Dashboard Client](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client) this sets the `TestLoad` option of the [CTest Test Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-test-step).

-Q,--quiet[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-Q "Link to this definition")
Make CTest quiet.

This option will suppress all the output. The output log file will still be generated if the [`--output-log`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-O) is specified. Options such as [`--verbose`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-V), [`--extra-verbose`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-VV), and [`--debug`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-debug) are ignored if `--quiet` is specified.

-O<file>,--output-log<file>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-O "Link to this definition")
Output to log file.

This option tells CTest to write all its output to a `<file>` log file.

--output-junit<file>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-output-junit "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.21.

Write test results in JUnit format.

This option tells CTest to write test results to `<file>` in JUnit XML format. If `<file>` already exists, it will be overwritten. If using the [`-S`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-S) option to run a dashboard script, use the `OUTPUT_JUNIT` keyword with the [`ctest_test()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html#command:ctest_test "ctest_test") command instead.

-N,--show-only[=<format>][¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-N "Link to this definition")
Disable actual execution of tests.

This option tells CTest to list the tests that would be run but not actually run them. Useful in conjunction with the [`-R`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-R) and [`-E`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-E) options.

Added in version 3.14: The `--show-only` option accepts a `<format>` value.

`<format>` can be one of the following values.

> `human`
> Human-friendly output. This is not guaranteed to be stable. This is the default.
> 
> `json-v1`
> Dump the test information in JSON format. See [Show as JSON Object Model](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#show-as-json-object-model).

-L<regex>,--label-regex<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-L "Link to this definition")
Run tests with labels matching regular expression as described under [string(REGEX)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/string.html#regex-specification).

This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose labels match the given regular expression. When more than one `-L` option is given, a test will only be run if each regular expression matches at least one of the test's labels (i.e. the multiple `-L` labels form an `AND` relationship). See [Label Matching](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-matching).

-R<regex>,--tests-regex<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-R "Link to this definition")
Run tests matching regular expression.

This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose names match the given regular expression.

-E<regex>,--exclude-regex<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-E "Link to this definition")
Exclude tests matching regular expression.

This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose names match the given regular expression.

-LE<regex>,--label-exclude<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-LE "Link to this definition")
Exclude tests with labels matching regular expression.

This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose labels match the given regular expression. When more than one `-LE` option is given, a test will only be excluded if each regular expression matches at least one of the test's labels (i.e. the multiple `-LE` labels form an `AND` relationship). See [Label Matching](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-matching).

--tests-from-file<filename>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-tests-from-file "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.29.

Run tests listed in the given file.

This option tells CTest to run tests that are listed in the given file. The file must contain one exact test name per line. Lines that do not exactly match any test names are ignored. This option can be combined with the other options like `-R`, `-E`, `-L` or `-LE`.

--exclude-from-file<filename>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-exclude-from-file "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.29.

Exclude tests listed in the given file.

This option tells CTest to NOT run tests that are listed in the given file. The file must contain one exact test name per line. Lines that do not exactly match any test names are ignored. This option can be combined with the other options like `-R`, `-E`, `-L` or `-LE`.

-FA<regex>,--fixture-exclude-any<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-FA "Link to this definition")
Exclude fixtures matching `<regex>` from automatically adding any tests to the test set.

If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture, that fixture's setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test set automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for fixtures matching the `<regex>`. Note that all other fixture behavior is retained, including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture setup tests that fail.

-FS<regex>,--fixture-exclude-setup<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-FS "Link to this definition")
Same as [`-FA`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-FA) except only matching setup tests are excluded.

-FC<regex>,--fixture-exclude-cleanup<regex>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-FC "Link to this definition")
Same as [`-FA`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-FA) except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.

-I[Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file],--tests-information[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-I "Link to this definition")
Run a specific number of tests by number.

This option causes CTest to run tests starting at number `Start`, ending at number `End`, and incrementing by `Stride`. Any additional numbers after `Stride` are considered individual test numbers. `Start`, `End`, or `Stride` can be empty. Optionally a file can be given that contains the same syntax as the command line.

-U,--union[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-U "Link to this definition")
Take the Union of [`-I`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-I) and [`-R`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-R).

When both [`-R`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-R) and [`-I`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-I) are specified by default the intersection of tests are run. By specifying `-U` the union of tests is run instead.

--rerun-failed[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-rerun-failed "Link to this definition")
Run only the tests that failed previously.

This option tells CTest to perform only the tests that failed during its previous run. When this option is specified, CTest ignores all other options intended to modify the list of tests to run ( [`-L`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-L), [`-R`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-R), [`-E`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-E), [`-LE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-LE), [`-I`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-I), etc). In the event that CTest runs and no tests fail, subsequent calls to CTest with the `--rerun-failed` option will run the set of tests that most recently failed (if any).

--repeat<mode>:<n>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-repeat "Link to this definition")
Run tests repeatedly based on the given `<mode>` up to `<n>` times. The modes are:

`until-fail`
Require each test to run `<n>` times without failing in order to pass. This is useful in finding sporadic failures in test cases.

`until-pass`
Allow each test to run up to `<n>` times in order to pass. Repeats tests if they fail for any reason. This is useful in tolerating sporadic failures in test cases.

`after-timeout`
Allow each test to run up to `<n>` times in order to pass. Repeats tests only if they timeout. This is useful in tolerating sporadic timeouts in test cases on busy machines.

--repeat-until-fail<n>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-repeat-until-fail "Link to this definition")
Equivalent to [`--repeat until-fail:<n>`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-repeat).

--max-width<width>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-max-width "Link to this definition")
Set the max width for a test name to output.

Set the maximum width for each test name to show in the output. This allows the user to widen the output to avoid clipping the test name which can be very annoying.

--interactive-debug-mode<0|1>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-interactive-debug-mode "Link to this definition")
Disable (`0`) or enable (`1`) interactive debug mode.

This option causes CTest to run tests in either an interactive mode or a non-interactive mode. In dashboard mode (`Experimental`, `Nightly`, `Continuous`), the default is non-interactive. In non-interactive mode, the environment variable [`DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST.html#envvar:DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST "DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST") is set.

Interactive Mode allows Windows Error Reporting (WER) to show debug popup windows and to create core dumps. To enable core dumps in tests, use interactive mode, and follow the Windows documentation on [Collecting User-Mode Dumps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps).

Changed in version 4.0: Windows Error Reporting (WER) is enabled in interactive mode, so test processes may show debug popup windows and create core dumps. This was made possible by updates to `libuv`.

Changed in version 3.11: Windows Error Reporting (WER) is disabled in both interactive and non-interactive modes, so test processes do not show popup windows or create core dumps. This is due to launching test processes with `libuv`.

--no-label-summary[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-no-label-summary "Link to this definition")
Disable timing summary information for labels.

This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each label associated with the tests run. If there are no labels on the tests, nothing extra is printed.

See [Label and Subproject Summary](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-and-subproject-summary).

--no-subproject-summary[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-no-subproject-summary "Link to this definition")
Disable timing summary information for subprojects.

This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each subproject associated with the tests run. If there are no subprojects on the tests, nothing extra is printed.

See [Label and Subproject Summary](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-and-subproject-summary).

--test-dir<dir>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-dir "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.20.

Specify the directory in which to look for tests, typically a CMake project build directory. If not specified, the current directory is used.

--test-output-size-passed<size>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-output-size-passed "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.4.

Limit the output for passed tests to `<size>` bytes.

--test-output-size-failed<size>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-output-size-failed "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.4.

Limit the output for failed tests to `<size>` bytes.

--test-output-truncation<mode>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-output-truncation "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.24.

Truncate `tail` (default), `middle` or `head` of test output once maximum output size is reached.

--overwrite[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-overwrite "Link to this definition")
Overwrite CTest configuration option.

By default CTest uses configuration options from configuration file. This option will overwrite the configuration option.

--force-new-ctest-process[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-force-new-ctest-process "Link to this definition")
Ignored. This option once disabled a now-removed optimization for tests running `ctest` itself.

--schedule-random[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-schedule-random "Link to this definition")
Use a random order for scheduling tests.

This option will run the tests in a random order. It is commonly used to detect implicit dependencies in a test suite.

--schedule-random-seed[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-schedule-random-seed "Link to this definition")

Added in version 4.1.

Override the random order seed

This option is used to allow recreating failures owing to random order of execution by `--schedule-random`.

--submit-index[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-submit-index "Link to this definition")
Legacy option for old Dart2 dashboard server feature. Do not use.

--timeout<seconds>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-timeout "Link to this definition")
Set the default test timeout.

This option effectively sets a timeout on all tests that do not already have a timeout set on them via the [`TIMEOUT`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/TIMEOUT.html#prop_test:TIMEOUT "TIMEOUT") property.

--stop-time<time>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-stop-time "Link to this definition")
Set a time at which all tests should stop running.

Set a real time of day at which all tests should timeout. Example: `7:00:00 -0400`. Any time format understood by the curl date parser is accepted. Local time is assumed if no timezone is specified.

--print-labels[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-print-labels "Link to this definition")
Print all available test labels.

This option will not run any tests, it will simply print the list of all labels associated with the test set.

--no-tests=<action>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-no-tests "Link to this definition")
Regard no tests found either as error (when `<action>` is set to `error`) or ignore it (when `<action>` is set to `ignore`).

If no tests were found, the default behavior of CTest is to always log an error message but to return an error code in script mode only. This option unifies the behavior of CTest by either returning an error code if no tests were found or by ignoring it.

Added in version 3.26.

This option can also be set by setting the [`CTEST_NO_TESTS_ACTION`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CTEST_NO_TESTS_ACTION.html#envvar:CTEST_NO_TESTS_ACTION "CTEST_NO_TESTS_ACTION") environment variable.

--collect-instrumentation<build>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-collect-instrumentation "Link to this definition")

Added in version 4.0.

Manually collect instrumentation data from the specified build directory. See the [Indexing](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-instrumentation.7.html#cmake-instrumentation-indexing) section of CMake instrumentation for more details.

[Label Matching](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id20)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-matching "Link to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests may have labels attached to them. Tests may be included or excluded from a test run by filtering on the labels. Each individual filter is a regular expression applied to the labels attached to a test.

When [`-L`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-L) is used, in order for a test to be included in a test run, each regular expression must match at least one label. Using more than one [`-L`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-L) option means "match **all** of these".

The [`-LE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-LE) option works just like [`-L`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-L), but excludes tests rather than including them. A test is excluded if each regular expression matches at least one label.

If a test has no labels attached to it, then [`-L`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-L) will never include that test, and [`-LE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-LE) will never exclude that test. As an example of tests with labels, consider five tests, with the following labels:

*   _test1_ has labels _tuesday_ and _production_

*   _test2_ has labels _tuesday_ and _test_

*   _test3_ has labels _wednesday_ and _production_

*   _test4_ has label _wednesday_

*   _test5_ has labels _friday_ and _test_

Running **ctest** with `-L tuesday -L test` will select _test2_, which has both labels. Running CTest with `-L test` will select _test2_ and _test5_, because both of them have a label that matches that regular expression.

Because the matching works with regular expressions, take note that running CTest with `-L es` will match all five tests. To select the _tuesday_ and _wednesday_ tests together, use a single regular expression that matches either of them, like `-L "tue|wed"`.

[Label and Subproject Summary](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id21)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-and-subproject-summary "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CTest prints timing summary information for each `LABEL` and subproject associated with the tests run. The label time summary will not include labels that are mapped to subprojects.

Added in version 3.22: Labels added dynamically during test execution are also reported in the timing summary. See [Additional Labels](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html#additional-labels).

When the [`PROCESSORS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/PROCESSORS.html#prop_test:PROCESSORS "PROCESSORS") test property is set, CTest will display a weighted test timing result in label and subproject summaries. The time is reported with `sec * proc` instead of just `sec`.

The weighted time summary reported for each label or subproject `j` is computed as:

Weighted Time Summary for Label/Subproject j =
    sum(raw_test_time[j,i] * num_processors[j,i], i=1...num_tests[j])

for labels/subprojects j=1...total

where:

*   `raw_test_time[j,i]`: Wall-clock time for the `i` test for the `j` label or subproject

*   `num_processors[j,i]`: Value of the CTest [`PROCESSORS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/PROCESSORS.html#prop_test:PROCESSORS "PROCESSORS") property for the `i` test for the `j` label or subproject

*   `num_tests[j]`: Number of tests associated with the `j` label or subproject

*   `total`: Total number of labels or subprojects that have at least one test run

Therefore, the weighted time summary for each label or subproject represents the amount of time that CTest gave to run the tests for each label or subproject and gives a good representation of the total expense of the tests for each label or subproject when compared to other labels or subprojects.

For example, if `SubprojectA` showed `100 sec*proc` and `SubprojectB` showed `10 sec*proc`, then CTest allocated approximately 10 times the CPU/core time to run the tests for `SubprojectA` than for `SubprojectB` (e.g. so if effort is going to be expended to reduce the cost of the test suite for the whole project, then reducing the cost of the test suite for `SubprojectA` would likely have a larger impact than effort to reduce the cost of the test suite for `SubprojectB`).

[Build and Test Mode](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id22)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#build-and-test-mode "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CTest provides a command-line signature to configure (i.e. run cmake on), build, and/or execute a test:

ctest --build-and-test <path-to-source> <path-to-build>
      --build-generator <generator>
      [<options>...]
      [--build-options <opts>...]
      [--test-command <command> [<args>...]]

The configure and test steps are optional. The arguments to this command line are the source and binary directories. The `--build-generator` option _must_ be provided to use `--build-and-test`. If `--test-command` is specified then that will be run after the build is complete. Other options that affect this mode include:

--build-and-test[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-build-and-test "Link to this definition")
Switch into the build and test mode.

--build-target[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-build-target "Link to this definition")
Specify a specific target to build. The option can be given multiple times with different targets, in which case each target is built in turn. A clean will be done before building each target unless the [`--build-noclean`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-build-noclean) option is given.

If no `--build-target` is specified, the `all` target is built.

--build-options[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-build-options "Link to this definition")
Additional options for configuring the build (i.e. for CMake, not for the build tool). Note that if this is specified, the `--build-options` keyword and its arguments must be the last option given on the command line, with the possible exception of `--test-command`.

--test-command[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-command "Link to this definition")
The command to run as the test step with the [`--build-and-test`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-build-and-test) option. All arguments following this keyword will be assumed to be part of the test command line, so it must be the last option given.

--test-timeout[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-test-timeout "Link to this definition")
The time limit in seconds

[Dashboard Client](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id23)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CTest can operate as a client for the [CDash](https://www.cdash.org/) software quality dashboard application. As a dashboard client, CTest performs a sequence of steps to configure, build, and test software, and then submits the results to a [CDash](https://www.cdash.org/) server. The command-line signature used to submit to [CDash](https://www.cdash.org/) is:

ctest -D <dashboard>         [-- <dashboard-options>...]
ctest -M <model> -T <action> [-- <dashboard-options>...]
ctest -S <script>            [-- <dashboard-options>...]
ctest -SP <script>           [-- <dashboard-options>...]

Options for Dashboard Client include:

-D<dashboard>,--dashboard<dashboard>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-D "Link to this definition")
Execute dashboard test.

This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client and perform a dashboard test. All tests are `<Mode><Test>`, where `<Mode>` can be `Experimental`, `Nightly`, and `Continuous`, and `<Test>` can be `Start`, `Update`, `Configure`, `Build`, `Test`, `Coverage`, and `Submit`.

If `<dashboard>` is not one of the recognized `<Mode><Test>` values, this will be treated as a variable definition instead (see the [dashboard-options](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-options) further below).

-M<model>,--test-model<model>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-M "Link to this definition")
Sets the model for a dashboard.

This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client where the `<model>` can be `Experimental`, `Nightly`, and `Continuous`. Combining `-M` and [`-T`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-T) is similar to [`-D`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-D).

-T<action>,--test-action<action>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-T "Link to this definition")
Sets the dashboard action to perform.

This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client and perform some action such as `start`, `build`, `test` etc. See [Dashboard Client Steps](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-steps) for the full list of actions. Combining [`-M`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-M) and `-T` is similar to [`-D`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-D).

-S<script>,--script<script>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-S "Link to this definition")
Execute a dashboard for a configuration.

This option tells CTest to load in a configuration script which sets a number of parameters such as the binary and source directories. Then CTest will do what is required to create and run a dashboard. This option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs [`ctest -D`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-D) with the appropriate options.

-SP<script>,--script-new-process<script>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-SP "Link to this definition")
Execute a dashboard for a configuration.

This option does the same operations as [`-S`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-S) but it will do them in a separate process. This is primarily useful in cases where the script may modify the environment and you do not want the modified environment to impact other [`-S`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-S) scripts.

The available `<dashboard-options>` are the following:

-D<var>:<type>=<value>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-3 "Link to this definition")
Define a variable for script mode.

Pass in variable values on the command line. Use in conjunction with [`-S`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-S) to pass variable values to a dashboard script. Parsing `-D` arguments as variable values is only attempted if the value following `-D` does not match any of the known dashboard types.

--group<group>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-group "Link to this definition")
Specify what group you'd like to submit results to

Submit dashboard to specified group instead of default one. By default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or Continuous group, but by specifying this option, the group can be arbitrary.

This replaces the deprecated option `--track`. Despite the name change its behavior is unchanged.

-A<file>,--add-notes<file>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-A "Link to this definition")
Add a notes file with submission.

This option tells CTest to include a notes file when submitting dashboard.

--tomorrow-tag[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-tomorrow-tag "Link to this definition")
`Nightly` or `Experimental` starts with next day tag.

This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.

--extra-submit<file>[;<file>][¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-extra-submit "Link to this definition")
Submit extra `.xml` part files to the dashboard. See the [`ctest_submit()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_submit.html#command:ctest_submit "ctest_submit") command's `PARTS ExtraFiles` option.

--http-header<header>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-http-header "Link to this definition")

Added in version 3.29.

Append HTTP header when submitting to the dashboard.

This option will cause CTest to append the specified header when submitting to the dashboard. This option may be specified more than once.

--http1.0[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-http1.0 "Link to this definition")
Submit using `HTTP 1.0`.

This option will force CTest to use `HTTP 1.0` to submit files to the dashboard, instead of `HTTP 1.1`.

--no-compress-output[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-no-compress-output "Link to this definition")
Do not compress test output when submitting.

This flag will turn off automatic compression of test output. Use this to maintain compatibility with an older version of CDash which doesn't support compressed test output.

### [Dashboard Client Steps](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id24)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-steps "Link to this heading")

CTest defines an ordered list of testing steps of which some or all may be run as a dashboard client:

`Start`
Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded by the following steps. See the [CTest Start Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-start-step) section below.

`Update`
Update the source tree from its version control repository. Record the old and new versions and the list of updated source files. See the [CTest Update Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-update-step) section below.

`Configure`
Configure the software by running a command in the build tree. Record the configuration output log. See the [CTest Configure Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-configure-step) section below.

`Build`
Build the software by running a command in the build tree. Record the build output log and detect warnings and errors. See the [CTest Build Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-build-step) section below.

`Test`
Test the software by loading a `CTestTestfile.cmake` from the build tree and executing the defined tests. Record the output and result of each test. See the [CTest Test Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-test-step) section below.

`Coverage`
Compute coverage of the source code by running a coverage analysis tool and recording its output. See the [CTest Coverage Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-coverage-step) section below.

`MemCheck`
Run the software test suite through a memory check tool. Record the test output, results, and issues reported by the tool. See the [CTest MemCheck Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-memcheck-step) section below.

`Submit`
Submit results recorded from other testing steps to the software quality dashboard server. See the [CTest Submit Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-submit-step) section below.

### [Dashboard Client Modes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id25)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-modes "Link to this heading")

CTest defines three modes of operation as a dashboard client:

`Nightly`
This mode is intended to be invoked once per day, typically at night. It enables the `Start`, `Update`, `Configure`, `Build`, `Test`, `Coverage`, and `Submit` steps by default. Selected steps run even if the `Update` step reports no changes to the source tree.

`Continuous`
This mode is intended to be invoked repeatedly throughout the day. It enables the `Start`, `Update`, `Configure`, `Build`, `Test`, `Coverage`, and `Submit` steps by default, but exits after the `Update` step if it reports no changes to the source tree.

`Experimental`
This mode is intended to be invoked by a developer to test local changes. It enables the `Start`, `Configure`, `Build`, `Test`, `Coverage`, and `Submit` steps by default.

### [Dashboard Client via CTest Command-Line](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id26)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-via-ctest-command-line "Link to this heading")

CTest can perform testing on an already-generated build tree. Run the **ctest** command with the current working directory set to the build tree and use one of these signatures:

ctest -D <mode>[<step>]
ctest -M <mode> [-T <step>]...

The `<mode>` must be one of the above [Dashboard Client Modes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-modes), and each `<step>` must be one of the above [Dashboard Client Steps](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-steps).

CTest reads the [Dashboard Client Configuration](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-configuration) settings from a file in the build tree called either `CTestConfiguration.ini` or `DartConfiguration.tcl` (the names are historical). The format of the file is:

# Lines starting in '#' are comments.
# Other non-blank lines are key-value pairs.
<setting>: <value>

where `<setting>` is the setting name and `<value>` is the setting value.

In build trees generated by CMake, this configuration file is generated by the [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module if included by the project. The module uses variables to obtain a value for each setting as documented with the settings below.

### [Dashboard Client via CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id27)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-via-ctest-script "Link to this heading")

CTest can perform testing driven by a [`cmake-language(7)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#manual:cmake-language(7) "cmake-language(7)") script that creates and maintains the source and build tree as well as performing the testing steps. Run the **ctest** command with the current working directory set outside of any build tree and use one of these signatures:

ctest -S <script>
ctest -SP <script>

The `<script>` file must call [CTest Commands](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-commands.7.html#ctest-commands) commands to run testing steps explicitly as documented below. The commands obtain [Dashboard Client Configuration](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-configuration) settings from their arguments or from variables set in the script.

[Dashboard Client Configuration](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id28)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-configuration "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Dashboard Client Steps](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dashboard-client-steps) may be configured by named settings as documented in the following sections.

### [CTest Start Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id29)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-start-step "Link to this heading")

Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded by the following steps.

In a [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script), the [`ctest_start()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_start.html#command:ctest_start "ctest_start") command runs this step. Arguments to the command may specify some of the step settings. The command first runs the command-line specified by the `CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND` variable, if set, to initialize the source directory.

Configuration settings include:

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: none, detected from source tree

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: `UPDATE_TYPE` if set, else `CTEST_UPDATE_TYPE`

`UpdateVersionOnly`
Specify that you want the version control update command to only discover the current version that is checked out, and not to update to a different version.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY.html#variable:CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY "CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY")

`UpdateVersionOverride`
Specify the current version of your source tree.

When this variable is set to a non-empty string, CTest will report the value you specified rather than using the update command to discover the current version that is checked out. Use of this variable supersedes `UpdateVersionOnly`. Like `UpdateVersionOnly`, using this variable tells CTest not to update the source tree to a different version.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_OVERRIDE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_OVERRIDE.html#variable:CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_OVERRIDE "CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_OVERRIDE")

Additional configuration settings include:

`NightlyStartTime`
In the `Nightly` dashboard mode, specify the "nightly start time". With centralized version control systems (`cvs` and `svn`), the `Update` step checks out the version of the software as of this time so that multiple clients choose a common version to test. This is not well-defined in distributed version-control systems so the setting is ignored.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME.html#variable:CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME")

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: `NIGHTLY_START_TIME` if set, else `CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME`

### [CTest Configure Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id31)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-configure-step "Link to this heading")

In a [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script), the [`ctest_configure()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_configure.html#command:ctest_configure "ctest_configure") command runs this step. Arguments to the command may specify some of the step settings.

Configuration settings include:

`ConfigureCommand`
Command-line to launch the software configuration process. It will be executed in the location specified by the `BuildDirectory` setting.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND.html#variable:CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND "CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND")

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: [`CMAKE_COMMAND`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_COMMAND.html#variable:CMAKE_COMMAND "CMAKE_COMMAND") followed by [`PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR.html#variable:PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR "PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR")

`LabelsForSubprojects`
Specify a semicolon-separated list of labels that will be treated as subprojects. This mapping will be passed on to CDash when configure, test or build results are submitted.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS.html#variable:CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS "CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS")

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: `CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS`

See [Label and Subproject Summary](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-and-subproject-summary).

### [CTest Build Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id32)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-build-step "Link to this heading")

In a [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script), the [`ctest_build()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_build.html#command:ctest_build "ctest_build") command runs this step. Arguments to the command may specify some of the step settings.

Configuration settings include:

`DefaultCTestConfigurationType`
When the build system to be launched allows build-time selection of the configuration (e.g. `Debug`, `Release`), this specifies the default configuration to be built when no [`-C`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-C) option is given to the **ctest** command. The value will be substituted into the value of `MakeCommand` to replace the literal string `${CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE}` if it appears.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE.html#variable:CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE "CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE")

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: `DEFAULT_CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`, initialized by the [`CMAKE_CONFIG_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CMAKE_CONFIG_TYPE.html#envvar:CMAKE_CONFIG_TYPE "CMAKE_CONFIG_TYPE") environment variable

`LabelsForSubprojects`
Specify a semicolon-separated list of labels that will be treated as subprojects. This mapping will be passed on to CDash when configure, test or build results are submitted.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS.html#variable:CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS "CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS")

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: `CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS`

See [Label and Subproject Summary](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#label-and-subproject-summary).

`MakeCommand`
Command-line to launch the software build process. It will be executed in the location specified by the `BuildDirectory` setting.

*   [CTest Script](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-script) variable: [`CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND.html#variable:CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND "CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND")

*   [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module variable: `MAKECOMMAND`, initialized by the [`build_command()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/build_command.html#command:build_command "build_command") command

`UseLaunchers`
For build trees generated by CMake using one of the [Makefile Generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#makefile-generators) or the [`Ninja`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Ninja.html#generator:Ninja "Ninja") generator, specify whether the `CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS` feature is enabled by the [`CTestUseLaunchers`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTestUseLaunchers.html#module:CTestUseLaunchers "CTestUseLaunchers") module (also included by the [`CTest`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CTest.html#module:CTest "CTest") module). When enabled, the generated build system wraps each invocation of the compiler, linker, or custom command line with a "launcher" that communicates with CTest via environment variables and files to report granular build warning and error information. Otherwise, CTest must "scrape" the build output log for diagnostics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in version 3.14.

When the `--show-only=json-v1` command line option is given, the test information is output in JSON format. Version 1.0 of the JSON object model is defined as follows:

`kind`
The string "ctestInfo".

`version`
A JSON object specifying the version components. Its members are:

`major`
A positive integer specifying the major version component of the JSON object model.

`minor`
A non-negative integer specifying the minor version component of the JSON object model.

`backtraceGraph`
JSON object representing backtrace information with the following members:

`commands`
List of command names.

`files`
List of file names.

`nodes`
List of node JSON objects with members:

`command`
An optional member present when the node represents a command invocation within the file. The value is an unsigned integer 0-based index into the `commands` member of the `backtraceGraph`.

`file`
An unsigned integer 0-based index into the `files` member of the `backtraceGraph`.

`line`
An optional member present when the node represents a line within the file. The value is an unsigned integer 1-based line number in the file where the backtrace was added.

`parent`
An optional member present when the node is not the bottom of the call stack. The value is an unsigned integer 0-based index into the `nodes` member of the `backtraceGraph` representing the parent in the graph.

`tests`
A JSON array listing information about each test. Each entry is a JSON object with members:

`name`
Test name. This cannot be empty.

`config`
Optional field specifying the configuration for which the test will run. This will always match the [`-C`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-C) option specified on the `ctest` command line. If no such option was given, this field will not be present.

`command`
Optional array where the first element is the test command and the remaining elements are the command arguments. Normally, this field should be present and non-empty, but in certain corner cases involving generator expressions, it is possible for a test to have no command and therefore this field can be missing.

`backtrace`
Index into the `nodes` member of the `backtraceGraph`.

`properties`
Optional array of test properties. Each array item will be a JSON object with the following members:

`name`
The name of the test property. This cannot be empty.

`value`
The property value, which can be a string, a number, a boolean, or an array of strings.

Added in version 4.1: The JSON output format is described in machine-readable form by [`this JSON schema`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/_downloads/a23288746b718529293c28c8c3fad9df/show-only-schema.json).

[Resource Allocation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id38)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#resource-allocation "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CTest provides a mechanism for tests to specify the resources that they need in a fine-grained way, and for users to specify the resources available on the running machine. This allows CTest to internally keep track of which resources are in use and which are free, scheduling tests in a way that prevents them from trying to claim resources that are not available.

When the resource allocation feature is used, CTest will not oversubscribe resources. For example, if a resource has 8 slots, CTest will not run tests that collectively use more than 8 slots at a time. This has the effect of limiting how many tests can run at any given time, even if a high `-j` argument is used, if those tests all use some slots from the same resource. In addition, it means that a single test that uses more of a resource than is available on a machine will not run at all (and will be reported as `Not Run`).

A common use case for this feature is for tests that require the use of a GPU. Multiple tests can simultaneously allocate memory from a GPU, but if too many tests try to do this at once, some of them will fail to allocate, resulting in a failed test, even though the test would have succeeded if it had the memory it needed. By using the resource allocation feature, each test can specify how much memory it requires from a GPU, allowing CTest to schedule tests in a way that running several of these tests at once does not exhaust the GPU's memory pool.

Please note that CTest has no concept of what a GPU is or how much memory it has. It does not have any way of communicating with a GPU to retrieve this information or perform any memory management, although the project can define a test that provides details about the test machine (see [Dynamically-Generated Resource Specification File](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-dynamically-generated-spec-file)).

CTest keeps track of a list of abstract resource types, each of which has a certain number of slots available for tests to use. Each test specifies the number of slots that it requires from a certain resource, and CTest then schedules them in a way that prevents the total number of slots in use from exceeding the listed capacity. When a test is executed, and slots from a resource are allocated to that test, tests may assume that they have exclusive use of those slots for the duration of the test's process.

The CTest resource allocation feature consists of at least two inputs:

*   The [resource specification file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-specification-file), described below, which describes the resources available on the system.

*   The [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/RESOURCE_GROUPS.html#prop_test:RESOURCE_GROUPS "RESOURCE_GROUPS") property of tests, which describes the resources required by the test.

When CTest runs a test, the resources allocated to that test are passed in the form of a set of [environment variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-environment-variables) as described below. Using this information to decide which resource to connect to is left to the test writer.

The `RESOURCE_GROUPS` property tells CTest what resources a test expects to use grouped in a way meaningful to the test. The test itself must read the [environment variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-environment-variables) to determine which resources have been allocated to each group. For example, each group may correspond to a process the test will spawn when executed.

Note that even if a test specifies a `RESOURCE_GROUPS` property, it is still possible for that to test to run without any resource allocation (and without the corresponding [environment variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-environment-variables)) if the user does not pass a resource specification file. Passing this file, either through the `--resource-spec-file` command-line argument or the `RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE` argument to [`ctest_test()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html#command:ctest_test "ctest_test"), is what activates the resource allocation feature. Tests should check the `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT` environment variable to find out whether or not resource allocation is activated. This variable will always (and only) be defined if resource allocation is activated. If resource allocation is not activated, then the `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT` variable will not exist, even if it exists for the parent **ctest** process. If a test absolutely must have resource allocation, then it can return a failing exit code or use the [`SKIP_RETURN_CODE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/SKIP_RETURN_CODE.html#prop_test:SKIP_RETURN_CODE "SKIP_RETURN_CODE") or [`SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION.html#prop_test:SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION") properties to indicate a skipped test.

### [Resource Specification File](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id39)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#resource-specification-file "Link to this heading")

The resource specification file is a JSON file which is passed to CTest in one of a number of ways. It can be specified on the command line with the [`ctest --resource-spec-file`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-resource-spec-file) option, it can be given using the `RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE` argument of [`ctest_test()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html#command:ctest_test "ctest_test"), or it can be generated dynamically as part of test execution (see [Dynamically-Generated Resource Specification File](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-dynamically-generated-spec-file)).

If a dashboard script is used and `RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE` is not specified, the value of [`CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE.html#variable:CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE "CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE") in the dashboard script is used instead. If [`--resource-spec-file`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-resource-spec-file), `RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`, and [`CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE.html#variable:CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE "CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE") in the dashboard script are not specified, the value of [`CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE.html#variable:CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE "CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE") in the CMake build is used instead. If none of these are specified, no resource spec file is used.

The resource specification file must be a JSON object. All examples in this document assume the following resource specification file:

{
 "version": {
 "major": 1,
 "minor": 0
 },
 "local": [
 {
 "gpus": [
 {
 "id": "0",
 "slots": 2
 },
 {
 "id": "1",
 "slots": 4
 },
 {
 "id": "2",
 "slots": 2
 },
 {
 "id": "3"
 }
 ],
 "crypto_chips": [
 {
 "id": "card0",
 "slots": 4
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
}

The members are:

`version`
An object containing a `major` integer field and a `minor` integer field. Currently, the only supported version is major `1`, minor `0`. Any other value is an error.

`local`
A JSON array of resource sets present on the system. Currently, this array is restricted to being of size 1.

Each array element is a JSON object with members whose names are equal to the desired resource types, such as `gpus`. These names must start with a lowercase letter or an underscore, and subsequent characters can be a lowercase letter, a digit, or an underscore. Uppercase letters are not allowed, because certain platforms have case-insensitive environment variables. See the [Environment Variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#environment-variables) section below for more information. It is recommended that the resource type name be the plural of a noun, such as `gpus` or `crypto_chips` (and not `gpu` or `crypto_chip`.)

Please note that the names `gpus` and `crypto_chips` are just examples, and CTest does not interpret them in any way. You are free to make up any resource type you want to meet your own requirements.

The value for each resource type is a JSON array consisting of JSON objects, each of which describe a specific instance of the specified resource. These objects have the following members:

`id`
A string consisting of an identifier for the resource. Each character in the identifier can be a lowercase letter, a digit, or an underscore. Uppercase letters are not allowed.

Identifiers must be unique within a resource type. However, they do not have to be unique across resource types. For example, it is valid to have a `gpus` resource named `0` and a `crypto_chips` resource named `0`, but not two `gpus` resources both named `0`.

Please note that the IDs `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `card0` are just examples, and CTest does not interpret them in any way. You are free to make up any IDs you want to meet your own requirements.

`slots`
An optional unsigned number specifying the number of slots available on the resource. For example, this could be megabytes of RAM on a GPU, or cryptography units available on a cryptography chip. If `slots` is not specified, a default value of `1` is assumed.

In the example file above, there are four GPUs with ID's 0 through 3. GPU 0 has 2 slots, GPU 1 has 4, GPU 2 has 2, and GPU 3 has a default of 1 slot. There is also one cryptography chip with 4 slots.

### [`RESOURCE_GROUPS` Property](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id40)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#resource-groups-property "Link to this heading")

See [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/RESOURCE_GROUPS.html#prop_test:RESOURCE_GROUPS "RESOURCE_GROUPS") for a description of this property.

### [Environment Variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id41)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#environment-variables "Link to this heading")

Once CTest has decided which resources to allocate to a test, it passes this information to the test executable as a series of environment variables. For each example below, we will assume that the test in question has a [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/RESOURCE_GROUPS.html#prop_test:RESOURCE_GROUPS "RESOURCE_GROUPS") property of `2,gpus:2;gpus:4,gpus:1,crypto_chips:2`.

The following variables are passed to the test process:

CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#envvar:CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT "Link to this definition")
The total number of groups specified by the [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/RESOURCE_GROUPS.html#prop_test:RESOURCE_GROUPS "RESOURCE_GROUPS") property. For example:

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT=3`

This variable will only be defined if [`ctest(1)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#manual:ctest(1) "ctest(1)") has been given a `--resource-spec-file`, or if [`ctest_test()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html#command:ctest_test "ctest_test") has been given a `RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`. If no resource specification file has been given, this variable will not be defined.

CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#envvar:CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_%3Cnum%3E "Link to this definition")
The list of resource types allocated to each group, with each item separated by a comma. `<num>` is a number from zero to `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT` minus one. `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>` is defined for each `<num>` in this range. For example:

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_0=gpus`

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_1=gpus`

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_2=crypto_chips,gpus`

CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>_<resource-type>[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#envvar:CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_%3Cnum%3E_%3Cresource-type%3E "Link to this definition")
The list of resource IDs and number of slots from each ID allocated to each group for a given resource type. This variable consists of a series of pairs, each pair separated by a semicolon, and with the two items in the pair separated by a comma. The first item in each pair is `id:` followed by the ID of a resource of type `<resource-type>`, and the second item is `slots:` followed by the number of slots from that resource allocated to the given group. For example:

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_0_GPUS=id:0,slots:2`

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_1_GPUS=id:2,slots:2`

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_2_GPUS=id:1,slots:4;id:3,slots:1`

*   `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_2_CRYPTO_CHIPS=id:card0,slots:2`

In this example, group 0 gets 2 slots from GPU `0`, group 1 gets 2 slots from GPU `2`, and group 2 gets 4 slots from GPU `1`, 1 slot from GPU `3`, and 2 slots from cryptography chip `card0`.

`<num>` is a number from zero to `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_COUNT` minus one. `<resource-type>` is the name of a resource type, converted to uppercase. `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>_<resource-type>` is defined for the product of each `<num>` in the range listed above and each resource type listed in `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>`.

Because some platforms have case-insensitive names for environment variables, the names of resource types may not clash in a case-insensitive environment. Because of this, for the sake of simplicity, all resource types must be listed in all lowercase in the [resource specification file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-resource-specification-file) and in the [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/RESOURCE_GROUPS.html#prop_test:RESOURCE_GROUPS "RESOURCE_GROUPS") property, and they are converted to all uppercase in the `CTEST_RESOURCE_GROUP_<num>_<resource-type>` environment variable.

### [Dynamically-Generated Resource Specification File](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id42)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#dynamically-generated-resource-specification-file "Link to this heading")

Added in version 3.28.

A project may optionally specify a single test which will be used to dynamically generate the resource specification file that CTest will use for scheduling tests that use resources. The test that generates the file must have the [`GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE.html#prop_test:GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE "GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE") property set, and must have exactly one fixture in its [`FIXTURES_SETUP`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/FIXTURES_SETUP.html#prop_test:FIXTURES_SETUP "FIXTURES_SETUP") property. This fixture is considered by CTest to have special meaning: it's the fixture that generates the resource spec file. The fixture may have any name. If such a fixture exists, all tests that have [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/RESOURCE_GROUPS.html#prop_test:RESOURCE_GROUPS "RESOURCE_GROUPS") set must have the fixture in their [`FIXTURES_REQUIRED`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/FIXTURES_REQUIRED.html#prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED "FIXTURES_REQUIRED"), and a resource spec file may not be specified with the `--resource-spec-file` argument or the [`CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE.html#variable:CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE "CTEST_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE") variable.

[Job Server Integration](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id43)[¶](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#job-server-integration "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added in version 3.29.

On POSIX systems, when running under the context of a [Job Server](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Job-Slots.html), CTest shares its job slots. This is independent of the [`PROCESSORS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_test/PROCESSORS.html#prop_test:PROCESSORS "PROCESSORS") test property, which still counts against CTest's [`-j`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#cmdoption-ctest-j) parallel level. CTest acquires exactly one token from the job server before running each test, and returns it when the test finishes.

For example, consider the `Makefile`:

test:
+ctest -j 8

When invoked via `make -j 2 test`, `ctest` connects to the job server, acquires a token for each test, and runs at most 2 tests concurrently.

On Windows systems, job server integration is not yet implemented.
