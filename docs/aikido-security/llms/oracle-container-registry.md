# Oracle Container Registry

Use this guide to connect your Oracle container registry to Aikido for image scanning.<br>

Aikido only needs read (pull) access, and needs to be able to view an index of all the repositories. We never push, modify, or delete images.

## Prerequisites

* The registry url for your Oracle Container Registry (what you use during docker login)
* A user with pull permissions for the repositories you want scanned.

  Scope it to the minimum set of repos or namespaces, make sure we can get a list of the repositories.
* (Optional) If your registry is behind a firewall, allowlist Aikido’s egress IPs.

## Set-up

### Step 1: Create credentials for Aikido

* Create a new user with the correct permissions: needs to have pull permissions & needs to be able to view all repositories.
* [Generate an auth token](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrygettingauthtoken.htm) for this new user.

### Step 2: Verify with docker login

Before connecting to Aikido, confirm the credentials work locally.

```
docker logout example.ocir.io 2>/dev/null || true
docker login example.ocir.io
# Username: <your-username-or-service-account>
# Password: <your-access-token-or password>
```

Then try pulling a known image to confirm permissions:

```
docker pull registry.example.ocir.io/namespace/image:tag
```

If this fails, adjust the token scope or repository permissions in your registry.

### Step 3: Add the registry in Aikido

We don't have an explicit entry for Oracle Container Registries, but the OCI option works with a lot of container registries, including Oracle Container Registry.
