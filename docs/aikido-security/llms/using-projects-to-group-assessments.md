# Using Projects to Group Assessments

## What are Projects

Projects in Aikido Pentest are logical groupings of one or more assessments that share the same scope, configuration, or target application.

They help you organize related pentests, for example by product, environment, or business unit, and keep all associated results, reports, and settings in one place.

A Project usually represents:

* A single application such as myapp.com and its related API or staging environments
* A set of connected apps that share the same backend or authentication system
* A recurring security scope such as a quarterly pentest of the same system

## Why Projects matter

Projects make it easy to:

* Track security posture over time by seeing how findings evolve across multiple assessments
* Reuse configuration such as targets, credentials, repository links, and API specs
* Manage reports by storing all assessment reports for the same app in one location
* Simplify compliance with a consistent audit trail for a defined scope

### Creating a Project

Before you can start an assessment, you first need to create a project.

When creating a project, you will:

1. Choose a name that clearly describes what is being tested

   (for example, “Aikido Dashboard” or “Customer Portal API”)
2. Save the project to make it available for future assessments

After the project is created, it becomes your starting point for all related assessments.

All configurations you define here are stored and reused automatically when starting a new assessment.&#x20;
