# Sanitization

## <a href="about:blank#_overview"></a> Overview

When services process user-generated content, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) is both a legal requirement and a trust imperative. Regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA mandate careful handling of personal data, while users expect their private information wonât be exposed to support staff, analysts, or third parties unnecessarily.

Text anonymizationâdetecting and masking sensitive details like names, emails, and phone numbersâenables legitimate use cases such as logging, analytics, and model training while minimizing privacy risks. It reduces the attack surface in case of breaches and demonstrates a privacy-respecting approach to data handling.

Akka supports this through service-wide sanitization.

The sanitization is disabled by default and can be selectively enabled through configuration.

When enabled, sanitization is automatically applied to text that is:

- written to logs
- passed to agent models from agent requests
- passed to agent models from local tool or MCP tool output
Text matched by a sanitizer is replaced by a mask of `*` containing the same number of characters as the original matched string.

For example, with a credit card sanitizer enabled, the following text:

I'm having problems using my credit card 5204 46025 0000 006 Will be masked to:

I'm having problems using my credit card ******************* Before being written in logs or passed to agent models.

### <a href="about:blank#_ad_hoc_sanitization"></a> Ad hoc sanitization

Sanitization can also be programmatically applied to text in any component where it makes sense for a specific
business case, for example before sending some text to a third party API or before writing a text in the state
of an entity. This is done by [injecting](setup-and-dependency-injection.html) a `akka.javasdk.Sanitizer` in the component constructor and
then using `akka.javasdk.Sanitizer#sanitize` on the text.

[SanitizingEndpoint.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/api/SanitizingEndpoint.java)
```java
@HttpEndpoint("/example-with-ad-hoc-sanitization")
@Acl(allow = @Acl.Matcher(principal = Acl.Principal.ALL))
public class SanitizingEndpoint {

  private final Sanitizer sanitizer;

  public SanitizingEndpoint(Sanitizer sanitizer) {
    this.sanitizer = sanitizer;
  }

  @Get("/somepath/{id}")
  public String returnSanitizedData(String id) {
    // String data from another component or a third party library/API
    String someText = loadText();
    String sanitizedText = sanitizer.sanitize(someText);
    return sanitizedText;
  }
```

## <a href="about:blank#_sanitizer_types"></a> Sanitizer types

There are two types of sanitizers available, it is possible combine predefined and custom sanitizers in the same service:

### <a href="about:blank#_predefined"></a> Predefined

A small set of common sanitizers is built into the Akka runtime and are enabled by name in config:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EMAIL` | email addresses |
| `PHONE` | International and national phone numbers |
| `CREDIT_CARD` | VISA, Mastercard, American Express, Diners, Discover, JCB, and generic credit card numbers |
| `IBAN` | international bank account numbers |
| `IP_ADDRESS` | ipv4 and ipv6 network addresses |
One or more of these are enabled in the service `application.conf` file like this:

```hocon
akka.javasdk.sanitization {
  predefined-sanitizers = ["IBAN", "CREDIT_CARD"]
}
```

### <a href="about:blank#_custom"></a> Custom

In many cases more application and business domain specific sanitizers are useful. Custom sanitizers allows defining
regular expressions that define character sequences that should be masked.

Custom, application specific sanitizers can be defined by adding a config block `akka.javasdk.sanitization.regex-sanitizers` with a name for each custom sanitizer followed by a config block with a single `pattern` key that has a value that is
a valid Java regular expression that matches the type of text that should be masked.

This example masks an hypothetical customer id in the form S0123456789:

```hocon
akka.javasdk.sanitization.regex-sanitizers = {
  "CUSTOMER_IDS" = { pattern = "S\\d{10}" }
}
```
This would lead to texts like:

Customer S0847362951 reported an issue with their order Being masked to:

Customer *********** reported an issue with their order Before being written in logs or passed to agent models.

## <a href="about:blank#_performance_considerations"></a> Performance considerations

Sanitization is applied to every log entry. In high-throughput applications, numerous sanitization rules or complex regular
expressions may impact performance. Consider monitoring application performance and optimizing regex patterns if necessary.

## <a href="about:blank#_testing_sanitization"></a> Testing sanitization

In tests the sanitizer can be directly accessed from `getSanitizer` method in `TestKit` or `TestKitSupport` to assert that expected
texts are masked given the service sanitizer configuration.
