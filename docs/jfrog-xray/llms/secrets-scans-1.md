# Secrets Scans

JFrog Advanced Security helps prevent the accidental exposure of secrets such as API keys, passwords, and tokens through its comprehensive secrets detection and token validation capabilities. By scanning both source code and binary artifacts, it ensures sensitive data is never exposed to unauthorized users, making it a powerful secrets prevention solution.

Secret scan results can be fine-tuned by ignoring specific findings that are known and accepted within the organization.
Ignore rules can be applied at various levels — from entire scanner types to individual secret findings — enabling targeted noise reduction and clearer reporting.

For developers and security experts, secrets detection is integrated into your IDE, CLI, Frogbot, and the JFrog Platform, providing real-time feedback to identify and address exposed secrets across the development pipeline.

### Supported Secret Types

* **Access Tokens (Keys)**: Detects structured access tokens in both text and binary files, such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and private tokens.
  * Token Validation enhances secret detection by verifying the validity of detected tokens and distinguishing between active and inactive tokens by authenticating against the token provider.
* **Certificate & Private Key Detection**: Identifies issues in X.509 PEM and DER certificates, including:
  * Certificates containing private keys
  * Expired certificates
  * Self-signed certificates
* **High Entropy Textual Secrets**:  Detects high-entropy secrets in source code and config files, such as passwords and secret keys with high randomness.
* **URL Secrets Detection**: Detects embedded credentials in URLs (e.g. `https://username:password@mydomain.com`).

### Token Validation

Enable **Token Validation** to verify the validity of detected tokens, distinguishing between active and inactive tokens by authenticating against the token provider.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  Token Validation currently supports public SaaS endpoints only (e.g., `github.com`, `gitlab.com`). Self-hosted or custom-domain instances (e.g., `github.mycompany.com`, `gitlab.mycompany.com`) are not validated.
</Callout>

* Available through both the **JFrog Platform** and **Xray’s REST API**.
* To enable in the **JFrog Platform**:
  * Navigate to **Administration** > **Xray Settings** > **General** > **Advanced Security**
  * Check the **Enable dynamic token validation** checkbox
* To enable via **REST API**, use the "Enable Token Validation for Secrets" API.

When a secret has been reviewed and determined as acceptable or a false positive, it can be excluded from future results by creating an **ignore rule** for that finding.
The rule is bound to the secret’s finding and can apply to its specific file, artifact, build, or release bundle scope.

See [Ignore Violations](https://docs.jfrog.com/security/docs/ignore-advanced-security-violations) for instructions on creating and managing ignore rules for secret findings.

### Validation Results

Once enabled, results appear under **Findings** in violation details. The **Token Validation** column indicates:

* **Active**: Token is valid and poses a security risk if compromised.
* **Inactive**: Token is no longer in use.
* **Unsupported**: Token provider does not support validation.
* **Unavailable**: Unable to validate due to unknown reasons.

Some providers attach metadata to secrets (e.g., AWS includes a **Token ID** with the **Token Secret**). This metadata is displayed in the **Metadata** column.

### Details about Supported Secret Types

#### Access Tokens (Keys)

Detects structured access tokens in text or binary files.\

#### Access Tokens (Keys) False Positives Reduction

Some access keys will not trigger alerts:

* **Public example keys** (e.g. `ANPAI65L554VRJ33ECQS6`)
* **Keys in documentation directories** (`e.g. /usr/local/share/`)
* **Keys matching common test patterns**:
  * .`*xxxx.*`, `.*test.*`, `.*sample.*`,  `.*example.*`
  * `.*token.*`, `.*123456.*`, `.*abcdef.*`, `.*foobar.*`

### Certificate & Private Key Detection

Detects issues in **X.509 PEM (text)** and **DER (binary) certificates**, including:

* Certificates containing private keys
* Expired certificates
* Self-signed certificates

### High Entropy Textual Secrets

Detects and identifies high-entropy secrets in textual files (e.g., source code, config files) when:

* The key is indicative of a secret (e.g., `password`, `secret`)
* The value has high randomness (e.g., `d#@B2xN,Y}`, not `123123123`)
  **Example**:

> my\_password: "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple123!"

#### High Entropy Textual Secrets False Positives Reduction

False positives are minimized using heuristics. Secrets will **not** raise alerts if:

* Key is exactly "key" (e.g., `key = d#@B2xN,Y}`)
* Value matches test patterns (`.*xxxx.*`, `.*123456.*`, etc.)
* Value contains repeated/sequential characters (e.g., `123456`)
* Secret is in documentation directories
* Secret is in third-party files (e.g., a third-party npm package)

### URL Secrets Detection

Detects secrets embedded in URLs (e.g., `https://myuser:mypass@somedomain.com`).

#### URL Secrets Detection False Positives Reduction

Some URLs will not trigger alerts:

* URLs matching test patterns (`.*example.*`, `.*foo.*`, `.bar.*`)
* Authentication placeholders (`.*user:pass.*`, .`*username.*`, `.*anonymous.*`)
* URLs referencing image files (`.jpg`)
