Fix common issues with sub agents.



If your sub agent gives weak or inconsistent results, you usually do not need a full prompt rewrite. Start by matching symptoms, apply one targeted prompt fix, and testing again.

  <Tab title="Ambiguity">
    ```markdown
    - If requirements are ambiguous and the decision is high impact, ask before proceeding.
    - For low-risk, reversible decisions, proceed with labeled assumptions.
    - If assumptions materially affect outcomes, list them explicitly.
    - If new input conflicts with prior constraints, surface the conflict before proceeding.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Evidence">
    ```markdown
    - When sources conflict, state the conflict and provide options with tradeoffs.
    - Separate direct evidence from inference.
    - Prioritize sources: official docs -> established repo patterns -> examples -> blog posts.
    - Call out when applying guidance outside its original context.
    - If confidence is low, say "I don't know" and state what must be verified.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Boundaries">
    ```markdown
    - Before acting, check: what could this break and who depends on it?
    - Escalate when requests are out of scope, low-confidence/high-impact, or blocked by permissions.
    - Define directive strength: must (non-negotiable), should (strong default), consider (optional).
    - When multiple valid paths exist, present options with tradeoffs.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Output shape">
    ```markdown
    - Return output in a strict format with ordered headings.
    - Lead with 2-5 key bullets, then details.
    - Avoid long preambles and repeated phrasing.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Deterministic ops">
    ```markdown
    - Do not rely on the LLM to iterate through lists; use programmatic loops.
    - When processing N items, call the sub agent N times from a parent tool.
    - Validate that all items in a list were processed before returning results.
    - Handle date/time filtering in the tool, not in the prompt; pass date parameters to the tool.
    ```

## Common issues and fixes

### Ambiguity and assumptions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent assumes missing details and proceeds">
    **What you see:** Silent assumptions, fabricated defaults, no clarification.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt says what to do, but not when to pause and ask.

    **Fix:**

    * Add: "If requirements are ambiguous and the decision is high impact, ask before proceeding."
    * Add: "If you proceed with assumptions, state them explicitly."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent asks too many clarifying questions">
    **What you see:** Repeated low-stakes questions and slow progress on reversible decisions.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define when asking is required versus optional.

    **Fix:**

    * Add ask policy: ask only for high-impact ambiguity or preference-sensitive decisions.
    * Add proceed policy: for low-risk decisions, proceed with labeled assumptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent overreacts to the most recent message">
    **What you see:** New feedback causes the agent to ignore earlier goals and constraints.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not include continuity guidance.

    **Fix:**

    * Add: "New input adds context; it does not erase prior requirements."
    * Add: "If new input conflicts with prior constraints, surface the conflict before proceeding."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assumptions compound without visibility">
    **What you see:** Output depends on multiple hidden assumptions that were never validated.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not require explicit assumption disclosure.

    **Fix:**

    * Add: "When assumptions affect outcome, list them explicitly before final recommendations."
    * Add: "If assumptions stack, pause and request confirmation before further work."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Evidence and source quality

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent flattens nuance across conflicting sources">
    **What you see:** Conflicting sources are treated as agreement; alternatives are not named.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not explain how to handle ambiguous or conflicting evidence.

    **Fix:**

    * Add: "When sources conflict, state the conflict and provide options with tradeoffs."
    * Add: "Separate direct evidence from inference."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent treats weak sources as equally authoritative">
    **What you see:** Low-trust examples are used instead of official docs or established repo patterns.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define source priority.

    **Fix:**

    * Add source priority guidance, for example: official docs -> established repo patterns -> examples -> blog posts.
    * Add: "Call out when applying guidance outside its original context."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent invents details when uncertain">
    **What you see:** Plausible but unverified claims are presented confidently.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not allow uncertainty language, so the agent guesses.

    **Fix:**

    * Add: "'I don't know' is valid when confidence is low."
    * Add: "Do not invent missing details; state what must be verified."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Decision boundaries and risk

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent never escalates">
    **What you see:** The agent tries to answer everything, including out-of-scope decisions.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define escalation boundaries.

    **Fix:**

    * Add explicit escalation criteria: out-of-scope requests, low confidence on high-impact decisions, missing permissions.
    * Add expected escalation output: what is blocked, why, and what is needed to continue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent misreads directive strength">
    **What you see:** Suggestions are treated as requirements, or hard requirements are ignored.

    **Why it happens:** Directive strength is not defined consistently.

    **Fix:**

    * Define terms once: `must` = non-negotiable, `should` = strong default, `consider` = optional.
    * Rewrite ambiguous constraints to use one of those terms consistently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent presents one option only">
    **What you see:** One option is presented even when multiple valid options exist.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not require tradeoff framing when uncertainty is high.

    **Fix:**

    * Add: "When multiple valid options exist, present options with tradeoffs."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Output clarity and structure

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent is verbose, repetitive, or buries key points">
    **What you see:** Long preambles, repeated phrasing, and key findings that are hard to locate.

    **Why it happens:** The prompt does not define a clear output shape.

    **Fix:**

    * Add a strict output format with ordered headings.
    * Add verbosity limits, for example: "Lead with 2-5 key bullets, then details."
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Deterministic operations

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The agent only processes some items in a list">
    **What you see:** You give the agent a list of 10 companies and ask it to call a tool or sub agent for each one, but only 3-5 get processed.

    **Why it happens:** LLMs are not reliable iterators. When asked to loop through a list and perform an action for each item, they often stop early, skip items, or lose track of progress. This is a fundamental limitation of how LLMs process lists.

    **Fix:**

    * Do not rely on the LLM to iterate. Instead, use programmatic iteration in a [function tool](/typescript-sdk/tools/function-tools) from a separate agent which calls the sub agent using a [webhook](/typescript-sdk/triggers/webhooks).
    * The function tool accepts the list, loops through each item in code, and calls the sub agent via webhook once per item.
    * The calling agent calls the function tool once with the full list; the tool handles the iteration deterministically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent filters dates incorrectly">
    **What you see:** You ask for "messages from the past 24 hours" but the agent returns messages from days ago, or misses recent ones. Date comparisons are inconsistent.

    **Why it happens:** LLMs struggle with date/time reasoning. They may misparse timestamps, miscalculate relative dates ("past 24 hours"), or inconsistently compare date formats. This is especially problematic when filtering large result sets.

    **Fix:**

    * Move date filtering into the tool itself. Add date parameters to the tool schema.
    * Have the tool compute the date range and filter results before returning them to the agent.
    * The agent's job is to extract the user's intent ("past 24 hours") and pass it as a parameter; the tool does the actual filtering.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Adding fixes to your prompt

You can add these guardrails in three ways. If you are new to prompt writing, start with Option A.

### Option A: Dedicated troubleshooting section

```markdown
## Prompt pitfalls to avoid

- If requirements are unclear on a high-impact decision, ask before proceeding.
- When sources conflict, acknowledge the conflict and separate evidence from inference.
- Lead with key findings and avoid repeated wording.
```

### Option B: Weave fixes into operating principles

```markdown
## Operating principles

- Clarify before action on high-impact ambiguity.
- Weigh evidence by source authority and relevance.
- Match confidence to certainty and provide options when needed.
```

### Option C: Hybrid

Use operating principles for defaults, then add a short "watch-outs" block near the end of the prompt.
