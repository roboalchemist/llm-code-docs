Get started with Inkeep Agents in <5min



<>
  ## Launch your first agent

  ### Prerequisites

  Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22 or higher
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  * [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 10 or higher

  You can verify by running:

  ```bash
  node --version
  pnpm --version
  docker --version
  ```

  ### Step 1: Create a new agents project

  Run the quickstart script on a target folder:

  ```bash
  npx @inkeep/create-agents my-agents
  ```

  Navigate to the folder

  ```bash
  cd my-agents
  ```

  Open the folder using your coding editor. To open with Cursor, you can run `cursor .`

  ### Step 2: Run the setup script

  Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker daemon) is running before running the setup script.

  ```bash
  pnpm setup-dev
  ```

  ### Step 3: Launch the dev environment

  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```

  The Visual Builder will auto-open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

  ### Step 4: Login to the Visual Builder

  Use the credentials from your root `.env` file (`INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_UI_USERNAME` and `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_UI_PASSWORD`) to log in when the Visual Builder opens.

  ### Step 5: Chat with your agent

  Navigate to the **Activities Planner** agent at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and ask about fun activities at a location of your choice:
