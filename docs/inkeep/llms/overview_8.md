  ## Credential Store Options

  MCP servers and external agents may require authentication for secure access. The Inkeep agent framework supports storing these credentials in three different ways:

  <OptionCards>
    <OptionCard title="Nango Store" icon="brand/Nango" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/nango" badge="Recommended" highlighted cta="Learn More">
      **Best for:** Development or Production environments with OAuth2.1/PKCE flows and complex integrations

      * Automatic token refresh for OAuth
      * Supports additional metadata headers
      * Works with complex OAuth flows (OAuth2.0/PKCE)
      * Managed service (self-hosted or cloud)
    </OptionCard>

    <OptionCard title="Keychain Store" icon="LuLock" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/keychain" badge="Default" cta="Learn More">
      **Best for:** Local development with OAuth services

      * Not suitable for production
      * No automatic token refresh
      * Requires manual re-authentication when tokens expire
      * Does not support additional metadata headers
    </OptionCard>

    <OptionCard title="Environment Variables" icon="LuDatabase" href="/typescript-sdk/credentials/environment-variables" cta="Learn More">
      **Best for:** Simple API keys and bearer tokens in development or production

      * Direct configuration via TypeScript SDK
      * Does not support additional metadata headers
      * Does not support OAuth2.1/PKCE flows
    </OptionCard>
  </OptionCards>

  ## Environment-aware Credentials

  When you need different credentials for different environments (e.g., development vs. production), you can take advantage of [environment-aware credentials](/typescript-sdk/credentials/env-aware-credentials). This approach allows you to:

  * Define separate credentials for each environment
  * Automatically load the correct credentials based on your deployment environment
  * Keep your development and production credentials cleanly separated
  * Easily switch between environments using the CLI's `--env` flag

  Learn more about setting up environment-aware credentials in the [dedicated guide](/typescript-sdk/credentials/env-aware-credentials).
