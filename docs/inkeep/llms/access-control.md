# Access Control (/visual-builder/access-control)

Multi-tenant authentication with organizations, team management, and fine-grained project permissions



The Inkeep Agent Framework provides two layers of access control:

| Layer              | What it does                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication** | Users sign in, belong to organizations, manage teams |
| **Authorization**  | Fine-grained project-level roles and permissions     |

Authentication handles user sign-in and organization membership. Authorization adds granular control over who can do what within each project.

<Note>
  For deployment configuration including OAuth providers, see [Authentication Setup](/deployment/authentication).
</Note>

## Sign-In Methods

| Method               | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email & Password** | Default sign-in with email and password credentials |
| **Google**           | OAuth sign-in (requires configuration)              |

To add Google sign-in, see [Adding OAuth Providers](/deployment/authentication#google-oauth).

## Organizations & Team Management

Each organization operates as an isolated tenant:

* **Separate workspaces**: Each organization has its own projects, agents, MCP servers, and credentials
* **Team collaboration**: Multiple users can belong to the same organization
* **Role-based access**: Team members have different permission levels

### Organization Roles

| Role       | Permissions                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**  | Full access to all projects and settings, can add members |
| **Member** | Access determined by project-level roles                  |

### Inviting Team Members

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. View current members and their roles
3. Click **Invite** to invite a new team member
4. Enter the member's email and select a role (Admin or Member)
5. Click **Send Invitation**

If email is enabled for your tenant, the invited user receives a branded email with a link to accept the invitation and set up their account. The invitation expires after 7 days.

If email is not configured, the invitation link is displayed directly in the UI — copy and share it manually with the team member.

<Tip>
  For self-hosted deployments, email requires SMTP configuration. See [Configure Email](/deployment/email) for setup instructions.
</Tip>

## Password Reset

If email is enabled for your tenant, users can reset their password through a self-service flow:

1. On the sign-in page, click **Forgot password?**
2. Enter the email address associated with your account
3. Check your inbox for a password reset link
4. Click the link and set a new password

The reset link expires after 30 minutes. If you don't receive the email, check your spam folder.

If email is not configured for your tenant, contact your organization administrator to reset your password.

## Project Roles & Permissions

Assign granular roles at the project level to give organization Members specific access to individual projects.

### Role Hierarchy

| Role               | View | Use | Edit |
| ------------------ | :--: | :-: | :--: |
| **Project Admin**  |   ✓  |  ✓  |   ✓  |
| **Project Member** |   ✓  |  ✓  |   ✗  |
| **Project Viewer** |   ✓  |  ✗  |   ✗  |

### Permission Breakdown

| Permission | What it allows                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **View**   | See project configuration, agents, and settings (read-only)                                          |
| **Use**    | Invoke agents, create API keys, view traces                                                          |
| **Edit**   | Modify agents, tools, credentials, project settings, and evaluations (datasets, evaluators, configs) |

### Managing Project Members

1. Navigate to your project
2. Go to **Members**
3. Search for members by email and select one or more to add
4. Choose a role for the selected members and click **Add**

<Tip>
  Organization Admins always have full access to all projects, regardless of project-level roles.
</Tip>

## User-Scoped vs Project-Scoped Resources

Certain resources can be configured with different scopes:

| Scope              | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Project-scoped** | Shared across all users in the project |
| **User-scoped**    | Configured separately for each user    |

### Example: MCP Servers

MCP servers can be configured as either project-scoped or user-scoped:

| Use Case                                            | Recommended Scope |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Shared company tools (internal APIs, databases)     | Project-scoped    |
| Personal integrations (user's Slack, GitHub, email) | User-scoped       |
| Services requiring per-user authorization           | User-scoped       |
| Tools where data should be separated by user        | User-scoped       |

<Tip>
  You only configure a user-scoped MCP server once. Each user sees the same server but connects with their own credentials. The framework automatically manages the per-user authentication.
</Tip>

To select the scope, go to **MCP Servers** → create a server → select the scope.

See [MCP Servers](/visual-builder/tools/mcp-servers) for more details.
