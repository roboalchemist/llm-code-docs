Attach reusable instruction blocks to sub-agents



## Overview

Skills are reusable instruction blocks you can attach to sub-agents. They help you share behavioral rules, reasoning guidelines, and formatting standards across multiple sub-agents without duplicating prompt content.

Use skills to:

* **Standardize behavior** across sub-agents (tone, formatting, guardrails)
* **Separate concerns** by moving specialized instructions out of the main prompt
* **Load instructions on demand** to reduce context size when not needed

## Defining Skills

Skills are defined as `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter. Each skill lives in its own directory.

### File Structure

```
skills/
├── weather-safety-guardrails/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── structured-itinerary-responses/
    └── SKILL.md
```

<Note>
  The directory name must match the 

  `name`

   field in the frontmatter.
</Note>

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown title="skills/weather-safety-guardrails/SKILL.md"
---
name: "weather-safety-guardrails"
description: "Safety rules for weather-dependent activity recommendations"
metadata:
  author: acme-corp
  version: "1.0"
---

- Never recommend outdoor activities during severe weather alerts.
- Always mention indoor alternatives when precipitation exceeds 50%.
- Include safety disclaimers for extreme temperature conditions.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`        | string | Yes      | Skill identifier. Must match the parent directory name.                        |
| `description` | string | Yes      | When to use this skill. Used by the agent to decide whether to load the skill. |
| `metadata`    | object | No       | Additional key-value pairs (author, version, tags, etc.).                      |

The body content after the frontmatter contains the actual instructions in Markdown format.

## Loading Skills

Use `loadSkills()` to load all skills from a directory:

```typescript
import path from 'node:path';
import { loadSkills, project } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';
import { myAgent } from './agents/my-agent';

export const myProject = project({
  id: 'my-project',
  name: 'My Project',
  agents: () => [myAgent],
  skills: () => loadSkills(path.join('my-project/skills')),
  models: {
    base: {
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
    },
  },
});
```

The `loadSkills()` function:

1. Scans the directory for `*/SKILL.md` files
2. Parses each file's frontmatter and content
3. Validates that the `name` matches the directory name
4. Returns an array of `SkillDefinition` objects

## Attaching Skills to Sub-Agents

Add skills to a sub-agent using the `skills` configuration option.

### Reference by ID

Reference skills defined at the project level by their ID:

```typescript
import { subAgent } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';

const activitiesPlanner = subAgent({
  id: 'activities-planner',
  name: 'Activities Planner',
  description: 'Plans activities based on weather conditions',
  prompt: 'Help users plan activities based on current weather.',
  skills: () => [
    { id: 'weather-safety-guardrails', index: 0 },
    { id: 'structured-itinerary-responses', index: 1 },
  ],
});
```

### Skill Reference Options

| Field          | Type    | Required | Description                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`           | string  | Yes      | The skill identifier (matches the `name` in SKILL.md).                               |
| `index`        | number  | No       | Controls ordering. Higher index = higher priority in the prompt.                     |
| `alwaysLoaded` | boolean | No       | If `true`, skill content is always included. If `false` (default), loaded on demand. |

### Attaching Skills

Define attached skills to subagents:

```typescript
const mySubAgent = subAgent({
  id: 'my-sub-agent',
  name: 'My Sub Agent',
  prompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  skills: () => [
    {
      id: 'inline-skill',
      index: 0,
      alwaysLoaded: true,
    },
  ],
});
```

## Always Loaded vs On-Demand Skills

Skills can be loaded in two ways:

### Always Loaded

Set `alwaysLoaded: true` to include the skill content in every prompt:

```typescript
skills: () => [
  { id: 'brand-guidelines', alwaysLoaded: true },
]
```

Use for skills that apply to every interaction (brand voice, compliance rules).

### On-Demand (Default)

When `alwaysLoaded` is `false` or omitted, skills appear as an outline in the system prompt. The agent can load the full content when needed using the built-in `load_skill` tool.

```typescript
skills: () => [
  { id: 'technical-troubleshooting' }, // Loaded on demand
]
```

Use for specialized instructions that only apply to certain requests.

```typescript title="index.ts"

  description: 'Plans activities based on weather forecasts',
  agents: () => [activitiesPlannerAgent],
  skills: () => loadSkills(path.join('activities-planner-advanced/skills')),
  models: {
    base: {
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini',
    },
  },
});
```

```typescript title="agents/activities-planner-advanced.ts"
import { subAgent, agent } from '@inkeep/agents-sdk';

const activitiesPlanner = subAgent({

  name: 'Activities Planner',
  description: 'Plans activities considering weather conditions',
  prompt: 'Help users find activities based on weather forecasts.',
  skills: () => [
    { id: 'weather-safety-guardrails', index: 0 },
    { id: 'structured-itinerary-responses', index: 1 },
  ],
});

export const activitiesPlannerAgent = agent({
  id: 'activities-planner-advanced',
  name: 'Activities Planner Advanced',
  defaultSubAgent: activitiesPlanner,
  subAgents: () => [activitiesPlanner],
