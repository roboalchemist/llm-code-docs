Reusable instruction blocks you can attach to sub-agents



## Overview

Skills are reusable instruction blocks that you can attach to multiple sub-agents. They govern agent behavior,
reasoning, and tool usage, helping you keep shared rules, tone, and formatting consistent across the agent graph
while still allowing each sub-agent to focus on its own role.

## Create a skill

1. Go to **Skills** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create skill**.
3. Fill in the required fields and save.

  <figcaption className="mt-2 text-center text-sm">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Fields

* [**Name**](https://agentskills.io/specification#name-field): A short identifier.
* [**Description**](https://agentskills.io/specification#description-field): Explains when to use this skill. Write descriptions that help the agent understand when to load the skill.
* [**Content**](https://agentskills.io/specification#body-content): The Markdown body, write whatever helps agents perform the task effectively.
* [**Metadata (JSON)**](https://agentskills.io/specification#metadata-field): Additional properties not defined by [the Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/home).

<Tip>
  Write descriptions that include "Use when..." or "Use if..." phrases. This helps the agent decide when to load on-demand skills.
</Tip>

## Writing effective descriptions

The description field is critical for on-demand skills. The agent uses it to decide whether to load the skill, so be specific about the scenarios where the skill applies.

**Good example:**

```
Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Poor example:**

```
Helps with PDFs.
```

## Attach skills to sub-agents

Open an agent in the Visual Builder, select a sub-agent node, and use the **Skills** picker to attach one or more
skills.

## Always loaded and On-demand skills

Use **Always loaded** to include a skill in every prompt. It's off by default so skills load on demand unless you
enable it.

### How on-demand skills work

On-demand skills appear as an outline in the system prompt. When the agent determines a skill is relevant based on its description, it calls the built-in `load_skill` tool to retrieve the full content. This keeps prompts compact while still giving agents access to specialized instructions when needed.
