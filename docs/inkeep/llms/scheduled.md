# Scheduled Triggers (/talk-to-your-agents/triggers/scheduled)

Run your Agents automatically on a recurring schedule or at a specific future time



Scheduled triggers run agents automatically on a recurring schedule (cron) or at a specific future time (one-time). Use them for daily reports, hourly health checks, periodic data syncs, or deferred tasks.

<Warning>
  \*\*User-scoped MCP servers require a configured `runAsUserId`. Without `runAsUserId` set on the trigger, tools that require user-scoped credentials will fail. See [User vs Project MCPs](/visual-builder/tools/user-vs-project-mcp) for more details.
</Warning>

## Create a scheduled trigger

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the triggers page

    Navigate to your project and select the **Triggers** tab on the left sidebar, then choose **Scheduled**.

    Click **New scheduled trigger**. Select the agent you want to trigger, then click **Continue**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure basic information

    Fill in the required fields in the **Basic Information** section:

    * **Name** — a human-readable identifier (e.g., "Daily Report Generator")
    * **Description** — optional explanation of what the trigger does
    * **Enabled** — toggle on to activate the trigger immediately after creation
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set the execution identity

    In the **Execution Identity** section, choose which user identity the trigger runs as. This determines whose credentials and permissions are used during execution.

    * **None** — the trigger runs without a user identity (tools requiring user-scoped credentials are skipped)
    * **Specific user** — the trigger uses that user's connected credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens for GitHub, Slack, or Jira)

    <Note>
      Non-admin users can only assign triggers to themselves. Org admins can select any user in the organization — and when creating a trigger, admins can select multiple users to bulk-create one trigger per user.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Choose a schedule

    Select the **Schedule Type**:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Recurring (Cron)">
        The schedule builder provides preset frequencies:

        | Frequency                     | You configure                     |
        | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
        | **Every few minutes**         | Interval (e.g., every 15 minutes) |
        | **Every hour**                | Minute past the hour              |
        | **Every day**                 | Time of day                       |
        | **Specific days of the week** | Days + time of day                |
        | **Once a month**              | Day of month + time of day        |
        | **Custom (advanced)**         | Raw 5-field cron expression       |

        The builder shows a live preview of the schedule and auto-detects your browser's timezone.

        <Image src="/images/scheduled-trigger.png" alt="Schedule configuration showing recurring cron with daily frequency, time picker, and timezone" />
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="One-time">
        Pick a future date and time using the date-time picker. The trigger fires once at the specified time and doesn't repeat.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a message template and payload (optional)

    Define a text message sent to the agent when the trigger fires.

    When the trigger fires, the agent receives:

    * A **text part** with the interpolated message
    * A **data part** with the full payload object

    If you leave both empty, the agent receives only `{}`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure retry behavior

    Set how the trigger handles failures:

    | Setting         | Range           | Default | Description                         |
    | --------------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
    | **Max Retries** | 0–10            | 1       | Number of retry attempts on failure |
    | **Retry Delay** | 10–3600 seconds | 60      | Seconds between retries             |
    | **Timeout**     | 30–780 seconds  | 780     | Execution timeout per attempt       |

    Each retry creates a new conversation with the agent. All conversation IDs are tracked on the invocation record.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Save

    Click **Create Scheduled Trigger**. The trigger appears in the **Scheduled** tab and begins running on its configured schedule.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manage scheduled triggers

The **Scheduled** tab shows all triggers in your project with their agent, schedule, status, last run, and next run. Each trigger has a dropdown menu with the following actions:

| Action               | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Run Now**          | Execute the trigger immediately, regardless of its schedule. Creates a new invocation and runs it with the trigger's configured payload, message template, and retry settings. |
| **View Invocations** | See all past and pending executions for this trigger                                                                                                                           |
| **Edit**             | Update the trigger's name, schedule, template, payload, retry settings, or execution identity                                                                                  |
| **Duplicate**        | Create a new trigger pre-filled with the same configuration                                                                                                                    |
| **Delete**           | Permanently remove the trigger                                                                                                                                                 |

You can also toggle the **Enabled** switch directly in the table to pause or resume a trigger without deleting it.

## Monitor invocations

View invocations for a single trigger via **View Invocations** in the dropdown, or view all invocations across the project by clicking **All Invocations**.

Each invocation shows its status, scheduled time, start time, duration, attempt number, and a link to the conversation trace.

### Invocation actions

| Action     | Available when                        | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cancel** | `pending` or `running`                | Stop the invocation before it completes                                                           |
| **Rerun**  | `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled` | Re-execute with the same trigger configuration. Creates a new invocation and runs it immediately. |

## Cron expression reference

Cron triggers use standard 5-field syntax:

```
┌───────────── minute (0–59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0–23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1–31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1–12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0–7 or MON–SUN)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

**Common examples:**

| Expression        | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `0 9 * * *`       | Every day at 9:00 AM                 |
| `0 9 * * MON-FRI` | Weekdays at 9:00 AM                  |
| `*/15 * * * *`    | Every 15 minutes                     |
| `0 */2 * * *`     | Every 2 hours                        |
| `0 0 1 * *`       | First day of every month at midnight |
