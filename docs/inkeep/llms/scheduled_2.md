# Scheduled Triggers in TypeScript SDK (/typescript-sdk/triggers/scheduled)

Define scheduled triggers in the TypeScript SDK to run agents on a cron schedule or one-time execution



Scheduled triggers run agents on a time-based schedule using cron expressions or at a one-time future timestamp. See [Scheduled Triggers](/talk-to-your-agents/triggers/scheduled) for a full conceptual overview.

## Creating Scheduled Triggers

Use the `scheduledTrigger()` factory function to create both recurring and one-time scheduled triggers. The schema validation enforces that you specify either `cronExpression` or `runAt`, but not both.

```typescript
import { scheduledTrigger } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

// Recurring schedule with cron
const dailyReport = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "Daily Report",
  cronExpression: "0 9 * * MON-FRI",
  cronTimezone: "America/New_York",
  messageTemplate: "Generate the daily status report",
  payload: { reportType: "daily" },
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelaySeconds: 60,
  timeoutSeconds: 300,
});

// One-time schedule
const oneTimeTask = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "Migration Task",
  runAt: "2025-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  messageTemplate: "Run the migration",
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelaySeconds: 300,
  timeoutSeconds: 780,
});
```

## Configuration Options

| Option              | Type      | Required          | Default | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | `string`  | Yes               | —       | Human-readable name                                                       |
| `description`       | `string`  | No                | —       | Description of the trigger's purpose                                      |
| `enabled`           | `boolean` | No                | `true`  | Whether the trigger is active                                             |
| `cronExpression`    | `string`  | One of cron/runAt | —       | 5-field cron expression (`minute hour day month weekday`)                 |
| `cronTimezone`      | `string`  | No                | `UTC`   | IANA timezone for cron evaluation                                         |
| `runAt`             | `string`  | One of cron/runAt | —       | ISO 8601 timestamp for one-time execution                                 |
| `messageTemplate`   | `string`  | No                | —       | Template with `{{placeholder}}` syntax                                    |
| `payload`           | `object`  | No                | —       | Static JSON payload passed to the agent                                   |
| `maxRetries`        | `number`  | No                | `1`     | Max retry attempts on failure (0–10)                                      |
| `retryDelaySeconds` | `number`  | No                | `60`    | Seconds between retries (10–3600)                                         |
| `timeoutSeconds`    | `number`  | No                | `780`   | Execution timeout in seconds (30–780)                                     |
| `runAsUserId`       | `string`  | No                | —       | User ID whose identity and credentials are used during execution          |
| `createdBy`         | `string`  | —                 | —       | Read-only. User ID of the trigger creator, set automatically on creation. |

<Note>
  You must specify either `cronExpression` or `runAt`, but not both. The system validates this at creation time.
</Note>

## Overriding Configuration with `.with()`

Use the `.with()` method to create a variant of an existing scheduled trigger:

```typescript
const dailyReport = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "Daily Report",
  cronExpression: "0 9 * * *",
  messageTemplate: "Generate the daily report",
});

const disabledReport = dailyReport.with({ enabled: false });
const weekdayReport = dailyReport.with({
  name: "Weekday Report",
  cronExpression: "0 9 * * MON-FRI",
});
```

## User-Scoped Execution

Set `runAsUserId` to execute the trigger with a specific user's identity, enabling access to their connected credentials (e.g., per-user OAuth tokens for GitHub, Slack, or Jira):

```typescript
import { scheduledTrigger } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

const userScopedReport = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "My Daily Report",
  cronExpression: "0 9 * * MON-FRI",
  messageTemplate: "Generate my daily status report",
  runAsUserId: "user_abc123",
});
```

When `runAsUserId` is set, agents automatically use that user's profile timezone for time-aware responses. Note that `cronTimezone` is still used for schedule calculation.

See [Scheduled Triggers](/talk-to-your-agents/triggers/scheduled) for details on permissions, admin delegation, and runtime behavior.

## Complete Example

```typescript
import { agent, subAgent, scheduledTrigger } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

// Recurring schedule with cron
const dailySummary = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "Daily Summary",
  cronExpression: "0 9 * * MON-FRI",
  cronTimezone: "America/New_York",
  messageTemplate:
    "Generate a summary of yesterday's activity. Report type: {{reportType}}",
  payload: { reportType: "daily" },
  maxRetries: 3,
  retryDelaySeconds: 120,
  timeoutSeconds: 600,
});

const hourlyHealthCheck = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "Hourly Health Check",
  cronExpression: "0 * * * *",
  messageTemplate: "Run a health check on all connected services",
  maxRetries: 2,
  timeoutSeconds: 120,
});

// One-time schedule
const dataMigration = scheduledTrigger({
  name: "Q1 Data Migration",
  runAt: "2025-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  messageTemplate: "Migrate Q1 data to the new schema",
  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelaySeconds: 300,
  timeoutSeconds: 780,
});

const reportGenerator = subAgent({
  id: "report-generator",
  name: "Report Generator",
  prompt: "You generate reports and summaries based on system activity.",
});

export default agent({
  id: "automation-agent",
  name: "Automation Agent",
  defaultSubAgent: reportGenerator,
  scheduledTriggers: () => [
    dailySummary,
    hourlyHealthCheck,
    dataMigration,
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  Scheduled triggers are managed separately from webhook triggers via dedicated API endpoints. They are scoped to an agent and can be created, updated, enabled/disabled, and deleted through the API or Manage UI.

## Best Practices

1. **Set appropriate timeouts** - Ensure `timeoutSeconds` is long enough for the agent to complete
2. **Configure retries for critical tasks** - Use `maxRetries` for important scheduled jobs
3. **Monitor invocations** - Check the invocation history for failed runs
4. **Use one-time triggers for deferred work** - Prefer `runAt` over cron for tasks that should execute exactly once
