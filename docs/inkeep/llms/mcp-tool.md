# Slack MCP Tool (/talk-to-your-agents/slack/mcp-tool)

Give your agents the ability to post messages to Slack channels and DMs via the MCP protocol.



The Slack MCP tool lets your agents **post messages to Slack** — channels, threads, and DMs. Unlike the [Slack Work App](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/overview) (where users talk *to* agents in Slack), the MCP tool gives agents the ability to act *on* Slack as part of their workflows.

<Note>
  The Slack MCP tool requires an installed Slack workspace. Follow the [installation guide](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/installation) first if you haven't set up the Slack app yet.
</Note>

## Create a Slack MCP tool

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open MCP Servers

    Navigate to **MCP Servers** in the sidebar and click **New MCP server**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Select Slack from Work Apps

    Switch to the **Work Apps** tab and select the **Slack** card. If your organization has a Slack workspace installed, you'll see the channel configuration dialog.

    If no workspace is installed, the dialog prompts you to [install the Slack app](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/installation) first.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure channel access

    Choose how the agent can interact with Slack:

    | Setting                 | Description                                                                                                                                      |
    | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Channel access mode** | **All channels** — the agent can post to any channel where the bot is a member. **Selected channels** — restrict the agent to specific channels. |
    | **DM enabled**          | Whether the agent can send direct messages. Enabled by default.                                                                                  |
    | **Selected channels**   | When using "Selected channels" mode, pick from the list of channels where the Inkeep bot is a member.                                            |

    Channel access and DM access are independent — you can allow all channels but disable DMs, or allow selected channels and also enable DMs.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create

    Click **Create** to create the Slack MCP tool. It appears in your MCP servers list and can be added to any agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available tools

The Slack MCP server exposes the following tools:

### `post-channel-message`

Posts a message to a Slack channel.

### `post-direct-message`

Sends a direct message to a Slack user.

The agent knows how to send a DM to the user asking the question out of the box — no additional prompting or configuration is required.

### `get-slack-user`

Looks up a Slack user by their user ID, email address, or name. Provide exactly one parameter:

| Parameter | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id` | Slack user ID (e.g., `U1234567890`). Returns an exact match.                        |
| `email`   | Email address (e.g., `jane@company.com`). Returns an exact match.                   |
| `name`    | Display name, real name, or username to search for. Returns up to 5 ranked matches. |

When searching by name, the agent should clarify with the user if multiple results are returned.

## Edit channel access

To change channel access after creation:

1. Open the Slack MCP tool from the **MCP Servers** list
2. In the **Slack Channel Access** section, click **Configure**
3. Update the channel access mode, DM toggle, or selected channels
4. Click **Save Changes**

## Access control

The MCP tool enforces access rules at runtime:

* **Selected channels mode**: The agent can only post to channels in the allowed list. Attempts to post to other channels are rejected.
* **DM disabled**: The agent cannot post to DM channels (channel IDs starting with `D`). Enable the DM toggle to allow DMs.
* **All channels mode**: The agent can post to any channel where the bot is a member.

Access configuration is per-tool — different agents can have different Slack MCP tools with different channel restrictions.
