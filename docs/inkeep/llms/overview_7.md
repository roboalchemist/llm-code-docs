# Slack Work App (/talk-to-your-agents/slack/overview)

Connect your Inkeep agents to Slack.



The Slack Work App brings your Inkeep agents directly into Slack. Team members can talk to agents by mentioning `@Inkeep` or by using `/inkeep` commands.

<Note>
  The Slack integration is only available for [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav).
</Note>

## Key features

* **`@Inkeep` and `/inkeep`** — Mention `@Inkeep` or use `/inkeep` commands in a channel or your DMs to talk to an Inkeep agent.
* **Channel configuration** — Set a workspace-wide default agent, or assign specific agents to individual channels

## Which agent handles my request?

The app uses an **agent resolution priority** to decide which agent responds:

| Priority | Source                | Set by                   | Scope                                  |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Channel default**   | Admin, via the dashboard | Only that channel                      |
| 2        | **Workspace default** | Admin, via the dashboard | All channels without a channel default |

If no agent is configured at either level, the bot prompts you to ask an admin to set one up in the dashboard.

<Tip>
  Use `/inkeep status` in any channel to see which agent is active for that channel and how it was resolved.
