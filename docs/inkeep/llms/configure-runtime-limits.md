# Configure Runtime Limits (/typescript-sdk/configure-runtime-limits)

Customize execution limits, timeouts, and constraints for your deployment



## Overview

The Inkeep Agent Framework includes sensible defaults for execution limits, timeouts, and constraints. However, certain use cases—like long-running orchestration agents—may require different configurations.

<SkillRule id="runtime-limits-overview" skills="typescript-sdk" title="Runtime Limits Configuration" description="How to configure execution limits, timeouts, and constraints">
  ## How Runtime Configuration Works

  ### Two Types of Limits

  **1. API-Configurable Limits** (set per agent/sub-agent via manage-api)

  * Configured in your agent definitions using `stopWhen`
  * Controls agent-specific behavior
  * See [Agent Settings - StopWhen](/typescript-sdk/agent-settings#configuring-stopwhen)

  **2. Runtime Environment Limits** (set via environment variables)

  * System-wide defaults and maximum allowed values
  * Controls infrastructure-level constraints
  * Documented in this guide

  ### Configuration Hierarchy

  When an agent executes:

  1. Uses agent-specific `stopWhen` settings if configured
  2. Falls back to runtime environment defaults
  3. Cannot exceed runtime environment maximums

  ### Understanding the Constants Architecture

  The runtime environment limits are defined as TypeScript constants in the `@inkeep/agents-core` package. These constants are organized into two categories based on their purpose:

  **1. Schema Validation Constants** (`packages/agents-core/src/constants/schema-validation/defaults.ts`)

  * Define **API-level validation limits** (min, max, default values)
  * Control what values users can configure via the manage-api
  * Used in Zod schemas to validate agent configuration requests
  * Examples: Transfer count limits, generation step limits, prompt character limits

  **2. Runtime Execution Constants - Shared** (`packages/agents-core/src/constants/execution-limits-shared/defaults.ts`)

  * Define **internal runtime behavior** limits
  * Control infrastructure-level timeouts, retries, and constraints
  * Shared across both manage-api and run-api services
  * Examples: MCP connection timeouts, conversation history token limits

  **3. Runtime Execution Constants - Run-API** (`packages/agents-run-api/src/constants/execution-limits/defaults.ts`)

  * Define **run-api specific runtime behavior** limits
  * Control execution engine timeouts, retries, and resource constraints
  * Only used by the run-api service (not shared with manage-api)
  * Examples: LLM generation timeouts, function tool sandbox limits, streaming buffer sizes

  Each constant includes detailed inline documentation explaining its purpose, behavior, and impact on the runtime. **The TypeScript constant files are the source of truth** for default values and available overrides—not `.env.example`.

  All constants can be overridden via environment variables prefixed with `AGENTS_`. For example:

  ```bash
  # Override a schema validation constant
  AGENTS_AGENT_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50

  # Override a runtime execution constant
  AGENTS_MCP_TOOL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
  ```

  ## Use Case: Long-Running Orchestration Agents

  For agents that orchestrate complex workflows (like coding agents that run for hours), you'll want to increase various limits and timeouts.

  ### Recommended Configuration

  Add these to your `.env` file:

  ```bash
  # Agent Execution - Allow more sub-agent transfers for complex orchestration
  AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT=50  # Default: 10
  AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_MAX=2000    # Default: 1000

  # Sub-Agent Turns - Allow more LLM generation steps per turn
  AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_DEFAULT=30  # Default: 12
  AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_MAX=2000    # Default: 1000

  # LLM Timeouts - Increase for longer-running operations
  AGENTS_LLM_GENERATION_FIRST_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS_STREAMING=600000   # 10min, Default: 4.5min
  AGENTS_LLM_GENERATION_SUBSEQUENT_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS=180000        # 3min, Default: 1.5min

  # Function Tools - Allow longer execution for complex operations
  AGENTS_FUNCTION_TOOL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS_DEFAULT=120000  # 2min, Default: 30sec

  # MCP Tools - Increase timeout for external tool operations
  AGENTS_MCP_TOOL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_DEFAULT=180000  # 3min, Default: 1min

  # Session Management - Keep tool results cached longer
  AGENTS_SESSION_TOOL_RESULT_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000  # 30min, Default: 5min

  # Streaming - Allow streams to run longer
  AGENTS_STREAM_MAX_LIFETIME_MS=1800000  # 30min, Default: 10min
  ```

  <Note>
    `AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_DEFAULT` sets the default number of transfers allowed between sub-agents in a turn when no agent-specific limit is configured. `AGENTS_EXECUTION_TRANSFER_COUNT_MAX` sets the maximum number of transfers that can be configured via the manage-api for any agent.

    The same pattern applies to `AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_DEFAULT` and `AGENTS_SUB_AGENT_TURN_GENERATION_STEPS_MAX`.
  </Note>

  ### Why These Settings?

  * **Transfer Count**: Coding orchestration often involves many handoffs between specialist agents (planning → implementation → testing → refinement)
  * **Generation Steps**: Each coding operation may require multiple tool calls (read files, analyze, write code, run tests)
  * **Timeouts**: Code generation and analysis can take time, especially for large files or complex refactoring
  * **Cache Duration**: Keeps tool results available throughout long sessions for artifact processing

  ## All Available Configuration Variables

  All runtime configuration variables are defined as TypeScript constants. To explore available overrides and their detailed documentation:

  1. **View the constant files** (source of truth):
     * Schema validation constants: `packages/agents-core/src/constants/schema-validation/defaults.ts`
     * Runtime execution constants (shared): `packages/agents-core/src/constants/execution-limits-shared/defaults.ts`
     * Runtime execution constants (run-api): `packages/agents-run-api/src/constants/execution-limits/defaults.ts`
  2. Each constant includes inline documentation explaining its purpose, behavior, and impact
  3. Convert constant names to environment variables by prefixing with `AGENTS_`

  ### Configuration Categories

  The runtime configuration is organized into functional categories:

  **Schema Validation Constants** (API-level limits):

  * **Agent Execution Transfer Count**: Limits transfers between sub-agents in a turn
  * **Sub-Agent Turn Generation Steps**: LLM generation steps within a single sub-agent activation
  * **Status Update Thresholds**: Event and time-based triggers for status updates
  * **Prompt Validation**: Character limits for agent and sub-agent system prompts
  * **Context Fetchers**: HTTP timeouts for external data fetching (CRM lookups, API calls)

  **Runtime Execution Constants - Shared** (infrastructure-level limits):

  * **MCP Tool Connection & Retry**: Connection timeouts and exponential backoff for MCP tools
  * **Conversation History**: Token limits for conversation context windows

  **Runtime Execution Constants - Run-API** (run-api service-specific limits):

  * **LLM Generation Timeouts**: Timeout behavior for AI model calls
  * **Function Tool Sandbox**: Execution limits for function tools in isolated sandboxes
  * **Delegation & A2A**: Inter-agent communication settings
  * **Artifact Processing**: UI component generation with retry mechanisms
  * **Session Management**: Tool result caching and cleanup
  * **Streaming**: Frequency, batching, and lifetime limits for streams
