Title: Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others - FastAPI

URL Source: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/

Markdown Content:
By default, **FastAPI** will return JSON responses.

You can override it by returning a `Response` directly as seen in [Return a Response directly](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/).

But if you return a `Response` directly (or any subclass, like `JSONResponse`), the data won't be automatically converted (even if you declare a `response_model`), and the documentation won't be automatically generated (for example, including the specific "media type", in the HTTP header `Content-Type` as part of the generated OpenAPI).

But you can also declare the `Response` that you want to be used (e.g. any `Response` subclass), in the _path operation decorator_ using the `response_class` parameter.

The contents that you return from your _path operation function_ will be put inside of that `Response`.

Note

If you use a response class with no media type, FastAPI will expect your response to have no content, so it will not document the response format in its generated OpenAPI docs.

JSON Responses[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#json-responses)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default FastAPI returns JSON responses.

If you declare a [Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/) FastAPI will use it to serialize the data to JSON, using Pydantic.

If you don't declare a response model, FastAPI will use the `jsonable_encoder` explained in [JSON Compatible Encoder](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/encoder/) and put it in a `JSONResponse`.

If you declare a `response_class` with a JSON media type (`application/json`), like is the case with the `JSONResponse`, the data you return will be automatically converted (and filtered) with any Pydantic `response_model` that you declared in the _path operation decorator_. But the data won't be serialized to JSON bytes with Pydantic, instead it will be converted with the `jsonable_encoder` and then passed to the `JSONResponse` class, which will serialize it to bytes using the standard JSON library in Python.

### JSON Performance[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#json-performance)

In short, if you want the maximum performance, use a [Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/) and don't declare a `response_class` in the _path operation decorator_.

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: list[str] = []

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item) -> Item:
    return item

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items() -> list[Item]:
    return [
        Item(name="Portal Gun", price=42.0),
        Item(name="Plumbus", price=32.0),
    ]
```

HTML Response[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#html-response)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To return a response with HTML directly from **FastAPI**, use `HTMLResponse`.

*   Import `HTMLResponse`.
*   Pass `HTMLResponse` as the parameter `response_class` of your _path operation decorator_.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def read_items():
    return """
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Some HTML in here</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Look ma! HTML!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
```

Info

The parameter `response_class` will also be used to define the "media type" of the response.

In this case, the HTTP header `Content-Type` will be set to `text/html`.

And it will be documented as such in OpenAPI.

### Return a `Response`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#return-a-response)

As seen in [Return a Response directly](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/), you can also override the response directly in your _path operation_, by returning it.

The same example from above, returning an `HTMLResponse`, could look like:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    html_content = """
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Some HTML in here</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Look ma! HTML!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    return HTMLResponse(content=html_content, status_code=200)
```

Warning

A `Response` returned directly by your _path operation function_ won't be documented in OpenAPI (for example, the `Content-Type` won't be documented) and won't be visible in the automatic interactive docs.

Info

Of course, the actual `Content-Type` header, status code, etc, will come from the `Response` object you returned.

### Document in OpenAPI and override `Response`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#document-in-openapi-and-override-response)

If you want to override the response from inside of the function but at the same time document the "media type" in OpenAPI, you can use the `response_class` parameter AND return a `Response` object.

The `response_class` will then be used only to document the OpenAPI _path operation_, but your `Response` will be used as is.

#### Return an `HTMLResponse` directly[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#return-an-htmlresponse-directly)

For example, it could be something like:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

def generate_html_response():
    html_content = """
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Some HTML in here</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Look ma! HTML!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    return HTMLResponse(content=html_content, status_code=200)

@app.get("/items/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def read_items():
    return generate_html_response()
```

In this example, the function `generate_html_response()` already generates and returns a `Response` instead of returning the HTML in a `str`.

By returning the result of calling `generate_html_response()`, you are already returning a `Response` that will override the default **FastAPI** behavior.

But as you passed the `HTMLResponse` in the `response_class` too, **FastAPI** will know how to document it in OpenAPI and the interactive docs as HTML with `text/html`:

Available responses[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#available-responses)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the available responses.

Keep in mind that you can use `Response` to return anything else, or even create a custom sub-class.

Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

### `Response`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#response)

The main `Response` class, all the other responses inherit from it.

You can return it directly.

It accepts the following parameters:

*   `content` - A `str` or `bytes`.
*   `status_code` - An `int` HTTP status code.
*   `headers` - A `dict` of strings.
*   `media_type` - A `str` giving the media type. E.g. `"text/html"`.

FastAPI (actually Starlette) will automatically include a Content-Length header. It will also include a Content-Type header, based on the `media_type` and appending a charset for text types.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/legacy/")
def get_legacy_data():
    data = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
    <shampoo>
    <Header>
        Apply shampoo here.
    </Header>
    <Body>
        You'll have to use soap here.
    </Body>
    </shampoo>
    """
    return Response(content=data, media_type="application/xml")
```

### `HTMLResponse`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#htmlresponse)

Takes some text or bytes and returns an HTML response, as you read above.

### `PlainTextResponse`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#plaintextresponse)

Takes some text or bytes and returns a plain text response.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/", response_class=PlainTextResponse)
async def main():
    return "Hello World"
```

### `JSONResponse`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#jsonresponse)

Takes some data and returns an `application/json` encoded response.

This is the default response used in **FastAPI**, as you read above.

Technical Details

But if you declare a response model or return type, that will be used directly to serialize the data to JSON, and a response with the right media type for JSON will be returned directly, without using the `JSONResponse` class.

This is the ideal way to get the best performance.

### `RedirectResponse`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse)

Returns an HTTP redirect. Uses a 307 status code (Temporary Redirect) by default.

You can return a `RedirectResponse` directly:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/typer")
async def redirect_typer():
    return RedirectResponse("https://typer.tiangolo.com")
```

* * *

Or you can use it in the `response_class` parameter:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/fastapi", response_class=RedirectResponse)
async def redirect_fastapi():
    return "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com"
```

If you do that, then you can return the URL directly from your _path operation_ function.

In this case, the `status_code` used will be the default one for the `RedirectResponse`, which is `307`.

* * *

You can also use the `status_code` parameter combined with the `response_class` parameter:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/pydantic", response_class=RedirectResponse, status_code=302)
async def redirect_pydantic():
    return "https://docs.pydantic.dev/"
```

### `StreamingResponse`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#streamingresponse)

Takes an async generator or a normal generator/iterator (a function with `yield`) and streams the response body.

```
import anyio
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

app = FastAPI()

async def fake_video_streamer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield b"some fake video bytes"
        await anyio.sleep(0)

@app.get("/")
async def main():
    return StreamingResponse(fake_video_streamer())
```

Technical Details

An `async` task can only be cancelled when it reaches an `await`. If there is no `await`, the generator (function with `yield`) can not be cancelled properly and may keep running even after cancellation is requested.

Since this small example does not need any `await` statements, we add an `await anyio.sleep(0)` to give the event loop a chance to handle cancellation.

This would be even more important with large or infinite streams.

Tip

Instead of returning a `StreamingResponse` directly, you should probably follow the style in [Stream Data](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/stream-data/), it's much more convenient and handles cancellation behind the scenes for you.

If you are streaming JSON Lines, follow the [Stream JSON Lines](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/stream-json-lines/) tutorial.

### `FileResponse`[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#fileresponse)

Asynchronously streams a file as the response.

Takes a different set of arguments to instantiate than the other response types:

*   `path` - The file path to the file to stream.
*   `headers` - Any custom headers to include, as a dictionary.
*   `media_type` - A string giving the media type. If unset, the filename or path will be used to infer a media type.
*   `filename` - If set, this will be included in the response `Content-Disposition`.

File responses will include appropriate `Content-Length`, `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

some_file_path = "large-video-file.mp4"
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def main():
    return FileResponse(some_file_path)
```

You can also use the `response_class` parameter:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

some_file_path = "large-video-file.mp4"
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/", response_class=FileResponse)
async def main():
    return some_file_path
```

In this case, you can return the file path directly from your _path operation_ function.

Custom response class[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#custom-response-class)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create your own custom response class, inheriting from `Response` and using it.

For example, let's say that you want to use [`orjson`](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) with some settings.

Let's say you want it to return indented and formatted JSON, so you want to use the orjson option `orjson.OPT_INDENT_2`.

You could create a `CustomORJSONResponse`. The main thing you have to do is create a `Response.render(content)` method that returns the content as `bytes`:

```
from typing import Any

import orjson
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()

class CustomORJSONResponse(Response):
    media_type = "application/json"

    def render(self, content: Any) -> bytes:
        assert orjson is not None, "orjson must be installed"
        return orjson.dumps(content, option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2)

@app.get("/", response_class=CustomORJSONResponse)
async def main():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

Now instead of returning:

```
{"message": "Hello World"}
```

...this response will return:

```
{
  "message": "Hello World"
}
```

Of course, you will probably find much better ways to take advantage of this than formatting JSON. 😉

### `orjson` or Response Model[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#orjson-or-response-model)

If what you are looking for is performance, you are probably better off using a [Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/) than an `orjson` response.

With a response model, FastAPI will use Pydantic to serialize the data to JSON, without using intermediate steps, like converting it with `jsonable_encoder`, which would happen in any other case.

And under the hood, Pydantic uses the same underlying Rust mechanisms as `orjson` to serialize to JSON, so you will already get the best performance with a response model.

Default response class[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#default-response-class)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When creating a **FastAPI** class instance or an `APIRouter` you can specify which response class to use by default.

The parameter that defines this is `default_response_class`.

In the example below, **FastAPI** will use `HTMLResponse` by default, in all _path operations_, instead of JSON.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI(default_response_class=HTMLResponse)

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return "<h1>Items</h1><p>This is a list of items.</p>"
```

Tip

You can still override `response_class` in _path operations_ as before.

Additional documentation[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#additional-documentation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also declare the media type and many other details in OpenAPI using `responses`: [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/additional-responses/).
