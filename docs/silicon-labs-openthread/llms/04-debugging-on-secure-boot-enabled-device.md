# Debugging on Secure Boot Enabled Device

Assume a correctly signed GBL image has been programmed to the device. Follow the procedures in [Generate an Unsigned Ap- plication Image](03-examples#generate-an-unsigned-application-image) to generate an unsigned application image for the GBL.

The Windows environment variable PATH should include the folder (`C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\adapter_packs\commander`) that locates the `commander.exe` of Simplicity Commander.

The following sections describe how to debug an application firmware with Simplicity IDE, or IAR on a Secure Boot enabled device.

## Simplicity IDE

This application note uses Simplicity Studio v5.2.3.1. The procedures and pictures may be different for the other versions of Simplicity Studio 5.

1. The Simplicity IDE creates a folder below (`<NAME>` is the Windows User Name on PC) in Windows when building the unsigned application image.  
   `C:\Users\<NAME>\SimplicityStudio\v5_workspace\blink_baremetal\GNU ARM v10.2.1 - Default`
2. Follow the procedures in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](03-examples#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](03-examples#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to create a batch file (Windows) to sign the unsigned application image and then flash it to the device. This application note uses ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot (Using Simplicity Commander) as an example to create a `secure_boot_debug.bat` file below.  
   ```sh  
   commander convert blink_baremetal.s37 --secureboot --keyfile sign_key.pem --verify sign_pubkey.pem  
   --outfile blink_baremetal.s37  
   commander flash blink_baremetal.s37  
   ```
3. Copy the batch file in step 2 and files (`sign_key.pem` and `sign_pubkey.pem` in this example) specified in `secure_boot_debug.bat` to the folder in step 1.
4. Right-click the project in the **Project Explorer** window, and then click **Properties** to open the properties dialog.

5. Select **C/C++ Build > Settings > Build Steps**. Enter the phrase below to the **Command:** box under the **Post-build steps** (enter text to **Description:** box is optional) to run the batch file as a post-build action. Click [**Apply and Close**] to exit.  
   ```sh  
   cmd //c 'secure_boot_debug.bat'  
   ```  
   ![Properties dialog box](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image63.jpg)
6. After building the project, the batch file in the **Post-build steps** overwrites the unsigned application image with the signed application image.  
   ![Overwriting in Post-build steps](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image64.jpg)  
   > **Note**: If the project is already up-to-date, it will not invoke the **Post-build steps** in step 5 to run the batch file. Use a dummy edit (add space or newline) on one of the source files in the project to trigger the build action.  
   ![Console window](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image65.jpg)  
   The application starts to run if no error in step 6.
7. Select the project in the **Project Explorer** window, click **Run→Attach to→1 Silicon Labs ARM Program** to attach to the running target for debugging on the signed application image.  
   ![Run window](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image66.jpg)

## IAR

This section uses Simplicity Studio v5.4.2.0 and IAR v9.20.4. The procedures and pictures may be different for the other versions of Simplicity Studio 5 and IAR.

1. The **Overview** tab shows the **Target and Tool Settings** card on the left side. Scroll down if necessary and click [**Change Target/SDK/Generators**].  
   ![Overview tab in SCLP file](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image67.jpg)
2. Drop down the **CHANGE PROJECT GENERATORS** list and select **IAR Embedded Workbench Project**. Click [**Save**] to generate an IAR project.  
   ![Target and tool settings dialog box](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image68.png)
3. Double click the IAR workspace file (`blink_baremetal.eww`) in the **Project Explorer** window to open the IAR project. The IAR creates a folder below (`<NAME>` is the Windows User Name on PC) in Windows to store the compiled image.  
   `C:\Users\<NAME>\SimplicityStudio\v5_workspace\blink_baremetal\ewarm-iar\exe`  
   ![Project Explorer window](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image69.png)
4. Follow the procedures in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](03-examples#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](03-examples#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to create a batch file (Windows) to sign the unsigned application image. This application note uses ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot (Using Simplicity Commander) as an example to create a `secure_boot_debug.bat` file below.  
   ```sh  
   cd C:\Users\<NAME>\SimplicityStudio\v5_workspace\blink_baremetal\ewarm-iar\exe  
   commander convert blink_baremetal.s37 --secureboot --keyfile sign_key.pem --verify sign_pubkey.pem  
   --outfile blink_baremetal.s37  
   ```
5. Copy the batch file in step 4 and files (`sign_key.pem` and `sign_pubkey.pem` in this example) specified in `secure_boot_debug.bat` to the folder in step 3.
6. Right-click the project in the workspace, and then click **Options...**.  
   ![Workspace window](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image70.jpg)  
   > **Note**: For GSDK v3.2 and lower, the `app_properties.c` is manually added to the IAR project.
7. Click **Build Actions** to open the **Build Actions Configuration** dialog box. Enter the phrase below to the **Post-build command line:** box to run the batch file as a post-build action. Click [**OK**] to exit.  
   ```sh  
   cmd /c "$PROJ_DIR$\ewarm-iar\exe\secure_boot_debug.bat > $PROJ_DIR$\log.txt 2>&1"  
   ```
8. After building the project, the batch file in the **Post-build command** overwrites the unsigned application image with the signed application image.  
   ![Build messages](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image72.png)  
   > **Note**: If the project is already up-to-date, it will not invoke the **Post-build command** in step 7 to run the batch file. Use a dummy edit (add space or newline) on one of the source files in the project to trigger the build action.  
   ![Build messages](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image73.png)
9. The `> $PROJ_DIR$\log.txt 2>&1` redirects the batch file output to the `log.txt` file in the IAR project folder.  
   ![Log.txt file](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image74.jpg)
10. If no error in step 8, click the ![start](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image75.jpg) icon to start debugging on the signed application image.
