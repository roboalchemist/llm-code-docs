# Multiprotocol Fundamentals

> **Note: This section replaces _UG103.16: Multiprotocol Fundamentals_. Further updates to this user guide will be provided here**.

Multiprotocol is a way to use more than one protocol on a single chip. Implementing more than one protocol on a single device can improve:

- Cost savings: A single device can perform more than one function.
- Space savings: End user product packaging can be smaller and simpler when protocols can share a single radio.
- Energy savings: The number of devices on a network is reduced.

The following pages describe:

- Different ways to implement multiprotocol devices and the infrastructure requirements for an effective implementation.
- Aspects of protocol operation to be considered when selecting a protocol for a multiprotocol implementation.
- The operation of the Silicon Labs Radio Scheduler, an essential component of a dynamic multiprotocol implementation.

These pages describe the use of multiprotocol on a single chip. For more information about coordinating multiple radio chips, like one from Silicon Labs and an external Wi-Fi radio, see [Wi-Fi Coexistence Fundamentals](https://docs.silabs.com/multiprotocol/latest/multiprotocol-wifi-coexistence-fundamentals/).
