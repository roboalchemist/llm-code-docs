# Secure Identification on HSE-SVH Devices

The goal of secure identification is to prove the ownership of a device's unique public key to an external service. It enables the external service to identify the device as legitimate and to authenticate device-generated data or messages.

## Chain of Trust

The chain of trust on HSE-SVH devices is illustrated in the following figure.

![Chain of Trust](/authenticating-devices-using-device-certificates/0.2/images/sld790-chain-of-trust.png)

- Silicon Labs is a Certificate Authority (CA).
- The root certificate and factory certificate are stored in the Silicon Labs Server.
- The factory certificate is static per factory.
- The batch certificate and device certificate are stored on the device.
- The batch certificate is rolled per production batch.
- The device certificate is a unique cryptographic identity.
- All certificates are X.509 standard format.  
  - TLS-compliant: Standard endpoint authentication methods are used in internet communications  
  - Signature algorithm: ECDSA-prime256v1 with SHA256
- Each certificate in the chain is signed by the certificate above it ([Signing and Verification figure](#signing-and-verification)).

> **Note**: A certificate can be revoked if needed, for instance if security issues arise. The certificate revocation lists are stored in the Silicon Labs Server.

## Device Certificate

The device certificate example is described in the following figure.

![Device Certificate Example](/authenticating-devices-using-device-certificates/0.2/images/sld790-device-certificate-example.png)

- The device certificate is in X.509 DER format (~0.5 kB).
- The device certificate is stored in HSE one-time programmable memory (OTP). It cannot be modified once programmed.
- The batch number (`Issuer: CN = Batch` field) identifies the factory and batch in which the device was produced.
- The validity period is 100 years from device manufacture date.
- The device 64-bit hard-coded unique ID (EUI) is encoded in the `Subject: CN` field, which blinds this certificate to the device.
- The device-specific public key is embedded in the device certificate and the corresponding private key is securely stored in the Secure Key Storage on the chip.
- The Issuer's private key is used to sign the hash of the certificate data to create a device certificate signature.

## Signing and Verification

Signing and verification for certificates on HSE-SVH devices are described in the following figures.
