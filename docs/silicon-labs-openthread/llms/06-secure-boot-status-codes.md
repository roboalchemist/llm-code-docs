# Secure Boot Status Codes

Boot status codes can be used to know the status of the boot mechanism. The `security status` command can be used to get the boot status.

```sh
commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205
```

```sh
SE Firmware version : 1.2.9
Serial number : 000000000000000014b457fffe045afd
Debug lock : Disabled
Device erase : Enabled
Secure debug unlock : Disabled
Tamper status : OK
Secure boot : Enabled
Boot status : 0x20 - OK
DONE
```

The following table shows Status codes in Secure Boot mechanism and their description:
