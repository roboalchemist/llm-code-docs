# Upgrade Existing Application to TrustZone

The main concerns when upgrading existing deployment to the TrustZone solution are:

- The [Secure/Non-secure pair for the bootloader](05-r-implementation) (24 kB) does not fit inside the current allotted bootloader space (16 kB).
- The [Secure/Non-secure pair for the application](07-r-ex) does not fit inside the current allotted application space.
- The [PSA ITS](05-r-implementation) moves from a non-encrypted to an encrypted format, so the existing stored cryptographic keys in NVM3 cannot be reused after upgrading the current application to TrustZone.

The [Secure Library](05-r-implementation) is based on PSA Crypto, so the existing application cannot integrate with the TrustZone if one of the following conditions is valid.

- Use [SE Manager APIs](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/service/api/group-sl-se-manager) for cryptographic and attestation operations.
- Use classic Mbed TLS APIs for cryptographic operations (except for X.509 certificate) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

## Peripheral Addresses in Device Header Files

The device header files (e.g., efr32mg21b020f1024im32.h) need to be configurable for different situations. The `SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` and `SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` definitions specify whether the compilation is for Secure or Non-secure applications. The `SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` and `SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` should be exclusive. If none of the definitions are true, the state should be similar to the Non-secure configuration, but the [startup code](#startup-code) (`SystemInit()` in system_*.c) will be responsible for reconfiguring the system.

        <tr>
            <th>Define (Software Component)</th>
            <th>Default Peripheral Pointer</th>

When building a Secure application (`SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` is true), all peripherals shall have their non-suffixed default address pointing to the Secure location of the peripheral (e.g., EMU). But the definitions in sl_trustzone_secure_config.h can force the addresses of specific peripherals pointing to the Non-secure location.

```C

#ifndef SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE_CONFIG_H
#define SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE_CONFIG_H
// Specify security configuration of peripherals. Peripherals that are not
// included here will automatically have their _BASE addresses point to their
// secure address. This might not be true, since most peripherals are configured
// to be non-secure -- but it's also not a problem if the peripheral is not
// accessed from the S app.
// Used in multiple places.
#define SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_CMU_S (0)
// Used by SE Manager service.
#define SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_AHBRADIO_S (0)
// Used by MSC service.
#define SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_LDMA_S (1)
// Used by MSC service.
#define SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_LDMAXBAR_S (1)
#endif // SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE_CONFIG_H

```

```C

#if defined(SL_CATALOG_TRUSTZONE_SECURE_CONFIG_PRESENT)
#include "sl_trustzone_secure_config.h"
#endif
#if ((defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE) && !defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_EMU_S))
    || (defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_EMU_S) && (SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_EMU_S != 0)))
#define EMU_BASE               (EMU_S_BASE)                  /* EMU base address */
#else

```

In other cases (`SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` is true or both `SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` and `SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` are false), all peripherals shall have their non-suffixed default address pointing to the Non-secure location of the peripheral (e.g., EMU).

```C

#define EMU_BASE               (EMU_NS_BASE)                 /* EMU base address */

```

> **Note**: Do not install the **TrustZone Secure** or **TrustZone Non-Secure** software component to the [TrustZone-unaware](#startup-code) application.

## Startup Code

The startup code moves peripherals from Secure to Non-secure to support the [default peripheral locations](#peripheral-addresses-in-device-header-files). In a TrustZone-aware application (either `SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` or `SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` is true), this is the application's responsibility (skip lines 168 to 194 in `SystemInit()`) and is done in the [Secure firmware](02-r-basic) of the system.

For the TrustZone-unaware application (both `SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` and `SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` are false), the `SystemInit()` in system_*.c (e.g., system_efr32mg21.c) moves peripherals to the Non-secure location.

- The `SystemInit()` sets the accesses of all peripherals to Non-secure except for the [SMU](03-r-bls) and HSE SEMAILBOX (lines 172 to 178).
- The `SystemInit()` sets the SAU in [All Non-secure](03-r-bls) configuration (lines 180 to 187).  
  - It ensures Non-secure access to Non-secure peripherals.  
  - The device component files (e.g., `efr32mg21b020f1024im32.slcc`) enable the [CMSE](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ecm0359818/latest) compiler option (`-mcmse` for GCC and `--cmse` for IAR) to pass the condition in line 181 to program the SAU.  
  - To catch the missing CMSE compiler option, it will generate a preprocessor error (line 186) if the CMSE flag is not set when manually upgrading a project from GSDK v4.0.x to ≥v4.1.x for the TrustZone-unaware application.
- The `SystemInit()` does not program the [ESAU](03-r-bls) (default Secure flash is 32 MB), so the whole program is run in the **Secure** state.
- The `SystemInit()` also enables the [`BMPUSEC`](03-r-bls) and [`PPUSEC`](03-r-bls) interrupts in the SMU (lines 189 to 193). It ensures the TrustZone-unaware application catches any violations of Bus Master and peripheral security access permissions.

![system_init](/series2-trustzone/0.2/images/sld717-system-init.png)

The `SMU_BASE` and HSE `SEMAILBOX_HOST_BASE` in device header files must point to the Secure location regardless of the `SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` and `SL_TRUSTZONE_NONSECURE` settings to avoid security violations on peripherals in the TrustZone-unaware application (SMU and HSE SEMAILBOX are set to Secure peripherals).

```C

#if ((defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE) && !defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_SMU_S))
    || (defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_SMU_S) && (SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_SMU_S != 0)))
#define SMU_BASE               (SMU_S_BASE)                  /* SMU base address */
#else
#define SMU_BASE               (SMU_S_BASE)                  /* SMU base address */

```

```C

#if ((defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_SECURE) && !defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_SEMAILBOX_HOST_S))
    || (defined(SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_SEMAILBOX_HOST_S) && (SL_TRUSTZONE_PERIPHERAL_SEMAILBOX_HOST_S != 0)))
#define SEMAILBOX_HOST_BASE    (SEMAILBOX_S_HOST_BASE)       /* SEMAILBOX_HOST base address */
#else
#define SEMAILBOX_HOST_BASE    (SEMAILBOX_S_HOST_BASE)       /* SEMAILBOX_HOST base address */

```

![linker_file](/series2-trustzone/0.2/images/sld717-linker-file.png)

The [ESAU](03-r-bls) sets the flash and RAM start address, so these addresses should be alignment at **4 kB** (0x1000). The Secure project linker file needs to have a section for [NSC](02-r-basic) (Secure Gateway) at the end of the Secure flash section. The [SAU](03-r-bls) sets the start address of the NSC section, so this section only needs to be **32 bytes** aligned.

- GCC NSC: The `.gnu.sgstubs` region in the Secure application map file (.map)
- IAR NSC: The `Veneer$$CMSE` region in the Secure application map file (.map)

The Secure and Non-secure flash and RAM sizes are incremented or decremented in **4 kB**. The memory configurations in Secure and Non-secure applications are correlated, so the flash and RAM settings are in pairs.

![mem_config](/series2-trustzone/0.2/images/sld717-mem-config.png)

> **Note**: Users should not directly edit the `template_contribution` in the `slcp` file, but rather use the [Memory Editor](07-r-ex) in Simplicity Studio to update the memory configuration.

## Debugger

Simplicity Studio supports two [debuggers](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-testing-and-debugging/using-the-debugger):

- GNU Debugger (GDB) client and SEGGER's GDB server
- Simplicity Studio Debugger

The [TrustZone-unaware](#startup-code) and [TrustZone-aware](05-r-implementation) applications enable the [`PPUSEC`](03-r-bls) interrupts in the SMU. The debugger will trigger the `SMU_SECURE_IRQHandler` if the **[Registers]** or **[Peripherals]** view feature violates peripheral security access permission.

### Simplicity Studio Debugger

The **[Registers]** view of Simplicity Studio Debugger can only access the Secure location of a peripheral. The following figure demonstrates the `Default_Handler` (`SMU_SECURE_IRQHandler` not defined) is triggered (`PPUSEC` in `SMU->IF` = 1) when viewing the registers of GPIO peripheral (`PPUFSPERIPHID` = 13) that is set to Non-secure access in the SMU.

The debugger can access the registers of the SMU since this peripheral is set to Secure access in the SMU.

This limitation does not apply to **GSDK < v4.1.0** since no peripherals are configured for Non-secure access.

![ppusec_fault](/series2-trustzone/0.2/images/sld717-ppusec-fault.png)

The Simplicity Studio Debugger is not the preferred choice for TrustZone debugging since it has limitations on viewing Non-secure access peripherals.

### GNU Debugger (GDB)

The **[Peripherals]** view of GNU Debugger can access either the Secure or Non-secure location of the peripheral to avoid conflicts on security access permission. The following figure shows the registers of GPIO on Secure (`GPIO` at `0x4003C000`) and Non-secure (`GPIO_NS` at `0x5003C000`) addresses. The GPIO peripheral is set to Non-secure access in the SMU, so the registers in the Secure address are displayed as zero.

![register-view](/series2-trustzone/0.2/images/sld717-register-view.png)

The GNU Debugger is the preferred choice for TrustZone debugging and is the default debugger for Simplicity Studio ≥ v5.5.0.0.
