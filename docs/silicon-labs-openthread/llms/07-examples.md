### Secure Debug Lock Using Commander Tool

1. Run the `security status` command to get the selected device configuration.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ---------------------------------------------------------------  
   SE ROM version          : 5.3  
   SE Firmware version     : 3.3.2  
   Serial number           : 0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591  
   Debug lock              : Disabled  
   Device erase            : Enabled  
   Secure debug unlock     : Disabled  
   Tamper status           : OK  
   Secure boot             : Disabled  
   Boot status             : 0x20 - OK  
   Command key installed   : False  
   Sign key installed      : False  
   Security state          : Production  
   DONE  
   ```
2. Run `util genkey` to generate commander private/public key pair.  
   ```sh  
   commander util genkey --type ecc-p256 --privkey command_key.pem --pubkey command_pubkey.pem  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Generating ECC P256 key pair...  
   Writing private key file in PEM format to command_key.pem  
   Writing public key file in PEM format to command_pubkey.pem  
   DONE  
   ```
3. Run the `security writekey` command to provision the Public Command Key (e.g., `command_pubkey.pem`).  
   ```sh  
   commander security writekey --command command_pubkey.pem --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Device has serial number 0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591  
     
   ================================================================================  
   Please look through any warnings before proceeding.  
   THIS IS A ONE-TIME command which permanently ties debug and tamper access to certificates signed by this key.  
   Type 'continue' and hit enter to proceed or Ctrl-C to abort:  
   ================================================================================  
   continue  
   Command public key stored in: C:/Users/<userName>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/ device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591/command_pubkey.pem  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: The Public Command Key cannot be changed once written.
4. This step is optional. To verify the public command key written into the device's SE OTP, run the `security readkey` command.  
   ```sh  
   commander security readkey --command --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   50DF50A09242A49F53251xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxE6E81C6  
   B3B891B1B9DBFC3D5F2D0yyyyy435DA6E8AFAF60037DA21AD7B2E1  
   DONE  
   ```
5. Run the `security lockconfig` command to enable the secure debug.  
   ```sh  
   commander security lockconfig --secure-debug-unlock enable --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Secure debug unlock was enabled  
   DONE  
   ```
6. a. For the **TrustZone-unaware** application, run the `security lock` command to lock the selected device.  
   ```sh  
   commander security lock --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Device is now locked.  
   DONE  
   ```  
   b. For the **TrustZone-aware** application, run the `security lock --trustzone ####` command to set the [debug options](05-debug-unlock#trustzone-debug-authentication) (e.g., `1100`) and lock the selected device. The bit order of #### is SPNIDLOCK (MSB), SPIDLOCK, NIDLOCK, and DBGLOCK (LSB).  
   ```sh  
   commander security lock --trustzone 1100 --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Writing debug restriction bits:  
   DBGLOCK:	0  
   NIDLOCK:	0  
   SPIDLOCK:   1  
   SPNIDLOCK:  1  
   Device is now locked.  
   DONE  
   ```  
   **Notes**:  
   - The `--trustzone` option for the `security lock` command requires Simplicity Commander **≥ v1.13.3**.  
   - It is strongly recommended to upgrade to SE firmware **≥ v1.2.14** (xG21 and xG22) or **≥ v2.2.1** (other Series 2 devices). For Series 3 devices, it is strongly recommended to upgrade SE firmware to ≥ v3.3.2 so that the debug options cannot be modified after the device is locked.  
   - Use `commander security lock` without the `--trustzone ####` option if the default setting of debug options (`0000`) is good enough for a TrustZone-aware application.
7. Run the `security disabledeviceerase` command to disable device erase. This is an **IRREVERSIBLE** action, and should be the last step in production. (**It is recommended not to set this option while evaluating secure debug functionality.**)  
   ```sh  
   commander security disabledeviceerase --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   ================================================================================  
   THIS IS A ONE-TIME command which Permanently disables device erase.  
   If secure debug lock has not been set, there is no way to regain debug access to this device. Type 'continue' and hit enter to proceed or Ctrl-C to abort:  
   ================================================================================  
   continue  
   Disabled device erase successfully  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: The debug options cannot be reset to the default value 0000 (unlock) if the device erase option is disabled.
8. Read back device status after it is securely locked.  
   a. For the TrustZone-unaware application, run the security status command to check the debug lock status of the device  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE ROM version        : 5.3  
   SE Firmware version   : 3.3.2  
   Serial number         : 0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591

   Command key installed : True  
   Sign key installed    : False  
   Security state        : Production  
   DONE  
   ```  
   b. For the TrustZone-aware application, run the `security status --trustzone` command to check the full debug lock status of the device.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --trustzone --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE ROM version          : 5.3

   DONE  
   ```

### Secure Debug Unlock Using Commander tool

Use case for secure debug unlock is explained in [secure debug unlock](05-debug-unlock#secure-debug-lockunlock-flow) as pictorially. The steps to securely unlock the device securely are explained below.

1. The Product Company creates a Private/Public Certificate Key pair for each device. Because the key pair is assigned only to a single device, the company may not need to protect the Private Certificate Key as securely as the Private Command Key by the Direct Customer.  
   In this example, the Private/Public Certificate Key pair (`cert_key.pem` and `cert_pubkey.pem`) is generated by running the `util genkey` command.  
   ```sh  
   commander util genkey --type ecc-p256 --privkey cert_key.pem --pubkey cert_pubkey.pem  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Generating ECC P256 key pair...  
   Writing private key file in PEM format to cert_key.pem  
   Writing public key file in PEM format to cert_pubkey.pem  
   DONE  
   ```
2. The Public Certificate Key (`cert_pubkey.pem`) for each device is passed to the Silicon Labs Direct Customer. The part number and serial number are also required if Direct Customer cannot access the device.If necessary, run the `security status` command to get the device serial number.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE ROM version	        : 5.3  
   SE Firmware version	    : 3.3.2  
   Serial number	        : 0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591  
   Debug lock	            : Enabled  
   Device erase	        : Enabled  
   Secure debug unlock	    : Enabled  
   Tamper status	        : OK  
   Secure boot	            : Disabled  
   Boot status	            : 0x20 - OK  
   Command key installed	: True  
   Sign key installed	    : False  
   Security state	        : Production  
   DONE  
   ```
3. The Direct Customer then places that Public Certificate Key in the [access certificate](05-debug-unlock#access-certificate). The access certificate is unique per device because it contains the unique device serial number. This certificate is generated once upon creation of the device, and thereafter, is generally only modified when the Private/Public Certificate Key pair is changed by the Product Company.  
   Run the `security gencert` command with the following parameters from the Product Company to generate an unsigned access certificate (`access_certificate.extsign`) in Security Store:  
   - Device part number  
   - Device serial number  
   - Public Certificate Key  
   ```sh  
   commander security gencert --device sixg301 --deviceserialno 0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591 --cert-pubkey cert_pubkey.pem --extsign  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Authorization file written to Security Store:  
   C:/Users/<userName>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/ device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591/certificate_authorizations.json Cert key written to Security Store:  
   C:/Users/<userName>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/ device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591/cert_pubkey.pem  
   Created an unsigned certificate in Security Store:  
   C:/Users/<userName>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/ device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591/access_certificate.extsign  
   DONE  
   ```
4. The signing of the access certificate can be done by passing an unsigned access certificate to a Hardware Security Module (HSM) containing the Private Command Key.  
   In this example, the OpenSSL tool is used instead of HSM. Please install openSSL version above 3.5.0. Sign the access certificate (`access_certificate.extsign`) in Security Store with the Private Command Key (`command_key.pem`). The [access certificate signature](05-debug-unlock#access-certificate) is in the `cert_signature.bin` file.  
   Run the `util signcert` command with the following parameters to verify the signature and generate the signed access certificate (`access_certificate.bin`):  
   - Unsigned access certificate  
   - Access certificate signature  
   - Public Command Key  
   ```sh  
   commander util signcert access_certificate.extsign --cert-type access --signature cert_signature.bin  
   --verify command_pubkey.pem --outfile access_certificate.bin  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   R = D97E43FEA278207080D6D0808B46810C1167F123AF1CA9FAF2DE0F4322B97ACE  
   S = FEDFEA11A3C83AFFCD5293283B13A50580862B9F651AAE08012C2BFB6BA8E697  
   Successfully verified signature  
   Successfully signed certificate  
   DONE  
   ```
5. The access certificate is passed to the Product Company. The purpose of the access certificate is to grant overall debug access capabilities to the Product Company and authorize them to allow third parties to debug the device. The Product Company can now use the access certificate to generate the Debug Unlock Token. The same access certificate can be used to generate as many Debug Unlock Tokens as necessary without having to ever go back to the Direct Customer.
6. To create the Debug Unlock Token, a debug session must be started with the device and the challenge value (which is a random number `Challenge 1` in this example) should be read out to generate the challenge response.  
   Run the `security gencommand` command to generate the challenge response without debug access command signature and store it in a file (`command_unsign.bin`).  
   ```sh  
   commander security gencommand --action debug-unlock --unlock-param 1111 -o command_unsign.bin --nostore  
   --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Unsigned command file written to:  
   command_unsign.bin  
   DONE  
   ```  
   **Notes**:  
   - The data in the `--unlock-param` option are the bits 2 to 5 of debug mode request in the challenge response.  
   - The default value `1111` (reset all debug options) is in place if the `security gencommand` command does not include the `-- un-lock-param` option.
7. The challenge response is then cryptographically hashed (SHA-256) to create a digest. The digest is then signed by the Private Certificate Key to generate the debug access command signature.  
   The signing of the challenge response can be done by passing an unsigned challenge response to a Hardware Security Module (HSM) containing the Private Certificate Key.  
   In this example, OpenSSL is used to sign the challenge response (`command_unsign.bin`) with the Private Certificate Key (`cert_key.pem`). The debug access command signature is in the `command_signature.bin` file.  
   ```sh  
   openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign cert_key.pem -out command_signature.bin command_unsign.bin  
   ```
8. Run the `security unlock` command with the access certificate (`access_certificate.bin`) from Direct Customer and debug access command signature (`command_signature.bin`) in step 7 to generate the Debug Unlock Token.  
   ```sh  
   commander security unlock --cert access_certificate.bin --command-signature command_signature.bin -- unlock-param 1111 --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Certificate written to Security Store:  
   C:/Users/<userName>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591/access_certificate.bin  
   R = B4F5F2628B50BBA54ADAB4EB67CD0F933FE4C01E8BA760915D5167E75330F3A2  
   S = 4D7EEA1B6D8EA61F3140198B26060D9F96D32CDCC5CE58CB4611ECED0D21F9B8  
   Command signature is valid  
   Secure debug successfully unlocked  
   Command unlock payload was stored in Security Store  
   DONE  
   ```  
   **Notes**:  
   - Put the required files in the same folder to run the command.  
   - The debug access command signature can be in a Raw or Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format.  
   - It requires Simplicity Commander Version 1.11.2 or above to support signature in DER format.  
   - The data in the `--unlock-param` option are the bits 2 to 5 of debug mode request in the Debug Unlock Token. This value **MUST** be equal to the value of `--unlock-param` option in step 6.  
   - The default value `1111` (reset all debug options) is in place if the `security unlock` command does not include the `--unlock- param` option.
9. **(Alternative)** The key protection is not required if the Private Certificate Key is ephemeral. Steps 6 to 8 can be implemented by running the `security unlock` command with the access certificate (`access_certificate.bin`) from the Direct Customer and Private Certificate Key (`cert_key.pem`) to generate the Debug Unlock Token.  
   ```sh  
   commander security unlock --cert access_certificate.bin --cert-privkey cert_key.pem --unlock-param 1111 -- device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Unlocking with unlock payload:  
   C:/Users/<userName>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591/challenge_a7be6d84d1a41321b1492e643ba626f1/unlock_payload_0000000000111110.bin  
   Secure debug successfully unlocked  
   DONE  
   ```  
   **Notes**:  
   - The data in the `--unlock-param` option are the bits 2 to 5 of debug mode request in the Debug Unlock Token.  
   - The default value `1111` (reset all debug options) is in place if the `security unlock` command does not include the `--unlock-param` option.
10. The Debug Unlock Token (also known as `Command unlock payload`) file (`unlock_payload_0000000000111110.bin`, where `0000000000111110` is the value of debug mode request) is stored in the Security Store. The location in Windows is `C:\Users\<userName>\AppData\Local\SiliconLabs\commander\SecurityStore\device_<Serial number>\challenge_<Challenge value>`.  
    ![screenshot](/series2-secure-debug/0.3/images/sld714-image68.jpg)  
    Users can also use the `security getpath` command to get the path of the Security Store or a specified device.  
    ```sh  
    commander security getpath --device sixg301  
    ```  
    ```sh  
    C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore  
    DONE  
    ```  
    ```sh  
    commander security getpath --deviceserialno 0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591  
    ```  
    ```sh  
    C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/SiliconLabs/commander/SecurityStore/device_0000000000000000781c9dfffe589591  
    DONE  
    ```
11. The Debug Unlock Token and the device are now delivered to the Debug 3rd Party.  
    Run the `security gencommand` command to create the Security Store to place the Debug Unlock Token file.  
    ```sh  
    commander security gencommand --action debug-unlock --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
    ```  
    ```sh  
    Unsigned command file written to Security Store:

    DONE  
    ```  
    Copy the Debug Unlock Token file (`unlock_payload_0000000000111110.bin`) from Product Company to the Windows Security Store `challenge_<Challenge value>` folder located in `C:\Users\<PC user name>\AppData\Local\SiliconLabs\commander\SecurityStore\device_<Serial number>challenge_<Challenge value>`.
12. The device compares the Debug Unlock Token contents with its internal serial number, challenge value, and Public Command Key to determine the token’s authenticity. If authentic, it will execute the debug access command to unlock the device; otherwise, it will ignore the command.  
    Run the `security unlock` command to unlock the device.  
    ```sh  
    commander security unlock --unlock-param 1111 --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
    ```  
    ```sh

    Secure debug successfully unlocked  
    DONE  
    ```  
    **Notes**:  
    - If the security store has multiple tokens for the selected device, use `--unlock-param` option to specify which unlock token is chosen to unlock the device.  
    - Simplicity Commander will only use the token with value `1111` (error if not available) from the security store to unlock the device if the security unlock command does not include the `--unlock-param` option.
13. Run `security status --trustzone` command to check the full debug lock status of the device.  
    ```sh  
    commander security status --trustzone --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
    ```  
    ```sh  
    SE ROM version	        : 5.3

    Sign key installed	  : False  
    DONE  
    ```
14. The Debug 3rd Party can now use this same Debug Unlock Token to unlock the device (step 12), over and over again after each power-on or pin reset, until they have finished debugging the device.
15. Once the Debug 3rd Party has finished debugging, they will send the device back to the Product Company.
16. Once the Product Company receives the device, they will immediately start a debug session, roll the challenge (from `Challenge 1` to `Challenge 2` in this example), and put the device back into the secure debug lock state. Rolling the challenge will effectively invalidate any Debug Unlock Token that has been previously given to any third party.  
    Run the `security rollchallenge` command and reset the device to invalidate the current Debug Unlock Token. The challenge cannot be rolled before it has been used at least once.  
    ```sh  
    commander security rollchallenge --device sixg301 --serialno 440326972  
    ```  
    ```sh  
    Challenge was rolled successfully.  
    DONE  
    ```  
    The unlock token is invalidated after rolling the challenge because any previously issued Debug Unlock Token now contains a different challenge value (`Challenge 1`) than the challenge value currently in the device (`Challenge 2`).  
    The validation process of any previously issued Debug Unlock Token will always fail until a new Debug Unlock Token is issued with a current matching challenge value (`Challenge 2`).
