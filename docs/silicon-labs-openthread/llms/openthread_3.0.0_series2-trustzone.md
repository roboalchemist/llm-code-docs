# Series 2 TrustZone

> **Note: This section replaces _AN1374: TrustZone_. Further updates to this user guide will be provided here**.

ARMv8-M TrustZone is a technology that provides a foundation for improved system security in embedded applications. It allows the ARMv8-M to be aware of the security states of the system. Series 2 devices use the Cortex-M33 core to implement the ARMv8-M TrustZone security extension, which provides the ability to restrict access to peripherals and memory regions based on the processor security attribute. TrustZone works with the MPU, which controls privileged/unprivileged execution of code to provide a complete security solution.

ARMv8-M TrustZone is an extensive topic. The references below are publicly available on the [ARM Developer Documentation](https://developer.arm.com/docs) website.
