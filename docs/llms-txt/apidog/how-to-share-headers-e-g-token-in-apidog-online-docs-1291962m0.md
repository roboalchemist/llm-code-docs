# How to Share Headers (e.g., Token) in Apidog Online Docs?

**I have to manually enter the same header each time I use “Try It” to test an API. Is there a way to share it automatically?**

Yes. It is recommended to use *variables* to share headers across API requests. Here are two common approaches:

### Method 1: Use a variable directly in the API’s header

Set the header like this in your API definition:

```js
Authorization: Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
```

When using the **“Try It”** feature in the online docs, users only need to enter the `ACCESS_TOKEN` value once at the top. All APIs that reference `{{ACCESS_TOKEN}}` will automatically fill in the value—no need to enter it repeatedly.

### Method 2: Define a global header params using a variable


<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Environment Management → Global Params**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add a header-type param, for example:

   ```js
   Name: Authorization  
   Type: string
   Default Value: Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
   ```

    APIs in the project will use this global param by default. You can also choose to enable or disable it for specific APIs.

    The online docs will automatically inherit the variable value, allowing multiple APIs to share it.

Whether you define the variable directly in the API’s header or reference it through global params, as long as the same variable name (e.g., `{{ACCESS_TOKEN}}`) is used, you only need to enter it once in the online docs. It will then be shared across all relevant requests—greatly improving the testing experience.
