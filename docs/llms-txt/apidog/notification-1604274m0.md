# Notification

Apidog's notification feature is divided into two main sections: **Personal Account Notifications** and **Project-Level Notifications**.

Personal Account Notifications (found in the account settings at the top right) focus on interactions directly related to you, such as `@` mentions or replies in endpoint [comments](https://docs.apidog.com/comments-1604291m0.md). These appear as inbox messages and email alerts to keep you updated.

Project-Level Notifications (found in project settings) are designed for team collaboration. They can automatically push important events such as endpoint changes or test results to third-party platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams), enabling automated team-wide information syncing.

This documentation introduces **Personal Account Notifications**. For **Project-Level Notifications**, please refer to [this doc](https://docs.apidog.com/notification-settings-616240m0.md).

## How to Enable Notifications

## Notification Events

You can choose to receive notifications for the following events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **New comments on resource I maintained** | When an endpoint, documentation, or other resource you're in charge of receives a new comment |
| **New comments on resources I created** | When an endpoint, documentation, or other resource you created receives a new comment |
| **Mentioned** | When another user `@` mentions you in a comment |
| **Replied** | When another user replies to your comment |
| **Resolved** | When an issue you raised is marked as resolved |

:::tip
It's recommended to enable at least one notification method to avoid missing important updates. For critical events that require quick responses (e.g., being mentioned), it's best to enable both inbox and email notifications.
