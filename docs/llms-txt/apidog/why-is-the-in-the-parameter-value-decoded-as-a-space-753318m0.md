# Why is the "+" in the parameter value decoded as a space?

In URL encoding rules, within form data, the space character (' ') needs to be encoded as a '+' sign, because using spaces directly in URLs is unsafe, and '%20' (the URL encoded form of a space) is longer and harder to read. Therefore, when URLs or form data are received and decoded by a web server, the '+' sign is decoded as a space. This is because in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME type data, '+' is used as a substitute for spaces.
