# End-to-End Testing

The comprehensive approach known as end-to-end (E2E) testing encompasses the validation of complete application flows from start to finish. Each flow represents a sequence of actions performed by a user within the application, potentially involving multiple endpoints and APIs. By simulating these complex user interactions, E2E testing can help identify bottlenecks, integration errors, and issues related to the overall user experience.

Apidog's test scenarios provide a powerful tool for executing requests in a specific order and chaining them together. This capability enables you to validate real-world usage scenarios and test workflows that involve various system components. You can pass data between requests, allowing you to mimic the user's experience more accurately.

After running your end-to-end tests, either manually or through automated processes, you can view the results in Apidog to determine which tests have passed or failed. This visibility helps you identify and address any issues that arise during the E2E testing process.

### End-to-end test setup in Apidog

To set up integration tests for your application in Apidog, use the following framework:

1. **API requests**: The basic unit of testing is an API request. Each request tests a specific piece of functionality by calling an API endpoint. Learn more about [send requests](https://docs.apidog.com/sending-requests-548328m0.md).

2. **Pre/post-request processors**: For each request, you can add scripts, assertions, extracting variables, and database operations to test and validate the response code, headers, body data, and more. Learn more about [add Pre/post-request processors](https://docs.apidog.com/prepost-processors-in-apidog-588246m0.md).

3. **Test scenarios**: When you need to send multiple requests consecutively, build continuous test scenarios, or repeat requests with different test data, you can create a test scenario and add the necessary requests to it. Learn more about [test scenarios](https://docs.apidog.com/create-a-test-scenario-599311m0.md).

4. **Environments**: When making API requests, it is often necessary to switch between development, testing, and production environments. Apidog makes it convenient to send requests to different environments - you simply need to click and select the desired environment at the top right corner of the interface. Learn more about [Create and use environments](https://docs.apidog.com/environment-management-584758m0.md).

7. **Mock Servers**: Simulate other systems with mock servers. You can test how your application interacts with other APIs and systems without connecting to the actual resources. Instead, you can use Apidog to set up a mock server that simulates the behavior of a real API server by accepting requests and returning responses. Learn more about [setting up mock servers](https://docs.apidog.com/cloud-mock-621066m0.md).

### Run end-to-end tests in Apidog

After setting up your integration tests in Apidog, you can run them in the following ways:

1. **Manually**: You can run a single request, or run a test scenario to get a test report. Learn more about [run a test scenario](https://docs.apidog.com/run-a-test-scenario-602063m0.md).

2. **Scheduled Automation**: You can set up "Scheduled Tasks" to automatically run configured automated test scenarios at specified times, obtain task execution results, and meet the requirements for scheduled testing and regression. Learn more about [Scheduled tasks](https://docs.apidog.com/scheduled-tasks-603702m0.md).

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: You can run test scenarios as part of your regular application build process using the Apidog CLI. Execute your test suites after every code push and view test reports in Apidog. Learn more about [CI/CD integration](https://docs.apidog.com/cicd-in-apidog-609698m0.md).
