# How to migrate environments from other tools to Apidog?

In Apidog, the Initial value of variables is synchronized within the team, while the Current value is only stored locally. This means that when you use Apidog on another computer, you won't have access to the previously used Current values.

Therefore, Apidog provides the functionality to migrate environments. You can export the services and variables in environments as a JSON file and then import it on another computer. Here are the steps:
