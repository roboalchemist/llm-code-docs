# Regression Testing

When improving or updating an application, it's crucial to verify that these changes don't negatively impact existing functionalities. Regression testing involves executing a series of tests to ensure modified components integrate seamlessly with the rest of the application without introducing new defects, commonly referred to as regressions.

For APIs, regression testing involves confirming that alterations to the API or its environment don't adversely affect dependent components. These tests can be performed after any change, from bug fixes to feature additions. Regression tests typically cover various API elements, including:

1. Status codes - Confirm appropriate status codes are returned for different request types.
2. JSON schema - Verify response structure and format align with API specifications.
3. Response time - Ensure API response times remain within acceptable ranges.
4. Response body - Check that response content and structure meet expectations.
5. Headers - Validate the presence and accuracy of response headers.

Automation tools like the Apidog CLI can be utilized to run regression tests prior to deploying code updates, preventing breaking changes from reaching production. Additionally, you can schedule tests using the Collection Runner to monitor results over time, gaining insights into your API's reliability.

### Regression test setup in Apidog

To set up integration tests for your application in Apidog, use the following framework:

1. **API requests**: The basic unit of testing is an API request. Each request tests a specific piece of functionality by calling an API endpoint. Learn more about [send requests](https://docs.apidog.com/sending-requests-548328m0.md).

2. **Pre/post-request processors**: For each request, you can add scripts, assertions, extracting variables, and database operations to test and validate the response code, headers, body data, and more. Learn more about [add Pre/post-request processors](https://docs.apidog.com/prepost-processors-in-apidog-588246m0.md).

3. **Test scenarios**: When you need to send multiple requests consecutively, build continuous test scenarios, or repeat requests with different test data, you can create a test scenario and add the necessary requests to it. Learn more about [test scenarios](https://docs.apidog.com/create-a-test-scenario-599311m0.md).

4. **Environments**: When making API requests, it is often necessary to switch between development, testing, and production environments. Apidog makes it convenient to send requests to different environments - you simply need to click and select the desired environment at the top right corner of the interface. Learn more about [Create and use environments](https://docs.apidog.com/environment-management-584758m0.md).

7. **Mock Servers**: Simulate other systems with mock servers. You can test how your application interacts with other APIs and systems without connecting to the actual resources. Instead, you can use Apidog to set up a mock server that simulates the behavior of a real API server by accepting requests and returning responses. Learn more about [setting up mock servers](https://docs.apidog.com/cloud-mock-621066m0.md).

### Run regression tests in Apidog

After setting up your integration tests in Apidog, you can run them in the following ways:

1. **Manually**: You can run a single request, or run a test scenario to get a test report. Learn more about [run a test scenario](https://docs.apidog.com/run-a-test-scenario-602063m0.md).
2. **Scheduled Automation**: You can set up "Scheduled Tasks" to automatically run configured automated test scenarios at specified times, obtain task execution results, and meet the requirements for scheduled testing and regression. Learn more about [Scheduled tasks](https://docs.apidog.com/scheduled-tasks-603702m0.md).

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: You can run test scenarios as part of your regular application build process using the Apidog CLI. Execute your test suites after every code push and view test reports in Apidog. Learn more about [CI/CD integration](https://docs.apidog.com/cicd-in-apidog-609698m0.md).
