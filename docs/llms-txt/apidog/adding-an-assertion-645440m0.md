# Adding an Assertion

For saved endpoints, you can add **pre-** and **post-processors** to prepare data or test the endpoint. **Assertions** are a type of post-processor in Apidog that allow you to validate API responses.

## Prerequisites

Before adding assertions, ensure you have:
- At least one saved [endpoint](https://docs.apidog.com/creating-an-endpoint-644726m0.md) that you want to add assertions to
- Basic understanding of JSON and API response structures

## Steps to Add an Assertion

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click on the **Post Processors** tab.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on **Add PostProcessor** and select **Assertion**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Fill in the Assertion form with the validation details. For example, to assert that the response `category id` is positive:
    
    | Field               | Value                     |
    |---------------------|---------------------------|
    | Name                | "id" is a positive integer|
    | Target Object       | Response JSON             |
    | JSONPath Expression | `$.category.id`           |
    | Assertion Rule      | Greater than              |
    | Assertion Value     |         0                 |

**JSONPath** is a query language for JSON, used to select and extract data from JSON documents. You can click on the 🔨 icon in the JSONPath Expression field to visually extract any JSONPath expression.

- In Apidog, you can visually add assertions, [extract variables](https://docs.apidog.com/extract-variable-588468m0.md), [perform database operations](https://docs.apidog.com/database-operations-in-apidog-588469m0.md), and more. Learn more about [pre and post processors](https://docs.apidog.com/prepost-processors-in-apidog-588246m0.md).

- You can also write assertions or implement other operations using scripts by simply adding a "Custom script". Apidog is compatible with Postman scripts, which can run in Apidog without modification. Learn more about [Scripts](https://docs.apidog.com/use-scripts-in-apidog-593582m0.md).
