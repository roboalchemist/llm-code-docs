# Run Test Suites Via CLI

## Selecting A Suitable Running Method

Apidog provides multiple ways to run test suites, suitable for different testing requirements.

1. **Local Visual Execution**:

- This method is initiated from a local machine and is suitable for small-scale, quick testing.
- It is particularly effective when development and testing occur simultaneously, allowing for real-time monitoring and immediate adjustments.

2. **Local [Apidog CLI](https://docs.apidog.com/introduction-to-apidog-cli-605134m0.md) Execution**:

- Ideal for handling large-scale data or iterative scenarios, this method offers increased execution speed. 
- It is capable of running offline, which is suitable for environments with restricted resources or those that do not require a graphical user interface.

3. **CI/CD Execution**:

- This execution style is integrated within the CI/CD pipeline, making it a great option for automated integration and continuous deployment processes. 
- It is especially useful in settings where tests are frequently run to confirm the stability of APIs after each code update.

4. **Self-Hosting Runner Execution**: 

- Teams can set up the Apidog Runner on their own servers, leveraging more robust computing resources for testing. 
- This method includes support for scheduled tasks, making it ideal for scenarios that need regular testing or those with significant testing demands.

:::tip
In test suites, if environment/global variables are used, the actual values of these variables may differ depending on the execution method chosen, which could lead to inconsistent test results.

## Running Apidog CLI

To run test suites using the [Apidog CLI](https://docs.apidog.com/introduction-to-apidog-cli-605134m0.md), you first need to create and orchestrate a test suite. Then, you can run the test suite from the command line using the Apidog CLI and get the test results and test report.

<Steps>
  <Step>
In a test suite, switch to the CI/CD tab.

  </Step>
  <Step>
Configure parameters such as run environment and notification method. Each configuration in the interface will be reflected in real-time in the CLI command generated below.
  </Step>
  <Step>
In the CI/CD provider section, select CLI command line or other platforms.
  </Step>
  <Step>
Click the "Add access token" button and then "Generate token"  for CLI call authentication. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/api-access-token.md).

  </Step>
  <Step>
Click to copy the command, paste it into the command line and execute it to see the test execution process and test report.

:::tip[]
Note: For the command to run successfully, you need to first install [Apidog CLI](https://docs.apidog.com/installing-and-running-apidog-cli-605135m0.md). If already installed, you need to update it to the latest version.

## About Variables and Local Configuration Files (Optional)

In some scenarios, CLI execution requires local configuration files:

- **Environment / Global Variables**

    If you choose "Export current values for use", you need to place the exported variable file in the CLI execution machine and specify the file path through `--variables <path>`.
    
    For the difference between "Use initial Values" and "Export current values for use", refer to: [Rules for using environment/global variables across different running methods](https://docs.apidog.com/run-a-test-scenario-602063m0#rules-for-using-environmentglobal-variables-across-different-running-methods).

- **Database Connection**

    If the test uses locally saved "database connections", the interface will guide you to export the configuration file and use it in CLI through `--database-connection <path>`.

    :::tip[]
    It is recommended to save "database connection" details in variable form, so that no additional `--database-connection <path>` is needed when running CLI, and it is also more convenient for collaboration and maintenance.  [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/database-connection-880098m0.md).

## CLI Test Report

After running the CLI, you will get a command-line test report containing the execution statistics of the test suite, as well as validation and assertion information for failed requests.

In the folder where the CLI is run, you can also find the `/apidog-reports/` folder, which contains HTML-formatted CLI test reports.
