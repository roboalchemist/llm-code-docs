## Pricing Impact of Team Size Changes

Apidog reviews team member changes monthly, regardless of whether you're on a monthly or annual subscription.

### Adding New Members

#### Monthly Subscription

**Formula:**
- Current month's charge = Plan price × Current team members
- Additional charge at billing cycle end = Plan price × Number of new users × (Days of usage ÷ Total days in month)

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) subscribed to the Basic Plan ($12/member/month) on May 20. A new user joined on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20**: \$12 × 10 = $120
2. **June 20**: (\$12 × 11) + (\$12 × 25/30) = \$132 + \$10 = $142

#### Annual Subscription

**Formula:**
- Current order price = Plan price × Current team members × 12
- Additional charge next month = Plan price × Number of new users × 12 × (Days of usage ÷ 365)

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) subscribed to the Basic Plan ($12/member/month) on May 20. A new user joined on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20 (Year 1)**: \$12 × 10 × 12 = \$1,440
2. **June 20 (Year 1)**: \$12 × 1 × 12 × (360/365) = \$142 (prorated for new member)
3. **May 20 (Year 2)**: \$12 × 11 × 12 = \$1,584

### Removing Members

#### Monthly Subscription

**Formula:**
- Current month's charge = Plan price × Current team members
- Refund at billing cycle end = Plan price × Number of removed users × (Unused days ÷ Total days in month)
- Next month's charge = Plan price × Current team size (refunds applied as credit)

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) subscribed to the Basic Plan ($12/member/month) on May 20. A member was removed on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20**: \$12 × 10 = \$120
2. **June 20**: \$12 × 9 = \$108 (refund of $10 applied as credit for future payment)

#### Annual Subscription

**Formula:**
- Current order price = Plan price × Current team members × 12
- Refund next month = Plan price × Number of removed users × 12 × (Unused days ÷ 365)
- Next year's charge = Plan price × Current team size × 12 (refunds applied as credit)

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) subscribed to the Basic Plan ($12/member/month) on May 20. A member was removed on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20 (Year 1)**: \$12 × 10 × 12 = \$1,440
2. **June 20 (Year 1)**: Refund of \$142 retained as team credit (visible in invoice)
3. **May 20 (Year 2)**: \$12 × 9 × 12 = \$1,296 (refund credit applied)

## Plan Changes

### Upgrading to a Higher-Tier Monthly Plan

**Formula:**
- Current month's charge = Lower-tier price × Current team members
- Upgrade charge = (Higher-tier price × Current team members) - (Lower-tier price × Current team members × Unused days ÷ Total days in month)

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) on Basic Plan (\$12/member/month, billing on the 20th) upgraded to Professional Plan (\$24/member/month) on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20**: \$12 × 10 = \$120
2. **May 25**: (\$24 × 10) - (\$12 × 10 × 25/30) = \$240 - \$100 = \$140 (upgrade difference)
3. **June 20**: \$24 × 10 = \$240

### Upgrading to a Higher-Tier Annual Plan

**Formula:**
- Current order price = Lower-tier price × Current team members × 12
- Upgrade charge = (Higher-tier price × Current team members × 12) - (Lower-tier price × Current team members × Unused days ÷ 365)

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) on annual Basic Plan (\$9/member/month) upgraded to annual Professional Plan (\$18/member/month) on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **Initial annual order**: \$9 × 10 × 12 = \$1,080
2. **May 25 (upgrade)**: (\$18 × 10 × 12) - (\$9 × 10 × 12 × Unused days/365)

### Downgrading or Canceling Subscription

#### Monthly Downgrade

Downgrades take effect at the end of your billing cycle.

**Formula:**
- Current month's charge = Plan price × Current team members
- Downgrade to Free Plan next month

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) on Basic Plan (billing on the 20th) downgraded to Free Plan on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20**: \$12 × 10 = \$120
2. **June 20**: Downgrade to Free Plan (no charge)

#### Annual Downgrade

Downgrades take effect at the end of your billing cycle.

**Formula:**
- Annual order price = Plan price × Current team size × 12
- Downgrade to Free Plan at subscription end

**Example:**

Team A (10 members) on annual Basic Plan subscribed on May 20 and downgraded to Free Plan on May 25.

**Actual payments:**
1. **May 20 (Year 1)**: \$9 × 10 × 12 = \$1,080
2. **May 20 (Year 2)**: Downgrade to Free Plan (no charge)

### Switching from Monthly to Annual Billing

The change takes effect immediately.

**Formula:**
- Current monthly charge = Monthly plan price × Current team size
- Annual charge (pay difference) = (Annual plan price × Current team size × 12) - (Monthly plan price × Current team size × Unused days ÷ Days in month)

### Switching from Annual to Monthly Billing

The change does NOT take effect immediately. The annual plan continues until the end of the subscription period, then the monthly plan activates.

**Formula:**
- Annual order price = Annual plan price × Current team size × 12
- Monthly order price = Monthly plan price × Current team size (starts after annual expires)
