- **Project Settings**: Go to `Settings` -> `Import Data`.
- **API List (Directory Tree)**: Click the `+` button next to the search bar and select `Import`.
- **Team Page**: Click the `Import Project` button on the project list page.

## Advanced: Importing to Sprint Branches

By default, data is imported into the **Main Branch**. If you are using Version Control, you can import directly into a specific **Sprint Branch**. 

The target branch is determined by the branch currently selected in the top-left corner of the app.


For more details, refer to [OAS imports into branches](https://docs.apidog.com/designing-apis-in-a-branch-616423m0.md#oas-import).
