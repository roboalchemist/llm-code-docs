# Merging Sprint Branches

Once endpoint definitions are developed and deployed within a sprint branch, you can merge some or all of the changes into the main branch.

## Accessing Merge Functions

### For APIs

**Option 1:** Click **Merge** in the branch switch next to **APIs**

**Option 2:** Click **Merge to main** at the right bottom of **APIs**

<Background>

</Background>

### For Test Scenarios

Test scenarios require separate merging and do not merge automatically with resources in APIs.

While in a sprint branch, hover over the **...** button next to a test scenario in automated testing to see the **Merge to Main** option.

## Merging into Unprotected Main Branch

If the main branch is not protected, users with project merge permissions can review changes and directly merge them into the main branch.

### Overview of Pending Merges

Clicking **Merge** opens the merge overview popup with key elements:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Filter** | View only modified resources or all resources in the current sprint branch |
| **Merging Preview** | Displays final effect on main branch directory after merging |
| **Resource Status** | Color-coded dots (gray: unchanged, orange: modified, green: new) |
| **Post-Merge Status** | Choose how to adjust merged resource status: Follow Current Branch, Follow Main, or Specified Status |

- If merged, the resource will be created in the main branch at the specified location
- Click to view complete content

### Viewing Merge Details and Reverting Merges

In the main branch, access **Change History** of a resource to:
- View content modified through merges
- Compare content with other versions
- Track and rollback changes

## Merging into Protected Main Branch

When merging into a protected main branch, users with editing permissions must create a merge request for administrator review and approval.

### Creating a Merge Request

1. Click **Merge** in the project
2. View all changes in the current branch
3. Select specific resources to merge
4. Click **Create Merge Request** at the bottom-right

</Background>

### Reviewing a Merge Request

Reviewers see a notification in **Project Overview** indicating a new merge request.

**To review:**
1. Go to **Project Overview** → **Merge Requests**
2. View list of requests with detailed information

<Background>
![Merge requests list](https://api.apidog.com/api/v1/projects/544525/resources/348695/image-preview)

3. Click a pending merge request to evaluate contents
4. Compare content before and after merge
5. Click **Merge** to approve and merge changes

### Modifying a Submitted Merge Request

After submitting a merge request, if changes are needed:

1. Directly modify content in the sprint branch
2. Changes automatically sync with the existing merge request
3. No need to create a new request
4. Modifications are indicated on the review page

</Background>

### Rejecting a Merge Request

If a merge request is not suitable:

1. Click **Reject** on the merge request review page
2. Request is marked as **Closed**
3. To make changes and merge again, create a new merge request

<Background>

## Merging Automated Test Scenarios

Automated test scenarios and endpoints are merged independently and separately. Test scenarios need individual merging without an overall merge page.

:::warning[Important Notes]
1. **Merge APIs first**: Merge resources in APIs before merging test scenarios. Failing to do so may cause related test scenarios in the main branch to run abnormally.
2. **Administrator access**: Currently, only project administrators can merge test scenarios into protected main branches. A feature for merge requests for test scenarios is planned for the future.
:::

**Merging test scenarios:**

Hover over the **...** button of a test scenario in automated testing to see the **Merge to Main** option.

<Background>

</Background>

**Test scenario merge popup displays:**

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Basic Information** | Sprint branch test scenario and associated main branch scenario (if any) |
| **Last Run Result** | Last manual run result (hover for summary). Ensure scenario passes before merging |
| **Merge Action** | Overwrite (if forked from main) or Add (if new) |
