# Custom Endpoint Fields

When collaborating on APIs, there may be a need for some custom additional fields to describe endpoints. For example, you could add fields such as "Authorization Required," "Response Format," or "Rate Limiting Policy" to provide more context to users consuming the API.

In Apidog, you can leverage **Customized Fields** to implement these additional fields seamlessly.

## Configuring Custom Fields

You can set up endpoint fields in Apidog by navigating to **Settings** > **General Settings** > **Feature Settings** > **Endpoint Feature Settings**. The customized fields that you configure here will apply project-wide in Apidog.

Apidog provides three default built-in fields that you can manually enable or disable. If enabled, the field will appear in the endpoint metadata.
