# Self-Hosted Runner Mock

Runner mock provides a self-hosted mock service for teams requiring mock endpoints in private networks or intranets. When a request is made to a runner mock URL, the request is sent to your self-hosted runner server, which generates and returns the mock response.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring runner mock:
- A deployed runner on your server or intranet (see [deploying the Runner](https://docs.apidog.com/general-runner-755233m0.md))
- Team or project admin permissions
- Access to team resources settings

Runner mock is ideal for teams that need mock services in private networks or for large-scale automated testing scenarios.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Does Runner Mock support HTTPS? How can I enable it?" defaultOpen>

Yes, runner mock **can be accessed via HTTPS**, but note the following:

**Important Details:**
- The runner itself does **not include built-in HTTPS certificate support** or automatic certificate provisioning
- If your domain is already configured with HTTPS (e.g., via a reverse proxy like Nginx with a certificate), you can use it directly

**Configuration:**

Simply enter `https://your-domain:port` in the **Server Host** field to access the runner mock service over HTTPS. No additional runner configuration is needed.

**Example:**

 ```js
https://runner.example.com:443
```
