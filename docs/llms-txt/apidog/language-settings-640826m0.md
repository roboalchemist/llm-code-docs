# Language Settings

Apidog offers flexible language settings across three different aspects to accommodate global team dynamics and individual preferences. Understanding these settings helps you configure the right language experience for your workflow and team collaboration.

## Language Settings Overview

| Setting Type | Scope | Who Can Change | Affects | Impacts Online Docs |
|--------------|-------|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Software Language** | Personal | Individual user | Local interface only | No |
| **Project Language** | Project-wide | Admin only | Auto-generated content for all team members | Yes |
| **Documentation Language** | Per share | Anyone with share permissions | Online documentation interface | N/A (is the online docs) |

## Software Language

The **Software Language** determines the language displayed in the Apidog software interface. You can set this via **Settings** → **General** → **Software Language**. 

This setting is personal and impacts only your local environment without affecting other team members or the Online Documentation.

:::tip
Switching the software language to English may still display some elements in the default language. This is where **Project Language** comes into play, affecting auto-generated content.

## Project Language

The **Project Language** influences auto-generated content within the project, such as default names for responses, examples, API test cases, markdown documents, and dataset names in test data.

Admin-only adjustable, this setting is found under **Settings** → **Basic Settings** → **Project Language**. It operates at the project level; once set, all team members utilize the same project language for consistency, including in Online Documentation.

## Documentation Language

The **Documentation Language** applies to the 'Online Documentation' and can be thought of as the software language for Online Documents. This setting is available through **Share** → **Share Docs** → **New Share** → **Language**.

## Best Practices

- **Individual users**: Set your **Software Language** to your preferred language for the interface
- **Team admins**: Set **Project Language** based on your team's primary working language
- **Documentation sharing**: Choose **Documentation Language** based on your target audience when sharing docs externally
