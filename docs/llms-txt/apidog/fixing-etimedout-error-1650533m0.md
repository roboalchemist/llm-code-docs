# Fixing ETIMEDOUT Error

**`ETIMEDOUT`** indicates that your request **exceeded the configured time limit** while waiting for a response from the target server.



## Possible Causes

There are three primary causes:

### 1. Network or firewall blocking

Your local firewall, antivirus software, or corporate network restrictions are preventing Apidog from establishing outbound connections.

### 2. Server or address issues

* The target server is not running, is unreachable, or the target port is blocked by a firewall.
* The requested URL or IP address is incorrect.

### 3. Apidog configuration issues

* The request timeout is set too short and the server has not yet responded.
* Proxy settings are incorrect, preventing the request from being sent.



## How to Fix

### 1. Install the browser extension or use the desktop app

If you are using the web version, install the [browser extension](https://docs.apidog.com/installing-apidog-chrome-extension-821769m0) before sending requests. Alternatively, use the [Apidog desktop app](https://apidog.com/download/) — **recommended** for greater stability.


### 2. Increase the timeout (most common)

In Apidog, go to **Settings → General** and increase the **Request timeout** value.

### 3. Check network and firewall

* **Local check:** Temporarily **disable** your firewall or antivirus to verify whether they are causing the timeout.
* **Network test:** Try a different network (for example, a mobile hotspot) to rule out corporate network restrictions.



### 4. Verify the server and address

* **Confirm service availability:** Ensure the target server is running and can be reached from other environments (for example, open the URL in a browser).
* **Validate the URL:** Double-check the request URL/IP and port for typos.



### 5. Check proxy settings

1. Open **Apidog → Settings → Network Proxy**.
2. Take the appropriate action:

   * If you **do not** need a proxy to reach the target service, ensure proxy is **disabled** or set to **No proxy**.
   * If you **do** require a proxy, verify the proxy host, port, and authentication credentials are correct.

If the timeout persists after these checks, consult the target service owner or administrator and provide request timestamps and the endpoint used so they can inspect server logs and network configurations.
