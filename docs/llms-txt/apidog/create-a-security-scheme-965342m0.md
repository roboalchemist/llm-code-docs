# Create a Security Scheme

Apidog offers a wide range of security scheme types, supporting various authentication methods, including:

1. **API Key** – Authenticate using a key passed via Header, Query, or Cookie.
2. **Bearer Token** – Authenticate using the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
3. **JWT** – Authenticate with tokens in JSON Web Token format.
4. **Basic Auth** – Use a username and password for basic authentication.
5. **Digest Auth** – More secure than basic auth.
6. **OAuth 2.0** – A widely adopted authorization standard supporting multiple grant types.
7. **OAuth 1.0** – An earlier version of OAuth with a different signature mechanism.
8. **Hawk Authentication** – HMAC-based authentication protocol.
9. **AWS Signature** – Signature-based authentication used for Amazon AWS services.
10. **Kerberos** – Ticket-based network authentication protocol.
11. **NTLM Authentication** – Authentication protocol developed by Microsoft.
12. **Akamai EdgeGrid** – Authentication method used by the Akamai API platform.
13. **Customize** – Allows you to define and use authentication methods that aren't natively supported by Apidog.

   The system will display the OAS (OpenAPI Specification) code for the current security scheme, available in both JSON and YAML formats.

   You can directly edit here to define more complex specifications. The system will update the security scheme settings based on your changes.

## Creating Security Schemes via OAS Import

When importing an OpenAPI file that includes security schemes, Apidog will automatically detect and create corresponding security schemes. These will appear in the project's **Security Schemes** list.

You can configure the mapping between Security and Auth when importing OAS files.

## Creating OAuth 2.0 Security Scheme

OAuth 2.0 is a widely used authorization framework, and Apidog offers full support for it. To create an OAuth 2.0 security scheme, configure the following:

1. **Grant Type**: Choose from `Authorization Code`, `Client Credentials`, `Implicit`, or `Password`.
2. **URL Settings**: Based on the selected grant type, configure the relevant URLs:
   - **Auth URL**
   - **Access Token URL**
   - **Refresh URL** (optional)
   - **Callback URL** (also known as Redirect URL)
3. **Scope Settings** (Define the permission scopes your app can request):
   - Add scope names and descriptions
   - Configure different sets of scopes for each grant type
