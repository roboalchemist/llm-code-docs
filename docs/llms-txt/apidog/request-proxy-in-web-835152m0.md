# Request Proxy in Web

When you log into Apidog via the web app and attempt to send a request to an endpoint, you might face Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. To help users overcome this challenge, Apidog offers several types of request proxy agents.

## Available Request Proxies

| Request Proxy | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Cloud Agent** | - No installation required<br>- Supports sending HTTPS requests<br>- Requires connection to the Apidog cloud<br>- Cannot access private or local network environments |
| **Browser Extension** | - Installed locally<br>- Supports sending HTTPS requests<br>- Requires downloading the Apidog [Browser Extension](https://docs.apidog.com/installing-apidog-chrome-extension-821769m0.md) |
| **Self-hosted Request Proxy Agent** | - Deployed on a self-hosted server<br>- Supports sending HTTPS requests<br>- Requires server deployment<br>- Restricted by the network environment of the deployment server, possibly unable to access local network environments |

## Selecting a Request Proxy

To choose which request proxy agent to use, go to the `Request Proxy` section located at the bottom right of the project page. 

By default, the system selects `Auto` mode. In this mode, if the browser extension is installed, it will be used to send requests. If not, the cloud agent will be employed for sending requests.
