# Kerberos

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol initially developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and widely used in modern computing systems, especially in enterprise environments. Kerberos utilizes symmetric encryption and a trusted third party, known as the Key Distribution Center (KDC), to securely authenticate users and services.

When using Windows Authentication in IIS (Internet Information Services), Kerberos will be used preferentially over NTLM when available, providing stronger security and better performance.
