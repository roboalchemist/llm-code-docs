# Automated Tests in Apidog

Testing plays a critical role in the API lifecycle. It validates API endpoints, methods, and integrations, ensuring that they function as expected. More importantly, it guarantees that the API can efficiently handle anticipated operational demands, thereby averting potential bottlenecks or failures in real-world scenarios.

## API Testing in Apidog

Apidog supports several crucial types of API testing to ensure comprehensive quality assurance:

| Testing Type | Purpose | Key Benefits |
|--------------|---------|--------------| 
| **[Integration Testing](https://docs.apidog.com/integration-testing-610064m0.md)** | Confirms that different modules or external systems work together correctly within the API | Automates tests to ensure internal and external interactions are faultless—crucial for application reliability in systems like microservices architectures |
| **[End-to-End Testing](https://docs.apidog.com/end-to-end-testing-610068m0.md)** | Assesses the complete operational flow, imitating real user scenarios | Captures user experience issues not detected at other testing levels, providing a comprehensive check on how the API performs from start to finish |
| **[Regression Testing](https://docs.apidog.com/regression-testing-610072m0.md)** | Verifies that new updates or features do not disrupt existing functions | Allows for continuous testing of affected functions after each update, maintaining consistency and reliability throughout development changes |
| **[Performance Testing](https://docs.apidog.com/performance-testing-603638m0.md)** | Evaluates how the API copes under stress, checking aspects like response times and resource usage | Helps predict and improve API behavior under peak loads, ensuring performance benchmarks are met |

## Getting Started with Apidog Testing

Apidog **test scenarios** consist of a group of API endpoints or requests, along with authorization types, parameters, headers, request body, tests, and settings for each endpoint. You can group requests with different method types (such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT) and design logical options like if, for, foreach to orchestrate the test steps.

If you are new to Apidog, follow these steps to start using Apidog tests:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a test scenario">
    Create and name a test scenario in Apidog tests. Import requests from the API spec or add custom requests. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/create-a-test-scenario-599311m0.md).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass data between requests">
Ensure seamless data flow by configuring data passage between steps, enabling outputs from previous steps to be inputs for subsequent ones. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/pass-data-between-requests-601617m0.md).
    </Step>
  <Step title="Flow control conditions">
 Utilize logical options like if, for, foreach to design the test flow. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/flow-control-conditions-599419m0.md)
  </Step>
    <Step title="Run the test scenario">
    Execute the test scenario to validate the API endpoints and ensure they function as expected. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/run-a-test-scenario-602063m0.md)
  </Step>
    <Step title="Get the test report">
    After the automated testing run is completed, a test report will be output, where you can see which requests have not passed the test. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/test-reports-603898m0.md).
  </Step>

    <Step title="Performance testing">
Consider incorporating performance testing into your Apidog test scenarios to evaluate the scalability and responsiveness of your APIs under different load conditions. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/performance-testing-603638m0.md)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Integration with CI/CD">
Incorporate Apidog tests into your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate the testing process. [Learn more](https://docs.apidog.com/cicd-in-apidog-609698m0.md)
