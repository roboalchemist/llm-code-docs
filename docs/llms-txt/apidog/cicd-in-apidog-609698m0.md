# CI/CD in Apidog

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are essential components of an API development workflow. Apidog provides integration with widely-used CI tools, enabling you to monitor API builds directly within the same platform where you design and test your APIs.

You can execute API test scenarios created in Apidog as part of your CI pipeline using the Apidog CLI.
