# Collaboration Workflow

This guide outlines the recommended workflow for API collaboration in Apidog, from initial design through deployment.

## Workflow Overview

The following workflow ensures smooth collaboration between API designers, developers, and QA engineers:

### 1. Draft API Documentation

API designers create initial API documentation in Apidog, defining endpoints, parameters, schemas, and expected responses.

### 2. Collaborative Review

Front-end and back-end developers work together to review and enhance the documentation, ensuring alignment on:
- API use cases and requirements
- Request/response structures
- Data models and schemas
- Error handling

### 3. Development Kickoff with Mock Data

Front-end developers can start development immediately using automatically generated mock data based on API documentation in Apidog.

**Benefits:**
- No manual mock rule creation required
- Parallel development without waiting for backend completion
- Realistic data structures for testing

### 4. Debugging with API Use Cases

Back-end developers debug APIs during development using predefined use cases.

**Completion criteria:**
- All use cases pass debugging successfully
- Any changes made during development automatically update the API specification
- Ensures timely and cost-effective API maintenance

### 5. Saving Endpoint Cases

Once debugging is complete, back-end developers save successful requests as endpoint cases for:
- Future testing
- Documentation of working examples
- QA reference

### 6. API Testing

QA engineers test APIs directly using predefined endpoint cases, ensuring:
- Functional correctness
- Expected response formats
- Error handling
- Edge cases

### 7. Integration Testing

After all APIs are developed, QA engineers (or back-end developers) utilize the test collection feature to conduct comprehensive multi-API integration testing.

**Purpose:**
- Verify the smooth functioning of the API calling process
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Validate data flow between endpoints

### 8. Joint Debugging

When both front-end and back-end development is finished:
1. Front-end developers switch from mock data to real data
2. Both teams verify the integration works as expected
3. Follow API specifications meticulously to ensure compatibility

## Benefits of This Workflow

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Parallel Development** | Front-end and back-end teams work simultaneously |
| **Reduced Errors** | Specification-driven development minimizes miscommunication |
| **Faster Iteration** | Automatic mock data and specification updates speed up development |
| **Better Testing** | Predefined cases and integration tests ensure quality |
| **Clear Documentation** | Living documentation stays in sync with implementation |
