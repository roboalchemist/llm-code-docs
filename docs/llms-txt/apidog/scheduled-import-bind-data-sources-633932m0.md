# Scheduled Import (Bind Data Sources)

**Scheduled Import** automatically synchronizes your API specifications from external sources into Apidog at regular intervals. This feature is ideal for teams that maintain their API specs in external systems (like Git repositories or Swagger endpoints) but want to leverage Apidog's powerful debugging and testing capabilities without manual re-imports.

With Scheduled Import, you can:
- **Maintain a single source of truth** for your API specs in your preferred version control system
- **Automatically sync changes** at customizable intervals (every 30 minutes, hourly, daily, etc.)
- **Import from multiple sources** including GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and direct URLs
- **Keep your team aligned** with the latest API changes without manual intervention 

## How to Configure

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Navigate to Settings**
    
    Go to `Settings` -> `Import Data` -> `Scheduled Import (Bind Data Sources)`.

## Execution Modes

Scheduled imports require an execution environment to run the fetch command. Choose the mode that best fits your workflow:

### 1. Local Client (Default)
The import runs **only when your Apidog desktop app is open**. 
- **Requirement**: You must have the project open with write permissions.
- **Limitation**: If you close the app or the project, updates will pause until you open it again.
- **Network**: Can access internal network URLs if your computer can access them.

:::info[]
Opening the project in the **Apidog Web App** also triggers the scheduled import. However, due to browser security restrictions, the Web App may not be able to access internal network URLs.
:::

### 2. Self-hosted Runner
The import runs on a server where you have deployed an Apidog Runner.
- **Benefit**: Runs 24/7 regardless of whether you are online.
- **Use Case**: Best for teams needing consistent updates without manual intervention.

## Advanced: Import to Sprint Branches

You can target specific sprint branches for your import. By default, data imports to the **Main Branch**.

For detailed workflow, refer to [Importing data into sprint branches](https://docs.apidog.com/designing-apis-in-a-branch-616423m0.md#import-oas-into-sprint-branch).
