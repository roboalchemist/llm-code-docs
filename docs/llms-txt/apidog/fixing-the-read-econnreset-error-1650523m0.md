# Fixing the read ECONNRESET Error

The `ECONNRESET` error indicates that after the Apidog client successfully established a connection with the target server and started transmitting data, **the connection was unexpectedly reset or forcibly closed by the server**.



## Possible Causes

This error is usually caused by network connectivity issues or problems on the server side, such as configuration errors or heavy load. Common causes include:

### 1. Network Configuration Issues

The most common reason is interference from your **VPN**, proxy server, or local firewall, which disrupts the connection.

### 2. Server Overload

The server may close new connections when it is under heavy load, especially during batch operations.

### 3. Invalid Request Configuration

If the request configuration (such as headers, body, or URL) is invalid, the server may reject it and proactively terminate the connection.



## How to Resolve

You can try the following steps to identify and fix the issue:

### 1. Install the Extension or Use the Desktop App

If you are using the web version, install the [browser extension](https://docs.apidog.com/installing-apidog-chrome-extension-821769m0) before sending requests.  
Alternatively, you can use the [desktop app](https://apidog.com/download/) — **recommended for better stability**.



### 2. Check Your Network and VPN/Proxy Settings

Since network issues are the most common cause, start by checking your connection setup:

- **VPN / Proxy:**

  - **For public APIs:** Try temporarily **disabling** your VPN or proxy service and resend the request.  
  - **For internal APIs:** Ensure your VPN is properly connected and that the target service is reachable.

- **Apidog Proxy Settings:**  
  Go to **Settings → Network Proxy** to verify your Apidog [client proxy configuration](https://docs.apidog.com/835154m0).  
  If your environment does not require a proxy, make sure no invalid proxy settings are applied.

- **Firewall / Security Software:**  
  Ensure that your local firewall or antivirus software is not mistakenly blocking Apidog’s network connections.



### 3. Verify Your Request Configuration

Double-check that your request settings in Apidog match the API specification:

- **HTTP Method:**  
  Make sure you’re using the correct method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

- **Headers:**  
  Verify that all required headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Content-Type`) are properly configured and contain no **typos** or **extra spaces**.

- **Request Body and Query Parameters:**  
  - If the body is in JSON format, ensure it is valid and properly structured.  
  - Confirm that all required parameters are provided.  
  - Check for unnecessary spaces or typos in the URL or parameters.



### 4. Check for Server Overload or Batch Execution Issues

If the error occurs during batch execution (e.g., running multiple test cases, test scenarios, or scheduled tasks in Apidog):

- **Try sending the request individually:**  
  Send the failing request from the “API Management” section as a single request.

  - **If it succeeds individually:**  
    This indicates the server might be overloaded when handling large batches. Try reducing the number of concurrent requests or increasing the interval between them.  
  - **If it still fails:**  
    The issue is likely related to network or request configuration. Continue checking the steps above.



### 5. Contact the API Provider

If none of the above solutions work, the issue may be caused by a server-side configuration or network restriction.

Contact the API provider or server administrator, and report the `ECONNRESET` error along with the request URL and approximate request time. This will help them review server logs and network configurations to identify the root cause.
