# ELANREFUSED.DNS Resolver Error

### What does the "ELANREFUSED.DNS Resolver Error" mean?
This error means the system couldn’t resolve a domain name (e.g., example.com) into an IP address due to a DNS (Domain Name System) issue, preventing a connection.

### What are the possible causes?
- Incorrect DNS Configuration: The system’s DNS settings might be wrong.

- Network Issues: Problems with the connection between the client and DNS server.

- Invalid Domain: The domain may not exist or could be misspelled.

- Access Denied: The DNS server might be blocking the request.

### How can I troubleshoot this error?

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check DNS Configuration:

- Verify that your system’s DNS server settings are correct.

- Try switching to a public DNS server, such as Google’s DNS:

   i. Primary DNS: 8.8.8.8

   ii. Secondary DNS: 8.8.4.4

2. Test Network Connectivity:

- Ensure your device is connected to the network.

- Use the ping command to check if you can reach the DNS server. For example:

    i. `ping 8.8.8.8`

3. Verify the Target Domain:

Use tools like `nslookup` or `dig`to manually resolve the domain name. For example:

  i. `nslookup example.com` or
 ii. `dig example.com`

If the domain fails to resolve, double-check the spelling or confirm if the domain exists.

4. Check for Firewall or Security Restrictions:

Ensure that your firewall or security software is not blocking DNS requests.
