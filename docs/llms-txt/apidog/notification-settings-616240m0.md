# Notification Settings

## Notification Overview

Apidog enables you to integrate with third-party applications to send notifications to designated recipients when certain events occur. When a specific event is triggered, notifications are sent in real-time to platforms like Slack. Supported notification channels currently include:

- Slack
- Teams
- Webhook
- Jenkins
- Email

Only **project admins** can configure the notification settings. Currently, email notifications are only available for the following events:

- Automated test completed/failed
- Continuous integration completed/failed
- Scheduled tasks completed/failed

## Notification Targets

Notification targets are recipients who receive messages through a specific channel when certain events happen.

To set up notifications, firstly you need to create a notification target by specifying a name, selecting a channel, and configuring its settings. Each channel has a unique setup process. The sections below will walk you through configuring them step by step.

### Teams

Support for sending notifications to Microsoft Teams allows [Workflows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498) in Teams to use these messages as triggers for further actions—such as automatically posting messages in a group or channel—helping teams stay informed about important events from Apidog.

Specifically, you can configure a Webhook Trigger within a Workflow. When certain notification events in Apidog are triggered (e.g., API changes, documentation updates, or automated test completions), Apidog will send a POST request to the specified HTTP POST URL of the trigger, carrying the event payload.

**Configuration Fields:**

| **Field** | **Required** | **Description** |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Name | Yes | A name that describes the purpose of this notification target |
| HTTP POST URL | Yes | The URL where the Webhook Trigger in the Workflow receives POST requests |

### Webhook

Supports sending notification events to the HTTP Server. You can send event messages to the HTTP Server by specifying a URL address to receive POST requests.

**Configuration field description:**

| **Configuration Field** | Required | Description |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Notification Name** | No | Give a name to the third-party integrated notification to record the purpose of the notification. |
| **Trigger Event** | Yes | Supported events: API changes, Data model changes, Document changes, Import data, Automation testing |
| **Server URL** | Yes | URL address of the HTTP Server for receiving requests |
| **Signature Auth** | No | The sent content is encrypted by the [HMAC SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) encryption algorithm, using a token as the KEY to display the value in hexadecimal (requires a configured token), and contains the prefix sha1= |

#### Integrating Apidog Notification with Self-hosted HTTP Server

Project admins can use third-party integration to associate their self-hosted HTTP Server with project notification events in Apidog, to receive notifications for relevant API changes, document changes, and automation test completions in their HTTP Server.

To integrate Apidog notification with self-hosted HTTP server, click "Settings" > "Notifications" > "Notification Targets" > and create a new notification Target.

<details>
<summary>📷 Visual Reference</summary>

<Background>
![create-new-webhook-notification-target.png](https://api.apidog.com/api/v1/projects/544525/resources/350634/image-preview)
</Background>

</details>

1. Fill in the notification target name.
2. Choose `Webhook` as the channel.
3. Paste the URL of the self-hosted HTTP Server in the `Service URL` field. 
4. If the signature verification is enabled, copy and paste the key in the `Signature Key` field.

After clicking `Save`, the set-up is complete. You now can move on to [create a notification event](https://docs.apidog.com/notification-settings-616240m0.md#notification-events).

### Jenkins

It supports sending notification events to Jenkins service. By configuring Jenkins Webhook URL, event messages can be sent to Jenkins.

**Configuration field descriptions:**

| **Configuration Field** | **Required** | **Description** |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Notification Name** | No | Give a name to the third-party integration notification to record its purpose. |
| **Trigger Events** | Yes | API changes, Data model changes, Import data, Automation testing. Real-time notifications will be triggered when any of the above events occur. |
| **Service URL** | Yes | The URL is configured in the [Generic Webhook Trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/) plugin. |
| **Signature Auth** | No | Sent to the [Generic Webhook Trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/) plugin via the Authorization Bearer header. |

#### Integrating Apidog Notification with Jenkins Service

Project admins can use third-party integration functionality to associate the Webhook URL configured in the Jenkins [Generic Webhook Trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/) plugin with project notification events in Apidog, to trigger a build action in Jenkins automatically when events such as API changes, document changes, and automation test completions are triggered, and view messages in the build history.

<details>
<summary>📷 Step 1: Webhook URL configured in Jenkins Generic Webhook Trigger plugin</summary>

Create a new view on the Jenkins Dashboard:

</Background>

- Fill in the notification target name.
- Choose `Jenkins` as the channel
- Paste the Webhook URL configured in the [Generic Webhook Trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/) plugin in the `Service URL` field
- If a custom token is used, copy and paste the `Token` into the `Signature Token` field.

</details>

After clicking `Save`, the set-up is complete. You now can move on to [create a notification event](https://docs.apidog.com/notification-settings-616240m0.md#notification-events).

Once the notification event is set up and triggered, Jenkins will automatically initiate a build action and you can view the message in the build history:

After clicking `Save`, the set-up is complete. You now can move on to [create a notification event](https://docs.apidog.com/notification-settings-616240m0.md#notification-events).

## Notification Events

You can create notification events to specify which events will trigger notifications to designated recipients (notification targets). To set up a notification event, you need to configure:
- Notification Event Name
- Trigger Event
- Notification Targets

<details>
<summary>📷 Visual Reference</summary>

<Background>
![creating-notification-events.png](https://api.apidog.com/api/v1/projects/544525/resources/350637/image-preview)
</Background>

</details>

### Trigger Event

You can choose from the following notification events to trigger the notification:

| Trigger Event | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Endpoint Changed** | Endpoint Created<br> Endpoint Updated <br> Endpoint Deleted |
| **Schema Changed** | Schema Created<br> Schema Updated<br> Schema Deleted |
| **Document Changed** | Document Created<br> Document Updated<br> Document Deleted |
| **Data Import** | Import (Manual Import)<br> Import (Auto Sync) |
| **Response Component Changed** | Response Component Created<br> Response Component Updated<br> Response Component Deleted |
| **Sprint Branch Changed** | Sprint Branch Merged<br> Sprint Branch Created<br> Sprint Branch Archived<br> Sprint Branch Deleted<br> Sprint Branch Retrieved |
| **API Version Changed** | API Version Created<br> API Version Deleted |
| **Security Scheme Changed** | Security Scheme Created<br> Security Scheme Updated<br> Security Scheme Deleted |

:::tip
For notifications related to automated tests (e.g., automated test completed, continuous integration completed, scheduled task completed), you need to configure the settings individually for each test scenario. This approach is more flexible and better suits real-world use cases.
:::

### Notification Targets

Choose which notification targets will receive the notification when a trigger event happens. You can choose from the notification targets that have already been set up in the project and select multiple targets if needed.

However, email notifications are only supported for three specific events:

- Automated test completed/failed
- Continuous integration completed/failed
- Scheduled tasks completed/failed
