## Other Features

Apidog also offers **Additional tools** and modes to enhance your debugging practices and API development workflow.

- **[Design-First vs. Request-First](https://docs.apidog.com/design-first-vs-request-first-541775m0.md):** Switch between design and debug modes to either focus on crafting your API specifications or debugging your API implementations.
- **[Generating Code](https://docs.apidog.com/generating-code-541770m0.md):** Automatically generate code snippets in various programming languages to help developers integrate with the API or reproduce issues locally.
- **[Auto-Generate API Spec from Requests](https://docs.apidog.com/saving-requests-as-endpoints-629856m0.md):** If your API specification is outdated or missing, Apidog can reverse-engineer an API spec from the requests.

By leveraging Apidog’s comprehensive suite of debugging features, developers can significantly reduce the time and effort needed for API testing, ensuring robust, reliable, and scalable API solutions.

## Best Practices for Different Teams

### For API Design-First Teams

Once the API design is complete, the backend development team can use the API Spec for developing and debugging the API. Apidog offers the following development and debugging features:

#### Before Development

- **[Generating Code](https://docs.apidog.com/generating-code-541770m0.md)**: Apidog allows for the generation of client SDKs, server stubs, and API documentation in various programming languages based on the API specification. This automated process saves time and ensures consistency when implementing APIs.

#### After Development

- **[Generating Requests](https://docs.apidog.com/generating-requests-541765m0.md)**: Apidog allows you to generate requests based on the API specification.
- **[Dynamic Values](https://docs.apidog.com/dynamic-values-541766m0.md)**: Dynamic values allow you to generate a new value based on a predefined rule every time you send a request. This helps streamline the debugging process and ensures that each request contains unique data.
- **[Environments and Variables](https://docs.apidog.com/environments-variables-in-apidog-577823m0.md)**: Apidog supports the configuration of different environments and services, allowing developers to switch between settings for development, testing, and production environments. This feature provides flexibility in testing APIs under various conditions.
- **[Validating Responses](https://docs.apidog.com/validating-responses-541768m0.md)**: Developers can validate API responses against predefined schemas or criteria to ensure that the data returned by the API meets the expected format and content. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency across API responses.
- **[Pre- and Post-Processors](https://docs.apidog.com/prepost-processors-in-apidog-588246m0.md)**: Apidog enables the definition of pre and post-processing steps that can be executed before and after API requests are sent. These operations can include data manipulation, logging, error handling, or any necessary actions to prepare for or handle the API response.
- **[Scripting](https://docs.apidog.com/use-scripts-in-apidog-593582m0.md)**: Developers have the ability to write and execute scripts within Apidog, allowing for advanced customization and automation of tasks during API development and testing. Scripts can be used to perform complex operations, interact with external systems, or enhance the functionality of API requests and responses.
- **[Debugging Cases](https://docs.apidog.com/debugging-cases-541771m0.md)**: Endpoint Case in Apidog is a pre-defined test case for a specific API endpoint, which is used to streamline the process of creating, managing, and executing API tests, as well as integrating them into automated testing workflows.
