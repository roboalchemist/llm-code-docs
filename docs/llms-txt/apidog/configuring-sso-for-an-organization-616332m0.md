## Creating an Organization

Please refer to the [Managing Organization](https://docs.apidog.com/managing-teams-612998m0.md) guide for instructions on how to create and manage organizations.

After the organization is created, a default name composed of only numbers will be generated. This name is a unique identifier for this organization and is used for URLs related to SSO. Therefore, you can manually change it to a name that is more likely to be recognized by members of your organization.

## Configuring SAML SSO

After successfully creating an organization, you can click SAML SSO to access the SSO configuration page. Please do the following:

1. Turn on the **Require SAML Authentication** switch.
2. Copy the **Sign on URL** from your identity provider (IdP) and fill it in.
3. Copy the **Issuer** from your identity provider (IdP) and fill it in.
4. Get the certificate from your identity provider (IdP) and paste its contents here.
5. Click the save button. Congratulations, you have successfully enabled SSO for the organization.

After you turn on SAML authentication, members of your organization must authenticate with your SAML identity provider (IdP) to access any of the organization's resources.
