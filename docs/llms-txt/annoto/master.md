Annoto is an in-video collaboration solution that enables users to contribute, share and learn together, turning passive 1-way video viewing into an interactive group experience.

Users can lean forward and become active participants, share ideas and create meaningful content, driving all users to be involved and return to the video.

Powered by comprehensive analytics, Annoto provides insights on users and their interactions within the video content, shedding light on how and when users interact with the video content and with each other.
