# Web Services — Host dynamic web apps (Express, Django, etc.) at a public URL.

Render helps you host web apps written in your favorite [language](language-support) and framework: Node.js with Express, Python with Django or FastAPI—you name it. Render builds and deploys your code with every push to your linked Git branch. You can also deploy a prebuilt Docker image.

Every Render web service gets a unique `onrender.com` subdomain, and you can add your own [custom domains](custom-domains). Web services can also communicate with your _other_ Render services over your private network.

> *Your web service must [*bind to a port*](#port-binding)* on host `0.0.0.0` to receive HTTP requests from the public internet. The default expected port is `10000` (you can [configure this](#port-binding)).
>
> If you _don't_ want your app to be reachable via the public internet, create a private service instead of a web service.

## Deploy a template

You can get started on Render by deploying one of our basic app templates:

- [Express](/deploy-node-express-app) (Node.js)
- [Django](/deploy-django) (Python)
- [Ruby on Rails](/deploy-rails-8)
- [Gin](/deploy-go-gin) (Go)
- [Rocket](/deploy-rocket-rust) (Rust)
- [Phoenix](/deploy-phoenix) (Elixir)
- [Laravel](/deploy-php-laravel-docker) (PHP)

## Deploy your own code

You can deploy your web service from a linked [GitHub](github)/[GitLab](gitlab)/[Bitbucket](bitbucket) repo, a public Git repository URL, or a [prebuilt Docker image](/deploying-an-image).

1. [Sign up for Render](https://dashboard.render.com/register) if you haven't yet.
2. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), click *New > Web Service*:

   [image: Selecting Web Service from the New menu]

*Select the source for your web service's code:*

**Git Provider (GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket)**

1. Select *Git Provider*, then connect your [GitHub](github), [GitLab](gitlab), or [Bitbucket](bitbucket) account if you haven't yet.
2. Select a repository from one of your linked provider accounts.
   - You can deploy any public or private repo that your account has access to.
3. In the service creation form, provide the following details:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | A name to identify your service in the Render Dashboard. Your service's `onrender.com` subdomain also incorporates this name. |
| *Region* | The geographic region where your service will run. Your services in the same region can communicate over their shared private network. |
| *Branch* | The branch of the repository to use to build your service. |
| *Language* | Your app's programming language. The service deploys to a runtime that includes the chosen language's build tools and dependencies. Render natively supports [these languages](language-support) and also provides a Docker runtime for building and running a custom image from a `Dockerfile`. |
| *Build Command* | The command for Render to run to build your service from source. Common examples include `npm install` for Node.js and `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python. |
| *Start Command* | The command for Render to run to start your built service. Common examples include `npm start` for Node.js and `gunicorn your_application.wsgi` for Python. |

4. Choose an *instance type* to run your service on:

   [image: Selecting a web service instance type]

   If you choose the Free instance type, note its [limitations](free#free-web-services).

5. Under the *Advanced* section, you can set environment variables and secrets, add a persistent disk, set a [health check path](/deploys#health-checks), and more.

6. Click *Create Web Service*. Render kicks off your service's first build and deploy.
   - You can view the deploy's progress from your service's *Events* page in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).

**Public Git Repository**

> *Use this method only to deploy a public repository you don't belong to.*
>
> Because this method does not use your Git provider credentials, Render does not support [auto-deploys](/deploys#automatic-deploys) or [pull request previews](preview-environments) for services that use it.

1. Select *Public Git Repository*.
2. Enter the URL of a public Git repository (e.g., `https://github.com/render-examples/express-hello-world`) and click *Connect*.
3. In the service creation form, provide the following details:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | A name to identify your service in the Render Dashboard. Your service's `onrender.com` subdomain also incorporates this name. |
| *Region* | The geographic region where your service will run. Your services in the same region can communicate over their shared private network. |
| *Branch* | The branch of the repository to use to build your service. |
| *Language* | Your app's programming language. The service deploys to a runtime that includes the chosen language's build tools and dependencies.

   - You can view the deploy's progress from your service's *Events* page in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).

**Existing Image (Docker)**

1. Select *Existing Image*.
2. Enter the path to your Docker image (e.g., `docker.io/library/nginx:latest`) and click *Connect*.
   - For images in private registries, add your [registry credentials](/deploying-an-image#credentials-for-private-images).
3. In the service creation form, provide the following details:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | A name to identify your service in the Render Dashboard. Your service's `onrender.com` subdomain also incorporates this name. |

## Port binding

*Every Render web service must bind to a port on host `0.0.0.0` to serve HTTP requests.* Render forwards inbound requests to your web service at this port (it is not _directly_ reachable via the public internet).

We recommend binding your HTTP server to the port defined by the `PORT` environment variable. Here's a basic Express example:

```js:app.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 4000 //highlight-line

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

<sup>

_Adapted ever-so-slightly from [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)_

</sup>

*The default value of `PORT` is `10000` for all Render web services.* You can override this value by setting the environment variable for your service in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).

> *If you bind your HTTP server to a different port, Render is _usually_ able to detect and use it.*
>
> If Render fails to detect a bound port, your web service's deploy fails and displays an error in your [logs](logging).

The following ports are reserved by Render and cannot be used:

- `18012`
- `18013`
- `19099`

### Binding to multiple ports

Render forwards inbound traffic to only _one_ HTTP port per web service. However, your web service _can_ bind to additional ports to receive traffic over your private network.

If your service does bind to multiple ports, always bind your public HTTP server to the value of the `PORT` environment variable.

## Connect to your web service

### Connecting from the public internet

Your web service is reachable via the public internet at its `onrender.com` subdomain (along with any [custom domains](custom-domains) you add).

> If you <i>don't</i> want your service to be reachable via the public internet, create a [private service](private-services) instead of a web service.

Render's load balancer terminates SSL for inbound HTTPS requests, then forwards those requests to your web service over HTTP. If an inbound request uses HTTP, Render first redirects it to HTTPS and _then_ terminates SSL for it.

### Connecting from other Render services

See [Private Network](private-network).
