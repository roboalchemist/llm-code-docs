# Day 13: Project Management & Documentation - Linear & Notion

> Build a project management agent that coordinates tasks, tracks progress, and maintains documentation across Linear and Notion.

<Card title="Day 13 challenge" icon="tasks">
  **Goal**: create a project coordination agent with Linear and Notion

  **Theme**: domain specialization week - project intelligence

  **Time investment**: \~20 minutes
</Card>

Welcome to Day 13! Today you'll build a **project management agent** that
bridges task tracking in Linear with documentation in Notion. This agent
understands how modern teams work across multiple tools.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Build a project management agent that coordinates across tools
* Connect Linear for issue tracking and sprint management
* Integrate Notion for documentation and knowledge management
* Create workflows that keep projects and docs in sync

<Warning>
  You'll need access to Linear and Notion workspaces with appropriate
  permissions to complete today's exercises.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding project management patterns

Project agents need to understand:

### Cross-tool coordination

* **Task lifecycle**: From idea in Notion → issue in Linear → documentation
  update
* **Status synchronization**: Keep project status consistent across platforms
* **Knowledge capture**: Document decisions and outcomes, not just track tasks
* **Team collaboration**: Different tools for different team members

<Tip>
  **Multi-tool thinking**: your agent should understand that Linear tracks work
  while Notion captures knowledge—and keep both synchronized.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create your project management agent

Work with Concierge to build a cross-platform coordinator:

```text
I want to create a project management agent that coordinates between Linear and Notion.

The agent should:
- Track sprint progress in Linear and update project docs in Notion
- Create Linear issues from Notion meeting notes and planning docs
- Generate weekly project summaries combining task data and documentation
- Ensure technical decisions in Linear are documented in Notion
- Keep project roadmaps synchronized across both platforms

It should act like a technical project manager who ensures nothing falls through the cracks.
```

## Step 3 connect Linear and Notion

Add both connections to your agent:

**Linear connection**:

* Issue management and creation
* Sprint tracking and velocity
* Project status and milestones
* Team workload visibility

**Notion connection**:

* Documentation reading and updates
* Meeting notes processing
* Knowledge base management
* Project wiki maintenance

## Step 4: Implement coordination workflows

### Workflow 1: Sprint documentation

```text
At the end of each sprint, can you:
1. Summarize completed Linear issues
2. Extract key decisions and technical changes
3. Update our Notion sprint retrospective doc
4. Identify undocumented features that need wiki updates
```

Your agent coordinates:

* Pulls completed issues from Linear
* Identifies important decisions and changes
* Updates Notion with structured summaries
* Flags documentation gaps

### Workflow 2: Meeting to task conversion

```text
I just finished a planning meeting. The notes are in Notion under "Product Planning."
Can you create Linear issues for all the action items we discussed?
```

The agent:

* Reads meeting notes from Notion
* Identifies concrete action items
* Creates properly labeled Linear issues
* Links back to source documentation

## Step 5: Build reusable coordination tasks

<Note>
  **Coming soon** daily scheduled tasks and automated workflows. For now, you'll
  need to interact with your agent through the UI to trigger these workflows.
</Note>

**Daily standup prep**:

```text
Can you prepare a standup summary that includes:
- Yesterday's completed Linear issues
- Today's priorities from Linear
- Any blockers mentioned in Linear comments
- Related Notion docs for context

Post this in our Notion daily standups page.
```

**Documentation health check**:

```text
Can you analyze:
- Linear issues marked "Done" without linked documentation
- Notion pages that reference outdated Linear issues
- Technical decisions in Linear not captured in Notion
- Project timelines that have diverged between tools

Create a "Documentation Debt" report in Notion.
```

<Tip>
  **Pro tip** set a reminder to run these workflows daily or weekly until
  automated scheduling becomes available.
</Tip>

## What you've accomplished

In 20 minutes, you've built a cross-platform project management agent:

**Multi-tool coordination** agent that understands Linear for execution and
Notion for knowledge

**Manual synchronization** keeps tasks and documentation aligned when you run
the workflows

**Workflow intelligence** converts between different information formats

**Gap identification** finds where documentation doesn't match execution

## The power of multi-tool agents

Project management agents that span tools can:

* **Prevent information silos** by connecting execution with documentation
* **Reduce context switching** by bringing information together
* **Capture institutional knowledge** automatically from task execution
* **Improve team alignment** through consistent cross-tool updates

## Pro tip for today

Ask your project agent:

```text
What patterns do you notice between our Linear velocity and our Notion documentation quality?
How can we improve both?
```

This helps your agent develop insights about your team's work patterns.

<Tip>
  **Remember** the best project agents don't just move data between tools—they
  understand how your team works and help improve processes.
