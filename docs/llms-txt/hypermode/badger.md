[Badger](/badger/overview) is a key-value store developed and maintained by
Dgraph. It is also open source, and it's the backing store for Dgraph data.

It is largely transparent to users that Dgraph uses Badger to store data
internally. Badger is packaged into the Dgraph binary, and is the persistence
layer. However, various configuration settings and log messages may reference
Badger, such as cache sizes.

Badger values are `Posting Lists` and indexes. Badger Keys are formed by
concatenating `<RelationshipName>+<NodeUID>`.
