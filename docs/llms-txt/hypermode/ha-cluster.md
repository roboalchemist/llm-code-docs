# Highly Available Cluster Setup

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

You can run three Dgraph Alpha servers and three Dgraph Zero servers in a highly
available cluster setup. For a highly available setup, start the Dgraph Zero
server with `--replicas 3` flag, so that all data is replicated on three Alpha
servers and forms one Alpha group. You can install a highly available cluster
using:

* [dgraph-ha.yaml](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/blob/master/contrib/config/kubernetes/dgraph-ha/dgraph-ha.yaml)
  file
* Helm charts.

### Install a highly available Dgraph cluster using YAML or Helm

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="YAML">
    #### Before you begin

    * Install the
      [Kubernetes command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
    * Ensure that you have a production-ready Kubernetes cluster with at least three
      worker nodes running in a cloud provider of your choice.
    * (Optional) To run Dgraph Alpha with TLS, see
      [TLS Configuration](./tls-configuration).

    #### Installing a highly available Dgraph cluster

    1. Verify that you are able to access the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster:

       ```sh
       kubectl get nodes
       ```

       An output similar to this appears:

       ```sh
         NAME                                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
        <aws-ip-hostname>.<region>.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   1m   v1.15.11-eks-af3caf
        <aws-ip-hostname>.<region>.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   1m   v1.15.11-eks-af3caf
        <aws-ip-hostname>.<region>.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   1m   v1.15.11-eks-af3caf
       ```

       After your Kubernetes cluster is up, you can use
       [dgraph-ha.yaml](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/blob/master/contrib/config/kubernetes/dgraph-ha/dgraph-ha.yaml)
       to start the cluster.

    2. Start a StatefulSet that creates Pods with `Zero`, `Alpha`, and `Ratel UI`:

       ```sh
       kubectl create --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/master/contrib/config/kubernetes/dgraph-ha/dgraph-ha.yaml
       ```

       An output similar to this appears:

       ```sh
       service/dgraph-zero-public created
       service/dgraph-alpha-public created
       service/dgraph-ratel-public created
       service/dgraph-zero created
       service/dgraph-alpha created
       statefulset.apps/dgraph-zero created
       statefulset.apps/dgraph-alpha created
       deployment.apps/dgraph-ratel created
       ```

    3. Confirm that the Pods were created successfully.

       ```sh
       kubectl get pods
       ```

       An output similar to this appears:

       ```sh
        NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
       dgraph-alpha-0        1/1     Running   0          6m24s
       dgraph-alpha-1        1/1     Running   0          5m42s
       dgraph-alpha-2        1/1     Running   0          5m2s
       dgraph-ratel-<pod-id> 1/1     Running   0          6m23s
       dgraph-zero-0         1/1     Running   0          6m24s
       dgraph-zero-1         1/1     Running   0          5m41s
       dgraph-zero-2         1/1     Running   0          5m6s
       ```

       You can check the logs for the Pod using `kubectl logs --follow <POD_NAME>`..

    4. Port forward from your local machine to the Pod:

       ```sh
          kubectl port-forward service/dgraph-alpha-public 8080:8080
          kubectl port-forward service/dgraph-ratel-public 8000:8000
       ```

    5. Go to `http://localhost:8000` to access Dgraph using the Ratel UI.

    <Note> You can also access the service on its External IP address.</Note>

    #### Deleting highly available Dgraph resources

    Delete all the resources using:

    ```sh
    kubectl delete --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/master/contrib/config/kubernetes/dgraph-ha/dgraph-ha.yaml
    kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims --selector app=dgraph-zero
    kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims --selector app=dgraph-alpha
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Helm">
    #### Before you begin

    * Install the
      [Kubernetes command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
    * Ensure that you have a production-ready Kubernetes cluster with at least three
      worker nodes running in a cloud provider of your choice.
    * Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
    * (Optional) To run Dgraph Alpha with TLS, see
      [TLS Configuration](./tls-configuration).

    #### Installing a highly available Dgraph cluster using Helm

    1. Verify that you are able to access the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster:

       ```sh
       kubectl get nodes
       ```

       An output similar to this appears:

       ```sh
         NAME                                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
        <aws-ip-hostname>.<region>.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   1m   v1.15.11-eks-af3caf
        <aws-ip-hostname>.<region>.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   1m   v1.15.11-eks-af3caf
        <aws-ip-hostname>.<region>.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   1m   v1.15.11-eks-af3caf
       ```

       After your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can use of the
       [Dgraph Helm chart](https://github.com/dgraph-io/charts/) to install a highly
       available Dgraph cluster

    2. Add the Dgraph Helm repository:

       ```sh
       helm repo add dgraph https://charts.dgraph.io
       ```

    3. Install the chart with `<RELEASE-NAME>`:

       ```sh
       helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph
       ```

       You can also specify the version using:

       ```sh
         helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph --set image.tag="[version]"
       ```

       When configuring the Dgraph image tag, be careful not to use `latest` or
       `main` in a production environment. These tags may have the Dgraph version
       change, causing a mixed-version Dgraph cluster that can lead to an outage and
       potential data loss.

       An output similar to this appears:

       ```sh
       NAME: <RELEASE-NAME>
       LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Feb  1 21:26:32 2023
       NAMESPACE: default
       STATUS: deployed
       REVISION: 1
       TEST SUITE: None
       NOTES:
       1. You have just deployed Dgraph, version 'v21.12.0'.

           For further information:
           * Documentation: https://docs.hypermode.com/dgraph
           * Community and Issues: https://discuss.hypermode.com/
       2. Get the Dgraph Alpha HTTP/S endpoint by running these commands.
           export ALPHA_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default --selector "statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name=<RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-alpha-0,release=<RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph" --output jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
           echo "Access Alpha HTTP/S using http://localhost:8080"
           kubectl --namespace default port-forward $ALPHA_POD_NAME 8080:8080

         NOTE: Change "http://" to "https://" if TLS was added to the Ingress, Load Balancer, or Dgraph Alpha service.
       ```

    4. Get the name of the Pods in the cluster using `kubectl get pods`:

       ```sh
           NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
         <RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-alpha-0   1/1     Running   0          4m48s
         <RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-alpha-1   1/1     Running   0          4m2s
         <RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-alpha-2   1/1     Running   0          3m31s
         <RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-zero-0    1/1     Running   0          4m48s
         <RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-zero-1    1/1     Running   0          4m10s
         <RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-zero-2    1/1     Running   0          3m50s
       ```

    5. Get the Dgraph Alpha HTTP/S endpoint by running these commands:

       ```sh
           export ALPHA_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default --selector "statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name=<RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph-alpha-0,release=<RELEASE-NAME>-dgraph" --output jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
           echo "Access Alpha HTTP/S using http://localhost:8080"
           kubectl --namespace default port-forward $ALPHA_POD_NAME 8080:8080
       ```

    #### Deleting the resources from the cluster

    1. Delete the Helm deployment using:

       ```sh
         helm delete my-release
       ```

    2. Delete associated Persistent Volume Claims:

       ```sh
       kubectl delete pvc --selector release=my-release
       ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Dgraph configuration files

You can create a Dgraph [configuration](./config) files for Alpha server and
Zero server with Helm chart configuration values, `<MY-CONFIG-VALUES>`. For more
information about the values, see the latest
[configuration settings](https://github.com/dgraph-io/charts/blob/master/charts/dgraph/README.md#configuration).

1. Open an editor of your choice and create a configuration file named
   `<MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   # <MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml
   alpha:
     configFile:
       config.yaml: |
         alsologtostderr: true
         badger:
           compression_level: 3
           tables: mmap
           vlog: mmap
         postings: /dgraph/data/p
         wal: /dgraph/data/w
   zero:
     configFile:
       config.yaml: |
         alsologtostderr: true
         wal: /dgraph/data/zw
   ```

2. Change to the director in which you created `<MY-CONFIG-VALUES>`.yaml and
   then install with Alpha and Zero configuration using:

   ```sh
   helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph --values <MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml
   ```

### Exposing Alpha and Ratel Services

By default Zero and Alpha services are exposed only within the Kubernetes
cluster as Kubernetes service type `ClusterIP`.

In order to expose the Alpha service and Ratel service publicly you can use
Kubernetes service type `LoadBalancer` or an Ingress resource.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LoadBalancer">
    #### Public Internet

    To use an external load balancer, set the service type to `LoadBalancer`.

    <Note>
      For security purposes we recommend limiting access to any public endpoints,
      such as using a white list.
    </Note>

    1. To expose Alpha service to the Internet use:

       ```sh
       helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph --set alpha.service.type="LoadBalancer"
       ```

    2. To expose Alpha and Ratel services to the Internet use:

       ```sh
       helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph --set alpha.service.type="LoadBalancer" --set ratel.service.type="LoadBalancer"
       ```

    ##### Private network

    An external load balancer can be configured to face internally to a private
    subnet rather the public Internet. This way it can be accessed securely by
    clients on the same network, through a VPN, or from a jump server. In
    Kubernetes, this is often configured through service annotations by the
    provider. Here's a small list of annotations from cloud providers:

    | Provider     | Documentation Reference                                                                                        | Annotation                                                        |
    | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | AWS          | [Amazon EKS: Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/load-balancing.html)             | `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"`   |
    | Azure        | [AKS: Internal Load Balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/internal-lb)                                | `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"` |
    | Google Cloud | [GKE: Internal Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/internal-load-balancing) | `cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"`                 |

    As an example, using Amazon [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the provider.

    1. Create a Helm chart configuration values file `<MY-CONFIG-VALUES>`.yaml file:

       ```yaml
       # <MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml
       alpha:
         service:
           type: LoadBalancer
           annotations:
             service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
       ratel:
         service:
           type: LoadBalancer
           annotations:
             service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
       ```

    2. To expose Alpha and Ratel services privately, use:

       ```sh
       helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph --values <MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml
       ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ingress Resource">
    You can expose Alpha and Ratel using an
    [ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
    resource that can route traffic to service resources. Before using this option
    you may need to install an
    [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)
    first, as is the case with [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/) and
    [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), while in the case of
    [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), this comes bundled with a
    default ingress controller. When routing traffic based on the `hostname`, you
    may want to integrate an addon like
    [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) so that DNS
    records can be registered automatically when deploying Dgraph.

    As an example, you can configure a single ingress resource that uses
    [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) for Alpha and Ratel
    services.

    1. Create a Helm chart configuration values file, `<MY-CONFIG-VALUES>`.yaml
       file:

       ```yaml
       # <MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml
       global:
         ingress:
           enabled: false
           annotations:
             kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
           ratel_hostname: "ratel.<my-domain-name>"
           alpha_hostname: "alpha.<my-domain-name>"
       ```

    2. To expose Alpha and Ratel services through an ingress:

       ```sh
       helm install <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph --values <MY-CONFIG-VALUES>.yaml
       ```

    You can run `kubectl get ingress` to see the status and access these through
    their hostname, such as `http://alpha.<my-domain-name>` and
    `http://ratel.<my-domain-name>`

    <Tip>
      Ingress controllers likely have an option to configure access for private
      internal networks. Consult documentation from the ingress controller provider
      for further information.
    </Tip>

### Upgrading the Helm chart

You can update your cluster configuration by updating the configuration of the
Helm chart. Dgraph is a stateful database that requires some attention on
upgrading the configuration carefully to update your cluster to your desired
configuration.

In general, you can use [`helm upgrade`][helm-upgrade] to update the
configuration values of the cluster. Depending on your change, you may need to
upgrade the configuration in multiple steps.

[helm-upgrade]: https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/

To upgrade to an [HA cluster setup](./#ha-cluster-setup-using-kubernetes):

1. Ensure that the shard replication setting is more than one and
   `zero.shardReplicaCount`. For example, set the shard replica flag on the Zero
   node group to 3,`zero.shardReplicaCount=3`.

2. Run the Helm upgrade command to restart the Zero node group:

   ```sh
   helm upgrade <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph [options]
   ```

3. Set the Alpha replica count flag. For example: `alpha.replicaCount=3`.

4. Run the Helm upgrade command again:

   ```sh
   helm upgrade <RELEASE-NAME> dgraph/dgraph [options]
   ```
