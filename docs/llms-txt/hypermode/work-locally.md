# Work Locally

> Seamless local-to-cloud experience for rapid experimentation

By using the Hyp CLI, you can access Hypermode-hosted models defined in your
[app's manifest](/modus/app-manifest). This allows for seamless and rapid
experimentation with new AI models.

## Hyp CLI setup

The Hyp CLI helps you invoke your Hypermode-hosted models from your local Modus
development environment. You can install the Hyp CLI to augment Modus and access
your Hypermode-hosted models.

```sh
npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
```

## Log into Hypermode

Before running `modus dev` to run your Modus app locally, ensure you're logged
into the Hyp CLI with the `hyp login` command.
