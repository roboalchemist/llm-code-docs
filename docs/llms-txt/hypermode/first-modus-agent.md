# Your First Modus Agent

> Build your first Modus Agent in a few minutes

In this quickstart, you'll learn to build your first Modus App with a single
function that demonstrates how to integrate external APIs with AI models. We'll
start with this stateless function, and later you can learn about building
stateful agents that maintain memory and coordinate complex operations.

Our examples use Go, which we recommend for new projects. You can also choose
AssemblyScript if you prefer. For AssemblyScript usage, refer to the
[AssemblyScript SDK overview](/modus/sdk/assemblyscript/overview).

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) - v22 or higher
* Text editor - we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Terminal - access Modus through a command-line interface (CLI)

## Building your first Modus app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Modus CLI">
    Install the Modus CLI to manage your Modus applications.

    ```sh
    npm install -g @hypermode/modus-cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new app">
    Create your first Modus app.

    ```sh
    modus new
    ```

    Choose between Go and AssemblyScript. Both compile to WebAssembly for fast performance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your app locally">
    Start your local development server:

    ```sh
    modus dev
    ```

    This starts your app and provides a URL to access the API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add external connections">
    To connect to external services, add this to your `modus.json`:

    ```json modus.json
    {
      "connections": {
        "zenquotes": {
          "type": "http",
          "baseUrl": "https://zenquotes.io/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an AI model">
    Add an AI model to your manifest:

    ```json
    {
      "models": {
        "text-generator": {
          "sourceModel": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
          "provider": "hugging-face",
          "connection": "hypermode"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up model access">
    Install and authenticate with the Hyp CLI to access Hypermode-hosted models:

    ```sh
      npm install -g @hypermode/hyp-cli
    ```

    Authenticate with your Hypermode account:

    ```sh
      hyp login
    ```

    This connects your local development environment to Hypermode's model infrastructure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first function">
    Create a function that fetches data from an external API and uses AI for analysis:

    <Tab title="Go">
      Create `intelligence.go`:

      ```go intelligence.go
      package main

      import (
        "errors"
        "fmt"
        "strings"

        "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/http"
        "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models"
        "github.com/hypermodeinc/modus/sdk/go/pkg/models/openai"
      )

      type IntelReport struct {
        Quote   string `json:"quote"`
        Author  string `json:"author"`
        Analysis string `json:"analysis,omitempty"`
      }

      const modelName = "text-generator"

      // Fetch a random quote and provide AI analysis
      func GatherIntelligence() (*IntelReport, error) {
        request := http.NewRequest("https://zenquotes.io/api/random")

        response, err := http.Fetch(request)
        if err != nil {
          return nil, err
        }
        if !response.Ok() {
          return nil, fmt.Errorf("request failed: %d %s", response.Status, response.StatusText)
        }

        // Parse the API response
        var quotes []IntelReport
        response.JSON(&quotes)
        if len(quotes) == 0 {
          return nil, errors.New("no data received")
        }

        // Get the quote
        intel := quotes[0]

        // Generate AI analysis
        analysis, err := analyzeIntelligence(intel.Quote, intel.Author)
        if err != nil {
          fmt.Printf("AI analysis failed for %s: %v\n", intel.Author, err)
          intel.Analysis = "Analysis unavailable"
        } else {
          intel.Analysis = analysis
        }

        return &intel, nil
      }

      // Use AI to analyze the quote
      func analyzeIntelligence(quote, author string) (string, error) {
        model, err := models.GetModel[openai.ChatModel](modelName)
        if err != nil {
          return "", err
        }

        prompt := `You are an analyst.
        Provide a brief insight that captures the core meaning
        and practical application of this wisdom in 1-2 sentences.`
        content := fmt.Sprintf("Quote: \"%s\" - %s", quote, author)

        input, err := model.CreateInput(
          openai.NewSystemMessage(prompt),
          openai.NewUserMessage(content),
        )
        if err != nil {
          return "", err
        }

        input.Temperature = 0.7

        output, err := model.Invoke(input)
        if err != nil {
          return "", err
        }

        return strings.TrimSpace(output.Choices[0].Message.Content), nil
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your function">
    Restart your development server:

    ```sh
    modus dev
    ```

    Modus automatically generates a GraphQL API from your functions.
    Since your function is named `GatherIntelligence()`, it becomes a GraphQL query field called `gatherIntelligence`.

    Open the Modus API Explorer at `http://localhost:8686/explorer` to test your function.
    The explorer is fully GraphQL-compatible, so you can issue this query:

    ```graphql
    query {
      gatherIntelligence {
        quote
        author
        analysis
      }
    }
    ```

    You'll receive a response like:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "gatherIntelligence": {
          "quote": "The only way to do great work is to love what you do.",
          "author": "Steve Jobs",
          "analysis": "
            This emphasizes that passion and genuine interest in your work are fundamental drivers of excellence.
            When you love what you do, the effort required for mastery feels less burdensome and innovation flows more naturally.
          "
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Your function now:

    * Fetches data from external APIs
    * Uses AI models for analysis
    * Provides intelligent responses
    * Handles errors gracefully
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor AI calls">
    When running locally, Modus records every AI model call for monitoring and debugging.
    You can see this in the Modus explorer.

    <Note>
      Local inference tracking is supported on Linux and macOS. Windows
      support is incoming.
    </Note>

    You can monitor:

    * Requests sent to AI models
    * Response times and token usage
    * Model performance metrics
    * Error rates and debugging info
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next?

You've successfully built your first Modus function. But this is just the
beginning. Real agents maintain memory, coordinate complex operations, and never
lose their context.

[What's an Agent?](/modus/agents) to learn how to build persistent,
memory-enabled agents that remember every interaction and can coordinate
sophisticated multi-step operations.
