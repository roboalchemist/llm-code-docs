# Retrieve Schema

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

You can retrieve the Dgraph schema containing the list of predicates types and
node types by:

* issuing a query on /query endpoint using the
  [HTTP Client](/dgraph/http#query-current-dql-schema)
* issuing a query using any [DQL client library](/dgraph/sdks/overview)
* using [Ratel UI](/dgraph/ratel/schema)

When using a query, the request body is

```dql
schema {}
```

<Note>
  Unlike regular queries, the schema query isn't surrounded by curly braces.
  Also, schema queries and regular queries can't be combined.
</Note>

You can query for particular schema fields in the query body.

```dql
schema {
  type
  index
  reverse
  tokenizer
  list
  count
  upsert
  lang
}
```

You can also query for particular predicates:

```dql
schema(pred: [name, friend]) {
  type
  index
  reverse
  tokenizer
  list
  count
  upsert
  lang
}
```

<Note>
  If Access Control Lists (ACL) is enabled, then the schema query returns only
  the predicates for which the logged-in ACL user has read access.
</Note>

Types can also be queried. Below are some example queries.

```dql
schema(type: Movie) {}
schema(type: [Person, Animal]) {}
```

Note that type queries don't contain anything between the curly braces. The
output is the entire definition of the requested types.
