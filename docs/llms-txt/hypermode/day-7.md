# Day 7: Meet Concierge - Your AI Agent Builder

> Discover Concierge, Hypermode's AI agent that builds AI agents. Learn to create custom agents from natural language with access to 2,000+ integrations and explore the Modus framework powering production-ready agents.

<Card title="Day 7 challenge" icon="robot">
  **Goal**: collaborate with Concierge to design, name, and deploy your first custom agent

  **Theme**: community week - from problem to deployed agent

  **Time investment**: \~20 minutes
</Card>

Welcome to Day 7! Yesterday you joined the community and unlocked Hypermode Pro.
Today's challenge is to work with **Concierge** to take a problem you're facing,
iterate through the requirements, gather the necessary connections, and emerge
with a named, deployed agent sitting in your sidebar ready for interaction.

This is your first complete agent creation cycle—from idea to deployed teammate.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Meet Concierge and start the iterative agent design challenge
* Work through problem definition, requirements gathering, and connection
  identification
* Collaborate until you have a complete agent specification
* Deploy your named agent to your sidebar, ready for Day 8 configuration
* Share your deployed agent concept with the community

<Warning>
  This requires Hypermode Pro access from Day 6. If you don't have your Pro
  access code yet, use the fast track program or participate in Discord
  community events to unlock additional capabilities.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Meet Concierge - the meta-agent

Concierge is fundamentally different from Sidekick. While Sidekick is a
productivity agent, Concierge is a **meta-agent**—an AI that specializes in
building other AIs using the same advanced reasoning capabilities you've
experienced all week.

**Start a conversation with Concierge:**

```text
Hi Concierge! I'm on Day 7 of the Agents Bootcamp.
I'd like to understand how you help people build custom agents.
What's your process for turning ideas into working agents?
```

Watch how Concierge:

* Explains its role as a collaborative agent builder
* Describes how it helps you think through what you want to solve
* Walks through the discovery process for understanding your needs
* Shows how ideas become specifications that become living agents

<Tip>
  **Agent builder mindset** notice how Concierge approaches agent creation—it
  starts with understanding your problem space, not jumping to solutions.
</Tip>

## Step 2: The iterative design challenge

Your challenge today is to work with Concierge through multiple iterations until
you have a complete agent ready for deployment. This isn't just a
conversation—it's a structured problem-solving process that results in a working
agent.

**Begin the challenge:**

```text
Concierge, I want to take on the Day 7 challenge. I have a problem I'm facing: [describe your challenge or workflow pain point]
Let's work together to turn this into a deployed agent. What do you need to know first?
```

**Example problem areas to consider:**

* Customer research and feedback analysis
* Competitive intelligence and market tracking
* Content creation and social media management
* Sales pipeline management and lead qualification
* Code review and development workflow automation
* Financial analysis and reporting
* Project management and team coordination

**The iterative process you'll experience:**

* **Problem definition** - Concierge helps you clearly articulate the challenge
  you're solving
* **Requirements gathering** - What specific outcomes do you need? What does
  success look like?
* **Capability mapping** - What tools and integrations does your agent need to
  succeed?
* **Personality design** - How should your agent communicate and behave?
* **Connection identification** - Which of the 2,000+ Pro integrations are
  essential?
* **Specification refinement** - Multiple rounds of "what about" and "have you
  considered"
* **Agent naming** - Choosing the perfect name that reflects your agent's role
  and personality
* **Deployment decision** - When both you and Concierge agree it's ready to
  deploy

<Info>
  This iterative process continues until you and Concierge reach consensus that
  your agent specification is complete. Once deployed, your named agent then
  appears in your sidebar, ready for connection configuration on Day 8.
</Info>

<Info>
  Behind the scenes, Concierge is building a comprehensive prompt that captures
  your agent's design. This same process creates the foundation for reusable
  actions you'll learn about on Day 9. Every conversation is building toward
  scalable, repeatable workflows.
</Info>

## Step 3: Share your deployed agent with the community

Once your agent is named and deployed to your sidebar, share your success with
the community for celebration, feedback, and inspiration.

<Card title="Share in Discord Community" icon="discord" href="https://discord.gg/HssAhQE3">
  Post in #agent-bootcamp about the agent you just deployed. Share your
  challenge, solution, and celebrate with other builders completing the Day 7
  challenge.
</Card>

**Share your deployed agent:**

```text
Day 7 Challenge Complete! 🎉

Agent Name: [Your agent's name]
Problem Solved: [Brief description of the challenge]
Key Capabilities: [What your agent can do]
Connections Identified: [Tools it will use]
Ready for Day 8: [Connection configuration and first workflows]

The iterative process with Concierge took [X] rounds of refinement to get it right!
```

**Community benefits:**

* **Celebrate your achievement** of completing the full design-to-deployment
  cycle
* **Get feedback** on your agent's capabilities and potential improvements
* **Inspire others** working through their own Day 7 challenges
* **Learn from deployed agents** others have created today
* **Build relationships** with builders who've solved similar problems

## What you've accomplished today

In just 20 minutes, you've completed the full agent creation cycle:

**Challenged yourself** - Took on the iterative design challenge with Concierge

**Defined your problem** - Clearly articulated the challenge you're solving with
AI

**Gathered requirements** - Worked through capabilities, connections, and
specifications

**Iterated to consensus** - Refined your agent through multiple exchanges until
both you and Concierge were satisfied

**Named and deployed** - Your agent now lives in your sidebar with its own
identity and purpose

**Shared your success** - Celebrated with the community and inspired other
builders

## The power of iterative collaboration

The Day 7 challenge demonstrates why Hypermode's approach is unique:

* **Problem-driven design** starts with real challenges, not theoretical
  capabilities
* **Collaborative refinement** ensures your agent actually solves your specific
  needs
* **Complete cycle** from problem to deployed agent in a single session
* **Ready for action** your agent is positioned for immediate configuration and
  use tomorrow

<Card title="Tomorrow - Day 8" icon="arrow-right" href="/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-8">
  Configure your deployed agent with the right connections and build your first
  sophisticated workflows. Turn your named agent into a working teammate.
</Card>

## Pro tip for today

After your agent is deployed in your sidebar, try this:

```text
What was most challenging about the iterative design process with Concierge?
What surprised me about going from problem to deployed agent in one session?
```

This reflection helps you understand the value of collaborative AI and prepares
you for tomorrow's connection configuration phase.

***

**Time to complete**: \~20 minutes

**Skills learned**: iterative agent design, collaborative problem-solving,
requirement gathering, agent deployment, community engagement

**Next**: day 8 - Configure connections and build sophisticated workflows with
your deployed agent

<Tip>
  **Challenge completed!** You now have a named agent in your sidebar that
  represents a real solution to a real problem. Tomorrow you'll configure its
  connections and watch it come to life with sophisticated workflows.
</Tip>
