## Example conversation

```text
Me: Create a playlist with the same beat as Candyman by Xtina. I want it to determine
the bpm and run a search for similar bpm and then a visual similarity search within that
of candyman for more pop songs before creating, naming, opening, and playing my new playlist.
```

```text
Agent: Here's the plan:

"Candyman" by Christina Aguilera is a pop song with a swing/jazz influence and an energetic,
upbeat tempo. Its BPM (beats per minute) is widely reported as 172.

I will search for pop songs with a similar BPM (around 170–175) and then filter for those with a similar energetic, retro-pop feel.

I'll create, name, and open your new playlist, then play it for you.

Let's get started!
