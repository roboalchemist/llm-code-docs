Dgraph supports [Mutations](./mutation) in JSON or [RDF](./rdf) format. When
using JSON format Dgraph creates nodes and relationships from the JSON structure
and assigns UIDs to nodes.

## Specifying node UIDs

For example, if you run this mutation:

```dql
 {
   "set": [
     {
      "name": "diggy",
      "dgraph.type": "Mascot"
     }
   ]
 }
```

You see that Dgraph responds with

```json
{
  "data": {
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "queries": null,
    "uids": {
      "dg.3162278161.22055": "0xfffd8d72745f0650"
    }
  }
}
```

Meaning that Dgraph has created one node from the JSON. It has used the
identifier `dg.3162278161.22055` during the transaction. And the final UID value
for this node is `0xfffd8d72745f0650`.

You can control the identifier name by specifying a `uid` field in your JSON
data and using the notation: `"uid" : "_:<your-identifier>"`

In this mutation, there are two JSON objects and because they refer to the same
identifier, Dgraph creates only one node:

```dql
   {
   "set": [
     {
      "uid": "_:diggy",
      "name": "diggy",
      "dgraph.type": "Mascot"
     },
     {
      "uid": "_:diggy",
      "species": "badger"
     }
   ]
 }
```

When you run this mutation, you can see that Dgraph returns the UID of the node
that was created with the `diggy` identifier:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "queries": null,
    "uids": { "diggy": "0xfffd8d72745f0691" }
  }
}
```

Note that the `species` field is added to the node already created with `name`
and `dgraph.type` information.

### Referencing existing nodes

You can use the `"uid"` field to reference an existing node. To do so, you must
specify the UID value of the node.

For example:

```dql
   {
   "set": [
     {
      "uid": "0xfffd8d72745f0650",
      "species": "badger"
     }
   ]
 }
```

Adds the `species` information to the node that was created earlier.

## Language support

To set a string value for a specific language, append the language tag to the
field name. In case, `species` predicate has the @lang directive, the JSON
mutation

```dql
   {
   "set": [
     {
      "uid": "_:diggy",
      "name": "diggy",
      "dgraph.type": "Mascot",
      "species@en" : "badger",
      "species@fr" : "blaireau"
     }
   ]
 }
```

Dgraph sets the `species` string predicate in English and in French.

## Geolocation support

Geo-location data must be specified using keys `type` and `coordinates` in the
JSON document. The supported types are `Point`, `Polygon`, or `MultiPolygon` .

```dql
 {
   "set": [
     {
      "name": "diggy",
      "dgraph.type": "Mascot",
      "home" : {
          "type": "Point",
          "coordinates": [-122.475537, 37.769229 ]
       }
     }
   ]
 }
```

## Relationships

Relationships are simply created from the nested structure of JSON.

For example:

```dql
 {
   "set": [
     {
      "uid": "_:diggy",
      "name": "diggy",
      "dgraph.type": "Mascot",
      "food" : [
        {
          "uid":"_:f1",
          "name": "earthworms"
        },
        {
          "uid":"_:f2",
          "name": "apples"
        }]
     }
   ]
 }

```

This result in the creation of three nodes and the `food` predicate as a
relationship.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "code": "Success",
    "message": "Done",
    "queries": null,
    "uids": {
      "diggy": "0xfffd8d72745f06d7",
      "f1": "0xfffd8d72745f06d8",
      "f2": "0xfffd8d72745f06d9"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use references to existing nodes at any level of your nested JSON.

## Deleting literal values

To delete node predicates, specify the UID of the node you are changing and
set\
the predicates to delete to the JSON value `null`.

For example, to remove the predicate `name` from node `0xfffd8d72745f0691` :

```dql
{
   "delete": [
     {
      "uid": "0xfffd8d72745f0691",
      "name": null
     }
   ]
}
```

## Deleting relationship

A relationship can be defined with a cardinality of 1 or many (list). Setting a
relationship to `null` removes all the relationships.

```JSON
{
  "uid": "0xfffd8d72745f06d7",
  "food": null
}
```

To delete a single relationship in a list, you must specify the target node of
the relationship.

```dql
{
   "delete": [
      {
      "uid": "0xfffd8d72745f06d7",
      "food": {
          "uid": "0xfffd8d72745f06d9"
        }
      }
   ]
}

```

deletes only one `food` relationship.

To delete all predicates of a given node:

* make sure the node has a `dgraph.type` predicate
* the type is defined in the [Dgraph types schema](./schema)
* run a delete mutation specifying only the UID field

```JSON
{
   "delete": [
      {
        "uid": "0x123"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Handling arrays

To create a predicate as a list of string:

```JSON
{
   "set": [
    {
      "testList": [
        "Grape",
        "Apple",
        "Strawberry",
        "Banana",
        "watermelon"
      ]
    }
   ]
}
```

For example, if `0x06` is the UID of the node created.

To remove one value from the list:

```JSON
{
  "delete": {
    "uid": "0x6", #UID of the list.
    "testList": "Apple"
  }
}
```

To remove multiple values:

```JSON
{
  "delete": {
    "uid": "0x6",
    "testList": [
          "Strawberry",
          "Banana",
          "watermelon"
        ]
  }
}
```

To add a value:

```JSON
{
   "uid": "0x6", #UID of the list.
   "testList": "Pineapple"
}
```

## Adding facets

Facets can be created by using the `|` character to separate the predicate and
facet key in a JSON object field name. This is the same encoding schema used to
show facets in query results. E.g.

```JSON
{
  "name": "Carol",
  "name|initial": "C",
  "dgraph.type": "Person",
  "friend": {
    "name": "Daryl",
    "friend|close": "yes",
    "dgraph.type": "Person"
  }
}
```

Facets don't contain type information but Dgraph tries to guess a type from the
input. If the value of a facet can be parsed to a number, it is converted to
either a float or an int. If it can be parsed as a Boolean, it is stored as a
Boolean. If the value is a string, it is stored as a datetime if the string
matches one of the time formats that Dgraph recognizes (`YYYY`, `MM-YYYY`,
`DD-MM-YYYY`, RFC339, etc.) and as a double-quoted string otherwise. If you do
not want to risk the chance of your facet data being misinterpreted as a time
value, it's best to store numeric data as either an int or a float.

## Deleting facets

To delete a `Facet`, overwrite it. When you run a mutation for the same entity
without a `Facet`, the existing `Facet` is deleted automatically.

## Facets in list

Schema:

```sh
<name>: string @index(exact).
<nickname>: [string] .
```

To create a List-type predicate you need to specify all value in a single list.
Facets for all predicate values should be specified together. It is done in map
format with index of predicate values inside list being map key and their
respective facets value as map values. Predicate values that don't have facets
values are excluded from the facets map.

```JSON
{
  "set": [
    {
      "uid": "_:Julian",
      "name": "Julian",
      "nickname": ["Jay-Jay", "Jules", "JB"],
      "nickname|kind": {
        "0": "first",
        "1": "official",
        "2": "CS-GO"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Above you see that there are three values ​​to enter the list with their
respective facets. You can run this query to check the list with facets:

```graphql
{
   q(func: eq(name,"Julian")) {
    uid
    nickname @facets
   }
}
```

Later, if you want to add more values ​​with facets, just do the same procedure,
but this time instead of using Blank-node you must use the actual node's UID.

```JSON
{
  "set": [
    {
      "uid": "0x3",
      "nickname|kind": "Internet",
      "nickname": "@JJ"
    }
  ]
}
```

And the final result is:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "q": [
      {
        "uid": "0x3",
        "nickname|kind": {
          "0": "first",
          "1": "Internet",
          "2": "official",
          "3": "CS-GO"
        },
        "nickname": [
          "Jay-Jay",
          "@JJ",
          "Jules",
          "JB"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Reserved values

The string values `uid(...)`, `val(...)` aren't accepted.
