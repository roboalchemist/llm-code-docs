**Apply your code:**

1. **Copy the Pro access code** from the modal
2. **Refresh your workspace** to see Pro features

Once complete, you'll see the Concierge agent appear in your sidebar:

**Pro features now unlocked:**

* **Concierge agent** available in your workspace sidebar
* **Extended connection library** with 2,000+ options
* **Custom agent creation** capabilities unlocked
* **Advanced workflow tools** accessible

{/* <!-- trunk-ignore(vale/error) --> */}

## Step 3: meet Concierge

**Concierge** is fundamentally different from Sidekick. While Sidekick is a
productivity agent, Concierge is a meta-agent—an AI that specializes in building
other AIs.

**Start a brief conversation with Concierge:**

```text
Hi Concierge! I just unlocked Pro through the fast track program. Can you tell me what you do and how you help build custom agents?
```

Watch how Concierge:

* Explains its role as an agent builder
* Describes the types of agents it can create
* Outlines the agent creation process
* Connects business needs to technical capabilities

<Tip>
  **Meta-AI concept** Concierge represents a new category of AI—agents that
  create other agents. Tomorrow you'll experience this firsthand.
</Tip>

{/* <!-- trunk-ignore(vale/error) --> */}

## Step 4: understand what Pro unlocks

With Hypermode Pro access, here's what becomes available:

### 2,000+ integrations

Beyond Sidekick's built-in capabilities, Pro gives you access to:

* **Development tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Vercel
* **Business tools**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, QuickBooks
* **Productivity**: Notion, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace
* **Data platforms**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Tableau, Looker
* **Custom APIs**: Connect your internal tools and services
* **And more**: virtually any tool your agents might need

### Custom agent creation

* Sales pipeline management
* Customer support automation
* Marketing insights and reporting
* Developer productivity tools
* Content creation and management

### Additional capabilities

* **Multi-agent workflows**: Agents that work together on complex tasks
* **Custom tool integration**: Connect proprietary systems and APIs
* **Advanced monitoring**: Deep insights into agent performance
* **Export to code**: Production-ready applications when you're ready

<Info>
  Pro isn't just about more features—it's about moving from using agents to
  building agent-powered solutions for your specific needs.
</Info>

## What's changing tomorrow

With Hypermode Pro access, Day 7 transforms from learning to building:

**Today (Day 6)** Understanding Pro capabilities and meeting Concierge

**Tomorrow (Day 7)** Creating your first custom agent with Concierge using
natural language

**Day 8** Give your agent the tools it needs

**Day 9** Creating reusable tasks from successful workflows

**Day 10** Week 2 reflection and strategic planning

## Community connection

While the fast track gives you immediate access, connecting with the community
enhances your learning:

<Card title="Join the Discord Community" icon="discord" href="https://discord.gg/HssAhQE3">
  Share your fast track success, connect with other builders, and get
  inspiration for advanced agent projects
</Card>

**Community benefits:**

* **Learn from experience**: See what works in real implementations
* **Get unstuck faster**: Crowdsource solutions to complex challenges
* **Share your wins**: Inspire others with your fast track success

## The community advantage

Unlike other platforms that limit Pro access, Hypermode's community approach:

* **Builds genuine connections** between agent builders working on similar
  challenges
* **Ensures active learning** through required community participation
* **Provides ongoing support** through live streams and collaborative
  discussions
* **Creates accountability** by connecting you with other builders on the same
  journey

<Card title="Tomorrow - Day 7" icon="arrow-right" href="/agents/30-days-of-agents/day-7">
  Meet Concierge in depth and create your first custom agent from natural
  language. Transform your specific domain knowledge into an intelligent agent.
</Card>

## Pro tip for today

Before tomorrow's session, think about:

```

This preparation helps you hit the ground running when building with Concierge
tomorrow.
