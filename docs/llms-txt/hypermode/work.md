# Work with your agent in threads

> Interact with your agent in natural language by giving your agent tasks to complete on your behalf.

**Threads is where ideas become agents.** it's a conversational interface that
lets you build, train, and refine AI agents through natural language—no coding
required.

### General guidance

* **Start simple:** Begin with a basic use case or workflow. Don't try to build
  a complex agent right away—get comfortable with the basics first.
  * You're going to need to learn to speak “agent.” You'll find some phrases are
    obvious to you but very ambiguous to an agent. The more you use Hypermode,
    the more it becomes natural.
* **Define clear goals:** Know what you want your agent to accomplish. Write
  down the specific tasks or problems you want the agent to solve.
  * For example, "goal: update the hero text on the website" then going into the
    rest of your instructions.
* **Understand inputs/outputs:** Learn what information (inputs) your agent
  needs and what kind of results (outputs) to produce.
  * Click to expand the tool calls you see streaming by as your agent works.
    Start to build an intuition around how your agent is executing work.
* **Use step-by-step instructions:** Break down tasks into small, logical steps.
  Agents perform best when instructions are clear and sequential.
* **Use check steps:** Frequently request an agent to check its work and verify
  that specific steps are completed. Today's AI is very eager to please,
  unfortunately that means it lies frequently about tasks being completed. Ask
  it to double check that specific actions have been taken.
