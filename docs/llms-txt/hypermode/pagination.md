# Pagination

Pagination allows returning only a portion, rather than the whole, result set.
This can be useful for top-k style queries as well as to reduce the size of the
result set for client side processing or to allow paged access to results.

Pagination is often used with [sorting](./sorting).

<Note>
  Without a sort order specified, the results are sorted by `uid`, which is
  assigned randomly. So the ordering, while deterministic, might not be what you
  expected.
</Note>

## First

Syntax Examples:

* `q(func: ..., first: N)`
* `predicate (first: N) { ... }`
* `predicate @filter(...) (first: N) { ... }`

For positive `N`, `first: N` retrieves the first `N` results, by sorted or UID
order.

For negative `N`, `first: N` retrieves the last `N` results, by sorted or UID
order. Currently, negative is only supported when no order is applied. To
achieve the effect of a negative with a sort, reverse the order of the sort and
use a positive `N`.

Query Example: last two films, by UID order, directed by Steven Spielberg and
the first three genres of those movies, sorted alphabetically by English name.

```dql
{ me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Steven Spielberg")) {
  director.film (first: -2) {
    name@en
    initial_release_date
    genre (orderasc: name@en) (first: 3) {
      name@en
    }
  }
}
}
```

Query Example: the three directors named Steven who have directed the most
actors of all directors named Steven.

```dql
{
  ID as var(func: allofterms(name@en, "Steven")) @filter(has(director.film)) {
    director.film {
      stars as count(starring)
    }
    totalActors as sum(val(stars))
  }

  directors(func: uid(ID), orderdesc: val(totalActors), first: 3) {
    name@en
  }
}
```

## Offset

Syntax Examples:

* `q(func: ..., offset: N)`
* `predicate (offset: N) { ... }`
* `predicate (first: M, offset: N) { ... }`
* `predicate @filter(...) (offset: N) { ... }`

With `offset: N` the first `N` results aren't returned. Used in combination with
first, `first: M, offset: N` skips over `N` results and returns the following
`M`.

<Note>
  Skipping over `N` results takes time proportional to `N` (complexity `O(N)`).
  In other words, the larger `N`, the longer it takes to compute the result set.
  Prefer [after](./#after) over `offset`.
</Note>

Query Example: order Hark Tsui's films by English title, skip over the first 4
and return the following 6.

```dql
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Hark Tsui")) {
    name@zh
    name@en
    director.film (orderasc: name@en) (first:6, offset:4) {
      genre {
        name@en
      }
      name@zh
      name@en
      initial_release_date
    }
  }
}
```

## After

Syntax Examples:

* `q(func: ..., after: UID)`
* `predicate (first: N, after: UID) { ... }`
* `predicate @filter(...) (first: N, after: UID) { ... }`

Another way to get results after skipping over some results is to use the
default UID ordering and skip directly past a node specified by UID. For
example, a first query could be of the form `predicate (after: 0x0, first: N)`,
or just `predicate (first: N)`, with subsequent queries of the form
`predicate(after: <uid of last entity in last result>, first: N)`.

<Note>
  Skipping over results with `after` takes constant time (complexity `O(1)`). In
  other words, no matter how many results are skipped, no extra time adds to
  computing the result set. This should be preferred over [offset](./#offset).
</Note>

Query Example: the first five of Baz Luhrmann's films, sorted by UID order.

```dql
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Baz Luhrmann")) {
    name@en
    director.film (first:5) {
      uid
      name@en
    }
  }
}
```

The fifth movie is the Australian movie classic Strictly Ballroom. It has UID
`0x99e44`. The results after Strictly Ballroom can now be obtained with `after`.

```dql
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Baz Luhrmann")) {
    name@en
    director.film (first:5, after: 0x99e44) {
      uid
      name@en
    }
  }
}
```
