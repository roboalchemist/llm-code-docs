# Error Handling

> Easily debug and handle errors

Error handling in Modus makes it simple to have both a clear debugging process
for developers and informative responses for end-users.

### Logging errors

The Console API in the Modus SDK is globally available in all functions. It
allows developers to capture log messages and errors, which are automatically
included in Modus runtime execution logs.

<Tip>
  When deployed to Hypermode, function logs are available in the Hypermode
  Console on the [Function Runs](../observe-functions#function-runs) page.
</Tip>

The Console API provides five logging functions:

```go
console.log("This is a simple log message.")
console.debug("This is a debug message.")
console.info("This is an info message.")
console.warn("This is a warning message.")
console.error("This is an error message.")
```

### Error reporting in GraphQL

GraphQL responses have a standard structure that includes both `data` and
`errors` sections. Modus allows for the inclusion of error codes or messages
within the `errors` section to allow for downstream processing in addition to
debugging.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts Go
  // in Go, error handling is typically done by returning an `error` object as the
  // last result of a function; Modus transforms this into logging and error handling
  // automatically, ensuring all errors are logged before being sent to the response
  func TestError(input string) (string, error) {
      if input == "" {
          return "", errors.New("input is empty")
      }
      return "You said: " + input, nil
  }
  ```

  ```ts AssemblyScript
  export function TestError(input: string): string {
    if (input == "") {
      console.error("input is empty")
      // this is a non-fatal error reported in GraphQL response.
      // the function continues
      return "Can't process your input"
    }

    if (input == "error") {
      throw new Error(`This is a fatal error.`)
      // a fatal error appears in the log
      // the errors section in GraphQL responses contains only one entry with
      // "message": "error calling function" and the data section is empty
      // the function does not continue
    }

    return "You said: " + input
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Best practices for error handling

* **Handle non-fatal errors** using `console.error`, allowing the function to
  continue. The GraphQL response may have both a `data` section and an `errors`
  section.

* **Handle critical errors** using AssemblyScript `throw` keyword or the Go
  idiomatic error object to stop the function's execution.

* **Return clear error messages**: When returning errors, include concise and
  informative error messages that help diagnose the issue.
