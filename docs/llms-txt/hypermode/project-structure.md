# Project Structure

> Understand the structure of a Modus app

{/* vale Google.Passive = NO */}

A Modus app is organized into a set of files and directories that define the
structure of your app. This structure is important for maintaining and scaling
your app as it grows.

{/* vale Google.Passive = YES */}

## Structure

Modus fits within the natural language structure of your app code, with
configuration separated from your source code.

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh Go
  .
  ├── main.go
  ├── ...
  ├── modus.json
  ├── go.mod
  └── go.sum
  ```

  ```sh AssemblyScript
  .
  ├── assembly
      ├── index.ts
      ├── ...
      └── tsconfig.json
  ├── modus.json
  ├── asconfig.json
  ├── package.json
  └── package-lock.json
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## App manifest

The `modus.json` [app manifest](/modus/app-manifest) is the central
configuration file for your Modus app. It defines the endpoints, connections,
and models that your code has available to it during runtime. Because Modus is a
secure-by-default framework, only the resources defined in this file are
accessible to your app.

## Initializing your app

When you initialize your app with the `modus new` command, the Modus CLI
scaffolds your app with the necessary files and directories.
