> Data handling, privacy, and security best practices

At Hypermode, we take security seriously. This document outlines our approach to
data handling, privacy, and security best practices to ensure your projects are
safe and secure.

## System description

Hypermode is a fully managed AI development platform that's designed to offer
easy integration of data and AI models, code-first agents and inferences, and
end-to-end visibility. The platform includes production hosting and
automatically created branch-based environments for apps and graphs, powered by
Modus and Dgraph.

Hypermode Inc. is responsible for the development and maintenance of the
service. Services leverage cloud-hosted infrastructure and we make some
components available as open source software under the Apache 2.0 License.
Relevant code repositories are available publicly through GitHub, and we welcome
contributions by the community, subject to a public code of conduct and GitHub
terms of service.

## Data handling and privacy

Hypermode maintains a strong commitment to protecting your data and privacy. For
detailed information on our data handling and privacy policies, please refer to
our [Privacy Policy](https://hypermode.com/privacy).

## Security best practices

Security is a shared responsibility. To help you keep your projects secure, we
recommend the following best practices:

* **Use strong passwords**: ensure that all user accounts use strong, unique
  passwords
* **Develop secure apps**: implement security and quality coding best practices
  in the code you write and deploy
* **Regularly update dependencies**: keep your project dependencies up-to-date
  to avoid vulnerabilities
* **Monitor for security alerts**: use tools to monitor your codebase for
  security vulnerabilities and address them promptly
* **Manage roles and permissions**: add and remove users from your organization
  as your team members change

## Reporting security issues

We take the security of Hypermode and our open source projects very seriously.
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let
us know right away.

We investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the
problem. Please report any issues or vulnerabilities via GitHub Security
Advisories instead of posting a public issue in GitHub. You can also send
security communications to [security@hypermode.com](mailto:security@hypermode.com).

Please include the version identifier and details on how the you can exploit the
vulnerability.

We appreciate your help in keeping Hypermode secure.
