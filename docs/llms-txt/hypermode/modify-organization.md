# Modify Organization

> Update organization attributes or delete your organization

Organizations contain a set of related projects and members. This forms the
billing envelope for Hypermode. You can modify your organization's name and slug
through the settings.

## Update organization name

Your organization name is a display name only and changing it doesn't impact
your running apps. To update your organization display name, click your
organization's name in the top navigation. Then, click **Settings** →
**General**. Enter a new name and click **Save**.

## Update organization slug

From your organization home view, click **Settings** → **General**. Enter a new
slug and click **Save**.

<Warning>
  When you update the organization slug, Hypermode reflects the new slug in your
  app endpoints across all projects. You must update any existing integrations
  that use the existing app endpoints. Make sure to communicate these changes
  with your team or stakeholders.
</Warning>

## Delete organization

If you no longer need an organization, you can permanently delete it. To delete
an organization, you must [delete all projects](/modify-project#delete-project)
first.

To delete an organization, click your organization's name in the top navigation.
Then, click **Settings** → **Delete**. Click **Delete** and enter the
organization's name as confirmation. This action is irreversible and permanently
deletes your organization.
