<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please

Dgraph Lambdas are JavaScript functions that can be used during query or
mutation processing to extend GraphQL or DQL queries and mutations. Lambdas are
not related at all to AWS Lambdas.
