Dgraph creates a GraphQL API from nothing more than GraphQL types. That's great,
and gets you moving fast from an idea to a running app. However, at some point,
as your app develops, you might want to customize the behavior of your schema.

In Dgraph, you do that with code (in any language you like) that implements
custom resolvers.

Dgraph doesn't execute your custom logic itself. It makes external HTTP
requests. That means, you can deploy your custom logic into the same Kubernetes
cluster as your Dgraph instance, deploy and call, for example, AWS Lambda
functions, or even make calls to existing HTTP and GraphQL endpoints.

## The `@custom` directive

There are three places you can use the `@custom` directive and thus tell Dgraph
where to apply custom logic.

1. You can add custom queries to the Query type

   ```graphql
   type Query {
     myCustomQuery(...): QueryResultType @custom(...)
   }
   ```

2. You can add custom mutations to the Mutation type

   ```graphql
   type Mutation {
       myCustomMutation(...): MutationResult @custom(...)
   }
   ```

3. You can add custom fields to your types

   ```graphql
   type MyType {
        ...
        customField: FieldType @custom(...)
        ...
   }
   ```

The `@custom` directive is used to define custom queries, mutations and fields.

In all cases, the result type (of the query, mutation, or field) can be either:

* a type that's stored in Dgraph (that's any type you've defined in your
  schema), or
* a type that's not stored in Dgraph and is marked with the `@remote` directive.

Because the result types can be local or remote, you can call other HTTP
endpoints, call remote GraphQL, or even call back to your Dgraph instance to add
extra logic on top of Dgraph's graph search or mutations.

Here's the GraphQL definition of the directives:

```graphql
directive @custom(http: CustomHTTP) on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @remote on OBJECT | INTERFACE

input CustomHTTP {
  url: String!
  method: HTTPMethod!
  body: String
  graphql: String
  mode: Mode
  forwardHeaders: [String!]
  secretHeaders: [String!]
  introspectionHeaders: [String!]
  skipIntrospection: Boolean
}

enum HTTPMethod {
  GET
  POST
  PUT
  PATCH
  DELETE
}
enum Mode {
  SINGLE
  BATCH
}
```

Each definition of custom logic must include:

* the `url` where the custom logic is called. This can include a path and
  parameters that depend on query/mutation arguments or other fields.
* the HTTP `method` to use in the call. For example, when calling a REST
  endpoint with `GET`, `POST`, etc.

Optionally, the custom logic definition can also include:

* a `body` definition that can be used to construct a HTTP body from arguments
  or fields.
* a list of `forwardHeaders` to take from the incoming request and add to the
  outgoing HTTP call. Used, for example, if the incoming request contains an
  auth token that must be passed to the custom logic.
* a list of `secretHeaders` to take from the `Dgraph.Secret` defined in the
  schema file and add to the outgoing HTTP call. Used, for example, for a server
  side API key and other static value that must be passed to the custom logic.
* the `graphql` query/mutation to call if the custom logic is a GraphQL server
  and whether to introspect or not (`skipIntrospection`) the remote GraphQL
  endpoint.
* `mode` which is used for resolving fields by calling an external GraphQL
  query/mutation. It can either be `BATCH` or `SINGLE`.
* a list of `introspectionHeaders` to take from the `Dgraph.Secret`
  [object](#dgraphsecret) defined in the schema file. They're added to the
  introspection requests sent to the endpoint.

The result type of custom queries and mutations can be any object type in your
schema, including `@remote` types. For custom fields the type can be object
types or scalar types.

The `method` can be any of the HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or
`DELETE`, and `forwardHeaders` is a list of headers that should be passed from
the incoming request to the outgoing HTTP custom request. Let's look at each of
the other `http` arguments in detail.

## Dgraph.Secret

Sometimes you might want to forward some static headers to your custom API which
can't be exposed to the client. This could be an API key from a payment
processor or an auth token for your organization on GitHub. These secrets can be
specified as comments in the schema file and then can be used in `secretHeaders`
and `introspectionHeaders` while defining the custom directive for a
field/query.

```graphql
type Query {
  getTopUsers(id: ID!): [User]
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "http://api.github.com/topUsers"
        method: "POST"
        introspectionHeaders: ["Github-Api-Token"]
        secretHeaders: ["Authorization:Github-Api-Token"]
        graphql: "..."
      }
    )
}

# Dgraph.Secret Github-Api-Token "long-token"
```

In the preceding request, `Github-Api-Token` would be sent as a header with
value `long-token` for the introspection request. For the actual `/graphql`
request, the `Authorization` header would be sent with the value `long-token`.

<Note>
  `Authorization:Github-Api-Token` syntax tells us to use the value for
  `Github-Api-Token` from `Dgraph.Secret` and forward it to the custom API with
  the header key as `Authorization`.
</Note>

## The URL and method

The URL can be as simple as a fixed URL string, or include details drawn from
the arguments or fields.

A simple string might look like:

```graphql
type Query {
  myCustomQuery: MyResult
    @custom(http: { url: "https://my.api.com/theQuery", method: GET })
}
```

While, in more complex cases, the arguments of the query/mutation can be used as
a pattern for the URL:

```graphql
type Query {
  myGetPerson(id: ID!): Person
    @custom(http: { url: "https://my.api.com/person/$id", method: GET })

  getPosts(authorID: ID!, numToFetch: Int!): [Post]
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/person/$authorID/posts?limit=$numToFetch"
        method: GET
      }
    )
}
```

In this case, a query like

```graphql
query {
  getPosts(authorID: "auth123", numToFetch: 10) {
    title
  }
}
```

gets transformed to an outgoing HTTP GET request to the URL
`https://my.api.com/person/auth123/posts?limit=10`.

When using custom logic on fields, the URL can draw from other fields in the
type. For example:

```graphql
type User {
    username: String! @id
    ...
    posts: [Post] @custom(http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/person/$username/posts",
        method: GET
    })
}
```

Note that:

* Fields or arguments used in the path of a URL, such as `username` or
  `authorID` in the preceding examples, must be marked as non-nullable (have `!`
  in their type); whereas, those used in parameters, such as `numToFetch`, can
  be nullable.
* Currently, only scalar fields or arguments are allowed to be used in URLs or
  bodies; though, see body below, this doesn't restrict the objects you can
  construct and pass to custom logic functions.
* Currently, the body can only contain alphanumeric characters in the key and
  other characters like `_` aren't yet supported.
* Currently, constant values are also not allowed in the body template. This
  would soon be supported.

## The body

Many HTTP requests, such as add and update operations on REST APIs, require a
JSON formatted body to supply the data. In a similar way to how `url` allows
specifying a url pattern to use in resolving the custom request, Dgraph allows a
`body` pattern that's used to build HTTP request bodies.

For example, this body can be structured JSON that relates a mutation's
arguments to the JSON structure required by the remote endpoint.

```graphql
type Mutation {
    newMovie(title: String!, desc: String, dir: ID, imdb: ID): Movie @custom(http: {
            url: "http://myapi.com/movies",
            method: "POST",
            body: "{ title: $title, imdbID: $imdb, storyLine: $desc, director: { id: $dir }}",
    })
```

A request with
`newMovie(title: "...", desc: "...", dir: "dir123", imdb: "tt0120316")` is
transformed into a `POST` request to `http://myapi.com/movies` with a JSON body
of:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "imdbID": "tt0120316",
  "storyLine": "...",
  "director": {
    "id": "dir123"
  }
}
```

`url` and `body` templates can be used together in a single custom definition.

For both `url` and `body` templates, any non-null arguments or fields must be
present to evaluate the custom logic. And the following rules are applied when
building the request from the template for nullable arguments or fields.

* If the value of a nullable argument is present, it's used in the template.
* If a nullable argument is present, but null, then in a body `null` is
  inserted, while in a url nothing is added. For example, if the `desc` argument
  above is null then `{ ..., storyLine: null, ...}` is constructed for the body.
  Whereas, in a URL pattern like `https://a.b.c/endpoint?arg=$gqlArg`, if
  `gqlArg` is present, but null, the generated URL is
  `https://a.b.c/endpoint?arg=`.
* If a nullable argument is not present, nothing is added to the URL/body. That
  would mean the constructed body would not contain `storyLine` if the `desc`
  argument is missing, and in `https://a.b.c/endpoint?arg=$gqlArg` the result
  would be `https://a.b.c/endpoint` if `gqlArg` weren't present in the request
  arguments.

## Calling GraphQL custom resolvers

Custom queries, mutations, and fields can be implemented by custom GraphQL
resolvers. In this case, use the `graphql` argument to specify which
query/mutation on the remote server to call. The syntax includes if the call is
a query or mutation, the arguments, and what query/mutation to use on the remote
endpoint.

For example, you can pass arguments to queries onward as arguments to remote
GraphQL endpoints:

```graphql
type Query {
  getPosts(authorID: ID!, numToFetch: Int!): [Post]
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/graphql"
        method: POST
        graphql: "query($authorID: ID!, $numToFetch: Int!) { posts(auth: $authorID, first: $numToFetch) }"
      }
    )
}
```

You can also define your own inputs and pass those to the remote GraphQL
endpoint.

```graphql
input NewMovieInput { ... }

type Mutation {
    newMovie(input: NewMovieInput!): Movie @custom(http: {
        url: "http://movies.com/graphql",
        method: "POST",
        graphql: "mutation($input: NewMovieInput!) { addMovie(data: $input) }",
    })
```

When a schema is uploaded, Dgraph introspects the remote GraphQL endpoints on
any custom logic that uses the `graphql` argument. From the results of
introspection, it tries to match up arguments and input and object types to
ensure that the calls to and expected responses from the remote GraphQL make
sense.

If that introspection isn't possible, set `skipIntrospection: true` in the
custom definition and Dgraph won't perform GraphQL schema introspection for this
custom definition.

## Remote types

Any type annotated with the `@remote` directive isn't stored in Dgraph. This
allows your Dgraph GraphQL instance to serve an API that includes both data
stored locally and data stored or generated elsewhere. You can also use custom
fields, for example, to join data from disparate datasets.

Remote types can only be returned by custom resolvers and Dgraph won't generate
any search or CRUD operations for remote types.

The schema definition used to define your Dgraph GraphQL API must include
definitions of all the types used. If a custom logic call returns a type not
stored in Dgraph, then that type must be added to the Dgraph schema with the
`@remote` directive.

For example, your API might use custom logic to integrate with GitHub, using
either `https://api.github.com` or the GitHub GraphQL API
`https://api.github.com/graphql` and calling the `user` query. Either way, your
GraphQL schema needs to include the type you expect back from that remote call.
That could be linking a `User` as stored in your Dgraph instance with the
`Repository` data from GitHub. With `@remote` types, that's as simple as adding
the type and custom call to your schema.

```graphql
# GitHub's repository type
type Repository @remote { ... }

# Dgraph user type
type User {
    # local user name = GitHub id
    username: String! @id

    # ...
    # other data stored in Dgraph
    # ...

    # join local data with remote
    repositories: [Repository] @custom(http: {
        url:  "https://api.github.com/users/$username/repos",
        method: GET
    })
}
```

Just defining the connection is all it takes and then you can ask a single
GraphQL query that performs a local query and joins with (potentially many)
remote data sources.

### RemoteResponse directive

In combination with the `@remote` directive, in a GraphQL schema you can also
use the `@remoteResponse` directive. You can define the `@remoteResponse`
directive on the fields of a `@remote` type to map the JSON key response of a
custom query to a GraphQL field.

For example, in the given GraphQL schema there's a defined custom DQL query,
whose JSON response contains the results of the `groupby` clause in the
`@groupby` key. By using the `@remoteResponse` directive you'll map the
`groupby` field in `GroupUserMapQ` type to the `@groupby` key in the JSON
response:

```graphql
type User {
  screen_name: String! @id
  followers: Int @search
  tweets: [Tweets] @hasInverse(field: user)
}
type UserTweetCount @remote {
  screen_name: String
  tweetCount: Int
}
type UserMap @remote {
  followers: Int
  count: Int
}
type GroupUserMapQ @remote {
  groupby: [UserMap] @remoteResponse(name: "@groupby")
}
```

it's possible to define the following `@custom` DQL query:

```graphql
queryUserKeyMap: [GroupUserMapQ] @custom(dql: """
{
  queryUserKeyMap(func: type(User)) @groupby(followers: User.followers) {
    count(uid)
  }
}
""")
```

## How Dgraph processes custom results

Given types like

```graphql
type Post @remote {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    datePublished: DateTime
    author: Author
}

type Author { ... }
```

and a custom query

```graphql
type Query {
  getCustomPost(id: ID!): Post
    @custom(http: { url: "https://my.api.com/post/$id", method: GET })

  getPosts(authorID: ID!, numToFetch: Int!): [Post]
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/person/$authorID/posts?limit=$numToFetch"
        method: GET
      }
    )
}
```

Dgraph turns the `getCustomPost` query into a HTTP request to
`https://my.api.com/post/$id` and expects a single JSON object with fields `id`,
`title`, `datePublished` and `author` as result. Any additional fields are
ignored, while if non-nullable fields (like `id` and `title`) are missing,
GraphQL error propagation is triggered.

For `getPosts`, Dgraph expects the HTTP call to
`https://my.api.com/person/$authorID/posts?limit=$numToFetch` to return a JSON
array of JSON objects, with each object matching the `Post` type as described
above.

If the custom resolvers are GraphQL calls, like:

```graphql
type Query {
  getCustomPost(id: ID!): Post
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/graphql"
        method: POST
        graphql: "query(id: ID) { post(postID: $id) }"
      }
    )

  getPosts(authorID: ID!, numToFetch: Int!): [Post]
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/graphql"
        method: POST
        graphql: "query(id: ID) { postByAuthor(authorID: $id, first: $numToFetch) }"
      }
    )
}
```

then Dgraph expects a GraphQL call to `post` to return a valid GraphQL result
like `{ "data": { "post": {...} } }` and will use the JSON object that is the
value of `post` as the data resolved by the request.

Similarly, Dgraph expects `postByAuthor` to return data like
`{ "data": { "postByAuthor": [ {...}, ... ] } }` and will use the array value of
`postByAuthor` to build its array of posts result.

## How errors from custom endpoints are handled

When a query returns an error while resolving from a custom HTTP endpoint, the
error is added to the `errors` array and sent back to the user in the JSON
response.

When a field returns an error while resolving a custom HTTP endpoint, the
field's value becomes `null` and the error is added to the `errors` JSON array.
The rest of the fields are still resolved as required by the request.

For example, a query from a custom HTTP endpoint will return an error in the
following format:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Rest API returns Error for myFavoriteMovies query",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 5,
          "column": 4
        }
      ],
      "path": ["Movies", "name"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How custom fields are resolved

When evaluating a request that includes custom fields, Dgraph might run multiple
resolution stages to resolve all the fields. Dgraph must also ensure it requests
enough data to forfull the custom fields. For example, given the `User` type
defined as:

```graphql
type User {
    username: String! @id
    ...
    posts: [Post] @custom(http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/person/$username/posts",
        method: GET
    })
}
```

a query such as:

```graphql
query {
  queryUser {
    username
    posts
  }
}
```

is executed by first querying in Dgraph for `username` and then using the result
to resolve the custom field `posts` (which relies on `username`). For a request
like:

```graphql
query {
  queryUser {
    posts
  }
}
```

Dgraph works out that it must first get `username` so it can run the custom
field `posts`, even though `username` isn't part of the original query. So
Dgraph retrieves enough data to satisfy the custom request, even if that
involves data that isn't asked for in the query.

There are currently a few limitations on custom fields:

* each custom call must include either an `ID` or `@id` field
* arguments are not allowed (soon custom field arguments will be allowed and
  will be used in the `@custom` directive in the same manner as for custom
  queries and mutations), and
* a custom field can't depend on another custom field (longer term, we intend to
  lift this restriction).

## Restrictions / Roadmap

Our custom logic is still in beta and we are improving it quickly. Here's a few
points that we plan to work on soon:

* adding arguments to custom fields
* relaxing the restrictions on custom fields using id values
* iterative evaluation of `@custom` and `@remote` - in the current version you
  can't have `@custom` inside an `@remote` type once we add this, you'll be able
  to extend remote types with custom fields, and
* allowing fine tuning of the generated API, for example removing of customizing
  the generated CRUD mutations.

## Example: query

Let's say we want to integrate our app with an existing external REST API.
There's a few things we need to know:

* The URL of the API, the path and any parameters required
* The shape of the resulting JSON data
* The method (GET, POST, etc.), and
* What authorization we need to pass to the external endpoint

The custom query can take any number of scalar arguments and use those to
construct the path, parameters and body (we'll see an example of that in the
custom mutation section) of the request that gets sent to the remote endpoint.

In an app, you'd deploy an endpoint that does some custom work and returns data
that's used in your UI, or you'd wrap some logic or call around an existing
endpoint. So that we can walk through a whole example, let's use the Twitter
API.

To integrate a call that returns the data of Twitter user with our app, all we
need to do is add the expected result type `TwitterUser` and set up a custom
query:

```graphql
type TwitterUser @remote {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    screen_name: String
    location: String
    description: String
    followers_count: Int
    ...
}

type Query{
    getCustomTwitterUser(name: String!): TwitterUser @custom(http:{
        url: "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json?screen_name=$name"
        method: "GET",
        forwardHeaders: ["Authorization"]
    })
}
```

Dgraph will then be able to accept a GraphQL query like

```graphql
query {
  getCustomTwitterUser(name: "dgraphlabs") {
    location
    description
    followers_count
  }
}
```

construct a HTTP GET request to
`https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json?screen_name=dgraphlabs`, attach
header `Authorization` from the incoming GraphQL request to the outgoing HTTP,
and make the call and return a GraphQL result.

The result JSON of the actual HTTP call will contain the whole object from the
REST endpoint (you can see how much is in the Twitter user object
[here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/user-object)).
But, the GraphQL query only asked for some of that, so Dgraph filters out any
returned values that weren't asked for in the GraphQL query and builds a valid
GraphQL response to the query and returns GraphQL.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "getCustomTwitterUser": { "location": ..., "description": ..., "followers_count": ... }
    }
}
```

Your version of the remote type doesn't have to be equal to the remote type. For
example, if you don't want to allow users to query the full Twitter user, you
include in the type definition only the fields that can be queried.

All the usual options for custom queries are allowed; for example, you can have
multiple queries in a single GraphQL request and a mix of custom and Dgraph
generated queries, you can get the result compressed by setting
`Accept-Encoding` to `gzip`, etc.

## Example: mutation

With custom mutations, you can use custom logic to define values for one or more
fields in a mutation.

Let's say we have an app about authors and posts. Logged in authors can add
posts, but we want to do some input validation and add extra value when a post
is added. The key types might be as follows.

```graphql
type Author { ... }

type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String
    text: String
    datePublished: DateTime
    author: Author
    ...
}
```

Dgraph generates an `addPost` mutation from those types, but we want to do
something extra. We don't want the `author` field to come in with the mutation,
that should get filled in from the JWT of the logged in user. Also, the
`datePublished` shouldn't be in the input; it should be set as the current time
at point of mutation. Maybe we also have some community guidelines about what
might constitute an offensive `title` or `text` in a post. Maybe users can only
post if they have enough community credit.

We'll need custom code to do all that, so we can write a custom function that
takes in only the title and text of the new post. Internally, it can check that
the title and text satisfy the guidelines and that this user has enough credit
to make a post. If those checks pass, it then builds a full post object by
adding the current time as the `datePublished` and adding the `author` from the
JWT information it gets from the forward header. It can then call the `addPost`
mutation constructed by Dgraph to add the post into Dgraph and returns the
resulting post as its GraphQL output.

So as well as the types above, we need a custom mutation:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  newPost(title: String!, text: String): Post
    @custom(
      http: {
        url: "https://my.api.com/addPost"
        method: "POST"
        body: "{ postText: $text, postTitle: $title }"
        forwardHeaders: ["AuthHdr"]
      }
    )
}
```

Find out more about how to turn off generated mutations and protecting mutations
with authorization rules at:

* [Remote Types - Turning off Generated Mutations with `@remote` Directive](./overview#remote-types)
* [Securing Mutations with the `@auth` Directive](./auth)

## Example: field

Custom fields allow you to extend your types with custom logic as well as make
joins between your local data and remote data.

Let's say we are building an app for managing projects. Users will login with
their GitHub id and we want to connect some data about their work stored in
Dgraph with say their GitHub profile, issues, etc.

Our first version of our users might start out with just their GitHub username
and some data about what projects they are working on.

```graphql
type User {
  username: String! @id
  projects: [Project]
  tickets: [Ticket]
}
```

We can then add their GitHub repositories by just extending the definitions with
the types and custom field needed to make the remote call.

```graphql
# GitHub's repository type
type Repository @remote { ... }

# Dgraph user type
type User {
    # local user name = GitHub id
    username: String! @id

    # join local data with remote
    repositories: [Repository] @custom(http: {
        url:  "https://api.github.com/users/$username/repos",
        method: GET
    })
}
```

We could similarly join with say the GitHub user details, or open pull requests,
to further fill out the join between GitHub and our local data. Instead of the
REST API, let's use the GitHub GraphQL endpoint

```graphql
# GitHub's User type
type GitHubUser @remote { ... }

# Dgraph user type
type User {
    # local user name = GitHub id
    username: String! @id

    # join local data with remote
    gitDetails: GitHubUser @custom(http: {
        url:  "https://api.github.com/graphql",
        method: POST,
        graphql: "query(username: String!) { user(login: $username) }",
        skipIntrospection: true
    })
}
```

Perhaps our app has some measure of their velocity that's calculated by a custom
function that looks at both their GitHub commits and some other places where
work is added. Soon we'll have a schema where we can render a user's home page,
the projects they work on, their open tickets, their GitHub details, etc. in a
single request that queries across multiple sources and can mix Dgraph filtering
with external calls.

```graphql
query {
    getUser(id: "aUser") {
        username
        projects(order: { asc: lastUpdate }, first: 10) {
            projectName
        }
        tickets {
            connectedGitIssue { ... }
        }
        velocityMeasure
        gitDetails { ... }
        repositories { ... }
    }
}
```
