# Modus CLI

> Comprehensive reference for the Modus CLI commands and usage

The Modus CLI is a command-line tool for interacting with your Modus app and
running it locally.

## Install

Install Modus CLI via npm.

```sh
npm install -g @hypermode/modus-cli
```

<Info>
  The Modus CLI automatically downloads various files and dependencies to the
  following directory:

  * Linux/macOS: `$HOME/.modus`
  * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.modus`

  If you would like to override the location of this directory, you can set the
  `MODUS_HOME` environment variable to the desired path.

  For example, if your local permissions on Windows don't allow creating a
  directory in the root of your user profile, you can try a different location.
  You can use the `AppData` directory, or any other directory where you have write
  permissions.

  ```cmd
  setx MODUS_HOME %APPDATA%\Modus
  ```

  *Note, the Windows `setx` command makes the environment variable setting
  permanent.*

## Commands

### `new`

Initialize a new Modus app. The Modus CLI prompts you to enter the app name and
language of choice.

### `dev`

Run your Modus app locally. The Modus CLI starts a local server and provides a
URL to access the app.

<Tip>
  When using [Hyp CLI](/hyp-cli) alongside the Modus CLI, users get access to
  [Hypermode's Model Router](/model-router) for local development.
</Tip>

### `build`

Build your Modus app. The Modus CLI compiles your app and generates a `.build`
folder for the artifacts.

### `uninstall`

Uninstall the Modus CLI from your system.
