# Day 18: Retrieval with PostgreSQL - Building Retrieval Systems

> Build sophisticated retrieval systems using PostgreSQL and Supabase, implementing semantic search over structured product catalogs for intelligent information retrieval.

<Card title="Day 18 challenge" icon="database">
  **Goal**: build a production-ready RAG system using PostgreSQL and Supabase

  **Theme**: context engineering week - information retrieval systems

  **Time investment**: \~30 minutes
</Card>

Welcome to Day 18! You've mastered prompt and message engineering. Now you'll
build **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems** - the foundation of
intelligent information access. Today you'll use PostgreSQL and Supabase to
create semantic search over structured data.

RAG systems enable agents to access current, relevant information dynamically
rather than relying solely on training data.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Set up a Supabase PostgreSQL database
* Load and index an Amazon product catalog as example data
* Connect your agent to Supabase for intelligent retrieval
* Implement semantic search queries that enhance agent responses
* Build retrieval patterns that scale to real-world data volumes

<Warning>
  This requires setting up external services (Supabase). You'll need to create
  accounts and configure database connections. The concepts apply to any
  PostgreSQL-based retrieval system.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding retrieval systems

Before building, understand what makes retrieval powerful:

### Retrieval architecture components

* **Knowledge Base**: Structured or unstructured data that agents can search
* **Embedding Model**: Converts text to vector representations for similarity
  search
* **Vector Database**: Stores and searches embeddings efficiently
* **Retrieval System**: Finds relevant information based on user queries
* **Generation**: Language model uses retrieved context to provide informed
  responses

### When to use retrieval vs. fine-tuning

**Retrieval is ideal for**:

* Dynamic information that changes frequently
* Large knowledge bases that exceed context windows
* Information that needs to be traceable and verifiable
* Scenarios where you need to add new information without retraining

**Fine-tuning is better for**:

* Changing behavior patterns or writing style
* Domain-specific reasoning capabilities
* When information is stable and doesn't change often

<Tip>
  **Retrieval thinking** Think of retrieval as giving your agent access to a
  dynamic, searchable library rather than memorizing everything up front.
</Tip>

## Set up Supabase

Supabase provides PostgreSQL with built-in vector search capabilities:

### Create your Supabase project

1. **Visit [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com)** and create a free account
2. **Create a new project** and note your project URL and API keys
3. **Set up authentication** and database permissions

## Load Amazon product catalog data

Let's create a realistic product dataset for testing:

### Sample product data

Create sample product data that represents a typical e-commerce catalog.
Navigate to the SQL editor in Supabase and run the following SQL:

{/* <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --> */}

```sql
-- Insert sample Amazon-style product data
INSERT INTO products (title, description, category, price, rating, metadata) VALUES
('Apple iPhone 15 Pro', 'Latest iPhone with titanium design, A17 Pro chip, and advanced camera system', 'Electronics', 999.00, 4.5, '{"brand": "Apple", "features": ["A17 Pro chip", "Titanium", "Advanced camera"]}'),

## Connect your agent to Supabase

Now integrate your retrieval system with your Hypermode agent:

### Add Supabase connection

1. **Navigate to your agent's connections** in the About section
2. **Add Supabase connection** and configure with your project credentials
3. **Test the connection** by querying the products table

Refer to the [Hypermode Supabase connection docs](/agents/connections/supabase)
for more information.

### Create a retrieval-enabled agent

If you don't have a suitable agent, create one with Concierge:

```text
I want to create a product recommendation agent that helps users find products based on their needs.

The agent should:
- Search to find relevant products from our catalog
- Understand user preferences and requirements
- Provide detailed product comparisons and recommendations
- Explain why specific products match user needs
- Handle follow-up questions about features, pricing, and alternatives

The agent should act like a knowledgeable sales associate who understands both product details and customer needs.
```

### Configure retrieval workflows

Add these patterns to your agent's instructions:

```text
Product Search Guidelines:
1. When users ask about products, use search on the products database
2. Search using natural language descriptions of user needs
3. Include relevant product details: title, description, price, rating, and key features
4. Explain why recommended products match the user's requirements
5. Offer comparisons between similar products when helpful
6. Always provide specific product information rather than generic advice
```

## Implement retrieval queries

Test your retrieval system with real queries:

### Basic product search

```text
I'm looking for a smartphone with good camera quality and long battery life under $800. What would you recommend?
```

Your agent should:

1. **Query the products table**
2. **Return relevant products** with explanations
3. **Format results** with specific details and reasoning

### Complex requirement matching

```text
I need a gift for someone who loves cooking and wants to save time in the kitchen. Budget is around $100. What products would be perfect?
```

Watch how semantic search finds relevant products even when the query doesn't
contain exact product keywords.

### Comparison queries

```text
Compare the top 3 headphones in your catalog and explain which is best for different use cases.
```

This tests the agent's ability to retrieve multiple products and synthesize
comparative information.

<Tip>
  **Retrieval quality** Good retrieval systems return not just similar products,
  but contextually relevant ones that actually answer the user's underlying
  need.
</Tip>

### Contextual retrieval

Help your agent understand search context:

```text
Retrieval Context Guidelines:
- For gift recommendations: Consider price range, recipient interests, and occasion
- For replacements: Find similar products with improvements or better value
- For comparisons: Retrieve products in the same category with different strengths
- For budget searches: Prioritize value and essential features within price range
- For premium searches: Focus on quality, features, and brand reputation
```

### Advanced query examples

Test sophisticated retrieval patterns:

```text
"I want to upgrade my home office setup for better productivity and comfort. I have a $1000 budget and work from home 8 hours a day."
```

```text
"Find me eco-friendly alternatives to common household items that also save money in the long run."
```

```text
"I'm a beginner cook who wants to make healthier meals but has limited time. What kitchen tools would be most impactful?"
```

## Performance optimization and monitoring

Ensure your retrieval system performs well at scale:

### Indexing optimization

```sql
-- Create additional indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products(price);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_rating ON products(rating);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_brand ON products USING GIN ((metadata->>'brand'));

-- Full-text search index
CREATE INDEX idx_products_fulltext ON products USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description));
```

### Query performance monitoring

```sql
-- Enable query statistics
SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%products%'
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Retrieval quality metrics

Track these metrics to ensure good RAG performance:

* **Retrieval precision**: How many retrieved items are relevant?
* **Retrieval recall**: How many relevant items are retrieved?
* **Response time**: How fast are queries executing?
* **User satisfaction**: Are users finding what they need?

## What you've accomplished

In 30 minutes, you've built a production-ready RAG system:

**Database foundation**: set up PostgreSQL with vector search capabilities

**Data pipeline**: loaded and indexed structured product catalog with embeddings

**Agent integration**: connected your agent to Supabase for dynamic information
retrieval

**Semantic search**: implemented vector similarity search for intelligent
product discovery

**Advanced patterns**: explored hybrid search, filtering, and contextual
retrieval

**Performance optimization**: learned indexing and monitoring strategies for
production use

## The power of retrieval systems

Retrieval transforms static agents into dynamic information systems:

**Before retrieval** Agents limited to training data and general knowledge

**After retrieval** Agents with access to current, specific, searchable
knowledge bases

This foundation enables agents to provide accurate, up-to-date information from
your own data sources.

## Pro tip for today

Test retrieval quality with diverse queries:

```text
Test my retrieval system with these different query types:
1. Specific product searches: "wireless noise-canceling headphones"
2. Use case searches: "products for home office productivity"
3. Comparative searches: "best value smartphones under $500"
4. Problem-solving searches: "solutions for small kitchen storage"

How well does semantic search understand intent vs. exact keywords?
```

This reveals the strengths and limitations of your retrieval system.
