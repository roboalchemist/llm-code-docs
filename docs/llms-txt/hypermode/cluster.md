## Cluster management

Here you find the basic information about the cluster.

The Zero list with license and the list of zeros connected:

* Each card represents a zero node. The card has a green sign which shows the
  health. It shows the address of the node and a little blue banner indicating
  that this node is the leader.

The Alpha list separated into groups:

* You have a list of tablets that exist on that group and their approximate
  size. The card has the same pattern as the zero ones.

<Tip>
  By clicking on the Node Card you can remove that node (Alpha or Zero).
