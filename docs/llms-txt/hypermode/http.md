</Note>

### Payload format

POST requests sent with the Content-Type header `application/graphql` must have
a POST body content as a GraphQL query string. For example, the following is a
valid POST body for a query:

```graphql
query {
  getTask(id: "0x3") {
    id
    title
    completed
    user {
      username
      name
    }
  }
}
```

POST requests sent with the Content-Type header `application/json` must have a
POST body in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "operationName": "...",
  "variables": { "var": "val", ... }
}
```

GraphQL requests can contain one or more operations. Operations include `query`,
`mutation`, or `subscription`. If a request only has one operation, then it can
be unnamed like the following:

### Single operation

The most basic request contains a single anonymous (unnamed) operation. Each
operation can have one or more queries within in. For example, the following
query has `query` operation running the queries `getTask` and `getUser`:

```graphql
query {
  getTask(id: "0x3") {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
  getUser(username: "dgraphlabs") {
    username
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getTask": {
      "id": "0x3",
      "title": "GraphQL docs example",
      "completed": true
    },
    "getUser": {
      "username": "dgraphlabs"
    }
  }
}
```

You can optionally name the operation as well, though it's not required if the
request only has one operation as it's clear what needs to be executed.

#### Query shorthand

If a request only has a single query operation, then you can use the short-hand
form of omitting the "query" keyword:

```graphql
{
  getTask(id: "0x3") {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
  getUser(username: "dgraphlabs") {
    username
  }
}
```

This simplifies queries when a query doesn't require an operation name or
[variables](/dgraph/graphql/query/variables).

### Multiple operations

If a request has two or more operations, then each operation must have a name. A
request can only execute one operation, so you must also include the operation
name to execute in the request. Every operation name in a request must be
unique.

For example, in the following request has the operation names `getTaskAndUser`
and `completedTasks`.

```graphql
query getTaskAndUser {
  getTask(id: "0x3") {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
  queryUser(filter: { username: { eq: "dgraphlabs" } }) {
    username
    name
  }
}

query completedTasks {
  queryTask(filter: { completed: true }) {
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

When executing the following request (as an HTTP POST request in JSON format),
specifying the "getTaskAndUser" operation executes the first query:

```json
query getTaskAndUser {
  getTask(id: "0x3") {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
  queryUser(filter: { username: { eq: "dgraphlabs" } }) {
    username
    name
  }
}

query completedTasks {
  queryTask(filter: { completed: true }) {
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getTask": {
      "id": "0x3",
      "title": "GraphQL docs example",
      "completed": true
    },
    "queryUser": [
      {
        "username": "dgraphlabs",
        "name": "Dgraph Labs"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

And specifying the `completedTasks` operation executes the second query:

```json
{
  "query": "query getTaskAndUser { getTask(id: \"0x3\") { id title completed } queryUser(filter: {username: {eq: \"dgraphlabs\"}}) { username name }\n}\n\nquery completedTasks { queryTask(filter: {completed: true}) { title completed }}",
  "operationName": "completedTasks"
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "queryTask": [
      {
        "title": "GraphQL docs example",
        "completed": true
      },
      {
        "title": "Show second operation",
        "completed": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Multiple queries execution

When an operation contains multiple queries, they run concurrently and
independently in a Dgraph read-only transaction per query.

When an operation contains multiple mutations, they run serially, in the order
listed in the request, with a transaction per mutation. If a mutation fails, the
following mutations aren't executed and previous mutations aren't rolled back.

### Variables

Variables simplify GraphQL queries and mutations by letting you pass data
separately. A GraphQL request can be split into two sections: one for the query
or mutation, and another for variables.

Variables can be declared after the `query` or `mutation` and are passed like
arguments to a function and begin with `$`.

#### Query example

```graphql
query post($filter: PostFilter) {
  queryPost(filter: $filter) {
    title
    text
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
{
  "filter": {
    "title": {
      "eq": "First Post"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Mutation example

```graphql
mutation addAuthor($author: AddAuthorInput!) {
  addAuthor(input: [$author]) {
    author {
      name
      posts {
        title
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
{
  "author": {
    "name": "A.N. Author",
    "dob": "2000-01-01",
    "posts": [{
      "title": "First Post",
      "text": "Hello world!"
    }]
  }
}
```

### Fragments

A GraphQL fragment is associated with a type and is a reusable subset of the
fields from this type. Here, we declare a `postData` fragment that can be used
with any `Post` object:

```graphql
fragment postData on Post {
  id
  title
  text
  author {
    username
    displayName
  }
}
query allPosts {
  queryPost(order: { desc: title }) {
    ...postData
  }
}
mutation addPost($post: AddPostInput!) {
  addPost(input: [$post]) {
    post {
      ...postData
    }
  }
}
```

### Using fragments with interfaces

It is possible to define fragments on interfaces. Here's an example of a query
that includes in-line fragments:

**Schema**

```graphql
interface Employee {
  ename: String!
}
interface Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @search(by: [exact])
}
type Human implements Character & Employee {
  totalCredits: Float
}
type Droid implements Character {
  primaryFunction: String
}
```

**Query**

```graphql
query allCharacters {
  queryCharacter {
    name
    __typename
    ... on Human {
      totalCredits
    }
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
  }
}
```

The `allCharacters` query returns a list of `Character` objects. Since `Human`
and `Droid` implements the `Character` interface, the fields in the result would
be returned according to the type of object.

**Result**

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "queryCharacter": [
      {
        "name": "Human1",
        "__typename": "Human",
        "totalCredits": 200.23
      },
      {
        "name": "Human2",
        "__typename": "Human",
        "totalCredits": 2.23
      },
      {
        "name": "Droid1",
        "__typename": "Droid",
        "primaryFunction": "Code"
      },
      {
        "name": "Droid2",
        "__typename": "Droid",
        "primaryFunction": "Automate"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## GET request

GraphQL request may also be sent using an `HTTP GET` operation.

\GET requests must be sent in the following format. The query, variables, and
operation are sent as URL-encoded query parameters in the URL.

```sh
http://localhost:8080/graphql?query={...}&variables={...}&operationName=...
```

* `query` is mandatory
* `variables` is only required if the query contains GraphQL variables.
* `operationName` is only required if there are multiple operations in the
  query; in which case, operations must also be named.

## Response

All responses, including errors, always return HTTP 200 OK status codes.

The response is a JSON map including the fields `"data"`, `"errors"`, or
`"extensions"` following the GraphQL specification. They follow the following
formats.

Successful queries are in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "extensions": { ... }
}
```

Queries that have errors are in the following format.

```json
{
  "errors": [ ... ],
}
```

#### Data field

The "data" field contains the result of your GraphQL request. The response has
exactly the same shape as the result. For example, notice that for the following
query, the response includes the data in the exact shape as the query.

Query:

```graphql
query {
  getTask(id: "0x3") {
    id
    title
    completed
    user {
      username
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getTask": {
      "id": "0x3",
      "title": "GraphQL docs example",
      "completed": true,
      "user": {
        "username": "dgraphlabs",
        "name": "Dgraph Labs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Errors field

The "errors" field is a JSON list where each entry has a `"message"` field that
describes the error and optionally has a `"locations"` array to list the
specific line and column number of the request that points to the error
described. For example, here's a possible error for the following query, where
`getTask` needs to have an `id` specified as input:

Query:

```graphql
query {
  getTask() {
    id
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field \"getTask\" argument \"id\" of type \"ID!\" is required but not provided.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Error propagation

Before returning query and mutation results, Dgraph uses the types in the schema
to apply GraphQL
[value completion](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Value-Completion)
and
[error handling](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Errors-and-Non-Nullability).
As an example, `null` values for non-nullable fields (such as `String!`) cause
error propagation to parent fields.

In short, the GraphQL value completion and error propagation mean the following.

* Fields marked as nullable (without `!`) can return `null` in the JSON
  response.
* For fields marked as non-nullable (with `!`) Dgraph never returns null for
  that field.
* If an instance of type has a non-nullable field that has evaluated to null,
  the whole instance results in null.
* Reducing an object to null might cause further error propagation. For example,
  querying for a post that has an author with a null name results in null: the
  null name (`name: String!`) causes the author to result in null, and a null
  author causes the post (`author: Author!`) to result in null.
* Error propagation for lists with nullable elements (for example
  `friends [Author]`), can result in nulls inside the result list.
* Error propagation for lists with non-nullable elements results in null for
  `friends [Author!]` and would cause further error propagation for
  `friends [Author!]!`.

Note that, a query that results in no values for a list always returns the empty
list `[]`, not `null`, regardless of whether it is nullable. For example, given
a schema for an author with `posts: [Post!]!`, if an author hasn't posted
anything and we queried for that author, the result for the posts field would be
`posts: []`.

A list can, however, result in null due to GraphQL error propagation. For
example, if the definition is `posts: [Post!]`, and we queried for an author who
has a list of posts. If one of those posts happened to have a null title (title
is non-nullable `title: String!`), then that post would evaluate to null, the
`posts` list can't contain nulls and so the list reduces to null.

#### Extensions field

The "extensions" field contains extra metadata for the request with metrics and
trace information for the request.

* `"touched_uids"`: The number of nodes that were touched to satisfy the
  request. This is a good metric to gauge the complexity of the query.
* `"tracing"`: Displays performance tracing data in [Apollo
  Tracing][apollo-tracing] format. This includes the duration of the whole query
  and the duration of each operation.
* `"dql_query"`: Optional, displays the translated DQL query Dgraph composed.
  This is only output when the GraphQL debug superflag
  `(--graphql "debug=true;")` is set.

[apollo-tracing]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing

Here's an example of a query response with the extensions field:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getTask": {
      "id": "0x3",
      "title": "GraphQL docs example",
      "completed": true,
      "user": {
        "username": "dgraphlabs",
        "name": "Dgraph Labs"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "touched_uids": 9,
    "tracing": {
      "version": 1,
      "startTime": "2020-07-29T05:54:27.784837196Z",
      "endTime": "2020-07-29T05:54:27.787239465Z",
      "duration": 2402299,
      "execution": {
        "resolvers": [
          {
            "path": ["getTask"],
            "parentType": "Query",
            "fieldName": "getTask",
            "returnType": "Task",
            "startOffset": 122073,
            "duration": 2255955,
            "dgraph": [
              {
                "label": "query",
                "startOffset": 171684,
                "duration": 2154290
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Turn off extensions**

To turn off extensions set the `--graphql` superflag's `extensions` option to
false (`--graphql extensions=false`) when running Dgraph Alpha.
