# Day 19: Retrieval with MongoDB - Document-Based RAG Systems

> Implement sophisticated document-based retrieval systems using MongoDB Atlas for unstructured data like product reviews, feedback, and content analysis.

<Card title="Day 19 challenge" icon="file-text">
  **Goal**: build document-based retrieval with MongoDB for unstructured data retrieval

  **Theme**: context engineering week - NoSQL and document retrieval

  **Time investment**: \~25 minutes
</Card>

Welcome to Day 19! Yesterday you built structured RAG systems with PostgreSQL.
Today you'll work with **unstructured document retrieval** using MongoDB Atlas.
You'll learn to search through product reviews, feedback, and content where the
structure varies and context is embedded in natural language.

Document-based retrieval excels when dealing with varied, unstructured content
that doesn't fit neatly into database tables.

## What you'll accomplish today

* Set up MongoDB Atlas with vector search capabilities for document retrieval
* Load Amazon product reviews as example unstructured data
* Connect your agent to MongoDB for intelligent document search
* Build retrieval patterns for sentiment analysis and contextual understanding

<Warning>
  This requires setting up MongoDB Atlas (free tier available). You'll be
  working with unstructured documents that require different indexing and search
  strategies than structured data.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Understanding document-based retrieval

Document databases handle unstructured data differently than relational
databases:

### Document and relational data

**Relational data (Day 18)**:

* Fixed schema with defined columns
* Structured relationships between tables
* Efficient for transactional operations
* Great for precise, attribute-based queries

**Document data (Today)**:

* Flexible schema with nested objects and arrays
* Self-contained documents with varying structures
* Efficient for content storage and retrieval
* Great for text analysis and semantic search

### When to use document-based retrieval

**Ideal for**:

* Product reviews and customer feedback
* Content analysis (blogs, articles, documentation)
* Social media posts and comments
* Support tickets and conversation logs
* Research papers and knowledge articles

**Not ideal for**:

* Highly structured transactional data
* Complex multi-table relationships
* Frequent schema changes requiring migrations

<Tip>
  **Document thinking** Think of document retrieval as searching through a
  library of books rather than looking up entries in a catalog. Context and
  content matter more than exact structure.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Set up MongoDB Atlas with vector search

MongoDB Atlas provides managed MongoDB with built-in vector search:

### Create your MongoDB Atlas cluster

1. **Visit [mongodb.com/atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)** and create a free
   account
2. **Create a new cluster** (M0 free tier is sufficient for learning)
3. **Set up database access** with username/password authentication
4. **Configure network access** to allow connections from your IP
5. **Get your connection string** for later use

### Create the reviews collection

```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB instance and create the reviews collection
use product_reviews

// Create collection with validation schema
db.createCollection("reviews", {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      bsonType: "object",
      required: ["product_id", "product_title", "review_text", "rating"],
      properties: {
        product_id: { bsonType: "string" },
        product_title: { bsonType: "string" },
        review_text: { bsonType: "string" },
        rating: { bsonType: "number", minimum: 1, maximum: 5 },
        reviewer_name: { bsonType: "string" },
        review_date: { bsonType: "date" },
        verified_purchase: { bsonType: "bool" },
        helpful_votes: { bsonType: "number" },
        embedding: { bsonType: "array" }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Load Amazon product reviews data

Create a realistic dataset of product reviews with varying structures:

### Sample review documents

{/* <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --> */}

```javascript
// Insert sample Amazon-style product reviews
db.reviews.insertMany([
  {

## Connect MongoDB to your agent

Integrate MongoDB with your Hypermode agent for document retrieval:

### Add MongoDB connection

1. **Navigate to your agent's connections** in the About section
2. **Add MongoDB connection** with your Atlas cluster credentials
3. **Test the connection** by querying the reviews collection

### Create a review analysis agent

If needed, create a specialized agent with Concierge:

```text
I want to create a product review analysis agent that helps users understand customer sentiment and experiences.

The agent should:
- Search through product reviews using semantic similarity
- Analyze customer sentiment and common themes
- Identify specific product strengths and weaknesses mentioned by reviewers
- Compare customer experiences across similar products
- Provide insights about product satisfaction patterns
- Help users understand real customer experiences beyond marketing claims

The agent should act like a market research analyst who specializes in customer feedback analysis.
```

### Configure document retrieval patterns

Add these instructions to your agent:

```text
Review Analysis Guidelines:
1. Use semantic search to find relevant reviews based on user interests
2. Look for patterns in customer feedback, not just individual opinions
3. Identify specific product features mentioned by multiple reviewers
4. Consider both positive and negative feedback for balanced insights
5. Explain sentiment trends and common themes across reviews
6. Provide specific quotes from reviews to support analysis
7. Note verified purchases vs. unverified reviews when relevant
```

### Implement document search and analysis

Test your document-based retrieval system:

### Semantic review search

```text
What do customers say about camera quality in smartphone reviews? I'm particularly interested in low-light performance.
```

Your agent should:

1. **Search reviews** for camera-related content
2. **Extract specific mentions** of camera features and performance
3. **Analyze sentiment** around camera quality
4. **Provide quotes** from actual reviews
5. **Summarize trends** across multiple customer experiences

### Sentiment analysis queries

```text
Analyze customer satisfaction patterns for headphones. What are the most common complaints and praise points?
```

This tests the agent's ability to:

* **Aggregate sentiment** across multiple reviews
* **Identify common themes** in feedback
* **Distinguish between** different types of issues or praise
* **Provide actionable insights** from unstructured feedback

### Comparative analysis

```text
Compare customer experiences between iPhone and Samsung phones based on actual user reviews. What are the key differences in satisfaction?
```

This requires:

* **Cross-product analysis** using semantic search
* **Pattern recognition** across different product categories
* **Balanced reporting** of pros and cons
* **Context-aware insights** about user preferences

<Tip>
  **Document retrieval insight** The power of document-based RAG is in
  understanding context and nuance that structured data misses. Focus on
  semantic meaning over exact keyword matches.
</Tip>

## What you've accomplished

In 25 minutes, you've mastered document-based RAG systems:

**MongoDB foundation**: set up Atlas with vector search for document retrieval

**Unstructured data handling**: loaded and indexed product reviews with flexible
schemas

**Document search**: implemented search across varying content structures

**Sentiment analysis**: built patterns for understanding customer feedback and
satisfaction trends

**Advanced aggregation**: explored complex queries for multi-dimensional
document analysis

## The power of document-based retrieval

Document RAG unlocks insights from unstructured content:

**Before document RAG** Limited to structured product information and marketing
claims

**After document RAG** Access to real customer experiences, sentiment trends,
and nuanced feedback

Combined with yesterday's structured RAG, you now have comprehensive information
retrieval capabilities.

## Pro tip for today

Test document retrieval with nuanced queries:

```text
Test my document RAG system with these complex queries:
1. "What specific issues do customers mention about battery life across different devices?"
2. "How do customer experiences vary between verified and unverified purchasers?"
3. "What patterns emerge when customers compare competing products?"
4. "Which product features generate the most emotional responses in reviews?"

How well does the system understand context and extract insights from unstructured text?
```

This reveals the sophistication of your document-based retrieval system.
