# count

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please

Syntax Examples:

* `count(predicate)`
* `count(uid)`

The form `count(predicate)` counts how many `predicate` edges lead out of a
node.

The form `count(uid)` counts the number of UIDs matched in the enclosing block.

Query Example: the number of films acted in by each actor with `Orlando` in
their name.

`````json
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Orlando"))
  @filter(has(actor.film)) {
    name@en
    count(actor.film)
  }
}

Count can be used at root and [aliased](./alias).

Query Example: count of directors who have directed more than five films. When
used at the query root, the [count index](./schema#count-index) is
required.

````json
{
  directors(func: gt(count(director.film), 5)) {
    totalDirectors : count(uid)
  }
}

Count can be assigned to a
[value variable](./variables#value-variables).

Query Example: the actors of Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman" ordered by the
number of movies acted in.

```json
{
  var(func: allofterms(name@en, "eat drink man woman")) {
    starring {
      actors as performance.actor {
        totalRoles as count(actor.film)
      }
    }
  }

  edmw(func: uid(actors), orderdesc: val(totalRoles)) {
    name@en
    name@zh
    totalRoles : val(totalRoles)
  }
}
```
`````
