Access Control Lists (ACL) are a typical mechanism to list who can access what,
specifying either users or roles and what they can access. ACLs help determine
who is "authorized" to access what.

Dgraph Access Control Lists (ACLs) are sets of permissions for which
`Relationships` a user may access. Recall that Dgraph is "predicate based" so
all data is stored in and is implicit in relationships. This allows
relationship-based controls to be very powerful in restricting a graph based on
roles, known as Relationship-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Note that the Dgraph multi-tenancy feature relies on ACLs to ensure each tenant
can only see their own data in one server.

Using ACLs requires a client to authenticate (log in) differently and specify
credentials that drive which relationships are visible in their view of the
graph database.
