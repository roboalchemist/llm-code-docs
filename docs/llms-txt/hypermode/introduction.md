# Hypermode Agents

> Build AI agents that act—from natural language toproduction-ready code

Hypermode Agents is the complete solution for defining, iterating, and working
with agents. Built on the latest AI advances, Hypermode Agents provide an agent
workbench that allows for quick iteration. The workbench includes:

* [**Threads**](work) is a conversational interface that lets you build, train,
  and refine AI agents through natural language—no coding required.
* [**Connections**](connections) establishes secure access for agent tools and
  your data. By leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Hypermode
  Agents can understand and interact with their environment.
* **Tasks** are repeatable sets of instructions that you can save and use later
  with your agent. Think of a task as a learned skill for your agent.
* [**Model Router**](model-selection) makes it easy to access the most popular
  models to power your agent.
* [**Agent building**](create-agent#build-a-new-agent-with-concierge) is through
  Hypermode's AI-powered agents that transforms natural language descriptions
  into fully functional agents. No coding experience required.

## How Hypermode Agents are different

* **Conversational interface** to build and refine agents in a live, interactive
  session using natural language.
* **Real-time control** for a view to which tools an agent can access and adjust
  its behavior while tasks are running.
* **Reduced handoffs** and minimize back-and-forth communication with technical
  teams by directly shaping agent behavior.
* **Exploration vs. production.** Develop and test agents freely in an
  exploratory environment, then lock configurations when ready for production.
* **Streamlined iteration** of creating and modifying agents that require only a
  few clicks, making it as simple to build your first agent as it is to manage
  thousands.
