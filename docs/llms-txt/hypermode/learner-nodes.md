# Learner Nodes

> Learner nodes let you spin-up read-only replica instance to serve best-effort queries faster

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please

</Info>

A Learner node is an enterprise-only feature that allows a user to spin-up a
read-only replica instance across the world without paying a latency cost. When
enabled, a Dgraph cluster using learner nodes can serve best-effort queries
faster.

A "learner node" can still accept write operations. The node forwards them over
to the Alpha group leader and does the writing just like a typical Alpha node.
It will just be slower, depending on the latency between the Alpha node and the
learner node.

<Note>
  A learner node instance can forward `/admin` operations and perform both read
  and write operations, but writing will incur in network call latency to the
  main cluster.
</Note>

## Set up a Learner node

The learner node feature works at the Dgraph Alpha group level. To use it, first
you need to set up an Alpha instance as a learner node. Once the learner
instance is up, this replica can be used to run best-effort queries with zero
latency overhead. Because it's an Enterprise feature, a learner node won't be
able to connect to a Dgraph Zero node until the Zero node has a valid license.

To spin up a learner node, first make sure that you start all the nodes,
including the Dgraph Zero leader and the Dgraph Alpha leader, with the `--my`
flag so that these nodes will be accessible to the learner node. Then, start an
Alpha instance as follows:

```sh
dgraph alpha --raft="learner=true; group=N" --my <learner-node-ip-address>:5080
```

This allows the new Alpha instance to get all the updates from the group "N"
leader without participating in the Raft elections.

<Note>
  You must specify the `--my` flag to set the IP address and port of Dgraph
  Zero, the Dgraph Alpha leader node, and the learner node. If you don't, you
  will get an error similar to the following: `Error during SubscribeForUpdates`
</Note>

## Best-effort Queries

Regular queries use the strict consistency model, and any write operation to the
cluster anywhere would be read immediately.

Best-effort queries apply the eventual consistency model. A write to the cluster
will be seen eventually to the node. In regular conditions, the eventual
consistency is usually achieved quickly.

A best-effort query to a learner node returns any data that is already available
in that learner node. The response is still a valid data snapshot, but at a
timestamp which is not the latest one.

<Note>
  Best-effort queries won't be forwarded to a Zero node to get the latest
  timestamp.
</Note>

You can still send typical read queries (strict consistency) to a learner node.
They would just incur an extra latency cost due to having to reach out the Zero
leader.

<Note>
  If the learner node needs to serve normal queries, at least one Alpha leader
  must be available.
</Note>

## Use-case examples

### Geographic distribution

Consider this scenario:

*You want to achieve low latency for clients in a remote geographical region,
distant from your Dgraph cluster.*

You can address this need by using a learner node to run best-effort queries.
This read-only replica instance can be across distant geographies and you can
use best-effort queries to get instant responses.

Because learner nodes support read and write operations, users in the remote
location can do everything with this learner node, as if they were working with
the full cluster.
