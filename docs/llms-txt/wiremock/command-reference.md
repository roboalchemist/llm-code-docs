# CLI Command Reference

> Complete reference documentation for all WireMock CLI commands

This reference documents all available commands, subcommands, and options in the WireMock CLI. For general usage and installation instructions, see [Installation and basic usage](/cli/overview).

## Global options

These options are available for all commands:

### -V, --version

Show the version and exit.

```shell  theme={null}
wiremock --version
```

### -h, --help

Show help message and exit. Can be used with any command or subcommand.

```shell  theme={null}
wiremock --help
wiremock record --help
```

## Authentication commands

### login

Login to WireMock Cloud. This command must have been executed at least once before executing most other commands.

```shell  theme={null}
wiremock login
```

Opens a browser window for authentication. Once complete, your credentials are stored locally.

<Info>
  If you have [set your API endpoint](/cli/config#configuring-your-api-endpoint) to a custom endpoint, `wiremock login` will no longer work. Use [config set](/cli/config#configuring-your-api-token) to set your API token directly.
</Info>

```shell  theme={null}
wiremock logout
```

```

**Arguments:**

* `<from>` - The URL of the target API to record from (required)

**Options:**

#### Recording behavior

* `--to=<cloud:mock_api_id>` - The ID of the mock API to import recorded stubs into. You will be prompted to choose a mock API if omitted.
* `-p, --reverse-proxy-port=<int>` - The local port to proxy requests through. Set to '0', '-1', or 'random' to assign a random port (default: 8000)

#### Logging

* `--request-log-level=(off|summary|full)` - How recorded requests are displayed in the console during recording (default: summary for interactive sessions, off for non-interactive sessions)
* `-q` - Equivalent of `--request-log-level=off`
* `-v` - Equivalent of `--request-log-level=full`

#### Import configuration

* `--import-config-file=<path>` - Path to a file containing custom configuration for handling how recorded requests are converted into stubs
* `--max-batch-requests, --batch-size=<int>` - The maximum amount of requests to import to the mock API in a single batch while recording. Given a max batch of N requests, an import to the mock API will occur for every N requests recorded. If omitted, all requests will be imported at the end of the session in a single batch.
* `--max-batch-bytes=<binary_size>` - The maximum amount of bytes to import to the mock API in a single batch while recording. Given a max batch of N bytes, an import to the mock API will occur for every N bytes recorded. Note, if a single recorded request exceeds the maximum number of bytes, this request will still be sent (in a batch of one). If omitted, all requests will be imported at the end of the session in a single batch. (examples: 5120, 5kB, 5kiB, 10 MB)

#### TLS/Client certificates

* `-c, --client-certificate=<path>` - Path to a PEM-encoded RSA private key and X509 certificate needed to authenticate against the target API using mutual TLS. Alternative to `--client-certificate-store`.

**Examples:**

```shell  theme={null}
wiremock record https://api.example.com
wiremock record https://api.example.com --to=cloud:abc123xyz
wiremock record https://api.example.com -p 9000 -v
