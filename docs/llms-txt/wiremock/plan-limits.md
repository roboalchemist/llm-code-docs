# Audit Event Destinations - Plan Limits

> Limitations of your audit destination usage.

WireMock Cloud applies limits to audit event destinations dependent upon the plan your organisation is subscribed to.

On the enterprise or enterprise trial plans, an account is limited to 1 audit event destination.  Accounts on the free
plan do not have access to this feature. If you are on the free plan and would like access to this feature,
[contact the WireMock team today](https://www.wiremock.io/contact-now) to discuss an enterprise plan for your organisation.

## Disabled Audit Event Destinations

If an account/organisation is downgraded to a plan that causes their audit event destinations to exceed the new plan's
limits, the exceeding destinations will be disabled.  This means WireMock Cloud will no longer send audit events to
those destinations.

Disabled destinations can be enabled at any time by [upgrading to a different plan](https://www.wiremock.io/contact-now).
