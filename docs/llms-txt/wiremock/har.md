# Importing Via HAR

> Importing HAR logs into WireMock Cloud.

HAR is a widely-used, JSON-based HTTP log format. It can be generated by a variety of tools and products, including from the Chrome dev tools Network tab.

WireMock Cloud can import your HAR log and convert it into a collection of stubs.

HAR files are imported in exactly the same way as other formats.
See [Import and Export Overview](./) for basic importing instructions via the UI and
[Importing and Export via the API](./api) for directions on automating
imports via WireMock Cloud's API.
