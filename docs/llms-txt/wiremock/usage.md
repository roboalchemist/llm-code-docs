You can use the API to retrieve various metrics about your organisation's use of the product. This corresponds to the data
you can see on the [usage page](https://app.wiremock.cloud/account/usage) in the app.

## Getting usage data

Usage data is associated with your organisation's subscription. Follow these steps to find the subscription ID and then use this
to retrive product usage data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get our user account">
    first getting our own user account by calling [get self](/api-reference/users/get-self), which will return
    a redirect to our user account resource. Follow this redirect to retrieve user account details and from here get the organisation ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the organisation">
    Using the organisation ID from the previous step call [get organisation](/api-reference/organisations/get-organisation-by-id)
    using the ID as the path parameter. This will return organisation information including the subscription ID, which we
    record for the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get product usage for the subscription">
    We can then use the subscription ID as the path parameter when calling [get usage](/api-reference/usage/get-usage) to get the actual usage data.
  </Step>
</Steps>
