# Import & Export - Mountebank

> Importing Mountebank stubs into WireMock Cloud.

Mountebank is an open source service virtualization tool, and WireMock Cloud supports
importing your Mountebank stubs and converting them into a collection of WireMock stubs.

Mountebank files are imported in exactly the same way as other formats.
See [Import and Export Overview](./) for basic importing instructions via the UI and
[Importing and Export via the API](./api) for directions on automating
imports via WireMock Cloud's API.
