# Gateway Certificate Store

You can upload private CA certificates into the gateway to enable secure connections with trusted API endpoints, ensuring reliable communication by verifying authenticity. This requires [Akeyless Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview) version `4.29.0` or later.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> After uploading a private CA to certificate store, some services may require a restart or reconnection to fully recognize and use the new certificate authority.

## Manage Certificates Using the CLI

To upload certificates to your gateway using the CLI, run the following command:

```shell
akeyless gateway update certificate-store \
--name <Certificate Display name> \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
--certificate-path <path/to/certificate/file> \
--certificate-data <certificate data in base64 format>
```

To delete certificates from your gateway using the CLI, run the following command:

```shell
akeyless gateway delete certificate-store \
--name <Certificate Display name> \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000'
```

Where:

* `name`: The Certificate Display name.
