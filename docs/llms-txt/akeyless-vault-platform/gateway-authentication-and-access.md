# Authentication and Access

Use this page to configure how administrators authenticate to Akeyless Gateway and how permissions are delegated to additional users.

## What This Configuration Controls

Authentication and access settings define:

* The default identity used by the Gateway to connect to Akeyless.
* Which human users can manage Gateway settings.
* Which Gateway components each authorized user can manage.

This configuration affects the management plane of the Gateway, including login to the Gateway Configuration Manager and configuration operations.

## Authentication Model

Gateway access is typically configured in two layers:

1. A primary Gateway authentication method.
2. A list of additional allowed users or identities with explicit permissions.

Supported authentication methods vary by deployment type. Common methods include:

* API key
* Cloud identity (AWS IAM, Azure Active Directory, or GCP)
* Certificate-based authentication
* Universal Identity

## Configure the Primary Gateway Identity

Set a primary authentication method that the Gateway uses for control-plane operations.

### Configure the Gateway Identity with Helm

For Kubernetes Helm deployments, configure `globalConfig.gatewayAuth` in `values.yaml`:

```yaml values.yaml
globalConfig:
  gatewayAuth:
    gatewayAccessId: <Access ID>
    gatewayAccessType: <access_key|aws_iam|azure_ad|gcp|cert|universal_identity>
```

For standalone Docker deployments, set the corresponding environment variables in the `docker run` command.

### Configure the Gateway Identity with Docker

For standalone Docker deployments, set the corresponding environment variables in the `docker run` command.
Use one of the following patterns for the primary Gateway identity:

| Auth method                            | Required environment variables                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API key                                | `GATEWAY_ACCESS_ID`, `GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY`                             |
| AWS IAM / Azure Active Directory / GCP | `GATEWAY_ACCESS_ID`                                                   |
| Certificate-based authentication       | `GATEWAY_ACCESS_ID`, `GATEWAY_CERTIFICATE`, `GATEWAY_CERTIFICATE_KEY` |
| Universal Identity                     | `ADMIN_UID_TOKEN`                                                     |

For compatibility with older deployments, legacy variable names may still appear in existing commands, such as `ADMIN_ACCESS_ID` and `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY`.

Example API key command:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 5696:5696 \
  -e GATEWAY_ACCESS_ID="p-xxxxxx" \
  -e GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY="<Access-Key>" \
  --name akeyless-gw akeyless/base:latest-akeyless
```

## Configure Allowed Access Permissions

After setting the primary identity, define who can manage Gateway settings with `allowedAccessPermissions`.

```yaml values.yaml
globalConfig:
  allowedAccessPermissions:
    - name: Administrators
      access_id: p-xxxxxxx
      permissions:
        - admin
```

To restrict access further, include `sub_claims` in each entry:

```yaml values.yaml
globalConfig:
  allowedAccessPermissions:
    - name: Operations
      access_id: p-xxxxxxx
      sub_claims:
        email:
          - admin@example.com
        group:
          - platform-team
      permissions:
        - admin
```

## Permission Scope Guidance

Use the minimum permissions required for each operational role.

| Permission       | Typical use                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`          | Full Gateway administration, including access permission management. |
| `defaults`       | Manage default login and default encryption settings.                |
| `targets`        | Manage target-related operations through the Gateway.                |
| `dynamic_secret` | Manage dynamic secret configuration.                                 |
| `rotated_secret` | Manage rotated secret configuration.                                 |
| `log_forwarding` | Manage log forwarding settings.                                      |
| `caching`        | Manage cache and offline behavior settings.                          |
| `kmip`           | Manage KMIP service configuration.                                   |
| `general`        | Manage general Gateway settings, including URL and TLS behavior.     |

## Recommended Access Pattern

* Use one dedicated machine identity for the Gateway primary authentication method.
* Add a separate admin group through `allowedAccessPermissions` for day-to-day management.
* Use least-privilege permissions for non-admin roles.
* Review allowed users and permission scope on a regular schedule.

## Validation Checklist

After applying authentication and access configuration:

1. Confirm the Gateway starts successfully.
2. Confirm login works for intended admin users.
3. Confirm non-admin users can only access the permitted configuration areas.
4. Confirm unauthorized users are blocked.
