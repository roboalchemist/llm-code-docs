# Analytics

Akeyless Platform provides rich analytics functionality, allowing the user to analyze the status of his secret posture in various environments with a high-level view.

The main screen tab provides information about items, such as Secrets and Keys where the screen is divided into the following parts:

* A geographic map presenting the IP addresses that consume secrets
* Pie chart that represents the division of the requests by the action type, and below the exact number of operations
* Request volume in the allocated timeframe
* Request time by action type (latency)

The user can change the timeframe for which the data is presented.

Navigate to the **Certificates** tab to get an immediate overview of your certificate's status with additional details on future expiration.
