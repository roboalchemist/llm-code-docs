# Audit Logs

Akeyless collects detailed Audit Logs per secret type, operation, user, time, and so on.

Akeyless Audit Logs take note of just about every change/action within the Akeyless system, providing a complete track record of your Akeyless system operations. Therefore, Akeyless Audit Logs are a valuable resource for Akeyless admins and auditors who want to examine suspicious activity on Akeyless or diagnose and troubleshoot issues.

These Audit Logs can give an Akeyless administrator invaluable insight into what behavior is normal and what behavior isn’t. A log event, for example, will show what activity was attempted and whether it succeeded. This can be useful when identifying whether a system component is misconfigured or likely to fail.

Akeyless log auditing is important for cybersecurity because it provides records that can serve as evidence. A comprehensive and in-depth log audit can make all the difference in the event of a legal battle and can protect your business from liability.

## Viewing Logs in the Console

When using the console, you can navigate to the **Audit Logs** tab to view logs in the following format:

![Screenshot of Audit Logs in the Akeyless Platform Console](https://files.readme.io/800a8f4-Screenshot_at_Nov_10_13-44-36.png)

These logs show you the time of the described action, what it was, whether it was successful or unsuccessful (status codes in the four hundreds means error), the client performing it, what IP it was performed from, and additional parameter tags such as access type or product type.

You can filter your logs based on any of these rubrics or tags inside the Akeyless SaaS platform to get insights or clarifications.

## Reading the Raw Logs

Another way to view your logs is to forward them in their raw form to tools such as Splunk, Logz.io, and so on.
The logs will show up as a line of text, from which you can read the following information:
