Encryption & Key Management Overview

The Akeyless Platform combines the capabilities of a Hardware Security Module (HSM) and a Key Management Service (KMS) with a built-in [KMIP Server](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/kmip-server) to provide enhanced encryption key lifecycle management. You can generate, protect, rotate, and delete keys, as well as use them with Encryption-as-a-Service and Digital Signing functions.

There are two general types of keys available for creation and use:

* **Classic keys:** If you want to [Bring Your Own Key](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/external-kms) to a Cloud KMS provider, you can create it as a [Classic Key](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/classic-keys). Once you share [Classic Keys](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/classic-keys) with a Cloud KMS, you can manage all your keys directly from the Akeyless Platform while using them in your cloud services through your Cloud KMS. For more information, see [Classic Keys](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/classic-keys).

* **DFC™ keys:** A key in Akeyless, by default, will be encrypted using Akeyless Distributed Fragments Cryptography™, our unique FIPS-certified encryption key management technology. With Akeyless DFC™, your encryption key is created as fragments across different regions and on different cloud providers. The key never exists as a whole, not even when it is used. For more information, see [Encryption Keys](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/encryption-keys).

Each type has its own sub-types and unique uses that will be elaborated upon in their own pages.
