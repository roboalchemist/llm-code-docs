# Advanced Configuration

## SSH Legacy Algorithm

As both classic SSH and RDP access are based on SSH certificates, to support legacy algorithms for SSH signing, please set the `legacySigningAlg` with `true` to sign the SSH certificates using the legacy `ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com` signing algorithm.

```shell
akeyless gateway update remote-access --legacy-ssh-algorithm true --gateway-url https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000
```

## Key Exchange Algorithm

A Key Exchange Algorithm is a method used to securely exchange cryptographic keys between parties over an insecure channel such as a public network. The primary goal of these algorithms is to enable two or more parties to securely establish a shared secret key, which can then be used for encrypting and decrypting messages during communication.

```shell
akeyless gateway update remote-access --kexalgs <algorithm-name> --gateway-url https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000
```

The options for this are:

* `curve25519-sha256`
* `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1`
* `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256`
* `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`
* `diffie-hellman-group14-sha256`
* `diffie-hellman-group16-sha512`
* `diffie-hellman-group18-sha512`
* `ecdh-sha2-nistp256`
* `ecdh-sha2-nistp384`
* `ecdh-sha2-nistp521`

## RDP Configuration

### RDP & SSH User Access

For RDP connections with an [externally provided username](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-desktop-secure-access#set-up-remote-access-to-a-windows-machine-from-the-akeyless-console), you can set your RDP or SSH resources to use the relevant attribute from the IdP JWT (For example, email) to establish a connection to the target server using the authenticated username. This applies to all SSH-based sessions, including RDP and Linux systems.

```yaml RDP
akeyless gateway update remote-access --rdp-target-configuration <your-sub-claim> --ssh-target-configuration <your-sub-claim> --gateway-url https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000
```

```yaml SSH
akeyless gateway update remote-access --ssh-target-configuration <your-sub-claim> --gateway-url https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000
```

### Support for Other Keyboard Layouts

To enable a keyboard layout in your remote sessions for Windows, use the following command (the default is `en-us-qwerty`):

```shell
akeyless gateway update remote-access --keyboard-layout <layout-option> --gateway-url https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000
```

```yaml Layout Options
value: da-dk-qwerty # Danish (Qwerty)
value: de-ch-qwertz # Swiss German (Qwertz)
value: de-de-qwertz # German (Qwertz)
value: en-gb-qwerty # UK English (Qwerty)
value: en-us-qwerty # US English (Qwerty) default
value: es-es-qwerty # Spanish (Qwerty)
value: es-latam-qwerty # Latin American (Qwerty)
value: fr-be-azerty # Belgian French (Azerty)
value: fr-ch-qwertz # Swiss French (Qwertz)
value: fr-fr-azerty # French (Azerty)
value: hu-hu-qwertz # Hungarian (Qwertz)
value: it-it-qwerty # Italian (Qwerty)
value: ja-jp-qwerty # Japanese (Qwerty)
value: no-no-qwerty # Norwegian (Qwerty)
value: pl-pl-qwerty # Polish (Qwerty)
value: pt-br-qwerty # Portuguese Brazilian (Qwerty)
value: sv-se-qwerty # Swedish (Qwerty)
value: tr-tr-qwerty # Turkish-Q (Qwerty)
```

## Session Log Forwarding

The Akeyless SRA supports Session Log Forwarding, which captures CLI input and output during sessions. These logs can be forwarded to any logging system. These settings can be added by way of the Gateway management console or by way of CLI:

```shell
akeyless gateway update remote-access-session-forwarding -h
```

## RDP Recordings

**RDP** sessions provide video recordings that can be saved to AWS S3 buckets or Azure Blob Storage. To work with session recording for RDP, provide the following settings to upload your recording to an S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage.

```shell
akeyless gateway update remote-access-rdp-recording -h
```

To store local recordings inside your Gateway, set the `rdp-session-storage` to `local`. Session recordings will be stored inside the Gateway under `/home/akeyless/recordings`. Make sure to add a persistent volume to your SRA deployment.

## SSH Fingerprint

Use this parameter inside your deployment to store fingerprint information in a specific location within your Akeyless account. This approach prevents the need to manually re-accept the SSH host key fingerprint after upgrades or other changes, make sure the Gateway Authentication method has the following permissions on that folder `create`, `read`, `list`. In the example below, the fingerprints will be stored in the `/MY_SSH_REMOTE_ACCESS_HOST_KEYS` folder.

```yaml
sshConfig:
  sshHostKeysPath: /MY_SSH_REMOTE_ACCESS_HOST_KEYS
```

## Concurrent Unauthenticated Connections

To specify the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH component, set the `CONFIG_MAX_STARTUPS` variable as part of your deployment under the `sra.env` section:

```yaml
sra:
  env:
    - name: CONFIG_MAX_STARTUPS
      value: "200:30:300"
```

## Proxy

To configure your proxy settings, you can set several parameters, including proxy settings for HTTP traffic, HTTPS traffic, and Ignore Hosts, using the `no_proxy` field, to prevent local traffic from going through your proxy server.

For environments with proxy servers, the `no_proxy` field needs to be set with the following addresses: `svc.cluster.local` and `*.svc.cluster.local`.

```yaml
# Linux system HTTP Proxy
httpProxySettings:
  http_proxy: ""
  https_proxy: ""
  no_proxy: ""
```
