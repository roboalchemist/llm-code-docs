# GCP Targets

You can define a GCP target to be used with [GCP Dynamic Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gcp-dynamic-secrets) and [GCP Rotated Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gcp-rotated-secret). Having a GCP target will allow you to conserve the credentials chain between all of your Dynamic Secrets, as it is possible to point a target at a rotated secret, or to manually edit credentials in the target instead of having to change them individually for connecting items.

## Create a GCP Target with the CLI

To create a GCP target with the CLI, run the following command:

```shell
akeyless target create gcp \
--name <target name> \
--gcp-key-file-path <Path to the service account private key> \
--gcp-sa-email <GCP service account email>
```

Where:

* `name`: A unique name of the target. The name can include the path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target.

* `gcp-key-file-path`: A path to the file with the Base64-encoded private key of the service account.

* `gcp-sa-email`: The GCP service account email.

You can find the complete list of parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Akeyless Targets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-ref-targets#gcp) section.

## Create a GCP Target in the Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and go to **Targets > New > Cloud (GCP)**.

2. Define a **Name** of the target, and specify the **Location** as a path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target

3. Select a **Protection key** with a Customer Fragment to enable Zero-Knowledge and click **Next**. For more information, [read here](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/implement-zero-knowledge).

4. Choose your preferred authentication mode by selecting one of the options:

   * Check the **Use Credentials** radio button to authenticate with the GCP admin user credentials.

   * Check the **Use Gateway's Cloud Identity** radio button to authenticate with the Gateway's Cloud IAM.

   > 👍 Note
   >
   > **Use Gateway's Cloud Identity** is relevant for cases where your Gateway uses a GCP service account to authenticate against Akeyless.
   >
   > For example, when you set up a [Dynamic Secret](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gcp-dynamic-secrets) for GCP, the target can be used for the temporary GCP service account key creation.

5. Define the remaining parameters as follows:

   * **Service Account Email:** If you selected the **Use Credentials** option in the previous step, specify the superuser service account email that will be used to authenticate Akeyless with GCP.

   * **Service Account Key:** Provide a Base64-encoded private key of the superuser service account.

6. Click **Finish**.
