# Security Health

## Overview

The Security Health Dashboard provides users with an overview of the strength and security of their stored passwords, offering real-time insights, improvement suggestions, and critical metrics that help maintain strong password hygiene. This document outlines the layout, functionality, scoring metrics, and API integrations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the security health features.

## Dashboard Layout

1. **Upper Section: Gauges**
   This section contains visual gauges that display the overall health of passwords:

   * Security Score Gauge: Represents an overall security score for all stored passwords. This score is a composite of various factors such as length, complexity, and rotation policy. The gauge's colors range from red (low score) to green (high score).
   * Weak Passwords Gauge: Displays the number of weak passwords as a fraction of the total passwords. Weak passwords are identified based on their lack of complexity and length.
   * Breached Passwords Gauge: Shows the number of passwords that have been compromised in known breaches. This gauge helps users identify vulnerable passwords that should be updated or replaced immediately.

2. **Lower Section: Password List**
   Below the gauges is a detailed table listing all passwords, providing users with key information and actionable suggestions:

   * Password Location: The service or app where the password is used.
   * Name of the Password: The name or identifier for the password.
   * Score: A graphical representation of the password's strength (For example, weak, medium, strong).
   * Suggestion: Provides recommendations for improving password strength.
   * Last Updated: The date when the password was last changed.

## Enhanced Filtering Options

Users can apply filters to view specific types of passwords:

* Filter by Weak Passwords: Filters the list to show only weak passwords.
* Filter by Breached Passwords: Filters the list to show passwords that have appeared in known breaches.
* Filter by Update Required Passwords: Filters passwords that need to be updated based on their age or vulnerability.

## Toggle for Password Score Feature

A toggle button has been added to allow users to enable or disable the password score feature in their account settings:

* **Toggle Button:** Located under "Password Management," the button controls whether the password score is displayed.
* **Default Setting:** The feature is disabled by default.
* **Functionality:** When enabled, password scores are calculated and displayed; when disabled, scores are hidden.

## Compromised Password Check

As part of our Password Manager’s Security Health evaluation, we incorporate checks against external databases of known compromised credentials. Specifically, we leverage the “Have I Been Pwned” database, which aggregates publicly disclosed password breaches.

This integration allows us to:

* Verify password exposure: Determine whether a given password has appeared in any known data breach, including those circulating on the dark web.
* Measure reuse risk: Identify how many times the same password has been exposed across different breaches, highlighting patterns of weak or reused credentials.
* Enhance scoring accuracy: Incorporate the exposure and reuse metrics into the overall Password Manager Security Health score, providing a more accurate and risk-aware assessment of each user’s password hygiene.
