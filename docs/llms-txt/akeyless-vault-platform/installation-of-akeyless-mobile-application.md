## Authentication Methods Support

In the context of modern enterprise environments, where security is a top priority, the Akeyless Platform offers a highly secure login flow. This involves using a code ID provided by an IT admin combined with multi-factor authentication (MFA). This method is more secure than traditional master passwords or biometrics, as it introduces multiple verification layers and eliminates potential single points of failure.

## VPN Requirement for Zero-Knowledge Keyless Mode

Zero-knowledge keyless functionality is a security feature that allows users to access and manage their passwords or other sensitive information without revealing their credentials to the Service Provider. This is achieved through cryptographic techniques that ensure that only the user has knowledge of their credentials, while the Service Provider can only verify their identity without ever storing or seeing their passwords.

A VPN establishes a secure tunnel between the user's mobile device and the VPN server, encrypting all network traffic and routing it through the VPN provider's secure infrastructure. This encrypted tunnel effectively shields the user's data from prying eyes, ensuring that their sensitive information, including their zero-knowledge keyless credentials, remains protected from interception and unauthorized access.

Therefore, requiring users to have a VPN installed on their phones before using zero-knowledge keyless functionality is a necessary security measure to protect their sensitive information and maintain the integrity of the zero-knowledge authentication process. By routing all network traffic through a secure VPN tunnel, users can confidently use zero-knowledge keyless functionality without compromising their security.

## Authentication Methods Support

Once you've installed the Akeyless browser extension. Simply locate the Akeyless Password Manager mobile app. To securely access your Akeyless account, you can use one of the following authentication methods:

* Access-ID and Access-Key: Use your unique Access-ID and Access-Key combination for secure login.
* SAML: Leverage your existing SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) identity provider for streamlined authentication.
* OIDC: Employ your preferred OIDC (OpenID Connect) identity provider for a seamless login experience.
* LDAP: For environments configured with LDAP, you can authenticate using your LDAP credentials for secure access.
  * Configure the [LDAP gateway URL](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/configure-ldap-gateway-url) by way of advanced settings then login with Email option as a login type.
* Account Alias: Support for using an account alias to simplify identification and enhance user experience.
