# Sectigo Target

The **Sectigo Target** enables you to use **Sectigo** as a Public Certificate Authority (CA) with Akeyless [PKI Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-and-pkitls-certificates).

With a public CA, Akeyless cannot access the private key that signs certificates. Akeyless will programmatically validate the certificate signing request by contacting Sectigo through the [Akeyless Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview) using the domain owner's account details

Akeyless will store the issued certificates, manage them, and notify you of upcoming expiration events.

## Create a Sectigo Target in the Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and go to **Targets > New > Certificate Automation (Sectigo)**.

2. Define the Name of the target, and specify the Location as a path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target.

3. Select a **Protection key** with a Customer Fragment to enable Zero-Knowledge and click **Next**.
   [Read more about Zero-Knowledge Encryption](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/implement-zero-knowledge).

4. Define the remaining parameters as follows:

   * **Customer URI:** The Customer URI of the Sectigo account.

   * **Username:** Username used to log in to Sectigo.

   * **Password:** Password of the Sectigo account

   * **Organization ID:** Sectigo Organization ID.

   * **Certificate Profile ID:** Sectigo Certificate Profile ID.

   * **External Requester:** Sectigo External Requester username.

   * **Timeout (seconds):** Timeout in seconds waiting for certificate validation (min: 300, max: 3600, default is 300)

5. Click **Finish**.

## Create a Sectigo Target with the CLI

To create a Sectigo target with the CLI, run the following command:

```shell
akeyless target create globalsign \
--name <Target Name> \
--username <Username> \
--password <Password> \
--customer-uri <Sectigo Account CustomerUri> \
--organization-id <Sectigo Organization ID > \
--certificate-profile-id <Sectigo Certificate Profile ID> 
--external-requester <username of the requester>
```

For a complete list of parameters and their descriptions, visit the [CLI Reference](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-ref-targets#globalsign).

Once the Sectigo Target is created, it can be used to generate a [public certificate](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/public-ca).

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The Akeyless PKI Issuer does not support Sectigo approval workflows, make sure your Sectigo certificate profile does not require a second approval.
