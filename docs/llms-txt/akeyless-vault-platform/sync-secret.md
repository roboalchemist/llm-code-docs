# Sync Secrets

The Akeyless [Universal Secret Connector](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/universal-secrets-connector) provides a powerful way to ensure that secrets remain synchronized across multiple external secret management solutions. Whenever a secret value is updated in Akeyless, the connector automatically ensures that the updated value is propagated to all integrated systems in real time, eliminating the need for manual synchronization.

## Prerequisites

* Universal Secret Connector Item.

* An [Akeyless Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview) with **Read** permission on the associated USC and its target.

* An [Authentication Method](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-and-authentication-methods) with **Read** and **Update** permission on the [Rotated Secret](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rotated-secrets) item, and **Read** permission on the associated USC.

This solution makes managing secrets in remote endpoints more efficient and consistent, enabling a secure, centralized approach to secret lifecycle management.
