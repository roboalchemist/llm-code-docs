# Sync a Static Secret

[Static Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/static-secrets) can be configured with a **sync** setting, ensuring that any change to the secret’s value is automatically synced through the relevant [Universal Secrets Connector](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/universal-secrets-connector).

## Syncing a Static Secret with the CLI

Run the following command to sync a Static secret to an external Secret Management solution using the CLI:

```shell
akeyless static-secret-sync \
--name <Static Secret name> \
--usc-name <USC name> \
--remote-secret-name <remote secret name>
```

Where:

* `name`: The Static Secret name.
* `usc-name`: The name of the Universal Secret Connector.
* `remote-secret-name`: Remote Secret Name that will be created on the remote endpoint. If the secret already exists, sync will override its value and tags.

You can find the complete list of parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Static Secrets section](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-reference-static-secrets#static-secret-sync).

## Syncing a Static Secret with the Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and navigate to the [Static Secret](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-reference-static-secrets) item
2. Go to the **Sync** tab on the secret item and click **Attach**.
3. Set the following settings:

* **Universal Secret Connector Name:** Choose the target **Universal Secret Connector**.

* **Remote Secret Name:** Enter the name of the secret that will be created or updated on the remote endpoint.

* **Filter secret value (jq)**: Optional, to filter the value of the rotated secret, to sync only specific fields, or to manipulate the value using a jq expression, for example, `.password` and so on.

> ℹ️ **Note (Format restrictions):**
>
> Kubernetes and HashiCorp targets enforce that secrets are in JSON format, which means a valid jq filter could be, for example: `{"password": .password}`

Click **Save** to synchronize the rotated secret.

If an automatic sync fails, an event is triggered. In that case, you can perform a **manual sync** from this tab.
