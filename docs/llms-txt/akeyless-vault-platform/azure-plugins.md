# Azure Plugins

Akeyless integrates with Azure DevOps in multiple ways depending on your workflow and operational requirements.

Use this page to choose the integration path that best fits your team, then follow each plugin page for setup steps and additional configuration options.

* [Azure DevOps Extension](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/akeyless-azure-devops-extension): The official Akeyless extension for Azure DevOps pipelines, including a dedicated service connection and tasks for authentication, static secrets, dynamic secrets, and rotated secrets.
* [Azure DevOps Plugin](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/azure-devops-plugin): A HashiCorp Vault-compatible approach using the Vault Interaction task with the Akeyless [HashiCorp Vault Proxy](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/hashicorp-vault-proxy).

Akeyless supports Azure identity-based and JWT-based authentication patterns for these plugin paths.
