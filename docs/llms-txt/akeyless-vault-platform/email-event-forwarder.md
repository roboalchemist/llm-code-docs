# Email Event Forwarder

**Email Event Forwarder** enables you to forward event notifications to email addresses based on your configuration. These include notifications about **Items, Auth Methods, Targets, and Gateways**, which can be configured to be sent immediately or every 1 to 24 hours.

## Create an Email Event Forwarder Using the CLI

To set up a **Email** Event Forwarder, use the following command:

```shell
akeyless event-forwarder create email \
--name MyForwarder \
--email-to <comma-separated email addresses> \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
--override-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/console/' \ #or use port 18888
--include-error false \
--items-event-source-locations </MySecrets/*> \
--targets-event-source-locations </MyTargets/*> \
--event-types <event type> \
--runner-type[=immediate] <immediate / periodic> \
--every <1-24 hours>
```

The main parameters for the command are as follows:

* `name`: **Event Forwarder** name

* `gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

* `override-url` Override Akeyless default URL inside the email with your Gateway Console endpoint `https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/console`. (or use your gateway URL at port `18888`)

* `items-event-source-locations`: **Items** event sources to forward events about, for example: `/MySecrets/*`

* `targets-event-source-locations` **Targets** event sources to forward events about, for example: `/MyTargets/*`

* `auth-methods-event-source-locations` **Auth Methods** event sources to forward events about, for example: `/API-Keys/*`

* `gateways-event-source-locations`: **Gateways** event sources to forward events about, for example, the relevant Gateways cluster URL: `https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000`

* `event-types`: A comma-separated list of types of events to notify about, [view the full list of the available events](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/event-center#event-types)
