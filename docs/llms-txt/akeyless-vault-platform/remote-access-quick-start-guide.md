# Quick Start

This quick start guide is intended to get you started with deploying a Gateway (with Remote Access) using the most basic, required parameters and a clean Kubernetes cluster. Within just a few minutes you will see how easy it is to complete the Gateway deployment and secure your user and machine access. You can also use just-in-time credentials with remote access to log into your various applications and services.

Akeyless Gateway can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager with or without Remote Access. This can also be deployed using Docker Compose, but this guide will focus on Kubernetes.

Akeyless provides a Helm chart to bootstrap the Akeyless Gateway deployment. In Kubernetes deployments, the configuration process takes place before the actual installation.

> ℹ️ **Note (Security):**
>
> This guide was tested with Amazon EKS and is **not secured** with TLS. We strongly recommend not using this setup in production or with real credentials.

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes Cluster
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) Installed
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
* Minimum 1 vCPU available with 2 GB RAM per resource
* The following ports need to be open on the cluster:

| Service                                                                          | Port |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| [Gateway Configuration Manager](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/configure-gateway) | 8000 |
| SSH Access                                                                       | 22   |

> ℹ️ **Note (First things first):**
>
> Before we get started, you will need an Authentication Method with an Access Role and an SSH Certificate Issuer. If you already have both, skip to the [Remote Access Configuration](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-access-quick-start-guide#remote-access-section) section.

## Create Your Authentication Method

For this guide, API key authentication is used for simplicity.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> The **API Key Authentication Method** is not recommended for production use. It works well for getting started with Akeyless, quick proofs of concept (POCs), and other temporary scenarios.

To create your API Key follow the below CLI commands:

1. Create an API Key authentication method with the CLI, run the following command:

   ```shell
   akeyless auth-method create api-key --name MyFirstAPIKey
   ```

2. Configure your CLI to work with the API Key by running the following command:

   ```shell
   akeyless configure --profile default --access-id <Your API Key Auth AccessID> --access-key <Your API Key>
   ```

## Create Your Access Role

Follow this tutorial to create an Access Role and associate your Authentication Method or you can follow the below CLI commands:

1. Create a new access role:

   ```shell
   akeyless create-role --name MyFirstRole
   ```

2. Set the role with access to all Items under /path/to/folder/ with Read and List permissions:

   ```shell
   akeyless set-role-rule --role-name MyFirstRole --path "/path/to/folder/\*" --capability read --capability list
   ```

3. Also, set the role with access to Targets:

   ```shell
   akeyless set-role-rule --role-name MyFirstRole --path "/path/to/folder/\*" --rule-type target-rule --capability read --capability list
   ```

4. Associate the Authentication Method with the Role:

   ```shell
   akeyless assoc-role-am --role-name MyFirstRole --am-name MyFirstAPIKey
   ```

Now you have an Authentication Method with the right access to deploy the Gateway.

## Create Your SSH Certificate Issuer

Follow the below commands:

1. Create a new RSA DFC Key in your Akeyless account:

   ```shell
   akeyless create-dfc-key -n MyRSAKey -a RSA2048
   ```

2. Create the SSH Certificate Issuer:

   ```shell
   akeyless create-ssh-cert-issuer --name your-ssh-cert-issuer-name --signer-key-name MyRSAKey --allowed-users 'ubuntu' --ttl 300
   ```

> ℹ️ **Note (SSH connection):**
>
> This is the bare minimum required to have an SSH Certificate Issuer and access the Remote Access Portal. For more details on connecting to a resource by way of SSH, please see the docs [here](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates).

## Configuration

### Add the Akeyless Helm Repo

Add the following repository to your Helm repository list:

```shell
helm repo add akeyless https://akeylesslabs.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configure the Helm Chart

Here you will find the bare minimum values you will need in your Helm chart to get up and running.

You can [download the chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akeylesslabs/helm-charts/refs/heads/main/charts/akeyless-gateway/values.yaml) and open it in your favorite editor.

Below is an explanation of the minimum required fields by section. Find them in the file and edit them as per the instructions.

#### Global Section

```yaml values.yaml
############
## Global ##
############

akeylessGatewayAuth:
  gatewayAccessId: <your_access_id>
  gatewayAccessType: access_key
  gatewayCredentialsExistingSecret: akeyless-auth

```

`gatewayAccessId`: For this quick start, we will use the [API Key](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/auth-with-api-key) authentication method. Add your API Key's `Access ID`.

`gatewayAccessType`: This is already set to `access_key` for API Key authentication.

`gatewayCredentialsExistingSecret`: The value is already set to `akeyless-auth`. A Kubernetes Secret is **required** for the deployment. To create this, follow the steps described in [API Key Authentication in the Akeyless Gateway chart](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-deploy-kubernetes-helm#api-key-authentication).

#### Gateway Section

There is no need to change anything here. Note that the Gateway deployment creates two pods (replicas) in the cluster by default. You can customize that by changing the `replicaCount` variable.

#### Remote Access Section

```yaml values.yaml
######################################################
## Default values for akeyless-secure-remote-access ##
######################################################
sra:
  # Enable secure-remote-access. Valid values: true/false.
  enabled: true
  
    sshConfig:
    replicaCount: 1

    config:
         CAPublicKey: |
            ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDAPzDVmeABzsGd0lEl9m2fdgmCzOLVmEGcLxNkn...
            ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD9SkmW9Ay7YwWQk9o3r6a4qQ7pI2Yw1M...
```

To configure Remote Access, follow these steps:

`sra`: Set the `enabled` field to `true`. Note that the Remote Access deployment creates two more pods in the cluster, one for Web and one for SSH.

`CAPublicKey`: For this to work properly, you are also required to provide the matching public key of the key you used to create the SSH Certificate Issuer in Akeyless. You can provide one or more CA public keys. More info can be found [here](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates). Add each `ssh-rsa` value on a new line.

## Deployment

### Deploy the Helm Chart

Once you have finished those steps, run the following command to create your deployment:

```shell
helm install quick-start-gw akeyless/akeyless-gateway -f values.yaml
```

### Verify Deployment Success

Run `kubectl get pods -w` to check that your pods are in `Running` state and that the Gateway and Remote Access services are available.

Then run `kubectl get services` and look for the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the service starting with `quick-start-gw`. Copy the `EXTERNAL-IP` and paste that into your browser with port 8000/console (for example, `http://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/console`). If you get the login page, you have successfully deployed the Gateway!

#### Gateway URLs

For the Gateway, you can access the following:

* The Gateway's Internal Console is located at `http://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/console`. The internal console means you are working from inside the Gateway and talking directly with the SaaS. If you are using `https://console.akeyless.io`, you will not be able to interact with this Gateway as it is not secured with TLS.

#### Remote Access URLs

For Remote Access, you can access the following:

* The Remote Access Internal Web Portal is located at `http://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/sra/portal`

  ![Illustration for: A screenshot of the Remote Access Internal Web Portal](https://files.readme.io/080e307-Screenshot_2024-08-06_at_11.17.00.png)

* Remote Access can also be accessed using our public URL: `https://zerotrust.akeyless.io`. If you are using the public URL for RDP, Web, or similar sessions, you will be required to add your Web URL endpoint: `http://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/sra/web-client`

## Testing Out Remote Access

Here we will lay out the steps to get a SAML user to access the Remote Access Portal.

1. Firstly, you need to make sure you have your SAML application set up, for example, an Okta account set up with the Akeyless application configured. You will also need to retrieve your Metadata URL for this.

2. Next, run the following command to create your SAML Auth Method and make sure to input your Kubernetes Service External-IP address:

   ```shell
   akeyless auth-method create saml --name mySamlAuth --unique-identifier email --idp-metadata-url <your-okta-metadata-url> --allowed-redirect-uri https://console.akeyless.io/login-saml,http://127.0.0.1:*,http://<EXTERNAL-IP-of-K8s-Service>:*
   ```

3. Create a role with access to Items with **List** permissions only. And set Secure Remote Access with Allow Access permissions.

   ```shell
   akeyless set-role-rule --role-name MySamlRole --path "/*" --capability list
   ```

   ```shell
   akeyless set-role-rule --role-name MySamlRole --path "/\*" --rule-type sra-rule --capability allow_access
   ```

4. Associate your Auth Method as follows:

   ```shell
   akeyless assoc-role-am --role-name MySamlRole --am-name MySamlAuth
   ```

5. Next, open your browser and go to your Remote Access internal endpoint: `http://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000/sra/portal`

6. Enter your SAML AccessID and click “Sign In”. You will be redirected to your SAML service login page to log in and then when you finish that will redirect you to a page with various resources you can set at a later time (refer to the following image). Congrats!

## Next Steps

With a Gateway deployed, you can now test out using just-in-time [Dynamic Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/how-to-create-dynamic-secret) for various applications and services by setting up [Targets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/targets). If you are also using Remote Access, you can also set up Remote Access on those Targets and log into those [Resources](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/supported-resource-types) securely from anywhere by [reading the docs](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-access-overview).
