# Overview

Akeyless **Certificate Lifecycle Management (CLM)** solution provides a seamless way to create, provision, monitor, renew, and revoke digital certificates. Certificates are essential for securing communications, verifying identities, and establishing trust across systems. With Akeyless **CLM**, these processes are streamlined while reducing the risks of expired or mismanaged certificates.

Unlike solutions that rely on **external KMS** services, the **Akeyless CLM** solution securely manages keys directly within the Akeyless Platform. Root Keys can be generated as [DFC Keys](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/encryption-keys), ensuring private keys remain protected at all times.

Akeyless integrates natively into diverse environments without requiring external secrets, leveraging its broad range of [Authentication Methods](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-and-authentication-methods). Fine-grained [RBAC](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rbac) controls ensure each identity has the precise level of access it needs, in line with policies defined for the [PKI Certificate Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-and-pkitls-certificates).

Secrets used for provisioning can be automatically [rotated](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rotated-secrets), removing the overhead of managing the lifecycle of external secrets. Operational visibility is built in, with full tracking through Akeyless [Events](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/event-center) and [Audit Logs](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/audit-logs).
