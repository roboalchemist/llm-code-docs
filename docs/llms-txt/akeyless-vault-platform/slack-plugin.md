# Slack Plugin

A **One-time Password** (OTP), also known as a one-time PIN, is a password valid for only one login session or transaction, on a computer system or other digital device. Akeyless can be used as a **Slack** app to share **OTP** easily inside your Organization **Slack** account.

## Configuration

Slack [Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands) allows users to invoke the Akeyless app by typing a `/akeyless` in the message field. By enabling Slash Commands, the Akeyless app can be summoned by users from any conversation in Slack.

To Set the Slash command a workspace admin shall perform the following configuration:

**Command** - the name of the command, set to `/akeyless`

**Request URL** - the URL we'll send a payload to, when the command is invoked by a user. Set to `https://sfs.akeyless-security.com`

Short Description - exactly what it sounds like, a short description of what your command does, for example, `Akeyless Secrets Management`
