# Custom Fields

Custom Fields allow you to enforce structured metadata on Akeyless objects such as **Secrets**, **Keys**, and **Certificates**. These fields help align your secrets and keys management with organizational policies.

For example:

* Every Secret may require an `Owner` field.
* Keys can optionally include a `Managed By` field.

Administrators can define which fields are available for each object type in Akeyless and whether those fields are required or optional.

> ℹ️ **Note:** Currently, Custom Fields supports only **Items**.

## Manage Custom Field

### Create a Custom Field

Run the following CLI command to create a new custom field in the account:

```shell
akeyless account-custom-field \
--object-type STATIC_SECRET \
--name <custom field name> \
--required[=false] <True/False> 
```

Where:

`object-type`: The object type to create the custom field, for example, `static-secret`, `rotated-secret`, `encryption-keys`, and so on.

`name`: The name of the custom field.

`required=[false]`: Mark the custom field as required or optional.

Once a custom field is created, it applies to all new objects of the selected type. If an existing object is updated, the defined custom field rules will also apply.

### Delete a Custom Field

Delete a custom field from the account:

```shell
akeyless account-custom-field delete --id <custom field ID>
```

### Update a Custom Field

Updates an existing custom field in the account:

```shell
akeyless account-custom-field update \
--id <custom field ID> \
--name <new name> \
--required=`[false]`
```

### Fetch a Custom Field

Retrieves a custom field:

```shell
akeyless account-custom-field get --id <custom field ID>
```

Retrieves a list of all custom fields in the account:

```shell
akeyless account-custom-field list --object item --object-type static-secret
```

## Manage Custom Field from Console

To manage custom fields in the account, navigate to your **Account Settings -> Custom Fields**, click **Add**

1. Provide the new custom field name
2. Choose the Object type in Akeyless to which this custom field will be attached. For example, **Items->Static Secret**
3. Select if this new custom field will be mandatory or not.

Once a custom field is created, it applies to all new objects of the selected type. If an existing object is updated, the defined custom field rules will also apply.
