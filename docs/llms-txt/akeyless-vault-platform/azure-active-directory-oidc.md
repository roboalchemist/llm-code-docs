# Azure AD - OIDC

To use Azure Active Directory (AAD) as an IdP to authenticate the Akeyless Platform by way of OIDC, follow the steps below.

## Create an Application

1. In your Azure account, go to **App registrations > New registrations**.

   ![Illustration for: Create an Application 1. In your Azure account, go to App registrations > New registrations.](https://files.readme.io/c9edb74-image-20210902-145138.png)

2. For **Redirect URI**, select **Web** for **Application type**. Set `https://auth.akeyless.io/oidc/callback` as the value and select **Register**.

3. Once the app has been created, you need to obtain the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and the **Issuer URL**:

   * The **Client ID** can be fetched from **Overview > Application (client) ID**:

   * The **Client Secret** can be created under **Certificates & Secrets > New Client Secret** (make sure to copy the Secret **Value**, not the Secret ID):

   * The **Issuer URL** can be fetched from **Overview > Endpoints > OpenID Connect metadata document** (note that the suffix **/.well-known/openid-configuration** should be omitted so that the Issuer URL will look like: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenant-id-abcd-efgh-a123-b456/v2.0`):

4. To add the AD group as a sub-claim, go to **Token configuration > Add Groups Claim**:

5. To bind the Azure application with your Akeyless account, create an OIDC Authentication Method using either CLI or UI, as described below.

## Create an OIDC Authentication Method with the CLI

```shell
akeyless auth-method create oidc --name 'my Azure app' --issuer https://{your-issuer-url} --client-id {your-client-id} --client-secret {your-client-secret} --unique-identifier {your-unique-identifier (for example, 'email' or 'username')}
```

This can also be done from the Console UI by creating a New OIDC Auth Method and filling in the same required parameters.

Notice that **unique-identifier** must be an available claim, which out of the box might be the `preferred_username` field.
If you wish to use a field such as **email** instead, make sure to first **Add optional claim** under **Token configuration** (in the Azure App), and add the **email** claim.

To log in with SSO to Akeyless using your new Azure AD OIDC Auth Method, log in to the Console, browse to Auth Methods, select the newly created OIDC Auth Method, and click **Generate OIDC Bookmark URL**. This provides the SSO link.

## Log in With OIDC Using the CLI

Configure a new profile with your Access ID from the previous step and OIDC type (if no profile name is provided, the default will be configured):

```shell
akeyless configure --access-id <your-access-id> --access-type oidc --profile 'azure-app'
```

Now, you can run any Akeyless CLI command and be authenticated with the Azure application:

```shell
akeyless list-items --profile azure-app
```
