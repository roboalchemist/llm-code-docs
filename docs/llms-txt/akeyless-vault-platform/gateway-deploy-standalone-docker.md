# Standalone Docker Deployment

Installation

## Prerequisites

* An [Authentication Method](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-and-authentication-methods). Make sure it has the right [access permission](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rbac) to create and manage [Secrets, Keys](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/manage-your-secrets-overview) and [Targets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/targets).

> ℹ️ **Note:** The following example uses the account default [Authentication Method](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-and-authentication-methods), using the account owner's email and password with superuser privileges on the account.

* A Linux or a Windows machine with [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed with a minimum 1 vCPU available with 2 GB RAM.

* Network port `8000` on the cluster must be open **only for internal network access**, allowing access to the following services using the corresponding endpoints:

| Service                                                                        | Endpoint   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [Gateway Console](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-configuration-manager) | `/console` |
| [HashiCorp Vault Proxy](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/hashicorp-vault-proxy)   | `/hvp`     |
| Akeyless V1 REST API                                                           | `/api/v1`  |
| Akeyless V2 REST API                                                           | `/api/v2`  |
| [KMIP Server](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/kmip-server)                       | `5696`     |

> ⚠️ **Warning:**
>
> Make sure that this server is not globally open to the public network. Akeyless Gateway requires only connections to Akeyless SaaS Core Services.

## Deployment

To deploy a standalone instance of Akeyless Gateway, run the following command:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 5696:5696 --name akeyless-gateway akeyless/base:latest-akeyless
```

After executing the above command, a new container named `akeyless-gateway` should run on Docker (use `docker ps` for confirmation). It contains a single instance of Akeyless Gateway.

To upgrade your current Gateway version, simply restart the container using the `docker restart <container name>` command.

> ℹ️ **Note:** In this example, the Gateway was deployed without a default Authentication Method as part of the deployment. Thus, **the first Authentication Method** used to log in becomes the admin user on this Gateway.

For further deployment options, visit the [Gateway Docker Advanced Configuration](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/advance-gw-docker-configuration) page.

### Initial Configuration

To configure your Akeyless Gateway:

1. On your browser, navigate to `http://Your-Akeyless-Gateway-URL:8000/console` and log in.

2. Navigate to **Gateways > Select Your Gateway > Manage Gateway**
