# Webhook Event Forwarder

Event forwarders are tools you can configure through the Event Center to get notified on other platforms when a certain event type happens. For example, you might want to be notified every time a certain [Certificate](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/certificate-storage) is about to expire or when a user requests access to an item in your Akeyless Platform.

**Webhook Event Forwarder** enables you to forward event notifications to **Endpoint URLs** based on your configuration. These include notifications about **Items, Auth Methods, Targets, and Gateways**, which can be configured to be sent immediately or every 1 to 24 hours.

## Create a Webhook Event Forwarder Using the CLI

To set up a **Webhook** Event Forwarder, use the following command:

```shell User-Pass
akeyless event-forwarder create webhook \
--name MyForwarder \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
--url <Webhook URL>
--items-event-source-locations </MySecrets/*> \
--targets-event-source-locations </MyTargets/*>
--auth-type user-pass
--username <Username> \
--password <Password> \
--event-types <event type> \
--runner-type[=immediate] <immediate, periodic> \
--every <1-24 hours>
```

```shell Token
akeyless event-forwarder create webhook \
--name MyForwarder \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
--url <Webhook URL>
--items-event-source-locations </MySecrets/*> \
--targets-event-source-locations </MyTargets/*>
--auth-type bearer-token \
--auth-token <Base64-encoded Token string> \
--event-types <event type> \
--runner-type[=immediate] <immediate, periodic> \
--every <1-24 hours>
```

```shell Certificate
akeyless event-forwarder create webhook \
--name MyForwarder \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
--url <Webhook URL>
--items-event-source-locations </MySecrets/*> \
--targets-event-source-locations </MyTargets/*>
--auth-type certificate \
--client-cert-file-name <file containing PEM certificate> \
--client-cert-data <Base64-encoded PEM certificate> \
--private-key-file-name <file containing a PEM RSA Private Key> \
--private-key-data <Base64-encoded PEM RSA Private Key> \
--event-types <event type> \
--runner-type[=immediate] <immediate, periodic> \
--every <1-24 hours>
```

The main parameters for the command are as follows:

* `name`: **Event Forwarder** name

* `gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

* `url`: The server that will receive the events.

* `items-event-source-locations`: Items event sources to forward events about, for example: `/abc/*`

* `event-types`: A comma-separated list of types of events to notify about, [view the full list of the available events](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/event-center#event-types)

* `auth-type`: The Webhook Authentication Type \[\`user-pass\`, \`bearer-token\`, \`certificate\`]

  * For `user-pass`:

    * `username`: Username for Authentication

    * `password`: Password for Authentication

  * For `bearer-token`:

    * `auth-token`: Base64-encoded Token string

  * For `certificate`:

    * `client-cert-file-name`: Name of a file containing a `PEM` certificate

    * `client-cert-data`: `Base64` encoded `PEM` certificate

    * `private-key-file-name`: Name of a file containing a `PEM` **RSA Private Key**

    * `private-key-data`: `Base64` encoded `PEM` **RSA Private Key**

* `runner-type[=immediate]`: Event Forwarder runner type \[\`immediate\`, \`periodic\`]

* `every`: Rate of periodic runner repetition in hours

  * Provide: **Username** and a **Password**

* For **Token**:

  * Provide: **Base64** encoded Token string

* For **Certificate**:

  * Provide: **PEM Certificate** and a **PEM Private Key**

* **Gateway**: Choose a gateway from the list

* **Protection-Key**: Protection key other than the default, if you wish to change it

* Choose either to:
