# Akeyless SCP

Akeyless SCP enables secure copy by way of [Remote Access](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-access-setup-overview).

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> Akeyless SCP currently supports only Unix-like operating systems.

## Prerequisite

* Akeyless [Remote Access](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-access-setup-overview).

* [SSH Certificate Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates).

* OpenSSH V7.3 or higher on target servers.

## Usage

1. Download Akeyless SCP script:

   ```curl Akeyless SCP
   curl -o akeyless-scp https://download.akeyless.io/Akeyless_Artifacts/Linux/SSH/akeyless-scp
   chmod +x akeyless-scp
   mv akeyless-scp /usr/local/bin
   ```

2. Create a resource file called `~/.akeyless-connect.rc` as follows:

   ```shell akeyless-connect.rc
   # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   # Copyright © 2019-2023  Akeyless Security LTD.
   #
   # All rights reserved
   # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   #
   # This file is a user-specific configuration file for `akeyless connect` CLI command, part of Akeyless Secure Remote Access
   # This file should be located under the user's home directory, named explicitly: .akeyless-connect.rc
   #

   # IDENTITY_FILE - the path to the ssh-key to be signed and used for Zero Trust session (if empty, default ssh-key is used)
   IDENTITY_FILE=""

   # CERT_ISSUER_NAME - full path to the Akeyless SSH Cert Issuer to use for Zero Trust session
   CERT_ISSUER_NAME=""

   # AKEYLESS_PROFILE - Akeyless CLI profile to be used
   AKEYLESS_PROFILE="default"

   # Akeyless CLI binary (if needed)
   AKEYLESS_CLI=akeyless

   # AKEYLESS_GW_REST_API - URL for Akeyless API Gateway (REST API)
   AKEYLESS_GW_REST_API=""

   # Following are used for control service, to configure the temporary session:
   # ${BASTION_API_PROTO}://"${BASTION_API_PREFIX}${BASTION_HOST}${BASTION_API_PATH}":"${BASTION_API_PORT}
   #
   BASTION_API_PREFIX=""
   BASTION_API_PATH=""
   BASTION_API_PROTO=http
   BASTION_API_PORT=9900
   BASTION_SSH_PORT=22

   # Allow caching of temp session creds
   SESSION_CACHING=no

   # Display connection stages
   DISPLAY_STAGES=yes

   # Use SSH Agent to store user's identity keys.
   USE_SSH_AGENT=yes

   SSH_EXTRA_ARGS=""

   # Path to SSH executable. For example, /usr/bin/ssh
   SSH_EXTERNAL_CLIENT="ssh"
   ```

   The latest version of this file can be found in [Akeyless official artifacts](https://rest.akeyless.io/Akeyless_Artifacts/Linux/SSH/).

   Edit the settings as follows:

   `IDENTITY_FILE` - Default is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Full path to the private key to be signed and used for the Zero Trust session.

   `CERT_ISSUER_NAME` - Full path to the Akeyless [SSH Certificates Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates) item.

   `AKEYLESS_PROFILE` - Set the default profile that will be used from your Akeyless [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli). By default, it's using the `default` profile of your Akeyless CLI.

   `AKEYLESS_CLI` - Akeyless CLI binary (if needed).

   `AKEYLESS_GW_REST_API` - Set your Akeyless Gateway URL on port `8080` for [Zero-Knowledge](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/zero-knowledge) items and for internal network access.

   `BASTION_API_PROTO` - Default is `http`. Set to `https` when your [Secure Remote Access Bastion](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-access-setup-k8s) is configured with TLS.

   `BASTION_API_PORT` - Default is set to `9900`. Set your matching `ssh-sra` cluster service port.

   `BASTION_SSH_PORT` - Default is set to `22`. Set your matching `ssh-sra` cluster service port.

   **Optional** when working with Application Load Balancers, you can set the exact path of your `ssh-sra` service, which listens to the bastion `api` control port:

   `BASTION_API_PREFIX` - Set your path prefix as your load balancer settings.

   `BASTION_API_PATH` - Set your path as your load balancer settings.

   Where the URL will be set as follow:

   `${BASTION_API_PROTO}://"${BASTION_API_PREFIX}${BASTION_HOST}${BASTION_API_PATH}":"${BASTION_API_PORT}`

   `SSH_EXTRA_ARGS` - Add any official SSH arguments.

3. Use the `akeyless-scp` command to perform secure copy to remote target server by way of Akeyless Secure Remote Access Bastion:

   Full options list:

   ```shell
   Usage: /usr/local/bin/akeyless-scp <user@remote-server[:port]> -v <bastion-server[:port]> [options]

   optional arguments:
       -i, --identity_file     Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read [default is '~/.ssh/id_rsa']
       -c, --cert-issuer-name  Akeyless certificate issuer name [mandatory]
       -l, --local-file        File to copy [mandatory]
       -r, --remote-file       File to copy [default is '~/']
       -d, --direction         Transfer direction, can be: upload/download [default is 'upload']
       --profile               Use a specific profile from your Akeyless CLI
       --ssh-extra-args        Use to add official SSH arguments (except -i)
   ```

   For example, this command will copy a local file to a remote server.

   ```shell
   akeyless-scp user@destination-server -v <sra-bastion-ssh-service> --local-file /full/local/location/file --remote-file /remote/location/file
   ```

## Working With SSH Keys

When the remote host doesn’t support SSH Certificates, you can still work with **Akeyless SCP** utilizing SSH Keys where the relevant private key is stored as a [Static Secret](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/static-secrets) within Akeyless, where the connection from the client to the Akeyless Bastion is established over short-lived SSH certificate, and from the Akeyless Bastion, the connection is established over SSH using keys, for example:

```shell
akeyless-scp <username>@<target-host> -v <sra-bastion-ssh-service> --local-file demo_file --remote-file /home/ubuntu/demo_file --name "/path/to/static-secret-of-ssh_private_key"
```

The `--name` should point to a **static secret** in Akeyless holding the SSH private key. Users should have **only** `list` permission on this item, while the Bastion should have `read` permission.

In that case, a tunnel will be established, and the Akeyless Bastions will fetch the key and allow the client to use it without exposing it to them.
