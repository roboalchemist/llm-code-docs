# Venafi Cloud

> ℹ️ **Note:** Venafi recently became CyberArk Machine Identity Security.

To work with the Venafi Cloud platform in CyberArk Machine Identity Security, you can choose either to work with CyberArk Machine Identity Security as your certificate issuer or to work with Akeyless as your issuer.

## Prerequisites

* Akeyless [Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview)

* Venafi Cloud

## Usage

### Venafi Issuer

The following command creates a Venafi **Dynamic Secret** using Venafi as the **certificate issuer**.

```shell
akeyless dynamic-secret create venafi \
  --name my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
  --venafi-api-key <YOUR VENAFI API KEY> \
  --venafi-zone <YOUR VENAFI ZONE>
```

Where:

`name`: Dynamic secret name.

`gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

`venafi-api-key`: Venafi API Key.

`venafi-zone`: The Venafi zone to use when issuing new certificates (policies will be pulled from here) - for example: `<Application_Name>/<Issuing_template_name>`

### Akeyless Issuer

The following commands create a Venafi **Dynamic Secret** using Akeyless as the **certificate issuer**.

When using Akeyless as the issuer, first, you need to create an RSA key with a **self-signed certificate** attached:

```shell
akeyless create-dfc-key \
--name venafi-cloud \
--alg RSA2048 \
--generate-self-signed-certificate \
--certificate-common-name venafi-cloud \
--certificate-ttl 10
```

Where:

`name`: A unique name for the encryption key. The name can include the path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new authentication method, using slash / separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the encryption key.

`alg`: Supported algorithms: `RSA1024`, `RSA2048`, `RSA3072` `RSA4096`.

`generate-self-signed-certificate`: Generate a self-signed certificate.

`certificate-common-name`: Common name for the generated certificate.

`certificate-ttl`: TTL in days for the generated certificate.

*Note: Once the key is created, it will be uploaded automatically to Akeyless.*

The certificate attached to the private key must have at least a Common Name (CN) with it.

Create the Venafi **Dynamic Secret** in Akeyless Gateway:

```shell
akeyless dynamic-secret create venafi \
  --name my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
  --venafi-api-key <YOUR VENAFI API KEY> \
  --venafi-zone <YOUR VENAFI ZONE> \
  --allowed-domains '[*]' \
  --allow-subdomains \
  --sign-using-akeyless-pki \
  --signer-key-name venafi-cloud \
  --user-ttl 2160h
```

Where:

`name`: Dynamic secret name.

`gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

`venafi-api-key`: Venafi-API-Key.

`venafi-zone`: Venafi zone.

`allowed-domains:` List of allowed-domains.

`allow-subdomains`: Whether to allow subdomains.

`sign-using-akeyless-pki`: Issue certificates using Akeyless PKI.

`signer-key-name`: Signer key name in Akeyless.

Once your Venafi dynamic secret has been successfully created, you can request a new certificate.

### Certificate Request

Certificate request using **Common Name (CN)**:

```shell
akeyless get-dynamic-secret-value \
  -n my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --args common_name=any-common-name.company.example.com
```

Certificate request using a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**:

To fetch a new certificate by way of **CSR**, you need to create your **CSR** in Akeyless:

```shell
CSR=$(akeyless generate-csr \
--name venafi-test \
--generate-key \
--key-type dfc \
--alg RSA2048 \
--common-name marketing.newyork.company.com | base64)
```

Get the Dynamic Secret using the **Certificate request:**

```shell
akeyless get-dynamic-secret-value \
  -n my-venafi-dynamic secret \
  --args csr=$CSR
```

In the response you’ll see the relevant information and artifacts for the request including the `certificate`, `serial number`, `common name`, and `expiration`.

Depending on your flow you may also see the `certificate chain`, `issuing ca`, `ca chain`, and `private key`.

The artifacts `certificate`, `certificate chain`, and `private key` can also be found as Static Secrets under the Artifacts Folder defined in the Dynamic Secret's settings.
