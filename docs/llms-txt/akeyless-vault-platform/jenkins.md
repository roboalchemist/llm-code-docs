# Jenkins Plugin

## Introduction

The [Akeyless Plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/akeyless-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#fetching-a-static-secret) enables secure integration of Akeyless-managed secrets and certificates within Jenkins pipelines. It supports multiple authentication methods, ensuring seamless and secure access to secrets and certificates.

Additionally, JSON-structured secrets can be retrieved by specifying keys, allowing precise control over the data fetched from Akeyless.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to authenticate and retrieve items using the Akeyless Plugin for Jenkins.

### Setting API Key Authentication

The following configuration uses an existing API Key in Akeyless for Jenkins authentication.

### Fetching a Static Secret

The following configuration will fetch a static secret to your pipeline. This example uses a JSON-Structured secret, where only the UserName key of the secret is saved to User Environment Variable.
