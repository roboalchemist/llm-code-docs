# Certificate Storage

## Overview

Akeyless Certificate storage allows you to securely store, sort, and browse through your certificates in one secure location, as well as set expiration notifications so you are always prepared.

The certificates are treated as their own type of item inside the Akeyless Platform with their parsed information saved in the form of a JSON array to represent the certificate chain. The item will include both the certificate itself and the private key (if it exists), which will be stored completely encrypted.

## Managing a Certificate with the CLI

### Creating a New Certificate

To create a new certificate, use the following command:

```shell create certificate
akeyless create-certificate \
--name <certificate-name> \
--certificate <path-to-certificate>
```

The main parameters for the command are as follows:

* `name`: A unique name for the Certificate. The name can include the path to the virtual folder in which you want to create it, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the Certificate.

* `certificate`: Path to a file that contains the certificate in one of the following formats: `pem,cer,crt,pfx,p12`.

* `certificate-data`: The content of the certificate in Base64 format. When this parameter is provided, the `certificate` path parameter is not required.

* `private-key`: Optional, path to the file with the certificate's private key.

* `key-data`: The content of the certificate’s private key in Base64 format. When this parameter is provided, the `private-key` path parameter is not required.

* `expiration-event-in`: How many days before the expiration of the certificate would you like to be notified, this parameter can be added multiple times for multiple notifications.

You can find the complete list of parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Certificates](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-reference-certificates#create-certificate) section.

### Getting a Certificate

To view a certificate's value, use the following command:

```shell get certificates
akeyless get-certificate-value \
--name <certificate-name>
```

This command will return the certificates with the chain if it exists, as well as the private key if it exists.

You can find the complete list of parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Certificates](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-reference-certificates#get-certificate-value) section.

### Updating a Certificate

This command is similar to the creation command and uses the same parameters, but instead of creating a new item it will update the data in the existing item and overwrite the expiration notifications. The command is as follows:

```shell update-certificate
akeyless update-certificate-value \
--name <certificate-name> \
--certificate <path-to-certificate>
```

All of the parameters from the creation command will also apply here.
