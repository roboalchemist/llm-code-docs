# Let's Encrypt Target

The [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) Target enables the use of **Let's Encrypt** as a Public Certificate Authority (CA) with an Akeyless [PKI Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-and-pkitls-certificates).

With a public CA, Akeyless cannot access the private key that signs certificates. Akeyless validates certificate issuance requests by connecting to **Let's Encrypt** through the [Akeyless Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/api-gw).

The Let's Encrypt integration uses an [ACME Client (v2)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555).

To prove domain ownership, Let's Encrypt requires an ACME challenge. Let's Encrypt documents `HTTP-01`, `DNS-01`, and `TLS-ALPN-01` challenge methods. For the Akeyless Let's Encrypt target, the supported challenge types are:

* `http` (default)
* `dns`

To prove domain ownership, the Akeyless integration supports the following validation methods:

* **DNS validation**: Ownership is proven by adding a DNS TXT record. This requires the domain to be managed in a supported DNS provider's hosted zone (for example, AWS Route 53, GCP Cloud DNS, or Azure DNS).

* **HTTP validation**: Ownership is proven by hosting a challenge file at `http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/.well-known/acme-challenge/` and returning the expected value during validation.

## Create a Let's Encrypt Target with the CLI

To create a Let's Encrypt target with the CLI, use one of the following examples based on the challenge method and DNS provider:

```shell DNS with AWS
akeyless target create lets-encrypt \
--name <Target Name> \
--email <ACME Account Email> \
--acme-challenge dns \
--dns-target-creds <AWS DNS Target Name> \
--hosted-zone <Route53 Hosted Zone ID>
```

```shell DNS with GCP
akeyless target create lets-encrypt \
--name <Target Name> \
--email <ACME Account Email> \
--acme-challenge dns \
--dns-target-creds <GCP DNS Target Name> \
--gcp-project <GCP Project ID>
```

```shell DNS with Azure
akeyless target create lets-encrypt \
--name <Target Name> \
--email <ACME Account Email> \
--acme-challenge dns \
--dns-target-creds <Azure DNS Target Name> \
--resource-group <Azure Resource Group Name>
```

```shell HTTP
akeyless target create lets-encrypt \
--name <Target Name> \
--email <ACME Account Email> \
--acme-challenge http
```

Where:

* `name`: A unique name for the target. The name can include a path to a virtual folder by using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, Akeyless creates it with the target.

* `email`: Email address used for ACME account registration.

* `lets-encrypt-url`: Use this when you want to select the ACME environment explicitly. Supported values are `production` (default) and `staging`.

* `acme-challenge`: Use this when you need DNS validation or want to set the challenge type explicitly. Supported values are `http` (default) and `dns`.

* `dns-target-creds`: Use this when `--acme-challenge=dns`. This is required for DNS validation. Supported target types are AWS, Azure, and GCP.

* `hosted-zone`: Use this when `--acme-challenge=dns` and `--dns-target-creds` points to an AWS target. This identifies the Route 53 hosted zone.

* `resource-group`: Use this when `--acme-challenge=dns` and `--dns-target-creds` points to an Azure target.

* `gcp-project`: Use this when `--acme-challenge=dns` and `--dns-target-creds` points to a GCP target and the project ID cannot be derived automatically.

* `timeout`: Use this when challenge validation needs a custom wait time. Default is `5m`. Supported range is `1m` to `1h`.

* `key`: Use this when you want to encrypt target secret values with a specific protection key instead of the account default key.

## Create a Let's Encrypt Target in the Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and go to **Targets** > **New** > **Certificate Automation (Let's Encrypt)**.

2. Define the Name of the target, and specify the Location as a path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target.

3. Select a **Protection key** with a Customer Fragment to enable Zero-Knowledge and click **Next**. [Read more about Zero-Knowledge Encryption](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/implement-zero-knowledge).

4. Define the remaining parameters as follows:
   * **Server URL**: Either [Production](https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory) or [Staging](https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory).

   * **Email**: Email address used to register the ACME account.

   * **Challenge Type**: Either **HTTP** or **DNS**.

     * **DNS Provider**: Either **AWS**, **GCP**, or **Azure** (relevant only if **Challenge Type** is **DNS**).

     * **Target**: Select a target that contains the DNS provider credentials (relevant only if **Challenge Type** is **DNS**).

     * **Hosted Zone**: [AWS Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html) hosted zone identifier. (Relevant only if **Challenge Type** is **DNS** and **DNS Provider** is **AWS**).

     * **Resource Group**: Azure resource group name. (Relevant only if **Challenge Type** is **DNS** and **DNS Provider** is **Azure**).

     * **GCP Project**: GCP Cloud DNS project ID. Optional when **DNS Provider** is **GCP**.

   * **Timeout**: Challenge validation timeout in seconds. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

5. Click Finish.

## Issue Certificates With HTTP Challenge

When the Let's Encrypt target is configured with `--acme-challenge=http`, certificate issuance is a two-phase flow:

1. Request the certificate:

```shell
akeyless get-pki-certificate \
--cert-issuer-name <PKI Issuer Name> \
--csr-file-path <path/to/request.csr>
```

1. Deploy the challenge file to the URL path returned in `http_challenge_info.file_path` using the value in `http_challenge_info.file_content`.

2. Finalize validation and issuance:

```shell
akeyless validate-certificate-challenge \
--cert-display-id <Certificate Display ID> \
--timeout 120
```

1. Retrieve the issued certificate value:

```shell
akeyless get-certificate-value \
--cert-issuer-name <PKI Issuer Name> \
--display-id <Certificate Display ID>
```

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> `validate-certificate-challenge` is required for HTTP challenge flows. DNS challenge flows do not require this additional validation command.
> For a PKI issuer that uses a Let's Encrypt target, requested TTL values in certificate requests can be between 30 and 90 days. The issued Let's Encrypt certificate validity is fixed at 90 days.
