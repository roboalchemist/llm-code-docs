# Akeyless Connect

Akeyless connect provides you with secure CLI access to resources or a secure tunnel from any Unix terminal.

## Prerequisites

To use Akeyless Connect you need:

* Akeyless [CLI](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli)
* An [SSH certificate issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates)
* An [Akeyless Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview) with Remote Access enabled.
* OpenSSH v7.2 or higher on target servers.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> Starting from Windows 10, Microsoft supports the native feature "Windows Subsystem for Linux."
> This feature enables users to use their Windows OS environment as a Unix-like system.
>
> To work with the `akeyless-connect` command from a Windows machine, place the `.akeyless-connect.rc` script in your home directory.

## Set Up Akeyless Connect

Install the latest version of [Akeyless Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli) or run `akeyless update` to ensure you're using the latest version.

**Optional**: Download the [akeyless-connect.rc file](https://rest.akeyless.io/Akeyless_Artifacts/Linux/SSH/.akeyless-connect.rc) and open it in your preferred file editor. This file can be used to hold default variables, shortening your connect command. It can also be helpful for customizing information to your needs.

> ℹ️ **Note (RC File Notes):**
>
> The `~/.akeyless-connect.rc` file must be placed in your local `$HOME` directory to work.
> The RC file still uses `BASTION_*` variable names for historical reasons, but the CLI flags are now `--sra-ctrl-*`.

Edit the settings as follows:

`IDENTITY_FILE` - Default is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Full path to the private key to be signed and used for the Zero Trust session.

`CERT_ISSUER_NAME` - Full path to the Akeyless [SSH Certificates Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates) item.

`AKEYLESS_PROFILE` - Set the default profile that will be used from your Akeyless [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli). By default, it's using the `default` profile of your Akeyless CLI.

`AKEYLESS_CLI` - Akeyless CLI binary (if needed).

`AKEYLESS_GW_SSH_URL` - Set your Akeyless Gateway URL for the SSH service on port `8000`. The Kubernetes Service name will start with `ssh-`.

`AKEYLESS_GW_REST_API` - Set your Akeyless Gateway URL on port `8080` for [Zero-Knowledge](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/zero-knowledge) items and for internal network access.

`BASTION_API_PROTO` - Default is `http`. Set to `https` when your [Remote Access](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/remote-access-setup-k8s) is configured with TLS. This corresponds to the SRA control API protocol (CLI flag `--sra-ctrl-proto`).

`BASTION_API_PORT` - Default is `9900`. Set your matching `ssh-sra` cluster service port. This corresponds to the SRA control API port (CLI flag `--sra-ctrl-port`).

`BASTION_SSH_PORT` - Default is set to `22`. Set your matching `ssh-sra` cluster service port.

**Optional**: When working with Application Load Balancers, you can set the exact path of your `ssh-sra` service, which listens to the bastion `api` control port:

`BASTION_API_PREFIX` - Set your path prefix as your load balancer settings. This corresponds to the SRA control API port (CLI flag `--sra-ctrl-subdomain`).

`BASTION_API_PATH` - Set your path as your load balancer settings. This corresponds to the SRA control API port (CLI flag `--sra-ctrl-path`).

Where the URL will be set as follows:

`${BASTION_API_PROTO}://"${BASTION_API_PREFIX}${BASTION_HOST}${BASTION_API_PATH}":"${BASTION_API_PORT}`

`SSH_EXTRA_ARGS` - Add any official SSH arguments.

`USE_SSH_LEGACY_ALG`- Specifies whether to use ssh-legacy-signing-algorithm. The default is No

> **Note (Compatibility Issue with Legacy SSH Versions (7.4 and 7.6)):**
>
> Customers who have upgraded their Secure Remote Access (SRA) to the latest may experience SSH connection failures when using Akeyless Connect to access remote machines running OpenSSH version 7.4 or 7.6. This occurs both in CLI and the Web portal.
>
> It is possible to bypass this issue by setting the following environment variable in the Web bastion deployment, to all outgoing SSH connections:
>
> ```shell values.yaml
> env:
>   - name: SSH_EXTRA_ARGS
>     value: -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com
> ```
>
> This workaround explicitly enables legacy SSH key types that are deprecated and **not aligned** with modern security best practices.

## Usage

Use the `akeyless connect` command to connect to a resource through the Gateway's Remote Access (more examples below). If you are using the `akeyless-connect.rc` file with a `CERT_ISSUER_NAME`, you don't need to add the `-c <cert-issuer-name>` flag in the command:

```shell General Template
akeyless connect -t <[user@]target/hostname/ip[:port]> -g <your-gateway-ip[:port]> -c <cert-issuer-name>
```

> ℹ️ **Note (Legacy SRA Deployments):**
>
> For legacy deployments, users will still run:
>
> `akeyless connect -t <[user@]target/hostname/ip[:port]> -v <your-gateway-ip[:port]> -c <cert-issuer-name>`

```shell
akeyless connect -h

## Examples

### SSH

For SSH access through the SSH component, please use both the `-g <gw-ssh-url>` and `-c <cert-issuer-name>` options. Note that end-users require `read` permission on the cert issuer item which enables them access to the service.

```shell
akeyless connect -t user@ssh-server[:port] -g <gw-ssh-url> -c "<Path to SSH Cert Issuer>"
```

> ℹ️ **Info:**
>
> For using different SSH cert-issuers that enable access to target-servers **without** providing `read` permission to the end-users (only `list` permission on the cert-issuers), you will need to also pass the flag: `-n cert-issuer-name` for the **other** cert-issuer. This will enable access through SRA based on its allowed-users list, where the bastion will read the secret (request the cert) on their behalf.

> ℹ️ **Info (Extract From Mode):**
>
> If the SSH certificate issuer is configured with externally provided usernames and a claim key name, Akeyless Connect supports **Extract From** mode. In this mode, the username is extracted from JWT sub-claims by the bastion.

### AWS

```shell
akeyless connect -t us-east-1 -c my-ssh-cert-issuer -g <gw-ssh-url>:<port> -n "<Path to AWS Dynamic Secret>"
```

If you already defined the `Cert Issuer` inside the `akeyless-connect.rc` file, you can use:

```shell
akeyless connect -t us-east-1 -g <gw-ssh-url>:<port> -n "<Path to AWS Dynamic Secret>"
```

### MongoDB

```shell
akeyless connect -t <mongo server IP>:27017 -g <gw-ssh-url>:<port> -n "<Path to MongoDB Dynamic Secret>"
```

### MySQL

```shell
akeyless connect -t <mysql-server>:3306 -g <gw-ssh-url>:<port> -n "<Path to MySQL Dynamic Secret>"
```

### Amazon EKS

```shell
akeyless connect -t <namespace>@<eks cluster endpoint without https:// > -g <gw-ssh-url>:<port> -n "<Path to EKS Dynamic secret>"
```

### Non-interactive connection to Kubernetes

Linux:

```shell
AKEYLESS_PARAM='get pod' akeyless connect -t <k8 cluster endpoint> -g <gw-ssh-url> -n "Path To Kubernetes DynamicSecret" --ssh-extra-args "non-interactive"
```

Windows:

```shell
$env:AKEYLESS_PARAM = 'get pods'; .\akeyless.exe connect -t <k8 cluster endpoint> -g <gw-ssh-url> -n "Path To Kubernetes DynamicSecret" --ssh-extra-args "non-interactive"
```
