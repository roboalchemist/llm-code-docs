# Static Secrets

Static Secrets are key/value pairs created and updated manually, such as passwords and API tokens. Text-based items can be stored in their original format, including configuration files, JSON formatted data, and YAML formatted data.

The typical process for working with Static Secrets includes:

1. [Create a Static Secret](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/create-secret): Start by defining the name and value of the Static Secret.

2. [Add a Static Secret to an Access Role](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/add-a-static-secret-to-an-access-role): Allow clients to access the Static Secret by adding it to a role with the appropriate permissions.

3. [Retrieve a Static Secret Value](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/retrieve-secret): Get the value of a Static Secret when needed.

4. [Sharing Static Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/sharing-static-secrets): Temporarily share with external users who are not part of your organization or do not have general access permissions.

If necessary, a Static Secret value can be updated or have multiple versions. See [Update and Version Static Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/staticversions).

When a Static Secret becomes obsolete, it can be deleted.
