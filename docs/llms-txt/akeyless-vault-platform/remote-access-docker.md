# Remote Access on Docker Compose

In this guide, we will deploy the SRA utility using Docker Compose and the most basic configuration.

You can get the [configuration files](https://github.com/akeylesslabs/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md) that will be used to deploy the gateway with the SRA by cloning the following repository to your environment:

```shell
gh repo clone akeylesslabs/docker-compose
```

The following files will be used:

* `docker-compose.yaml`: Defines the Akeyless services and their setup.

* `gateway.env`: Stores environment variables for configuring the Gateway.

* `sra.env`: Stores environment variables for Secure Remote Access.

* `cache.env`: Stores Redis password (required when cache is enabled).

Note that this guide assumes you already have a gateway, and will only refer to the `sra.env` file configuration.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker Installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (version `20.10` or higher).

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (version `1.29` or higher).

* Akeyless Gateway deployed on [Docker Compose](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-deploy-docker-compose#/).

* [SSH Certificate Issuer](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-certificates) for CLI Access with `session_ username` allowed.

### Deployment Overview

The Docker Compose file defines the following services:

| Service                                                                           | Description                                       | Ports                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [Akeyless Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-deploy-docker-compose#/) | Central access control and authentication gateway | 8000 (API), 8080 (Health)   |
| SRA Web                                                                           | Web-based Zero Trust portal for remote access     | As specified in YAML        |
| SRA SSH Proxy                                                                     | Secure SSH-based remote access                    | 2222 (SSH), 9900 (Internal) |

Each service runs within an isolated Docker bridge network (internal-net), ensuring secure internal communication.

## Configuration

To deploy a gateway with the SRA utility, run the following steps:

1. For SSH access, configure the following in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

   * ```yaml docker-compose.yaml
       volumes:
       - /path/to/ca.pub:/var/akeyless/creds/ca.pub
     ```

   In the example above, the `ca.pub` is the public key specified in the SSH Certificate Issuer.

   [Read more about the available parameters](https://github.com/akeylesslabs/docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml).

2. Configure the following in the `gateway.env` file:

   * `CLUSTER_NAME`: The name of the cluster that will be deployed.
   * `UNIFIED_GATEWAY`: Set to `true` to enable the SRA utility.
   * `GATEWAY_ACCESS_ID`: The `AccessID` of the authentication method that will be used for the authentication.
   * `GATEWAY_ACCESS_TYPE`: The `AccessType` of the authentication method.
   * `GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY`: The `AccessKey` of the authentication method (relevant only for [API Key](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/auth-with-api-key)).
   * `ALLOWED_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS`: A list of users who can manage your Gateway configuration
   * [Read more about the available parameters](https://github.com/akeylesslabs/docker-compose/blob/main/gateway.env).

3. Configure the following in the `sra.env` file:

   * `UNIFIED_GATEWAY`: Set to `true`.

   [Read more about the available parameters](https://github.com/akeylesslabs/docker-compose/blob/main/sra.env).

4. Optional - if Redis is enabled, configure the following in the `cache.env` file:

   * `REDIS_PASS=password`.

   [Read more about the available parameters](https://github.com/akeylesslabs/docker-compose/blob/main/cache.env).

## Installation

To deploy the Gateway with the SRA utility, run this command from the directory where your **Gateway** and **SRA** configuration files are located.

```shell
docker compose --profile sra up -d
```

To verify the deployment, run:

```shell
docker ps
```

Upon successful installation, you will see 4 containers:

* `akeyless-sra-ssh`

* `akeyless-sra-web`

* `akeyless-gateway`

* `akeyless-cache`

## SRA Access

To start working with SRA, open your browser and login to the **Secure Remote Access** portal using the following URL: `http://Your-Akeyless-Gateway-URL:8000/sra/portal`

Log in with one of the [supported authentication methods](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-resources-remotely#prerequisites).

Once logged in, you will see the [Dynamic Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/how-to-create-dynamic-secret#/) with Secure Remote Access enabled. From there, you can securely access those resources using Just-In-Time credentials, either through the web interface or by way of an SSH connection.
