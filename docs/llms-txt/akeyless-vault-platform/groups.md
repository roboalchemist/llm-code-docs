# Groups

Groups enable administrators to manage and reuse [Authentication Methods](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-and-authentication-methods) more easily by associating them to an Akeyless [OIDC Application](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/oidc-app-provider) as a Group rather than manually associating multiple individual Authentication Methods.

## Creating a Group with the CLI

To create a group, use the following command:

```shell
akeyless create-group \
--name <New Group Name> \
--group-alias <Group Alias> \
--user-assignment <Auth Method List>
```

Where:

* `name`: A unique name for the Group. The name can include the path to the virtual folder in which you want to create the new Group, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the Group.

* `group-alias`: A short name for the Group. The alias cannot contain the special characters `/`, `.`, or `*`.

* `user-assignment`: A JSON string defining a list of `access-ids` and `sub-claims`. For example: `[{"access_id":"p-123456", "sub_claims":{"email":["user@example.com"]}}]`.

* `user-assignment-file`: Instead of a string, users can add this flag to pass a JSON file, using the same formatting, with a path to the file.
