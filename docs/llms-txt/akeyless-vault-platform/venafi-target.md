# Venafi Target

**Venafi** Target can be used with the Venafi Dynamic Secret as described under the [Venafi Integration](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/venafi-integration) docs.

> **Note:** Venafi is now CyberArk Machine Identity Security. In Akeyless CLI and API operations, this integration still uses `venafi` naming for backward compatibility.

This page refers to CyberArk Machine Identity Security services by their legacy Venafi target names where required by Akeyless UI, CLI, and API field names.

## Create a Venafi Target in the Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and go to **Targets > New > Certificate Automation (Venafi)**.

2. Define the Name of the target, and specify the Location as a path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using the slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target.

3. Select a **Protection key** with a Customer Fragment to enable Zero-Knowledge and click **Next**. For more information, [read here](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/implement-zero-knowledge).

4. Choose your preferred Venafi target type by selecting either: **Venafi Cloud** or **Trust Protection Platform**.

   * For **Venafi Cloud** set the following:

     * **API Key:** The API key to use when connecting to a Venafi Cloud environment.

     * **Zone:** The Venafi zone to use when issuing new certificates (policies will be pulled from here) - for example: `<Application_Name>/<Issuing_template_name>`

     * **Base URL:** Base URL of the Venafi Cloud environment (Default is [https://venafi.cloud/](https://venafi.cloud/)).

   * For **Trust Protection Platform** set the following:

     * **Access Token:** Venafi Access Token to use to access the TPP environment

     * **Refresh Token:** Venafi Refresh Token to use when the Access Token is expired

     * **Client ID:** Default is `akeyless`.

     * **Zone:** The zone to use when issuing new certificates (policies will be pulled from here).

     * **Base URL:** Base URL of the Trusted Protection Platform environment.

5. Click **Finish**.
