# Ansible AWX Plugin

using Ansible AWX with Akeyless Platform for storing credentials.

This article uses the **Vault Secret Lookup** plugin for Ansible AWX.

There are two main parameters used to configure the connection to Akeyless - the **URL**, and a **Token** for access.

The lookup plugin uses these by way of the environment variables `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN`.

In this workflow, token-based authentication is the primary method for AWX.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> Akeyless developed API compatibility with HashiCorp Vault OSS, enabling the use of Vault OSS community plugins for both Static and Dynamic Secrets, you can find more information [here](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/hashicorp-vault-proxy)

## Prepare AWX Environment

Clone the latest stable version of the project and check all the dependencies as mentioned in the [getting started](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/17.0.1/INSTALL.md#getting-started) section:

```shell
git clone -b <x.y.z> https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
```

Choose the desired [deployment platform](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/17.0.1/INSTALL.md#docker-compose), the following guide will describe the use of Docker Compose:

```shell
sudo mkdir /root/.awx/awxcompose
sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml
```

## Configure Akeyless Platform Settings

On AWX UI, navigate to **Resources** and create new **Credentials**. Select HashiCorp Vault Secret Lookup as your **Credentials Type** and set the **SERVER URL** to `https://hvp.akeyless.io` or work directly with your [Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview) URL on port `8200`:

You can either use Akeyless [API Key](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/auth-with-api-key) in the following format as your **Token**:

A concatenation of your `Access ID` and your `Access Key` with two dots as a delimiter that is: `< Access ID >..< Access Key >`.

Alternatively, to extract your authorization tokens directly using the [Akeyless CLI](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli) `auth` command as part of your workflow variables:

```shell
VAULT_TOKEN=$(akeyless auth --access-id "Access ID" --access-type="Auth Method type" --json true | awk '/token/ { gsub(/[",]/,"",$2); print $2}')
```

If your environment uses certificate authentication, you can generate `VAULT_TOKEN` with certificate preflight authentication:

```shell
VAULT_TOKEN=$(akeyless auth --access-id "Access ID" --access-type cert --cert-file-name ./server-cert.pem --key-file-name ./server-key.pem --json true | awk '/token/ { gsub(/[",]/,"",$2); print $2}')
```

> ℹ️ **Note (Certificate Authentication):**
>
> The AWX Vault Secret Lookup integration still consumes `VAULT_TOKEN`. Certificate support is available for the preflight token generation step.

To fetch a secret from the Akeyless Platform, for example, for AWX Tower credentials that will be used to establish a remote connection to an AWX node, create new **Credentials** and set the **Credentials Type** as **Ansible Tower**:

You can now select to populate the Username and Password fields from an external Secret Management system.

## Static Secrets

To work with Static Secrets, the Path to Secret should be in this format for **KV 1**:

`secret/data/<Full Secret Name>`, where the Key Name in the returned JSON name is `data`.

For example, let's create a secret:

```shell
akeyless create-secret -n /DevOps/Ansible -v 'AkeylessIsGr8'
```

The **Key name** should be set to `data` and the **Path** should be set to `secret/data/DevOps/Ansible`.

![Illustration for: The Key name\*\*should be set to data and the Path should be set to secret/data/DevOps/Ansible.](https://files.readme.io/2958df1-ansible5.png)

If the secret value itself is a JSON-structured object, the **Path** must be in the following format:

`secret/<Full Secret Name>`, without the `data/` prefix, you can use the internal JSON keys as the **Key Names** for example, let's create a secret that contains a JSON-structured value:

```shell
akeyless create-secret -n /DevOps/AnsibleJson -v '{"username":"john","password":"secret"}'
```

The **Key names** can be: `username` and `password` where the **Path** is `secret/DevOps/AnsibleJson`

![Illustration for: The Key names can be: username and password where the Path is secret/DevOps/AnsibleJson.](https://files.readme.io/4ce297c-Ansible6.png)

To work with **KV 2** use the following format:

To fetch the secret **/DevOps/Ansible**:

The **Path** is `secret/DevOps/Ansible`, where the Key in the returned JSON name is `DevOps/Ansible` without the `/` prefix.

![Illustration for: To fetch the secret /DevOps/Ansible: The Path is secret/DevOps/Ansible, where the Key in the returned JSON name is DevOps/Ansible without the / prefix.](https://files.readme.io/486bb56-Ansible7.png)

For example, to fetch the secret **/DevOps/AnsibleJson**:

The **Path** should be `secret/DevOps/AnsibleJson`, and the **Key name** should be set with the relevant JSON keys.

## Dynamic Secrets

To use your Ansible Plugin to fetch Dynamic Secrets:

The **Path** should be in the following format: `<Dynamic Secret type>/creds/<Full Secret Name>`

The returned JSON object will have keys named `password` and `username`. For example:

```json
{
  "password": "BbDUelj%Z1~UH1YS",
  "username": "tmp_ProdDB_p-csdsffer"
}
```

In this example, we are fetching a dynamic secret named **/databases/Mysql** using [MySQL Dynamic Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/create-dynamic-secret-to-sql-db).
