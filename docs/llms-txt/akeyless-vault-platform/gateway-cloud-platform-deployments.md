# Cloud-Managed Kubernetes Platforms

This page groups cloud-managed Kubernetes platform deployment patterns for the Akeyless Gateway.

Use this section when your organization deploys Gateway on cloud-managed compute platforms and wants deployment guidance aligned with provider-native identity and platform controls.

## When to Use Cloud-Managed Kubernetes Platforms

Cloud-managed Kubernetes platform deployment patterns are a good fit when you need:

* Managed cloud runtime environments.
* Cloud-native workload identity integration.
* Standardized platform operations across cloud environments.

If you need provider-agnostic deployment guidance, use [Kubernetes with Helm Deployment](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-chart) first, then apply provider-specific settings.

## Shared Prerequisites

Before selecting a platform-specific flow, validate the following:

* Kubernetes cluster and Helm are installed and operational.
* Outbound connectivity to required Akeyless SaaS services is available.
* A Gateway authentication method is prepared with required permissions.
* Platform-specific identity bindings are planned for runtime access.

Reference:

* [Gateway Network Connectivity](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/api-gateway-network-connectivity)

## Platform Guides

Choose the guide that matches your platform:

| Platform Guide                                                                                          | Typical Identity Integration |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [Amazon EKS Deployment](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-k8s#aws-iam)                              | AWS IAM roles                |
| [Azure Container App Deployment](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-on-azure-container-app)          | Azure managed identity       |
| [Azure Kubernetes Service Deployment](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-k8s#azure-active-directory) | Azure AD workload identity   |
| [Google Kubernetes Engine Deployment](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-k8s#gcp)                    | GCP workload identity        |

## What Stays the Same Across Platforms

Across EKS, AKS, GKE, and Azure Container Apps, the core Gateway model is consistent:

* Gateway authentication and access permissions.
* TLS and certificate configuration.
* Cache and offline behavior.
* Log forwarding and telemetry configuration.

After deployment, continue with:

* [Gateway Authentication](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-authentication)
* [Telemetry and Monitoring](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/monitor-akeyless)
