# Venafi Trust Protection Platform (TPP)

> ℹ️ **Note:** Venafi recently became CyberArk Machine Identity Security.

To work with Venafi TPP in CyberArk Machine Identity Security, you can choose either to work with CyberArk Machine Identity Security as your certificate issuer or to work with Akeyless as your issuer.

## Prerequisites

* Akeyless [Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview).

* Venafi TPP.

## Usage

### Venafi Issuer

The following command creates a Venafi Dynamic Secret using Venafi as the **certificate issuer**:

```shell
akeyless dynamic-secret create venafi \
  --name my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
  --venafi-use-tpp \
  --venafi-access-token <Venafi Access Token> \
  --venafi-refresh-token <Venafi Refresh Token> \
  --venafi-baseurl <YOUR TPP ENVIRONMENT BASE URL> \
  --venafi-zone <YOUR VENAFI ZONE>
```

Where:

`name`: A unique name of the Dynamic Secret. The name can include the path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new dynamic secret, using the slash/separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the Dynamic Secret.

`gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

`venafi-use-tpp`: Required when working with TPP.

`venafi-access-token`: Venafi Access Token to use to access the TPP environment (Relevant when using TPP).

`venafi-refresh-token`: Venafi Refresh Token to use when the Access Token is expired (Relevant when using TPP).

`venafi-baseurl`: Base URL of the TPP environment. Or a Cloud environment which isn't [https://venafi.cloud/](https://venafi.cloud/).

`venafi-zone`: Venafi Zone.

### Akeyless Issuer

The following commands create a Venafi Dynamic Secret using Akeyless as the **certificate issuer**.

When using Akeyless as the issuer, first, you need to create an RSA key with a **self-signed certificate** attached:

```shell
akeyless create-dfc-key \
--name venafi-tpp \
--alg RSA2048 \
--generate-self-signed-certificate \
--certificate-common-name venafi-test \
--certificate-ttl 10
```

Where:

`name`: A unique name for the encryption key. The name can include the path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new authentication method, using slash / separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the encryption key.

`alg`: Supported algorithms: `RSA1024`, `RSA2048`, `RSA3072` `EC256`, `EC384`, `EC521` (`EC` type is relevant for **Classic key** only).

`generate-self-signed-certificate`: Generate a self-signed certificate with the key.

`certificate-common-name`: Common name for the generated certificate.

`certificate-ttl`: TTL in days for the generated certificate.

*Note: Once the key is created, it will be uploaded automatically to Akeyless.*

The certificate attached to the private key must have at least a **Common Name (CN)** with it.

Create the Venafi Dynamic Secret in Akeyless Gateway:

```shell
akeyless dynamic-secret create venafi \
  --name my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
  --sign-using-akeyless-pki \
  --signer-key-name venafi-tpp \
  --allowed-domains '[*]' \
  --allow-subdomains \
  --user-ttl 2160h \
  --venafi-use-tpp \
  --venafi-access-token <Venafi Access Token> \
  --venafi-refresh-token <Venafi Refresh Token> \
  --venafi-baseurl <YOUR TPP ENVIRONMENT BASE URL> \
  --venafi-zone <YOUR VENAFI ZONE>
```

Where:

`name`: A unique name of the Dynamic Secret. The name can include the path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new dynamic secret, using the slash/separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the Dynamic Secret.

`gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

`sign-using-akeyless-pki`: Creating certificates using Akeyless PKI.

`signer-key-name`: Signer key name in Akeyless.

`allowed-domains`: List of allowed-domains.

`allow-subdomains`: whether subdomains are allowed or not.

`-user-ttl`: User TTL.

`venafi-use-tpp`: Required when working with TPP.

`venafi-access-token`: Venafi Access Token to use to access the TPP environment (Relevant when using TPP).

`venafi-refresh-token`: Venafi Refresh Token to use when the Access Token is expired (Relevant when using TPP).

`venafi-baseurl`: Base URL of the TPP environment. Or a Cloud environment which isn't [https://venafi.cloud/](https://venafi.cloud/).

`venafi-zone`: Venafi Zone.

Once your Venafi Dynamic Secret has been successfully created, you can request a new **certificate**.

### Certificate Request

Certificate request using **Common Name (CN)**:

```shell
akeyless get-dynamic-secret-value \
  -n my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --args common_name=any-common-name.company.example.com
```

Certificate request by way of **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**:

To fetch a new certificate by way of **CSR**, you need to create your **CSR** and send it to the Akeyless Gateway in Base64 encoding.

Create a **CSR**:

```shell
CSR=$(akeyless generate-csr \
--name venafi-test \
--generate-key \
--key-type dfc \
--alg RSA2048 \
--common-name marketing.newyork.company.com | base64)
```

Get the Dynamic Secret using the **Certificate request:**

```shell
akeyless get-dynamic-secret-value \
  -n my-venafi-dynamic-secret \
  --args csr=$CSR
```

In the response, you’ll see the relevant information and artifacts for the request including the `certificate`, `serial number`, `common name` and `expiration`.

Depending on your flow you may also see the `certificate chain`, `issuing ca`, `ca chain`, and `private key`.

The artifacts `certificate`, `certificate chain` and `private key` can also be found as Static Secrets under the Artifacts Folder defined in the dynamic secret's settings.
