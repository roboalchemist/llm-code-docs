# Set Up Event Forwarder on Akeyless System

Setting up an event forwarder in Akeyless is a process that enables you to automatically send events from Akeyless to another system or application, such as a logging or monitoring service. This capability is particularly useful for maintaining security and operational awareness. Here’s how to configure an event forwarder in Akeyless:

## Step 1: Access the Akeyless Console

Log In: Start by logging into your Akeyless management console. You'll need administrative access to configure event forwarders.

## Step 2: Navigate to Event Forwarders
