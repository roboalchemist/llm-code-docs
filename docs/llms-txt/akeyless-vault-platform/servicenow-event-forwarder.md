# ServiceNow Event Forwarder

**ServiceNow Event Forwarder** enables you to forward event notifications to **Endpoint URLs** based on your configuration. These include notifications about **Items, Auth Methods, Targets, and Gateways**, which can be configured to be sent immediately or every 1 to 24 hours.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> The URL for the **ServiceNow** endpoint would be: `<serviceNowURL>/akeyless-events/`
