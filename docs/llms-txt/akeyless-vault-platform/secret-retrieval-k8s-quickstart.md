# Getting a Secret within a Kubernetes Cluster Quickstart

This Quickstart shows how to inject a secret from Akeyless into a Kubernetes container using the **Akeyless Kubernetes Secrets Injector**. Your application will read the secret from a file inside the container’s filesystem; the injector handles authentication and secret retrieval.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

* A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.21 or later recommended)
* `kubectl` configured
* An Akeyless Gateway reachable from the cluster within a Namespace titled `akeyless`
* A Static Secret in Akeyless
* An Akeyless API Key (Access ID + Access Key) with an appropriate Role associated

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> The **API Key Authentication Method** is not recommended for production use. It works well for getting started with Akeyless, quick proofs of concept (POCs), and other temporary scenarios.

## Step 1: Install the Injector

Before injecting secrets into containers, you must install and configure the **Akeyless Kubernetes Secrets Injector**. This component authenticates workloads to Akeyless and writes secrets into the container filesystem.

1. Run the following commands to update the Helm repositories in your local Helm environment:

   ```shell
   helm repo update
   ```

   You should already have added the official Akeyless Helm chart repository to deploy the Akeyless Gateway.

   *Sample Output:*

   ```text
   Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
   ...Successfully got an update from the "akeyless" chart repository
   Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
   ```

2. Run the following command to save the default configuration values of the Akeyless Kubernetes Secrets Injector Helm chart to your current directory as a new file called `values.yaml`:

   ```shell
   helm show values akeyless/akeyless-secrets-injection --version "1.17.5" > values.yaml
   ```

   There should be no command output.

3. Using your text editor of choice, edit the `values.yaml` file.
   1. Under the `env` key:

      1. Set `AKEYLESS_ACCESS_ID` to the Access ID of your API Key.
      2. Set `AKEYLESS_ACCESS_TYPE` to `api_key`.
      3. Uncomment `AKEYLESS_API_KEY` (by removing the `#`) and replace `<api-key` with the value to the Access Key of your API Key.

      In all of these instances, you should leave the quotation marks in place (`"`).

      *Sample File Section*:

      ```yaml
      env:
      AKEYLESS_URL: "https://vault.akeyless.io"
      AKEYLESS_ACCESS_ID: "p-h8kyauyqvow2am" 
      AKEYLESS_ACCESS_TYPE: "api_key" # azure_ad/aws_iam/api_key/k8s

      # AKEYLESS_API_GW_URL: "https://api-gw-url"
      # AKEYLESS_POD_ACCESS_PATH: "<location-to-access-secrets-per-pod-name>"
      # AKEYLESS_NAMESPACE_ACCESS_PATH: "<location-to-access-secrets-per-namespace>"
      # AKEYLESS_SECRET_DIR_NAME: "<path>"
      AKEYLESS_API_KEY: "GCz5fLEgc0tJftA/7W1WnywbgorEc30V92xQ3dOGNME="
      # AKEYLESS_CRASH_POD_ON_ERROR: "enable"
      # AKEYLESS_K8S_AUTH_CONF_NAME: "K8s_conf_name"

      # The Gateway Base64 certificate file, for example, 'cat my-gw.crt | base64'
      # AKEYLESS_GW_CERTIFICATE: 


      AKEYLESS_AGENT_LIMITS_CPU: "500m"
      AKEYLESS_AGENT_REQUESTS_CPU: "250m"
      AKEYLESS_AGENT_LIMITS_MEM: "128Mi"
      AKEYLESS_AGENT_REQUESTS_MEM: "64Mi"
      ```

   2. Save the file.

4. Run the following command to install the Akeyless Kubernetes Secrets Injector Helm chart using the `values.yaml` file that you edited:

   ```shell
   helm install secret-injector akeyless/akeyless-secrets-injection --version "1.17.5" --namespace akeyless -f values.yaml
   ```

   *Sample Output:*

   ```text
   NAME: secret-injector
   LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Nov 20 13:52:33 2025
   NAMESPACE: akeyless
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   DESCRIPTION: Install complete
   TEST SUITE: None
   ```

## Step 2: Verify Pods for the Secret Injector

1. Wait for the Akeyless Kubernetes Secret Injector pods to be ready. This will likely take about one minute.
2. Run the following command to check that the pods are ready:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -n akeyless
   ```

   *Sample Output:*

   ```text
   NAME                                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   gw-akeyless-gateway-cache-7bc7c7556b-rdwzx                    1/1     Running   0          155m
   secret-injector-akeyless-secrets-injection-8464b9f585-p9r5x   1/1     Running   0          111s
   secret-injector-akeyless-secrets-injection-8464b9f585-x882c   1/1     Running   0          111s
   unified-gw-akeyless-gateway-695dbb7f67-bflsz                  1/1     Running   0          155m
   unified-gw-akeyless-gateway-695dbb7f67-n6kbx                  1/1     Running   0          155m
   ```

   Note that the Akeyless Gateway pods are also included in the sample output.

## Step 3: Verify the Secret

If you have not yet, create a Static Secret named `/QuickSecret` and ensure your API Key's associated Role has access to retrieve its value.

## Step 4: Create a Kubernetes Deployment

1. Create a new manifest file called `akeyless-secret-quickstart.yaml` that defines our Deployment:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
   name: akeyless-secret-quickstart
   namespace: akeyless
   spec:
   replicas: 1
   selector:
       matchLabels:
       app: akeyless-secret-quickstart
   template:
       metadata:
       labels:
           app: akeyless-secret-quickstart
       annotations:
           akeyless/enabled: "true"
           akeyless/inject_file: "QuickSecret"
       spec:
       containers:
           - name: quickstart
           image: alpine:3.19
           command:
               - "sh"
               - "-c"
               - "echo $MY_SECRET && echo going to sleep... && sleep 10000"
           env:
               - name: MY_SECRET
               value: akeyless:QuickSecret
   ```

2. Apply the manifest file and create the Deployment:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f akeyless-secret-quickstart.yaml
   ```

   *Sample Output:*

   ```text
   deployment.apps/akeyless-secret-quickstart created
   ```

## Step 5: Verify the Pod Started

Wait about one minute to verify the Quickstart pod is created:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n akeyless
```

## Step 6: Read the Secret from the Container

Run the following command to see your Static Secret be retrieved:

```shell
kubectl logs -n akeyless deploy/akeyless-secret-quickstart
```

*Sample Output*:

```text
Defaulted container "quickstart" out of: quickstart, akeyless-init (init)
2025/11/21 01:50:44 [INFO] Secret QuickSecret was successfully written to: /akeyless/secrets/QuickSecret
Super Secret
going to sleep...
```

> ℹ️ **Note:** In this example, we have injected the Static Secret's value as both a file *and* and an environment variable to illustrate your options. In a production environment, injecting the secret value as a file is the preferred method.

## Step 7: Clean Up

```shell
kubectl delete -f akeyless-secret-quickstart.yaml
```

*Sample Output:*

```text
deployment.apps "akeyless-secret-quickstart" deleted from akeyless namespace
```

***

*You have successfully:*

1. *Installed the Akeyless Kubernetes Secrets Injector*
2. *Created a demo deployment using annotation-based secret retrieval*
3. *Retrieved an Akeyless secret value directly inside a container*
