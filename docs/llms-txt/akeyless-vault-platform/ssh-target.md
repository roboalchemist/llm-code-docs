# SSH Target

You can define an SSH target that will be used with an [SSH Rotated Secret](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/create-an-ssh-rotated-secret) or [RDP Dynamic Secrets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rdp-dynamic-secrets)

## Create an SSH Target with the CLI

To create an SSH target with the CLI, run the following command:

```shell
akeyless target create ssh \
--name <Target name> \
--host <SSH hostname> \
--port <SSH port> \
--ssh-username <SSH username> \
--ssh-password <SSH password>
```

Where:

* `name`: A unique name of the target. The name can include the path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target.

* `host`: The SSH hostname.

* `port`: The SSH port.

* `ssh-username`: The SSH username.

* `ssh-password`: The SSH password.

You can find the complete list of parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Akeyless Targets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-ref-targets#ssh) section.

## Create an SSH Target in the Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and go to **Targets > New > Operating System (SSH)**.

2. Define a **Name** of the target, and specify the **Location** as a path to the virtual folder where you want to create the new target, using slash `/` separators. If the folder does not exist, it will be created together with the target.

3. Select a **Protection key** with a Customer Fragment to enable Zero-Knowledge and click **Next**. For more information, [read here](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/implement-zero-knowledge).

4. Define the remaining parameters as follows:

   * **Hostname**, **Port** and **Username** to set up the connection.

   * **Authentication Type:** In this section, you can select the preferred type of authentication with the SSH server either `SSH Key` or `Password`:

     * Select the **SSH Key** radio button to authenticate with the Private Key and an optional Passphrase.

     * Select the **Password** radio button to authenticate with the password.

   * Set the following details accordingly:

     * **Private Key:** Provide an SSH private key.

     * **Private Key Passphrase:** Enter a passphrase for the SSH key.

     * **Password:** Provide a password for the above-mentioned username.

5. Click **Finish**.
