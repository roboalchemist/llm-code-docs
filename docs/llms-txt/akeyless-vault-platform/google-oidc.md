# Google - OIDC

To use Google as an IdP to authenticate the Akeyless Platform by way of OIDC, follow the steps below.

> Ensure your OAuth consent configuration **includes only authorized domains** of your organization, and that the User type is set to **Internal** only.

To set your OAuth consent screen with **User type** internal, open your OAuth consent settings and ensure the following are set for User type:

And for Authorized domains:

## Create an OAuth Client ID

1. Visit the [Google API Console](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?service=cloudconsole\&passive=1209600\&osid=1\&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.developers.google.com%2F\&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.developers.google.com%2F\&flowName=GlifWebSignIn\&flowEntry=ServiceLogin).

2. Go to **Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**.

3. For the **Application Type** select **Web Application**, for the **Authorized redirect URIs** set `https://auth.akeyless.io/oidc/callback` and click **Create**.

4. Once the OAuth Client ID has been created, you need to obtain the **Client ID** and **Client secret**:

5. To bind the OAuth Client ID with your Akeyless Platform account, create an OIDC Authentication Method using either CLI or UI, as described below.

## Create an OIDC Authentication Method with the CLI

```shell
akeyless auth-method create oidc --name 'Google-OIDC' --issuer https://accounts.google.com --client-id {your-client-id} --client-secret {your-client-secret} --unique-identifier {your-unique-identifier (for example, 'email' or 'username')}
```

## Log in With OIDC Using the CLI

1. Configure a new profile with your Access ID from the previous step and OIDC type (if no profile name is provided, the default will be configured):

   ```shell
   akeyless configure --access-id <your-access-id> --access-type oidc --profile 'google-oidc'
   ```

2. Now, you can run any Akeyless CLI command and be authenticated with Google:

   ```shell
   akeyless list-items --profile google-oidc
   ```
