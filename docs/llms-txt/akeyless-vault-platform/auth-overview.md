# Authentication & Authorization

Akeyless uses a two-stage model to control access to secrets, keys, certificates, and other identity workflows: **authentication** and **authorization**. These stages determine *who* is making the request and *what* that identity is allowed to do.

## Authentication

Authentication is *who* is making a request: the identity of the user, service, workload, or machine attempting to access Akeyless. Akeyless supports several authentication methods designed for human users, applications, and infrastructure services operating across cloud and on-premises environments.

### Human Authentication

* **Username and Password**: Console login for administrators and basic users.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Authentication through enterprise identity providers using OAuth 2.0 authorization flows, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML 2.0.

### Machine and Workload Authentication

* **Access Keys**: Programmatic identities for automation and applications.
* **JWT-Based Authentication**: Trust established by way of externally issued, signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
* **Kubernetes Authentication**: Pod identity validation using Kubernetes `ServiceAccount` tokens.
* **Cloud Provider Identities**: Supported cloud providers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud.

### Directory and Legacy System Authentication

* **LDAP Authentication**: Integration with enterprise identity directories.
* **Kerberos Authentication**: Authentication in environments using Kerberos realms.

### Universal Identity

**Universal Identity** is Akeyless’s identity abstraction layer that allows multiple authentication methods (such as JWTs, cloud identities, OIDC tokens, and access keys) to map into a single logical identity. This enables:

* Cross-environment identity portability
* Migration between auth methods without reconfiguring permissions
* Simplified governance across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployments

Universal Identity is especially useful for large organizations standardizing identity strategy across multiple platforms.

## Authorization

Authorization determines *what* an identity is allowed to do after it has been authenticated. In Akeyless, authorization is based on **roles and policies**.

### Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions through **roles**. A role can specify:

* Which secrets, keys, or other items are accessible
* Which actions are permitted (read, write, list, rotate, delete)
* Whether access is limited to specific paths or namespaces

RBAC is the simplest and most common authorization model in Akeyless.

### Attribute-Based Access Control

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) evaluates **contextual attributes**, such as:

* Source IP address
* Time of day
* Environment or region
* Identity metadata or claims

ABAC policies allow dynamic, context-aware access decisions.

### Combined Policies

Akeyless allows RBAC and ABAC to be used together. For example:

* A role grants access to a secret.
* An ABAC policy restricts access to business hours.
* A context rule ensures requests must originate from a gateway inside a private network.

This layered approach provides strong access governance.

## Policy Enforcement

Policy enforcement happens at the **control plane**, but cryptographic operations (like signatures or decryptions) are only performed when both authentication and authorization succeed. All successful requests generate **audit events** that can be viewed in the console or forwarded to SIEM systems.

## Summary

Authentication confirms the identity of the requester, while authorization determines what the identity is permitted to do. Together, these controls define how Akeyless manages access to secrets, keys, certificates, and cryptographic operations. This separation of responsibilities ensures strong security, clear governance, and consistent enforcement across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.
