# Certificate Provisioning

Certificate Provisioning is a process in which a certificate is injected into a remote endpoint. Currently, Akeyless supports provisioning certificates to a [Linux](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-target) or a [Windows](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/windows-target) endpoint utilizing [Targets](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/targets).

Any [stored](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/certificate-storage) certificate can be provisioned through the [Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview), whereupon successful provisioning, future renewals of the certificate will be provisioned automatically.

Setting up certificate provisioning requires **Target** permissions on the Gateway.

> ℹ️ **Note (Provisioning Permissions on Target):**
>
> To prevent partial files, the Gateway first saves new items (certificates, keys, and so on) in a temporary folder on your server, then atomically renames them into the final paths you specify. Ensure the temporary folder is writable by the user defined in the Target.

## Provisioning a Certificate Using the Akeyless CLI

Run the following CLI command to provision a certificate:

```shell
akeyless assoc-target-item \
--name <Certificate name> \
--target-name <Target Name> \
--gateway-url 'https://<Your-Akeyless-GW-URL>:8000' \
--certificate-path <Where to save the certificate> \
--post-provision-command <"echo Akeyless">
```

Where:

* `name`: The **Certificate** item name.

* `target-name` The **Target** item name, to provision the certificate.

* `gateway-url`: Akeyless Gateway Configuration Manager URL (port `8000`).

* `certificate-path`: A path on the **Target** to save the certificate PEM file can be used as well with `chain-path` and `private-key-path` flags to save those on different locations.

* `post-provision-command`: Optional, a custom command to run on the remote target after successful provisioning, for example, restarting a service.

You can find the complete list of additional parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Encryption Keys](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-reference-encryption-keys#assoc-target-item) section.

## Provisioning a Certificate Using the Akeyless Console

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console, and go to **Items**, find the certificate you wish to provision.
2. Click on the **Certificate** item, click on the **Provisioning** tab, and then **Attach**.
3. Enter the following parameters:

* **Target Name** - **Choose an existing Target** from the drop-down list to select the existing [SSH](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/ssh-target)/ [Windows](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/windows-target) Target.

* **Gateway** - **Choose an existing Gateway** from the drop-down list to select the relevant Gateway.

* **Certificate Remote Path** - The path where the certificate will be provisioned to in the remote machine.

* **Private Key Remote Path** - A path on the target to store the private key.

* **Certificate Chain Path** - A path on the target to store the full chain.

* **Post Provision Command** - A custom command of your choice that will be executed on the remote machine as part of the provisioning process.
