# GitLab - OIDC

To use GitLab as an IdP to authenticate the Akeyless Platform by way of OIDC, follow the steps below.

## Create an Application

1. In your GitLab account, go to **Edit profile > Applications.**

2. For **Redirect URI** set `https://auth.akeyless.io/oidc/callback`, select the **"openid", “profile”** and **“email“** scope and click **Save application**.

3. Once the application has been created, you need to obtain the **Client ID** and **Client secret**:

4. To bind the GitLab Client ID with your Akeyless account, create an OIDC Authentication Method using either CLI or UI, as described below.

## Create an OIDC Authentication Method with the CLI

```shell
akeyless auth-method create oidc --name 'my GitLab app' --issuer https://gitlab.com --client-id {your-client-id} --client-secret {your-client-secret} --unique-identifier {your-unique-identifier (for example, 'email' or 'username')}
```

## Log in With OIDC Using the CLI

1. Configure a new profile with your Access ID from the previous step and OIDC type (if no profile name is provided, the default will be configured):

   ```shell
   akeyless configure --access-id <your-access-id> --access-type oidc --profile 'gitlab-oidc'
   ```

2. Now, you can run any Akeyless CLI command and be authenticated with GitLab:

   ```shell
   akeyless list-items --profile gitlab-oidc
   ```
