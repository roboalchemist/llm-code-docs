# Add a Static Secret to an Access Role

Access Roles provide clients (users or machines) with permissions to work with secrets. When adding a secret to a role, exactly which **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) that a client can perform for that secret can be specified.

> ℹ️ **Info:**
>
> By default, the account owner has privilege permissions in Akeyless. Managing users' Access Roles and permissions can be done using Akeyless Platform [Authentication Methods](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/access-and-authentication-methods) with [Access Roles](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rbac) to grant users the minimum permissions they need.

## Add a Static Secret to a Role from the Akeyless CLI

Static Secrets can be created with the Akeyless CLI:

```shell
akeyless set-role-rule \
  --role-name <role name> \
  --path <secret name with path> \
  --capability <read|create|update|delete|list|deny> \
  --rule-type item-rule
```

where:

* `--role-name`: The name of the role to which to add the static secret.

* `--path`: The full path to the static secret.

* `--capability`: A CRUD operation clients associated with the role can perform for the secret. Each `capability` argument can include a single permission, either `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `list`, or `deny`. Use multiple `capability` arguments to assign multiple permissions.

* `--rule type`: `item-rule`.

For example, to add the **AdminCredentials** secret in the **Admin** folder to the **SystemAdmin** access role, also in the **Admin** folder, with **Read** and **List** permissions, type:

```shell
akeyless set-role-rule \
  --role-name /Admin/SystemAdmin \
  --path /Admin/AdminCredentials \
  --capability read \
  --capability list \
  --rule-type item-rule
```

The response should be like this:

```shell
The requested rule was successfully set to the role /Admin/SystemAdmin
```

You can find the complete list of parameters for this command in the [CLI Reference - Access Roles](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli-reference-access-roles#set-role-rule) section.

## Add a Static Secret to a Role from the Akeyless Console

Let’s add a static secret to a role from the Akeyless Console. If you’d prefer, see how to do this from the [Akeyless CLI](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/add-a-static-secret-to-an-access-role#add-a-static-secret-to-a-role-from-the-akeyless-cli) instead.

1. Log in to the Akeyless Console and go to **Access Roles**.

2. Select the role to which you want to add the secret.

3. Select the **Items**s tab, then select **Add**.

4. In the **Add Rule for Items** dialog box, in the **Allow access to the following path**\* field, enter the full path to the static secret.

5. From the **Allow the following actions** options, select the **CRUD** operation(s) the client associated with the role that can perform for the secret.

   > 👍 Note
   >
   > **Deny** overrides all other operations.

6. Click **Add**.
