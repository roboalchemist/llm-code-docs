# Creating an API Key Quickstart

This Quickstart walks you through creating an **Akeyless API Key**, which can be used for programmatic access, automation, and for authenticating Akeyless Gateways or applications.

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> The **API Key Authentication Method** is not recommended for production use. It works well for getting started with Akeyless, quick proofs of concept (POCs), and other temporary scenarios.

By the end of this guide, you will have:

* An Akeyless **Access ID**
* An Akeyless **Access Key**
* An Authentication Method configured to use that API Key

## Prerequisites

You will need:

* An active Akeyless account
* Access to the Internet

If you do not yet have an account, complete the [Creating an Akeyless Account Quickstart](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/account-quickstart) first.

## Step 1: Sign In to the Akeyless Console

1. Open the Akeyless Console: [https://console.akeyless.io](https://console.akeyless.io).
2. Sign in to your existing Akeyless account.

You will be taken to the Akeyless Console homepage.

## Step 2: Open the Create Authentication Method Form

1. In the left navigation menu, select **Users & Auth Methods**.
2. Select **+ New**.

This opens the **Create Authentication Method** form.

## Step 3: Create an API Key Authentication Method

1. On the **Type** selection screen, select **API Key**.
2. Select **Next →**.
3. Enter `My API Key` in the **Name** field.
4. Select **Finish** to continue.

You will now see the new API Key displayed with two critical values:

* **Access ID**
* **Access Key**

## Step 5: Copy and Save the Access Credentials

After the API Key is created:

* Copy the **Access ID**
* Copy the **Access Key**

Store these values securely.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The **Access Key** is shown only once.
> If you lose it, you must create a new API Key.

## Step 6: Assign Permissions

The API Key must be associated with **Roles** to control what it can access.

1. In the left navigation menu, select **Access Roles**.
2. Select the pre-made **admin** role to open the **Edit Role** window.
3. In the **Edit Role** window, the **General** tab is selected by default.
4. Select **+ Associate**.
5. In the **Auth Method** drop-down menu, select `/My API Key`.
6. Select **Save**.

> ℹ️ **Note:** The `/` added in this drop-down menu indicates that `My API Key` was created at the root of the Items directory in your Akeyless account. You can create subdirectories to organize your Items.

You can associate `My API Key` with a custom role later if desired.

## Step 7: Test the API Key (Optional)

You can test the API Key with the Akeyless CLI:

1. [Download the Akeyless CLI](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/cli#download) with a Terminal or Command Prompt.
2. For Akeyless CLI Configuration:
   1. Type `n` to skip configuring a profile. You can change this later.
   2. Choose if you want to move the Akeyless CLI binary and if you want to create a user `PATH` environment variable.
3. Close and relaunch your Terminal or Command Prompt.
4. Authenticate with the Access ID and Access Key:

```shell
akeyless auth --access-id <ACCESS-ID> --access-key <ACCESS-KEY>
```

You should expect to see `Authentication succeeded.` in response to your command. You can test your access further by listing available items:

```shell
akeyless list-items
```

The output of this command should be a JSON-formatted list of all Items in your Akeyless account.

*Your API Key is now ready for use in your Akeyless environment.*
