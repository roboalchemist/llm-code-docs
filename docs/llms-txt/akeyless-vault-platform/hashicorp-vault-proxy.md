# HashiCorp Vault Proxy

HashiCorp Vault Proxy

Akeyless developed API compatibility with HashiCorp Vault OSS, enabling the use of Vault OSS community plugins for both Static and Dynamic Secrets.

Benefits:

* Extending the variety of platform plugins
* Side-by-side scenarios with vault repositories
* Easing migrations from existing solutions
* Supporting **KV** and Dynamic Secrets.

Interaction with the Akeyless vault proxy can be done against our public endpoint: `https://hvp.akeyless.io`

Or directly through your [Gateway](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/gateway-overview) on port `8200`.

## Usage

HashiCorp Vault `V1` secret engine proxy will be available using this prefix: `v1/kv`

```curl Vault Proxy V1
curl --header "X-Vault-Token: XXXXX" https://hvp.akeyless.io/v1/kv/{secret-name}
```

HashiCorp Vault `V2` secret engine will be available using this prefix: `v1/secret/data`

```curl Vault Proxy V2
curl --header "X-Vault-Token: XXXX" https://hvp.akeyless.io/v1/secret/data/{secret-name}
```

If the secret value itself is a JSON-structured object, the **Path** must be in the following format:

`secret/<Full Secret Name>`, without the `data/` prefix, you can use the internal JSON keys as the **Key Names**

### Custom Engine Name

Custom engine names can also be used for accessing secrets by replacing the default engine name with the custom engine name in the URL:

```shell
curl --header "X-Vault-Token: XXXXX" https://hvp.akeyless.io/v1/{custom-engine-name}/{secret-name}
```
