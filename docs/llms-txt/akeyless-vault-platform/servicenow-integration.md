# ServiceNow Integration

## Introduction

> ℹ️ **Note:**
>
> These instructions were created using the Vancouver release of ServiceNow. Newer versions may have a different UI.

### Centralized Access Request Record

Each access request triggers the creation of a dedicated record in ServiceNow Akeyless Application. This record captures essential details such as the requestor's identity and the specific item for which access is sought, providing admins with a comprehensive overview of each request and the ability to approve or decline the access request by way of ServiceNow instance.

### Prompt Admin Notification

System administrators receive immediate email or notification alerts upon new access requests. This notification mechanism ensures that requests are promptly reviewed and evaluated, minimizing delays in access provisioning.

*Note:* Notifications will need to be configured by ServiceNow Admin on the instance level for recorded addition or record update of the Akeyless ServiceNow application "access request" table.

### Streamlined Approval/Decline Process

Admins can conveniently view, evaluate, and take action on access requests directly within the ServiceNow instance. The approval or decline decision can be made with a single click, streamlining the approval process.

### Granular Control With Termination Option

Administrators maintain complete control over access requests, with the ability to terminate requests at any time. This termination option enhances security by ensuring that access privileges are revoked when they are no longer required.

### Automated Temporary Access Creation

Upon approval, ServiceNow Akeyless integration seamlessly generates temporary access for the specific item.

### Comprehensive Requestor Notification

Requestors receive timely notifications regarding the status of their access requests. This communication keeps users informed and enhances their overall experience with the access management process.

*Note:* Notifications will need to be configured by ServiceNow Admin on the instance level for recorded addition or record update of the Akeyless ServiceNow application "access request" table.

## Required Akeyless Configuration

To use the Akeyless ServiceNow App, an Access Role must be created. [This guide (Role-Based Access Control (RBAC))](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/rbac) outlines the steps for creating an Access Role in Akeyless.

Please configure the following permissions:

* Create/Read/Update role under `/Access Requests/*`

* Upon approval within the ServiceNow Akeyless app, a request is sent to Akeyless systems to generate temporary access for the specific item.

### Notifications

Admins and users (requestors) can receive notifications when certain actions are performed on the `akeyless_access_request` table in the ServiceNow instance.

Admins can receive notifications when a new access request record is created, while users (requestors) can receive notifications when their access request is approved.

These notifications can be configured based on specific actions, such as when a new record is added or when a record is updated by an admin user of the ServiceNow instance.

[Refer to the ServiceNow documentation on push notifications.](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-platform-administration/page/administer/notification/reference/r_PushMessageArchitecture.html)
