# Ruby SDK

The Akeyless SDK for Ruby makes it easy for you to integrate your Ruby applications, libraries, or scripts with the Akeyless Platform secret management services. The below Ruby code examples show a typical sequence of integrating secrets into your application.

## Installation

```ruby
gem install akeyless
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the installation procedure and then run the following code:

```ruby
require 'akeyless'

# default: public API Gateway
config = Akeyless::Configuration.new

# use port 8081 exposed by the deployment:
config.server_index = nil
config.scheme = 'https'
config.host =  'gateway.company.com:8081'

# use port 8080 exposed by the deployment with /v2 prefix: 
config.server_index = nil
config.scheme = 'https'
config.host =  'gateway.company.com:8080/v2'


api = Akeyless::V2Api.new(Akeyless::ApiClient.new(config))

# auth using email and password
body = Akeyless::Auth.new
body.admin_email = 'foo@example.com'
body.admin_password = 'strong-password'
body.access_type = "password"

result = api.auth(body)
token = result.token

# get secret value using the token
body = Akeyless::GetSecretValue.new
body.token = tokenbody.names = ['my-secret']
result = api.get_secret_value(body)
```
