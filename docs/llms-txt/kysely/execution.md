# Execution flow

The following page gives a **simplified** overview of Kysely's execution flow, from query building to querying the database. It is a nice introduction for anyone looking to understand how Kysely works under the hood. Knowing what your dependencies do and don't do is always a good idea!

This breakdown explains the journey from a type-safe method call in your application to receiving results from the database, as depicted in the diagram.

1. ### Immutable query building[​](#immutable-query-building "Direct link to Immutable query building")

   The process starts in your `App`. You interact with the `QueryBuilder` by calling its methods (`selectFrom`, `where`, etc.). Each call returns a *new* `QueryBuilder` instance containing an updated, immutable `QueryAST` (Abstract Syntax Tree), which is the internal representation of your SQL query.

2. ### Initiating execution[​](#initiating-execution "Direct link to Initiating execution")

   When you chain the final `.execute()` call, the `QueryBuilder` begins a multi-step execution process, commanding the `QueryExecutor` to perform distinct tasks.

   <!-- -->

3. ### Query Transformation[​](#query-transformation "Direct link to Query Transformation")

   First, the `QueryBuilder` instructs the `QueryExecutor` to process the `QueryAST`. The `QueryExecutor` iterates through all registered plugins, calling `transformQuery` on each. This allows plugins to modify the query structure before compilation. The final, transformed `QueryAST` is returned to the `QueryBuilder`.

   <!-- -->

4. ### Query Compilation[​](#query-compilation "Direct link to Query Compilation")

   Next, the `QueryBuilder` tells the `QueryExecutor` to compile the transformed AST. The `QueryExecutor` delegates this to the `Dialect`-specific `QueryCompiler`. The compiler traverses the AST and produces a `CompiledQuery` object (containing the final SQL string and parameters). This `CompiledQuery` is then returned to the `QueryBuilder`.

   <!-- -->

5. ### Execution & Connection Handling[​](#execution--connection-handling "Direct link to Execution & Connection Handling")

   The `QueryBuilder` now asks the `QueryExecutor` to execute the `CompiledQuery`.

   * The `QueryExecutor` requests a connection from Kysely's `Driver`.
   * The `Driver`'s job is to abstract away vendor-specific details. It communicates with the actual third-party `DatabaseDriver` — for example, the `pg` or `mysql2` npm package — to get a connection from its pool.
   * A `DatabaseConnection` object, which wraps the native connection, is returned to the `QueryExecutor`.

   <!-- -->

6. ### Database Query[​](#database-query "Direct link to Database Query")

   The `QueryExecutor` passes the `CompiledQuery` to the `DatabaseConnection` object, which executes it. The `DatabaseConnection` uses the underlying `DatabaseDriver` to send the SQL and parameters to the database for execution. The `DatabaseDriver` sends the raw results back. The `DatabaseConnection` standardizes these into a `QueryResult` object and returns it to the `QueryExecutor`. Immediately after, the connection is released back to the pool.

   <!-- -->

7. ### Result Transformation[​](#result-transformation "Direct link to Result Transformation")

   The `QueryResult` is then passed through the plugin system again. The `QueryExecutor` calls the `transformResult` method on each plugin, allowing for final modifications to the results before they are returned to the `App`.

   <!-- -->

8. ### Returning to the App[​](#returning-to-the-app "Direct link to Returning to the App")

   The final, transformed `QueryResult` is passed up from the `QueryExecutor` to the `QueryBuilder`. The `QueryBuilder` then resolves the promise from the initial `.execute()` call, delivering the final, typed results to your `App`.
