# What is Vertana?

Vertana\[^1] is an LLM-powered agentic translation library for TypeScript.
It goes beyond a single “prompt in, text out” translation call by orchestrating
multiple steps—gathering context, enforcing terminology, evaluating quality, and
iteratively refining output.

Vertana is designed for applications where translation is part of a product or a
workflow: documentation sites, developer tools, localization pipelines, customer
support tooling, or internal knowledge bases.

\[^1]: The name *Vertana* is derived from the Sanskrit word *वर्तन* (*vartana*),
meaning *turning*, *moving*, or *abiding*.

## Why an agentic workflow?

A single-pass translation is often good enough for short, generic text.
It becomes fragile when you need:

* *Consistent terminology* across a document or project
* *Domain-aware accuracy* in technical, legal, or medical content
* *Style consistency* (tone, voice, formatting)
* *Quality control* beyond “sounds okay”

Vertana treats translation as a process.  It can gather supporting information,
use it during translation, and improve the result until it is acceptable.

## How Vertana works

Vertana composes a translation from multiple stages:

1. *Chunking*: Split long input into manageable pieces while preserving
   formatting and structure.
2. *Context gathering*: Collect relevant information from configured sources
   (required sources run up front; passive sources are exposed as tools).
3. *Translation*: Generate a draft translation with the available context.
4. *Evaluation*: Score and critique the translation against explicit criteria.
5. *Refinement*: Iteratively apply feedback to improve weak spots.
6. *Selection*: Optionally compare multiple candidates and pick the best.

Not every workflow uses every stage, but the building blocks are there when you
need tighter control.

## Key concepts

`context sources`
:   Pluggable functions that provide additional information.
They can inject style guides, background context, glossary databases, or
anything else that helps a model make better translation decisions.

`glossaries`
:   Term mappings used to enforce consistent translations.
Vertana can apply a predefined glossary and can also accumulate terminology
as it translates.

`refinement`
:   An iterative loop that evaluates quality and improves the translation until
it meets configured thresholds.

`best-of-N selection`
:   A workflow that generates multiple candidates (potentially from different
models) and chooses the most suitable result via comparative evaluation.

## Package overview

Vertana is a monorepo with several packages:

*@vertana/facade*
:   The high-level API.
Use this if you want a single `translate()` entry point and sensible
defaults.

*@vertana/core*
:   The underlying translation pipeline.
Use this if you need lower-level building blocks or custom orchestration.

*@vertana/context-web*
:   Helpers for web-based context gathering.
Use this to fetch and extract context from linked pages.

*@vertana/cli*
:   A command-line interface for translation without writing code.

## What Vertana is not

Vertana is intentionally focused on high-quality, product-grade translation.
It is not:

* A replacement for full localization platforms (string extraction,
  translation memory, review workflows, etc.)
* A guarantee of factual correctness (LLMs can still make mistakes)
* A single “magic prompt” that works for every domain without configuration
