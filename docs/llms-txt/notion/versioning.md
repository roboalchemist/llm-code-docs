# Versioning

> Learn about API change management and how to set the appropriate version in your integration.

export const latestApiVersion = <code>2025-09-03</code>;

The Notion API is versioned. Our API versions are named for the date the version is released. For example, our latest version is {latestApiVersion}.

Set the version by including a `Notion-Version` header. Setting this header is **required**.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl https://api.notion.com/v1/users/01da9b00-e400-4959-91ce-af55307647e5 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer secret_t1CdN9S8yicG5eWLUOfhcWaOscVnFXns"
    -H "Notion-Version: 2025-09-03"
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  // If you're using the JavaScript SDK, the appropriate
  // Notion-Version header will be set for you.
  const { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');

  // To override the default version, pass the `notionVersion` argument
  // when initializing the `Client`. For example:
  //
  // const notion = new Client({
  //   auth: process.env.NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  //   notionVersion: "2025-09-03"
  // });
  const notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

A new API version is released when we introduce a **backwards-incompatible** change to the API. For example, changing a property type's name.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON theme={null}
  // Prior to version 2021-05-13, the rich text property is called "text"
  "properties": {
  	"Description": {
  		"type": "text",
  		"text": [/* ... */]
  	}
  }

  // In version 2021-05-13, the rich text property is now called "rich_text"
  "properties": {
  	"Description": {
  		"type": "rich_text",
  		"rich_text": [/* ... */]
  	}
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In the above example, if you do not upgrade to the new version, you will continue to set text properties using `text` when creating or updating a page. Once you upgrade to the new version, you will need to use `rich_text` to set that same text property.

Similarly, the page response will be returned with the property type `text` on the old version, while on the new version, the response will say `rich_text`.

<Warning>
  **Required Header**

  The `Notion-Version` header must be included in all REST API requests. This ensures the Notion API response is consistent with what your code expects.

  The most recent `Notion-Version` is {latestApiVersion}.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Versioning is only for backwards incompatible changes**

  For new features and additions to the API, such as adding a new API endpoint, or including a new object in an existing API endpoint's response, there won't be a new version. You'll be able to take advantage of any new functionality on the version of the API you're currently using.
</Note>

**Note:** You may notice that Notion API URLs contain a `v1`. This is not related to the versioning described above. We don't intend to change these URLs.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do releases of the JavaScript SDK work?">
    Releases of the [Notion SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js) are published to NPM as [`@notionhq/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notionhq/client)
    and use a separate [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.
    View the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js/releases) for the latest version and changes over time. Some SDK changes are also
    featured in the [API changelog](/page/changelog).

    When upgrading to a new "minor" or "patch" version of the SDK, you generally won't need to make any code changes to your integration. These updates contain backwards-compatible
    improvements and fixes.

    However, new "major" versions of the SDK are not backwards-compatible, and you may need to make updates to your integration.

    <Note>Some major releases drop support for older Notion API versions and update the default version used to make requests when no `notionVersion` is provided to
    the SDK `Client` constructor.<br /><br />For example, `v5.0.0` and above dropped support for `2022-06-28` and earlier, and only works well with `2025-09-03` and above.
    <br /><br />To manage this upgrade, refer to the [upgrade guide](/guides/get-started/upgrade-guide-2025-09-03).
    See the [compatibility table](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements-and-compatibility) in the README to see which versions
    of the SDK are compatible with which versions of the API.</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will staying on an older API version work indefinitely?">
    We don't currently have any plans to stop supporting older API versions. If this changes in the future, we'll communicate this with all affected
    users and provide a time window and migration guidance. However, we recommend upgrading to the latest version
    to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.
