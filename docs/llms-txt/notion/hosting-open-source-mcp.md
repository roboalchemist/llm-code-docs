# Hosting a local MCP server

Learn how and when to use the open-source Notion MCP server.

## If you would like to run your own MCP server, the [notion-mcp-server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server) package is our open-source implementation. It offers more control over setup and behavior, and is a great fit for teams who already have an existing Notion integration or prefer to manage infrastructure themselves.

Compared to Notion’s remote MCP, this option requires more technical setup, including provisioning your own Notion integration and handling deployment. But it also gives you full visibility, support for the original JSON-based v1 APIs, and the flexibility to customize capabilities as needed.

Our MCP server works with any MCP client. Select one that best fits your needs and use cases. Examples of supported MCP clients are listed [here](common-mcp-clients).
