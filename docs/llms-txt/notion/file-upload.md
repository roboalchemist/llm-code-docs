# File Upload

> The [File Upload object](#object-properties) tracks the lifecycle of a file uploaded to Notion in the API.

<Note>
  **Getting started**

  View [Working with files and media](/guides/data-apis/working-with-files-and-media) for a comprehensive, end-to-end guide to uploading and attaching files.
</Note>

Once a file upload has a `status` of `"uploaded"`, pass its ID in a [file object](/reference/file-object#files-uploaded-in-the-api-type-file_upload) with a `type` of `file_upload` to the API to attach it to blocks, pages, and databases in a Notion workspace.

## Object properties

The response of File Upload APIs like [Retrieve a file upload](/reference/retrieve-a-file-upload) contains `FileUpload` objects with the following fields:
