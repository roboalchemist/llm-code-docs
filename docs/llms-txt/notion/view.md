  **Getting started**

  View [Working with views](/guides/data-apis/working-with-views) for a comprehensive guide to creating and managing views.
</Note>

**Views** define how pages in a [data source](/reference/data-source) are filtered, sorted, and displayed within a [database](/reference/database). Each view has its own type (table, board, calendar, etc.), filter, sort order, and layout configuration.

## Supported view types

| Type        | Description                                    |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `table`     | Rows-and-columns spreadsheet layout.           |
| `board`     | Kanban board grouped by a property.            |
| `calendar`  | Calendar layout grouped by a date property.    |
| `timeline`  | Gantt-style timeline layout.                   |
| `gallery`   | Card grid with cover images.                   |
| `list`      | Simple list layout.                            |
| `form`      | Form view for data entry.                      |
| `chart`     | Chart visualization.                           |
| `map`       | Map view with location pins.                   |
| `dashboard` | Multi-widget dashboard containing other views. |

<Info>
  View-specific `configuration` is available for all view types except `dashboard`. Dashboard views use `rows` to define their layout instead. See [Working with views](/guides/data-apis/working-with-views#view-configuration) for configuration details per view type.
