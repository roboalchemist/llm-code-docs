# SIEM events

> A comprehensive list of webhook events available in your SIEM platform once you set up the Notion SIEM connection.

Below is a comprehensive list of webhook events that will be available in your SIEM platform once you set up the Notion SIEM connection. All events available in your SIEM platform will correspond to an audit log event. The glossary will help you understand the specific events that are being tracked and how they relate to your organization's security posture. Use this information to fine-tune your dashboards, alerts, and incident management processes.

## Event types

Events are split into the following categories:

1. **Page events**: Events users take on a single Notion page.
2. **Data source events**: Events about data sources (databases). Note: Some data source operations may emit as `page.*` events for historical reasons.
3. **Workspace events**: Events users take on an entire Notion workspace.
4. **Account events**: Events about accounts of users in the workspace.
5. **Teamspace events**: Events users take on one or more teamspaces.
6. **Form events**: Events about forms in the workspace.

## Page audience

For page events, the page audience describes the visibility level of the target page. The audience captured will be one of the following:

* **Private**: The page is not shared with other users.
* **Internal**: The page is shared with other members of the workspace only.
* **External**: The page is shared with one or more guests outside of the workspace and/or with an integration bot.
* **Public**: The page is shared to the web.
