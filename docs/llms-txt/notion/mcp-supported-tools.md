# Supported tools

> Learn what you can do with Notion MCP tools.

Now that you have installed the Notion MCP, let's explore how AI assistants can use Notion MCP tools to create, search, and manage content in your Notion workspace.

These tools work seamlessly together through prompts, and their real power comes from combining them. With a single prompt, you can search your workspace, create new pages from the results, and update properties across multiple pages. Understanding these building blocks helps you craft efficient prompts that tackle complex tasks by combining multiple tools.

## MCP tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="notion-search">

<Info>
  **Tool names may vary for OpenAI**

  When connecting with an OpenAI MCP client (e.g. ChatGPT), the `notion-` prefix is automatically omitted from the `notion-fetch` and `notion-search` tools, making them appear as `fetch` and `search`, respectively. This is because these specific tool names are required as part of the [Deep Research specification](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/deep-research#remote-mcp-servers) for remote MCP servers.
</Info>

## Rate limits

Standard [API request limits](/reference/request-limits) apply per user's usage of Notion MCP (totaled across all tool calls). Currently, this is an average of **180 requests per minute** (3 requests per second).

Some MCP tools have additional, tool-specific rate limits that are stricter. These are subject to change over time, but the current values are listed below for reference:

* **Search**: 30 requests per minute

### Examples

To illustrate the above limitations, you'll experience rate limit errors in your MCP client of choice in any of the following example scenarios (assuming we take the average rate over a large enough time window):

* 35 searches per minute (exceeds search-specific limit)
* 12 searches & 170 fetches per minute (exceeds general 180 requests/min limit)
* 185 fetches per minute (exceeds general 180 requests/min limit)

### What to do if you're rate-limited

In most cases, the time it takes to do a complex AI-powered search across Notion and your connected tools means that sequential searches will typically stay under the rate limit. In general, if you encounter rate limit errors, prompt your LLM tool to reduce the amount of parallel searches or operations performed using Notion MCP, and/or try again later.
