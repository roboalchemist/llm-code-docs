- What if my integration doesn’t meet the requirements?

  > You’ll receive an email notification from our team and an updated notice in the integration management settings to know why your integration was rejected.

- What if my integration is rejected?

  > Integrations are rejected for various reasons from brand/trademark issues, to quality concerns, to situations where the baseline integration criteria isn’t met. We encourage developers to review our feedback, make necessary changes, and resubmit your integration.
