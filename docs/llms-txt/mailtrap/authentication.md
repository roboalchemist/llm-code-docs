# Authentication

## Authentication

There are several ways to send authenticated HTTP requests:

* Send a HTTP header `Api-Token: {api_token}`, where `{api_token}` is your API token
* Send a HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer {api_token}`, where `{api_token}` is your API token (more info: [Token Access Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750))

You can manage your API token on the [API Tokens](https://mailtrap.io/api-tokens) page. API token does not have an expiration date, you may reset it manually.
