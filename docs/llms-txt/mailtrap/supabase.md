# Supabase

Mailtrap can now be integrated with Supabase, giving you flexible options for email sending and contact automation. This integration allows you to exceed the default sending limits and sync your user base to send personalized email campaigns.

## Integration Options

Mailtrap offers two main integration approaches with Supabase:

### Mailtrap SMTP + Supabase

Use Mailtrap's SMTP settings to send emails directly through your Supabase project. This approach is ideal for applications that use SMTP-based email delivery.

**Key Features:**

* Configure SMTP credentials in Supabase Authentication settings
* Send emails through Supabase's built-in email system
* Adjust email rate limits beyond Supabase defaults

See the Mailtrap SMTP and Supabase integration guide for detailed setup instructions.
