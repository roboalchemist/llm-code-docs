# SSL Cipher Error

When using a custom domain for click tracking, you may encounter `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` or `Error 1001` error.

### Understanding Custom Domain Click Tracking

Mailtrap allows you to use your own domain for click tracking. To achieve this:

1. You add an `mt-link` CNAME record during the domain setup process
2. Mailtrap issues a security certificate for the mt-link subdomain to ensure a secure connection
3. Certificates from **Let's Encrypt** and **Google Trust Services** are used

### The Cause of the Error

Some domains have a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) specified in **CAA records**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your CAA records don't include Google Trust Services and Let's Encrypt, Mailtrap won't be able to request certificates from them. This prevents click tracking from working because browsers can't establish a secure connection.
{% endhint %}

### Checking Your CAA Records

You can check the CAA records for your domain using this command:

{% code title="Terminal" %}

```bash
dig CAA example.com
```

{% endcode %}

The output might look similar to this:

{% code title="Sample Output" %}

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.   13990    IN    CAA    0 issue "globalsign.com"
example.com.   13990    IN    CAA    0 issuewild "globalsign.com"
```

{% endcode %}

In this example, the domain only allows GlobalSign to issue certificates, which is why Mailtrap cannot obtain a certificate.

### Solution: Update CAA Records

You have two options:

**Option 1: Add Required CAs (Recommended)**

If you want to keep your existing CAA records, modify them to include Google Trust Services and Let's Encrypt:

{% code title="Required CAA Records" %}

```
# Google Trust Services
0 issue "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"

# Let's Encrypt
0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
```

{% endcode %}

**Option 2: Remove CAA Restrictions**

If you don't need to restrict which CAs can issue certificates for your domain, you can remove the CAA records entirely.

### How to Add CAA Records

**CAA Record Configuration**

<table><thead><tr><th width="148.625">Field</th><th width="318.66015625">Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>blank or <code>@</code>, depending on your provider</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>TTL</td><td>1 hour or any other appropriate TTL</td><td>Controls how long the record is valid.</td></tr><tr><td>Flag</td><td>0</td><td><code>0</code> means that no flags have been set. Please read your DNS provider's documentation for specific behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Tag</td><td>issue</td><td>Allows the CA to issue certificates for this domain and its subdomains (e.g., mt-link subdomain).</td></tr><tr><td>Domain</td><td><code>pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes</code> <strong>OR</strong> <code>letsencrypt.org</code></td><td>Google Trust Services needs the additional parameter <code>cansignhttpexchanges=yes</code>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need to create **two separate CAA records**: one for Google Trust Services and one for Let's Encrypt.
{% endhint %}

### Verification

After updating your CAA records:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Wait for DNS Propagation**

It can take several hours for the changes to your CAA records to propagate. This varies by DNS provider and TTL settings.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Verify CAA Records**

Run the `dig CAA example.com` command again to confirm the new records are in place.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Test Your mt-link Subdomain**

Once propagated, you should be able to access your mt-link subdomain without SSL errors:

### Need Help?

If you're still experiencing SSL errors after updating CAA records:

* Wait at least 24 hours for full DNS propagation
* Verify the records are correctly formatted (check for typos)
* Contact your DNS provider for CAA record support
