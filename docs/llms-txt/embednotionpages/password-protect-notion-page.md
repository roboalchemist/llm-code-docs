# How to Add a Password to a Notion Page

Notion doesn't let you add passwords to pages yet.

To protect your content, you'll need a workaround. Here are the main options:

## 1. Use an iframe

This is probably the easiest option if you need to protect individual Notion pages.

You just embed your Notion page on your own website using an iframe.

You can use [EmbedNotionPages.com](https://embednotionpages.com/) for this.

Pop your public Notion link into the tool, and it generates the iframe code for your site.

Then you can set a password to control who gets access.

Perfect if you already have a website and want a quick solution.

## 2. Set up a reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy basically sits between users and your Notion page, asking for a password before letting anyone through.

You can build this with Sotion, Nginx, or Vercel – and it gives you the bonus of cleaner links and custom styling.

## 3. Turn Notion into a website

For a more complete solution, [Super.so](https://super.so/) turns your Notion pages into a full website.

Beyond just password protection, you get custom domains, SEO tools, and a professional-looking site.

This makes sense if the entire website content could be in Notion.
