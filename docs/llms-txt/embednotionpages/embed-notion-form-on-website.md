# How to Embed a Notion Form on Your Website

Embedding a Notion form into your website lets you collect responses directly in your Notion workspace, simplifying data collection and improving visitor interaction with your content.

## How It Works:

Notion forms provide a powerful way to collect data directly within your workflow. When embedded on your website using an HTML `<iframe>`, these forms create a seamless experience for your visitors.

The process is straightforward: make your Notion form publicly accessible, embed it on your site, and watch as submissions flow directly into your Notion database—albeit without requiring users to navigate away from your website.

This integration creates a pro, cohesive experience while simplifying your data collection process.

## How to Embed a Notion Form into Your Website

1. **Create and publish your Notion form:**

   - Design your form within Notion, ensuring it includes all necessary fields.
   - Click on the "Share form" button at the top-right corner of your Notion form.
   - For "Who can fill it out", select "Anyone on the web with link".
   - Click on "Embed this form"

3. **Embed the form into your website:**

   - Paste the copied iframe code into your website's HTML at the location where you want the form to appear. This is typically within a content div or dedicated form section.
   - Adjust the `width` and `height` attributes to fit your website's design and ensure optimal user experience.

### Considerations:

- **Permissions:** Ensure the form is set to public; otherwise, visitors won't be able to access it.
- **Responsiveness:** Test the embedded form on various devices to ensure it displays correctly and is user-friendly.
- **Third-Party Tools:** If you encounter limitations or require additional customization, consider using tools like [Fillout.com](https://www.fillout.com/) or [NoteForms](https://noteforms.com/) that offer enhanced embedding capabilities and direct integration with Notion databases.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Notion forms into your website, enhancing data collection and management within your Notion workspace.
