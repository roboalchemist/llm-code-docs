# Signup and Registration

## 1. Signup

To generate images on Ideogram, you will need to first create an account.

Visit [<mark style="color:blue;">Ideogram.ai</mark>](https://ideogram.ai) and sign up using a Google or Apple account. At the moment, Ideogram only supports signup through Google or Apple. When you click “Continue with Google” or “Continue with Apple,” you will be redirected to the respective login page and then back to Ideogram. **Be sure to select the correct Google or Apple account when signing up, as it cannot be changed later.**

## 2. Pick a Username (Display Handle)

Once you log in, you will be prompted to choose a username that will be associated with your account and will be visible to other Ideogram users. The username must be unique, only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore, and be between 3 and 16 characters. Please note that your Google or Apple account's profile picture will be used as your Ideogram profile picture by default, but you can change your picture to any of your own generations later. **Be sure to choose a username you like, as you won't be able to change it later**. Once you've chosen a username, you're ready to experience the magic of text-to-image!

## 3. Subscribe to an Ideogram Plan

To get access to priority generation, private generation, image upload, and other premium features, you'll need to subscribe to one of our plans. Please visit [<mark style="color:blue;">ideogram.ai/pricing</mark>](https://ideogram.ai/pricing) for more information and to purchase a plan.
