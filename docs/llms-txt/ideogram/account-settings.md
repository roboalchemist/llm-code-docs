## Cancel Your Subscription

{% hint style="danger" %}

### **Important**

You must cancel your subscription **at least five (5) days** before the subscription period renewal date to allow the cancellation process to fully take place and to avoid future subscription charges.
{% endhint %}

Click **Cancel subscription** at the top of the page to proceed with cancellation. You will be asked to confirm before you cancel.

When you cancel your Ideogram subscription, you will still retain access to the features and benefits of your plan until the end of your current billing period. **There are no refunds for any unused periods remaining on your subscription**. If you change your mind about cancelling, you can always renew your subscription later.

***

## Deleting Your Account

This section explains how deletion works and what to expect.

1. **Initiating deletion**
   * In the [User Menu](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/user-menu), select **Delete account**.
   * A confirmation prompt appears, asking you to type a specific word (e.g. “delete”) to confirm.
2. **Deletion process**
   * Once confirmed, the process may take a few minutes to start.
   * &#x20;<mark style="color:red;background-color:$danger;">**The deletion is permanent and irreversible**</mark>  — all your images (generated or uploaded), prompts, and history will be removed.
   * The full deletion process usually takes up to 48 hours, during which you cannot re-register with the same Google or Apple account.
3. **Effect on subscriptions**
   * Any active subscription linked to your Ideogram account will be canceled automatically. You will not be charged for any renewal payments in the future.
   * Any prepayments made for future periods, such as the remaining time on a monthly or annual subscription plan, are forfeit and non-refundable.
   * After account deletion, your subscription data cannot be restored. We are not able to transfer the subscription plan to another Ideogram account.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you delete your Ideogram account, all your generations, prompts, and user data will be deleted from Ideogram servers. Your previous generations will no longer be visible to other users.
{% endhint %}
