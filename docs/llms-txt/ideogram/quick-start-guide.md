### Write Your Prompt

On the main page, locate the prompt box at the top. Enter a description of the image you want to generate. For example:

> *A serene landscape with mountains during sunset.*

You can enhance your prompt by specifying styles, colors, or other details by yourself or turn on [**Magic Prompt**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) and the AI will do it automatically for you.

**Tip:** For inspiration, click on any image you like from other users to see the prompt they used.
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}

### Customize Generation Settings

Adjust a few settings located at the bottom of the prompt box:&#x20;

* **Model**: Choose the model you want (*each has a different price in credits*)
* **Style**: Choose from options like \*Realistic\*, \*General\*, \*Design\*, etc.
* **Aspect Ratio**: Select the desired image dimensions.
* **Magic Prompt**: Enhance your prompt automatically for more detailed results.
* **Color Palette**: Define a specific color scheme.

These settings are optional; you can proceed with the  defaults if preferred.

Tip: Try different models and styles.
{% endhint %}

### Generate the Image

Click the **"Generate"** button. Ideogram will process your prompt and display your generated images within seconds.
