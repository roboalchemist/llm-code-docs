<details>

<summary>What is the priority queue?</summary>

The priority queue is Ideogram’s fastest processing path and ensures your image gets processed immediately. Priority generation requires priority credits. The number of priority credits you have depends on the subscription plan you are subscribed to. You can also purchase top-up credits.

For more information, go to: [plans-and-pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens when I run out of priority credits?</summary>

Paid subscribers who have no priority credits remaining will generate on the slow queue. The slow queue has wait times that vary based on available server capacity and how much you've used it.

At this point, you can either: upgrade to a higher-tier plan that offers more priority prompts, purchase top-ups to get more priority prompts without changing your plan, or wait for your priority prompts to replenish on your next monthly billing period.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I choose between generating in slow queue or using my priority queue credits?</summary>

There is currently no way to toggle between the two queues. You will use your priority queue credits until they are exhausted, then switch to the slow queue. If you don't want to wait until your next monthly credit refresh, you can purchase top-up credits for more priority prompts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can other people see the images I generate?</summary>

All images generated on Ideogram are public by default to support the sharing of creative images generated by the community. If you want to hide your creations from others, [private generations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations) are available as a feature on the Ideogram Plus and Ideogram Pro plans.

For more information, go to: [private-generations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I correct text in my image?</summary>

Although Ideogram excels at generating text in images, errors like spelling mistakes or missing words can occur. Depending on the error, there are various ways to correct it.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Do my unused Priority credits roll over to the next month if I don’t use them?</summary>

Unused priority credits from the monthly subscription plans will not roll over to the next month of your subscription. Also, if you cancel your subscription, any unused credits will expire at the end of the current billing period. The same applies to Slow credits for Basic plan subscribers.

Priority credits from Top-up purchases will rollover to the next month, but only if your account continues to have a valid subscription plan. Else, they will become inaccessible because Free users cannot use priority credits. These credits will become accessible again as soon as you re-subscribe to a paid plan.

</details>
