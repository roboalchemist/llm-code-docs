# Team Plan

The **Team** subscription is extremely useful for sharing access to Ideogram with others. Whether it’s for family members, a few partners, or an entire production team, a Team plan enables one paid account to provide access to multiple users.&#x20;

## Overview

Here are some features of the Team subscription:

* **Centralized billing and administration** for multiple members under a single team account.
* **1,500 Priority credits per month** per member.
* Add Priority credits to members with **Top up credits**.
* **Unlimited slow credits** for every member.
* **Full access to all premium features** for you and your team.
* Full access to the **Batch Generation** feature.
* **Add or remove** **team members** as needed.
* And more...

## Team Owner

The **Team owner** is the user who created the team and manages its subscription. They have full control over team settings, including inviting and removing members, allocating more Priority credits to members through the **Top-up credits** feature, and overseeing team activity. The **Team owner** operates under a single account tied to the team subscription and does not have the option to switch to a personal account like the other members of the team.

### Managing the Team

Selecting **Manage team subscription** from the Profile menu, will lead to the team's page similar to the one below. This is where you will be able to do all the management of the team.

On the team's page, you will be able to:

1. **Set or change** your team's name and icon.
2. **View** and **manage** your subscription and billing.
3. **Manage** your team members.
   1. Invite members to join the team.
   2. Top up members' credits if necessary.
   3. Remove members from the team.

### Managing Billing

To manage the billing of the Team subscription, navigate to the Team’s page by clicking your **Profile icon** located at the bottom of the left-side panel and selecting **Manage team subscription.** From there, click on the **Manage Billing** button to access the billing information for the account.

### Inviting New Members

1. Click on **Invite members** on the team's page. An invite modal window will appear like the example below.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FciXvtKK4qUTMLYOvF52t%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=933a0464-1d65-4f71-bd9c-a91cc2b0a8f5" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fyc7oA34C61GDah0Fxdq4%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=50cdbf1b-6f89-4e85-94ff-c3c5d169865b" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>The modal window to invite new members to your team.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. You can invite a member in two ways:
   1. **By username**
      1. The username is the unique identifier for a person on Ideogram. It appears at the top when you click on your profile icon. As you enter the username, a list of user accounts may appear—ensure you select the correct one before sending the invitation. The person will receive an email and a notification in Ideogram, inviting them to join your team as a member.
   2. **By email**
      1. If the person is already on Ideogram and the email you specified to invite them is already associated with their account (via Google or Apple), they will receive **both an email and a notification** inviting them to join your team.
      2. If the person **is not** yet on Ideogram, they will receive **an email** inviting them to create an account (using Google or Apple) before joining your team.
3. Once the invitation is sent, a new row will appear in the member list with the status “Pending”, indicating that the person has not yet joined.
4. At the moment a member joins the team, they will immediately have all the privileges of team membership, **and the Team account will be charged for an additional member**.

### Managing Team Members

To top up credits for a particular member or remove a member from your team, click on the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> located at the right end of the member's row.

1. Select **Top up credits** to buy **Priority credits** for that member.
2. Choose **Remove from team** to remove a member from your team.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When **removing a member** from the team, <mark style="color:red;">**you will not receive any reimbursement**</mark> for unused credits or time remaining on the subscription.

**Re-inviting** the same user again <mark style="color:red;">**will incur a new charge**</mark> on the subscription.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing Your Team Members Images

Click on a team member’s name to access their profile page. To view images generated by that team member, they must set the image to public, allowing it to appear in the "All tab. They can also pin the image to make them appear in the "Pin" tab, as a mean of image management.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recognize the importance of sharing within the team while not making the image public. The Ideogram the team is working towards solutions to allow that.
{% endhint %}

## Team Members

Team members are users who have been invited to a team by the team owner. They receive a set amount of credits and full access to all premium features to generate images. Team members can make their images available for the team to view by setting them to public. They can also pin images for better organization and management within their profile.

### Being Invited

To join the team, they simply need to click the “Join Team” button in the email or select “Accept” in the notification.

### Personal Space vs Team Space

Members of a team can switch between their personal space and the team’s space when generating images. Once selected, the credits used to generate images will be deducted from the chosen account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **Team owner** operates under a single account tied to the team subscription and does not have the option to switch to a personal space like the other members of the team.
{% endhint %}

To switch between spaces, simply click on your profile icon, then select either your team’s name or “Personal” to choose the account you want to use. In the example below, the member also has a personal Plus subscription. Note how the number of Priority credits differs between the team space and the personal space.

A quick way to check which space you are currently using is to look at your profile icon. If it contains a square with the first letter of your team’s name, then you are using the team space. Otherwise, you are in your personal space.

## Generating Images

Generating images with a team account is the very same as generating images with a personal account. The only differences are:

* You are using your Team's account credits instead of your own.
* You'll have to make the images public so the other members can see them.
