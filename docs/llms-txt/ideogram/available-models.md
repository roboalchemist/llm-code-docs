# Available Models

When generating images with Ideogram, you can choose between different *model versions*. Each version offers distinct characteristics that determine image quality, style fidelity, and performance.

Your selected model affects how Ideogram interprets your prompt, the level of detail in the output, and the consistency across generations.

To select a model:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to expand it (if not already expanded) and display the generation settings.
2. Select **Model + variations** (displayed as the actual model and number of images, for example, **3.0 Default x 4**)  to open the dropdown menu.
3. Choose the **Model**, **Number of images** (1–4), and [Render speed](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed).
