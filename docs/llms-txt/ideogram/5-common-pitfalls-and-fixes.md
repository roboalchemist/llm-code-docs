# 5- Common Pitfalls and Fixes

Even with a good understanding of prompting, it’s easy to make small mistakes that lead to strange or disappointing results—especially when you're trying to get a very specific image from the AI. This section highlights some of the most common issues users run into when they want precise results and shows how to fix them with simple changes.

These tips are especially useful when you have a clear image in mind and want Ideogram to follow your descriptions closely. If you're prompting more for creative discovery or artistic exploration, some of these “mistakes” may actually lead to interesting results—so feel free to experiment.

## Vague Adjectives

**Issue:** Using non-specific descriptors like *“beautiful,” “interesting,” “nice”* or *“cool”* can lead to unpredictable outcomes, as the AI lacks a clear visual reference for these terms.

**Fix:** Replace vague adjectives with specific visual details.

> **Instead of:** *“A beautiful forest”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A dense forest with tall pine trees and soft rays of sunlight filtering through the branches”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“A beautiful dress.”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A red satin evening gown with intricate lace details.”*

## Generic Style Terms

**Issue:** Using broad style descriptors like “artistic” or “modern”—often seen at the beginning of the prompt to define the medium and style of the image—may not provide the AI with enough guidance to what kind of art you expect.

**Fix:** Specify the desired style using well-known art movements, techniques, or mediums.

> **Instead of:** *“a modern painting of a landscape”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “An impressionist painting of a rolling countryside with thick brushstrokes and pastel tones”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“an artistic photo of a dancer”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A soft-focus photo of a ballet dancer mid-leap on a dimly lit stage”*

## Contradictory Descriptions

**Issue:** Writing conflicting information in a prompt can confuse the AI, leading to inconsistent or nonsensical images.

**Fix:** Ensure all elements of the prompt are coherent and compatible.

> **Instead of:** *“A minimalist sculpture with fine and intricate details”*\
> **Try:** *“A minimalist sculpture with smooth, simple geometric shapes in white marble”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Or:** “A detailed sculpture carved with delicate patterns and ornamental features, displayed on a minimal white pedestal”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“A clean, empty room cluttered with artifacts”*\
> **Try:** *“A clean, empty room with plain white walls and a single wooden chair”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Or:** “A room filled with ancient artifacts, displayed on simple white pedestals in a clean, open space”*

## Abstract Concepts Tied to a Subject

**Issue:** Prompts centered on abstract ideas without concrete visual elements can lead to a wide variety of results.

**Fix:** Anchor abstract concepts with tangible visuals.

> **Instead of:** *“A symbol of hope”*\
> **Try*****:** “A single flower blooming through a crack in the concrete”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“*&#x41; child caught in a moment of wonde&#x72;*”*\
> **Try*****:** “A child staring up at a night sky filled with stars, mouth slightly open in awe”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“An old man lost in regret”*\
> **Try*****:** “An old man sitting alone on a park bench, staring down at a faded photo in his hands”*

## Aspect Ratio Influence on Framing

Even with the exact same prompt, Ideogram may generate very different results depending on the aspect ratio you choose.

This is because the AI tries to fill the entire canvas based on the image it was trained with, and different aspect ratios naturally suggest different types of framing. For example:

A prompt like *“A woman walking on a busy city street sidewalk”*

* In **portrait (1:2)**, the result may show her full body from head to toe.
* In **landscape (2:1)**, the framing may shift closer—showing her from the waist up or knees up to fit the wider format.

If you're aiming for a specific composition—like a wide scenic view, a full-body portrait, or a tight close-up—it helps to:

* **Choose an aspect ratio** that matches your intent
* **Include clear framing cues** in your prompt, such as *“full-body,” “head and shoulders,” “wide establishing shot,”* and so on

However, even with a matching prompt and aspect ratio, the AI may still frame your subject differently than expected. For example:

* You might ask for a **full-body view** in landscape format, but the result shows only the upper body
* Or you might want a **close-up** in portrait format, but the AI includes the full body anyway

To guide the framing more precisely, here are two simple strategies that work in both cases:

1. **Include visual elements that hint at how much of the subject should be shown**
   * For **full-body results**, describe things near the feet—like shoes, sidewalk texture, shadows, or puddles
   * For **close-ups**, focus only on upper-body features—like eyes, lips, hands, or shoulders
2. **Adjust the focus of the prompt**
   * For wider framing, make the **environment** the main subject (e.g., *“a crowded city sidewalk”*) and describe the person as a key detail within it
   * For tighter framing, keep the **person** as the main subject and avoid describing large-scale surroundings that suggest a wide shot

These small changes help steer the AI toward the type of framing that fits your goal—whether it’s a full scene or a focused portrait. Combining descriptive language with the right aspect ratio gives you much better control over what appears in the final image.

In conclusion, learning to spot these small issues—and knowing how to fix them—can make a big difference in how well your prompt is understood. With just a few adjustments, you'll start getting images that feel a lot closer to what you had in mind.

In the next section, you’ll see how to iterate and refine your prompt step by step.
