# Describing Age and Life Stage

When prompting for people, describing age clearly can shape the outcome just as much as physical features or clothing. However, many AIs don’t reliably interpret numeric ages (e.g., “a 7-year-old girl”) with visual accuracy. Instead of specifying numbers, it’s more effective to use descriptive, life stage–based terms. This appendix breaks those terms into two parts per group: age terms and modifiers to help communicate the age and physical traits more accurately.

You can mix and match across each category for more controlled image generation.
