# Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

<details>

<summary>How can I start using Ideogram to generate AI images?</summary>

Sign up for a free account at [ideogram.ai](https://ideogram.ai/) and start generating images. Ideogram works directly in your browser, with no need to download any additional applications or software.

For more information, go to: [signup-and-registration](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/signup-and-registration "mention") and [generating-images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/generating-images "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much does Ideogram cost to use?</summary>

With a free account, you get 10 weekly credits - that's up to 40 images per week. You can also subscribe to a paid plan to access premium features like shorter wait-times, private generation, image upload, and way more generation credits.

For more information, go to: [plans-and-pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use Ideogram to generate images for commercial use?</summary>

We do not claim any ownership rights over the images generated, nor do we restrict your ability to use them. You are free to use the images as you wish. However, you are responsible for ensuring that your content does not violate any laws or third-party rights or our Terms of Service. Please review our full [Terms of Service](https://ideogram.ai/legal/tos), especially Section 2.1.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When do the <strong>Slow credits</strong> for <strong>Free Plan users</strong> reset?</summary>

**Slow credits** for **Free Plan users** reset every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (overnight from Friday to Saturday).

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I get access to the Ideogram API?</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the priority queue?</summary>

The priority queue is Ideogram’s fastest processing path and ensures your image gets processed immediately. Priority generation requires priority credits. The number of priority credits you have depends on the subscription plan you are subscribed to. You can also purchase top-up credits.

For more information, go to: [plans-and-pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens when I run out of priority credits?</summary>

Paid subscribers who have no priority credits remaining will generate on the slow queue. The slow queue has wait times that vary based on available server capacity and how much you've used it.

At this point, you can either: upgrade to a higher-tier plan that offers more priority prompts, purchase top-ups to get more priority prompts without changing your plan, or wait for your priority prompts to replenish on your next monthly billing period.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I choose between generating in slow queue or using my priority queue credits?</summary>

There is currently no way to toggle between the two queues. You will use your priority queue credits until they are exhausted, then switch to the slow queue. If you don't want to wait until your next monthly credit refresh, you can purchase top-up credits for more priority prompts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can other people see the images I generate?</summary>

All images generated on Ideogram are public by default to support the sharing of creative images generated by the community. If you want to hide your creations from others, [private generations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations) are available as a feature on the Ideogram Plus and Ideogram Pro plans.

For more information, go to: [private-generations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I change the cover image?</summary>

To change the automatically assigned cover image, simply click the heart icon to like the image you prefer. This will set it as the cover image. If you like multiple images in the same generation, the first one in the list will be chosen as the cover image.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I correct text in my image?</summary>

Although Ideogram excels at generating text in images, errors like spelling mistakes or missing words can occur. Depending on the error, there are various ways to correct it.&#x20;

Please read our full guide here: [text-and-typography](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/2-prompting-fundamentals/text-and-typography "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I download images in PNG format?</summary>

Paid subscribers can download images in PNG format as part of their plan benefits. Navigate to the image you want to download, click the Menu button, and then select Download -> PNG.

If you directly Right Click -> Save As on the image, you will download a WEBP format image. Please use the method outlined above to download images in PNG format.

For more information, go to: [downloading-images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/downloading-images "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I download images in SVG format?</summary>

At the moment, we do not support SVG or any other vector image formats. However, you can use third-party software or websites to convert bitmap images to vector formats, such as SVG.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I remove the background on my generated images?</summary>

You can use the [Background Removal](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/replace-or-remove-background) feature to remove the background from an image.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I integrate my logo or photo without modifications into an image?</summary>

Currently, it’s not possible to use images and logos without the AI slightly reinterpreting them. This feature may be available in a future version.

</details>

***

### Account Management

<details>

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I change my profile picture on Ideogram?</summary>

Go to the image page of any of your generations. Click the menu button and select "Set as profile picture" to change your profile picture to that image.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I reset my account's password?</summary>

Ideogram accounts are registered using Google or Apple accounts, so there's no password to reset.

You will need to reset your password or contact support on the respective Google or Apple website.

</details>

<details>

</details>

***

### Subscription/Billing

<details>

<summary>How do I upgrade my free account to a paid subscription plan?</summary>

Log into your account and visit [ideogram.ai/pricing](https://ideogram.ai/pricing). Select from one of the plans, noting whether you want annual or monthly billing frequency. Click the **Upgrade** button and you will be taken to a checkout screen to enter your payment details.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I cancel my subscription plan?</summary>

You can cancel your monthly or yearly subscription at any time. You'll be able to use all the benefits and features of your plan until the end of your billing period and won't be charged again after that.

To cancel your subscription plan, please follow these steps:

1. Log into your account and visit [ideogram.ai/pricing ](https://ideogram.ai/pricing)
2. Click on **Manage billing** at the top right corner of the screen
3. Click **Cancel Plan**

[Broken link](https://docs.ideogram.ai/broken-reference "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens to my private images if I cancel my subscription plan?</summary>

You will still have access to your private images after canceling your plan, and they will not be visible to other users. However, you will no longer be able to create additional private images.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do my unused Priority credits roll over to the next month if I don’t use them?</summary>

Unused priority credits from the monthly subscription plans will not roll over to the next month of your subscription. Also, if you cancel your subscription, any unused credits will expire at the end of the current billing period. The same applies to Slow credits for Basic plan subscribers.

Priority credits from Top-up purchases will rollover to the next month, but only if your account continues to have a valid subscription plan. Else, they will become inaccessible because Free users cannot use priority credits. These credits will become accessible again as soon as you re-subscribe to a paid plan.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I changed my mind. Can I get a refund on my subscription payment?</summary>

Payments for all of our subscription services are non-refundable and there are no credits given for any unused periods remaining on your subscription. Please review our full [Terms of Service](https://ideogram.ai/legal/tos), specifically Section 2.6.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I avoid being double charged when upgrading my plan plan, or changing my plan to annual billing?</summary>

You will only pay the difference between the new price and the unused portion of your current subscription. Please review the final amount on the confirmation screen.

[Broken link](https://docs.ideogram.ai/broken-reference "mention")

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why was I charged another month's subscription fee when I only wanted to subscribe for one month?</summary>

Once you log in, you will be prompted to choose a username that will be associated with your account and will be visible to other Ideogram users. The username must be unique, only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore, and be between 3 and 16 characters. Please note that your Google or Apple account's profile picture will be used as your Ideogram profile picture by default, but you can change your picture to any of your own generations later. **Be sure to choose a username you like, as you won't be able to change it later**. Once you've chosen a username, you're ready to experience the magic of text-to-image!

# Generating Images

Ideogram is a web application that allows you to browse and generate images from text. Within the user interface, you can generate images, browse and filter previously generated images, curate your user profile, manage your subscription, and more.

### Generation

To create an image in the simplest way, type the description of what you want to see in the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box), then hit **Generate**. On a mobile device, click on the&#x20;

{% tabs %}

At the top of the screen, click the input text box to type a description of what you want Ideogram to generate, then hit **Generate** to start the process.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS app / Mobile" %}

At the bottom of the screen, you can click on the "+" button to pull up the generation panel and start typing in a description of what you want Ideogram to generate. Hit the **Generate** button to start the generation.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Prompts and generations are visible to everyone on Ideogram unless you choose to generate in [Private Mode](https://docs.ideogram.ai/features-and-tools#private-generations)<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>
{% endhint %}

Ideogram generates four images at a time using graphical processing units (GPUs) on remote servers. While the generation is happening, you will see previews of the final images with a progress indicator above them.

# The Basics, Step-by-Step

Here is a brief guide to help you understand how to prompt on Ideogram, step by step.

The prompts provided will always be written in the following format:

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A rough pencil sketch featuring a boy with sandy hair and blue eyes, wearing a&#x20;*~~*<mark style="color:purple;">hoodie</mark>*~~ *<mark style="color:green;">checked shirt</mark> and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day.*

The <mark style="color:green;">text in green</mark> means this text is new or was added to a prompt previously used.\
~~<mark style="color:purple;">Strikethrough purple text</mark>~~ means this text has been removed or replaced from a prompt previously used.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For all examples below, we'll use the following settings:\
• [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) set to OFF\
• [Aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratio-and-dimensions) of 1:1\
• [Model](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/available-models) v2.0 (unless otherwise stated)\
• [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models) Realistic (unless otherwise stated)
{% endhint %}

## 1- A Very Basic Prompt

Let's start with a very basic prompt:

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair on a grey background.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F6SdnPm3bIKs2g6wlsBdM%2F01-a-boy-with-blond-hair-on-a-grey-backgrou_Ly2nLPPoQ9y1z6LIcw3XFA_PaBnaSuPS-avUkgh963fdg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3e7cb25f-f683-4817-a4be-f2ce3cba380b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Nothing complicated here. The image of a boy and a grey background as requested. Now let's add more details...

## 2- Adding Details

Let's add some specific details like eye colour, and maybe he's wearing a wearing a denim jacket over a light blue shirt, and how about a more interesting background.

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair <mark style="color:green;">and blue eyes,</mark>&#x20;*~~*<mark style="color:purple;">on a grey background.</mark>*~~*&#x20;<mark style="color:green;">wearing a denim jacket and a checked shirt, against a backdrop of wooden planks.</mark>*

<div align="center" data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FOdryg28QNCv9HAT1eLoS%2F02-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_ErLgiSIuTLOIeP6_wEowOA_FdSygSBYQg2RamlTZSsXKg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=334d2a1b-0a61-42ce-b20c-4c4dd656b05d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Nice! Now let's try to make it a bit more dynamic...

## 3- A Point of View

Perhaps changing the angle and/or the point of view would produce a more interesting image?

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a denim jacket and a checked shirt, <mark style="color:green;">seen partially in profile</mark>, against a backdrop of wooden planks.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FEKzo3JopwfJrRE4aJMV4%2F03-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_w2SHXqZkSPmG6C_kJIcCUw_J7uxTxO6Sk-1A7No-GTVng.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5799b398-b5ab-4aa1-8b18-2c3041f59c06" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Almost a studio photo but still very natural, isn’t it?

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: there are also other terms used to achieve this pose, such as <mark style="color:green;">three-quarter pose</mark>, or <mark style="color:green;">slightly turned to the left</mark>, etc.
{% endhint %}

## 4- Adding Elements

Let's add a few elements to make the overall image more attractive?

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a denim jacket, a checked shirt <mark style="color:green;">and jeans, sitting cross-legged on the floor, beside a friendly dog. Between them both there is a house plant in a pot. The entire scene is set</mark> against a backdrop of wooden planks.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQlylTfS4nF0sGuSP0RS0%2F04-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_k4xIQmBRRz63zQZJUZI8sA_zhke1hkFSa2O2ffdEoV9Xg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=74668586-9c07-4fc3-b61e-777618522544" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Observe how effectively the AI has rendered the requested elements and their precise positioning within the image composition. Now, let’s shift the mood…

## 5- Make a Lively Scene

Prompt:\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing* ~~*<mark style="color:purple;">a denim jacket,</mark>*~~*&#x20;a checked shirt and jeans, <mark style="color:green;">playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day</mark>.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fs99zJjCi2CNs0WERLVIy%2F05-a-boy-with-blond-hair-and-blue-eyes-wear_CxEC3eNFTOibsmMPfSOTDw_glodCDWlTHuawMwuJYYDmw.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6a848ab3-3dd6-48fb-888b-17bd671b2bd6" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The addition of an environment contributes greatly to the atmosphere of a picture. And everyone knows that the Golden Retriever is a child's best friend. 😉

## 6- Using Available Pptions

As you may have noticed, Ideogram provides several options for generating images. From [Aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratio-and-dimensions) and [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models) to [Color palette](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/color-palette) and other features, these options are invaluable for creating unique and diverse visuals.

Let’s explore some of these possibilities to create various outputs.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0gSfbdmjCwas0Sci7LMM%2F6a-washed-out-soft-watercolour-painting-fea_tr8MFtTWQuqXdEyhmGkk-g_wLlBWoqVQby0KFVjLj8oXg.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9208a445-ed0d-4ef8-a0e3-d3626500e4ee" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em><mark style="color:green;">Washed-out soft watercolour painting featuring</mark> a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day.</em><br><strong>Model</strong>: v2.0<br><strong>Style</strong>: General<br><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: 4:5<br><strong>Color Palette</strong>: Pastel</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FRp0tvlFklFY9tZ23VsbA%2F6b-an-anime-illustration-featuring-a-boy-wi_47x_QrUXSZWrei7GJoi2hg_dUPo5DZlQ96xWioteT4BUw.png?alt=media&#x26;token=99fa807d-46ff-4f8f-b280-023b37cfcf85" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em><mark style="color:green;">An anime illustration featuring</mark> a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day.</em><br><strong>Model</strong>: v2.0<br><strong>Style</strong>: Anime<br><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: 4:5<br><strong>Color Palette</strong>: None</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FSuzU14dx9NzYbYPxUsPA%2F6c-a-cartoon-like-3d-boy-with-blond-hair-an_w5x5BIvySSKPtBGTAsKcGA_rMfJBRtPTjyNqXRSaONLNA.png?alt=media&#x26;token=44ca65de-b958-4ab6-b84d-23be7c838549" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em><mark style="color:green;">A cartoon-like 3D</mark> boy with sandy hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a paper-art park on a sunny day.</em><br><strong>Model</strong>: v2.0<br><strong>Style</strong>: 3D<br><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: 4:5<br><strong>Color Palette</strong>: None</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Difference between v1.0 styles and v2.0 styles.**

**In v1.0, the styles are really just words added at the end of the prompt** to specify the style you want, nothing more. So if you select 'illustration', it is the very same as if you've added the word 'illustration' at the end of your prompt. This works even better if you describe the style you want in the context of the prompt rather than a simple word at the end of it.

**In v2.0, the different styles utilize slightly different models to generate the images.** It is as though you are using a model better suited to the style you want, rather than relying on a generic AI model.

For more information, refer to the [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models) section of this documentation.
{% endhint %}

## 7- Add Some Text

Let's say you want to make a cover for a children book, give it a title and also add the author's name.

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*Washed-out soft watercolour painting featuring a boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a checked shirt and jeans, playing with a friendly Golden Retriever, in a park on a sunny day. <mark style="color:green;">At the top of the image, the book title is: "Michael and his dog" in a fun painted typography. At the bottom, the author's name: "John Johnson".</mark>*\
**Model**: v2.0\
**Style**: General\
**Aspect ratio**: 3:4\
**Color Palette**: None

# Downloading Images

Once you have created one or more images, you might want to download them to your computer. There are different ways to download images generated on Ideogram.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You shouldn't download images using a right-click in browser or by any other means as this may result in downloading smaller or more compressed images than those provided by the official methods below.
{% endhint %}

## Single-Image Download

When browsing images in the [**Image Gallery**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/image-gallery) of any page, you can quickly download an image by hovering your cursor over it. A **Download icon**  <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FDhsN8Ova8a1J0MvpsP8b%2FDownload%20-%20Dark%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=339fabeb-5409-45d6-b1b6-3abba85a68f5" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F9eO0r1aVyx0g2Ir1TRi2%2FDownload%20-%20Light%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=e3d2ac2d-edbe-4c39-8561-5dd736c9d34f" alt="" data-size="original"></picture>  will appear — click it to save the image directly to your device.

Alternatively, click the image to open it in **Image View**, then click the **Download** button in the **Details Panel**. The button is a **split button**: clicking the main area downloads the image immediately, while clicking the **arrow icon** on the right opens a **dropdown menu** with additional download options:

* **JPEG (70% quality)** – Available to all users. A compressed format offering smaller file sizes. The 70% quality setting may introduce minor compression artifacts, typically visible only at the pixel level and not noticeable during normal viewing.
* **PNG (100%)** – Available to **Basic Plan** users and higher. An uncompressed format that preserves the exact generated image, ensuring maximum visual quality with no compression artifacts.

## Multiple-Image Download

When viewing images in your Creations or in your Pinned, Public, or Private profile tabs, you can download multiple images in different ways:

1. Use the select tool in the upper right area:
2. Simply drag from an area outside the images to select the images you want to download.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FMT83FaB3HXxtjlwFDGmo%2FIdeogram-BatchDL-Dark.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=06aa994b-193f-4181-82f1-3f76c0a5be5a" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FOUq1ObJYrDpO5BMpRO5n%2FIdeogram-BatchDL-Light.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=abb6de37-a99f-48e8-92f1-287cd1e8c9a9" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>Select individual images or entire sets of four images (like shown above) by dragging.</p></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected some images, you can add or remove them as you wish. Selected images will have a red checkmark in the upper-left corner. A small box with options will appear at the bottom of the screen, allowing you to download all the selected images.

When you click the "Download" button, the selected images will start downloading as a single ZIP file. After decompression, all the images will be in PNG format if you have a Basic Plan or higher, or in JPEG format for Free Plan users.

You can also download all the images generated, not just the cover image, by clicking the grid/single view toggle button located to the left of the "Select" button. This will display all the images generated with a particular prompt, allowing you to download all of them at once, instead of just the cover image.

{% endhint %}

Click **Cancel subscription** at the top of the page to proceed with cancellation. You will be asked to confirm before you cancel.

When you cancel your Ideogram subscription, you will still retain access to the features and benefits of your plan until the end of your current billing period. **There are no refunds for any unused periods remaining on your subscription**. If you change your mind about cancelling, you can always renew your subscription later.

   * A confirmation prompt appears, asking you to type a specific word (e.g. “delete”) to confirm.
2. **Deletion process**
   * Once confirmed, the process may take a few minutes to start.
   * &#x20;<mark style="color:red;background-color:$danger;">**The deletion is permanent and irreversible**</mark>  — all your images (generated or uploaded), prompts, and history will be removed.
   * The full deletion process usually takes up to 48 hours, during which you cannot re-register with the same Google or Apple account.
3. **Effect on subscriptions**
   * Any active subscription linked to your Ideogram account will be canceled automatically. You will not be charged for any renewal payments in the future.
   * Any prepayments made for future periods, such as the remaining time on a monthly or annual subscription plan, are forfeit and non-refundable.
   * After account deletion, your subscription data cannot be restored. We are not able to transfer the subscription plan to another Ideogram account.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you delete your Ideogram account, all your generations, prompts, and user data will be deleted from Ideogram servers. Your previous generations will no longer be visible to other users.

Great for quickly locating content created by others on a particular subject or style. When clicking the icon, the entire navigation tab transforms into a text field where you can enter your search terms.

# Prompt Box

## Prompt Box Overview

The Prompt Bo**x** is the main area where you describe what you want to see in your generated image. It also gives you access to various settings that let you control the visual style, subject consistency, aspect ratio, colors, and more.

2. **Image Upload** – Lets you upload an image to use in these different situations:
   1. As a [Character](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/character-reference) or [Style](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference) reference, or to [Describe](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) the content of the uploaded image.
   2.

# Prompting Guide


# In a Nutshell

## Ideogram Prompting in a Nutshell

Want to quickly start prompting with Ideogram? Here are the basics you need to know.

***

## Use Natural Language Only

Ideogram understands plain, everyday language. No need to use weights, parameters, or technical syntax—just describe what you want as clearly as possible, the way you’d describe something to a person.

***

## Be Clear and Visually Grounded

The more your prompt describes things that can actually be seen—like shapes, colors, materials, lighting, and background—the better the AI can understand and render them.

Focus on:

* The main subject (who or what is it?)
* What it’s doing (pose or action)
* Where it is (setting or background)
* How it looks (style, color, emotion, lighting)

Example: *“A watercolor painting of a fox curled up in snow under a pine tree, with soft blue shadows and falling snowflakes.”*

***

## Use a Structure

You don’t need perfect grammar, but to get the best results, structure your prompt using a clear format. Section 3 walks you through each part, but here's the general idea:

* **Image summary**: A concise phrase describing the type of image
* **Main subject**: Who or what the image is about
* **Pose or action**: What the subject is doing
* **Secondary elements**: Anything else around the main subject
* **Setting & background**: Where it’s taking place
* **Lighting & atmosphere**: How the scene feels
* **Framing & composition**: Camera angle or layout (optional)

Here’s a complete structure that works well:

> *\[Image summary]. \[Main subject details], \[Pose or action], \[Secondary elements], \[Setting & Background], \[Lighting & Atmosphere], \[Framing & Composition]*

For example:

> *A watercolor painting of a girl flying a kite on a hill at sunset, wearing a red dress, wind blowing through her hair, with trees in the background and soft golden lighting.*

No need to use every part—keep it short when exploring, and add more parts/details when you need control.

***

## Main Ideas First

Ideogram tends to give slightly more importance to parts placed earlier in the prompt. This is where to write the subject.

***

## Generating Text in Images

If you want text in your image, describing it near the beginning of the prompt usually leads to better results with fewer errors than if it is near the end. Using quotes `“ ”` around the desired text also helps. Keep in mind that the longer and more complex the text, the more likely it is to produce errors.

***

## Visually Grounded vs. Abstract Prompts

* **Visually Grounded**: Clear, detailed prompts get you precise images (e.g., *“A smiling woman wearing sunglasses at the beach”*).
* **Abstract/Poetic**: Vague or symbolic prompts lead to creative, surprising images (e.g., *“The feeling of summer captured in a moment”*).

***

## Handle Negatives

* Don’t say *“no people,” “man without a beard,” “no background”* or *“without trees.”*
* Instead, say exactly what you want (*“empty street,” “clean-shaven man,” “a plain white background,” or “desert landscape”*).

***

## Be Specific, Detailed, But Not Overloaded

Ideogram generally performs best with prompts under approximately 150 words (around 200 tokens). If the prompt is longer, the AI may begin to misinterpret or ignore the content beyond that point.

***

## Try, Iterate, Tweak

If something looks off, tweak one thing at a time:

* Reword key phrases, try synonyms or analog concepts
* Emphasize or remove a detail
* Use a different style
* Change the aspect ratio to change framing

Prompting is a creative process—experiment, learn, and have fun.

***

## Use Creative Tools

* **Magic Prompt**: Enhances and expands your original prompt.
* **Reference Style**: Applies the visual style from an image (generated or uploaded) to the image you are generating.
* **Random Style**: Same as Reference Style but with a random image. Perfect for wild visual explorations.
* **Remix**: Adjust and tweaks existing images using similar or different prompts.

Combine all of these for surprising, creative outcomes.

# 1- What is Prompting

## Prompting? What's That Exactly?

Prompting is the process of providing a description or instruction to an AI model to generate a specific output. In the context of Ideogram, you write a textual description of the image you want to create, and the AI generates an image based on that description.

For example:

> *“A serene landscape with rolling hills under a starry night sky.”*

This prompt guides the AI to produce an image matching the described scene.

A good prompt can be short or detailed, precise or poetic, depending on your goals. You'll learn how to choose the best approach based on the type of image you want.

***

## Why Prompting Matters

Prompting is how you describe to a text-to-image AI exactly what you want to see. The words you choose directly influence the result—whether you're aiming for something precise or exploring a creative idea. A clear, well-structured prompt helps the AI produce accurate and visually appealing images.

This guide teaches you effective prompting techniques, balancing clarity and creativity to get the best results possible.

***

## Why Structure and Wording Matter

Text-to-image AI models like Ideogram don’t interpret meaning intuitively like people do. They follow your instructions literally and try to visually represent every word in your prompt. Because of this, your prompt’s wording and structure significantly affect image quality.

A clear prompt structure helps Ideogram:

* Understand the main subject clearly.
* Focus on important visual attributes.
* Separate foreground from background elements.
* Accurately apply artistic style, lighting, and atmosphere.

***

Prompting with Ideogram is both a skill and a creative process. Whether you’re aiming for a specific visual or simply exploring artistic ideas, writing clear, thoughtful prompts gives you more control over the results. As you’ve seen throughout this guide, even small changes in structure, wording, or strategy can make a big difference. With practice, experimentation, and the right tools, you’ll learn how to shape the AI’s output to better match your intent—or discover something unexpectedly brilliant along the way.

**Happy prompting!**

# 2- Prompting Fundamentals

This section covers the key concepts that will help you write effective prompts for Ideogram. Whether you're aiming to generate the exact image you have in mind or to explore more creative, open-ended interpretations, these fundamentals apply to both prompting styles.

## Prompting Uses Natural Language

Ideogram uses **plain natural language** to interpret prompts. There are **no hidden parameters, weights, or coded instructions** you can embed in the prompt—everything must be described the way you would say it to another person.

This means:

* You **can’t assign weights** to parts of a prompt (e.g., `::1` or `(important)`
* You **can’t use hex codes or RGB values** for colors (e.g., `#E4BC73` ). Describe them instead with ordinary words (e.g., *“deep red,” “pale blue,” “golden-yellow”*). You can still influence the color in the image to be generated with the **Color** function.
* You **can’t use technical flags or shortcuts** like `--ar` or `--v` or `--style`

**Positioning still matters**: things written earlier in the prompt tend to be given more importance. So place the most important subject or idea near the beginning whenever possible.

If you’re coming from other text-to-image tools, this may feel simpler—but that simplicity is also what makes Ideogram especially good at interpreting well-structured, natural descriptions.

**You can write your prompt in your preferred language**: Ideogram generally understands prompts in any language, but for the most reliable results—especially when including text—write in English. Non-Latin scripts (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic) often render incorrectly. Using Magic Prompt will automatically translate your prompt into English.

While short, tag-like prompts (such as *“a man in the forest, fire, dramatic, painting”*) may work in some cases, **Ideogram—especially version 2.0 and higher—responds better to natural, sentence-style prompting.** Full sentences or clearly structured phrases help the AI understand context, relationships, and composition more reliably. Writing your prompt the way you'd describe the image to another person generally produces better results. Ordinary grammar, punctuation, and descriptive flow help the model understand context, relationships, and visual intent more accurately.

***

## How Ideogram Interprets Prompts

When you write a prompt, Ideogram doesn’t guess what you mean like a person might—it tries to visually represent every word. It reads your words literally, and each one affects what appears in the image.

> *A tall man in a red coat walking through a snowy forest.*

Ideogram will try to include all of those elements: the height, the red coat, walking action, snow, and the forest.

The clearer and more specific your wording, the better chance the AI has of generating an image that matches what you imagined.

***

## The Importance of Visual Grounding

Visual grounding refers to including concrete, observable details in your prompts—such as colors, shapes, objects, and settings—that the AI can accurately render.

For example, instead of saying:

> *A beautiful scene.*

Provide specific details:

> *A sunset over the ocean with orange and pink hues reflecting on the water.*

This specificity helps the AI generate more accurate and visually coherent images.

Even when you’re being creative or poetic, including some visually grounded elements gives Ideogram a stronger base to work from.

***

## Prompt Length and Clarity

The length of your prompt affects how Ideogram interprets your request. Longer prompts can give you more control and precision, but only if they’re well structured. Short prompts, on the other hand, leave more room for artistic or unexpected outcomes.

Prompt adherence is influenced by the clarity and specificity of your prompt. Longer, well-structured prompts with detailed descriptions can guide Ideogram to produce images that closely match your vision. However, overly complex or ambiguous prompts may lead to unexpected results.

### When to Use a Short Prompt

Short prompts are useful when you want to explore creative or poetic ideas without strict control over the result. They often work best when paired with tools like Magic Prompt or Random Style.

* **Short and creative:**

  > *A woman drifting through a quiet dream, shapes and colors shifting gently around her.*

This kind of prompt leaves much up to the AI’s interpretation. You might get surreal, abstract, or symbolic results—great for inspiration or exploration.

### When to Use a Longer Prompt

Longer prompts help when you want to control multiple parts of the image: the subject, background, lighting, mood, or style. They’re ideal when you already have a specific result in mind.

* **Visually grounded and detailed:**

  > *A red fox standing beneath bright autumn trees, surrounded by golden leaves falling onto a quiet forest floor.*

This kind of prompt tells the AI exactly what to render, and how to stage the visual.

### Tips for Using Longer Prompts Effectively:

* Break the prompt into logical pieces: subject, details, background, atmosphere.
* Put the most important ideas near the beginning.
* Avoid packing in too many unrelated concepts—this can confuse the AI.

### About the number of words:

Ideogram supports prompts up to **approximately 150 – 160 words (around 200 tokens)**. Prompts longer than this may be ignored or generate less accurate results. Make every word count, and always lead with what matters most.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Prompt length isn’t tied to prompting style. You can write short or long prompts whether you're using visually grounded, abstract, or hybrid language.

* Use **short prompts** when you want looser interpretation, to spark creative exploration or want to use Magic Prompt.
* Use **longer prompts** when you want to guide specific elements like subject, background, style, or lighting.

Start simple, lead with what's most important, and build up detail only as needed.
{% endhint %}

***

## **Visually Grounded vs. Abstract Prompts**

Ideogram responds well to both visually grounded and abstract prompts—but not in the same way. The way you phrase your prompt has a major impact on the kind of image you get, and how closely it matches your intent.

### **Visually Grounded Prompts**

These prompts focus on what can literally be seen in the image: the subject, setting, lighting, style, colors, and composition. They’re best when you have a specific image in mind and want the AI to render it as clearly and accurately as possible.

> * *A stone lighthouse standing on a rocky cliff in heavy fog, its beam shining across calm gray waves at dusk.*
> * *A woman sitting in a dark room beside a table, reading a book under the warm glow of a single candle.*

Visually grounded prompts tend to produce **more consistent and accurate results**, **stronger prompt adherence**, and **better layout control**, especially when generating images that include text.

### **Abstract or Poetic Prompts**

These prompts use figurative language, emotion, or symbolism to guide the image in a more open-ended way. They’re ideal for **creative exploration**, **unexpected results**, or **evoking a feeling rather than a scene**.

> * *A lighthouse fading into the mist, its light barely reaching the waves as the sea swallows the horizon.*
> * *A woman reading by candlelight, her face half-shadowed, as time seems to pause around her.*

Ideogram handles abstract prompts surprisingly well—especially when they include **some visual or emotional anchors**. The results may be unpredictable, but often striking.

### **Hybrid Prompts**

You can also blend both approaches: use a clear visual structure with a poetic tone, or add symbolic elements to an otherwise grounded prompt. This lets you guide the AI while leaving room for interpretation.

> * *A watercolor of a ballerina mid-spin on a quiet stage—like a moment of silence captured in motion.*
> * *A detailed ink sketch of an old lighthouse on a cliff. The sea below vanishes into mist like a forgotten memory.*
> * *A portrait of a young woman in a red cloak, standing still. The forest behind her blurs into colors like wet paint on glass.*

This style is especially useful when:

* You want a **specific subject** but an open-ended or expressive background.
* You want **artistic interpretation** while keeping a core idea intact.
* You want to inspire **variation in mood or atmosphere** while locking down style or composition.

Use hybrid prompts when you want the best of both worlds: direction *and* discovery.

**Tip:**

* Use **visually grounded prompts** for accuracy and control
* Use **abstract prompts** for creativity and exploration
* Use **hybrid prompts** when you want something expressive but anchored

## Generating Text in Images

Ideogram excels at rendering text within images—especially for posters, logos, titles, labels, headers, and other designs that incorporate typograpy—making it a powerful tool for any project that combines visuals and words.

The way you phrase your prompt can influence how well Ideogram renders the text within an image. Below are a few natural-language examples that show how to include quoted text early in your prompt, while keeping the description visually grounded and realistic.

> * *On the wall behind the artist, the phrase “Inspire Daily” is painted in large brush strokes across a mural, at the back of a vibrant and creative studio.*
> * *A vintage poster design with the words “Ride Free” curving along the bottom in retro lettering, featuring a smiling woman on a bicycle on a countryside road.*
> * *A chalkboard sign outside the bakery reads “Fresh Bread Daily” in handwritten white letters, surrounded by loaves and pastries arranged on rustic wooden shelves.*

**To achieve the best results:**

* **Use Visually Grounded Prompts**: Clearly describe the text's appearance, placement, and style within the image.
* **Position Text Early in the Prompt**: Mention the desired text near the beginning of your prompt to get better results.
* **Enclose Text in Quotation Marks**: Use quotation marks to specify the exact text you want to appear in the image.
* **Break longer text into chunks.**\
  If you're trying to generate more than one line of text, it's often better to split the content into sections with specific visual placement:

  > *A restaurant sign with the title “La Pasta” at the top, and the phrase “Fresh handmade Italian dishes” written below.*

  This gives Ideogram clearer structure and lowers the risk of spelling errors.
* **Reduce visual complexity if possible.**\
  The more intricate the rest of the scene is—busy backgrounds, multiple subjects, fine textures—the harder it is for the AI to cleanly render text. Simple backgrounds and good contrast between text and its surroundings improve results.

That said, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

* **Text length matters.**\
  The longer the text you want to include, the higher the chance of spelling errors, distortions, or incomplete words. Think of it like taking a group photo: the more people in the shot, the greater the chance someone will blink. Short, punchy phrases work best.
* **Not suitable for layouts with full textual content**\
  Ideogram is not designed to generate complete, text-heavy documents—such as full restaurant menus, website mock-ups with all copy in place, or multi-paragraph flyers. It can create the overall design and insert titles or short blocks of text, but long passages should be added later in a graphic editor or page layout application.
* **Foreign language support is limited.**\
  While you can write prompts in your own language, Ideogram’s text rendering is most accurate in **English**. Other languages, especially those that don’t use the Latin alphabet (like Chinese, Arabic, or Cyrillic scripts), often produce unpredictable or unreadable results.

If precise, readable text is important to your design, consider using Ideogram to generate the visual concept and then add the text manually using graphic editing tools afterward.

# Text and Typography

One of the areas in which Ideogram excels is in the generation and integration of text into an image. Whether as an overlay (e.g. a meme), as a typographic design (e.g. a t-shirt design) or as an integral part of various image elements (e.g. the name of a bottle of perfume), it's easy to get good results, often on the very first try.

To do this, all you need to do is write your prompt using complete sentences and punctuation, and indicate the text to be written by putting it in quotation marks and describing the context.

Here's an example:

**Prompt**:\
\&#xNAN;*A poster on a wall with text that reads: "Everything you can imagine is real. – Pablo Picasso"*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FfO4lAMxbqFuRZtHZWAqv%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a8e1fa55-cf26-4463-a80b-b2af30b1d12c" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The AI generated the requested text on a poster, on a wall.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
In the image above, the AI has decided on the style and type of wall and poster that will be generated, as well as other visual aspects. Of course, you can describe these or any other elements you'd like to appear in the image yourself in the prompt, and the AI will generate them accordingly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For the time being, text that you would like to be written using a non-Latin alphabet or accented Latin characters may have some difficulty being generated correctly, if at all.
{% endhint %}

## Various types of text renderings

A few flying vehicles can be seen in the distance, adding to the bustling city atmosphere.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Fonts and copyrights

It is important to know that the Ideogram's AI doesn't use real fonts to generate images the same way you use font in your computer. To put it simply, the AI learns by looking at lots of different text images and how it looks and what are the actual styles. As it learns, it figures out how to make text that matches those different styles. So, when you ask it to make text, it uses what it's learned to make text that looks like it's from a specific style or font, even if it's not using that exact font.

## Errors and misspelled words or phrases.

Although Ideogram excels at generating text in images, an image can sometimes contain a spelling error, a missing or extra word or letter. Depending on the nature of the error, it is possible to correct the situation in various ways.

* Simply generate your prompt again a few times and see if you get the text you want.
* Change some of the longer, more complex words for shorter synonyms.
* Use the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor) to modify the text, adding or deleting parts and then remix the image.
* Use the Typographic [Style Tag](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models) with version 1.0 as it helps to achieve better results.
* Upload an image containing the desired text, which will serve as a starting point and composition source for the image to be created by remixing it.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's a well-known fact that long, complex words and long sentences are harder to generate correctly than short, everyday words. But don't despair, it can be done with patience, and it will get easier as the AI is updated and gets better.

It is often easier to remix an image to fix the image content itself while keeping the text right rather than trying to remix to fix the text while keeping the rest of the image.

# 3- Prompt Structure

## Why a Prompt Structure?

A prompt structure is simply the way you organize your words when asking the AI to create an image. It helps the AI understand exactly what you want to see, like what kind of image it should be, what’s in it, and how it should look or feel.

When your prompt is clearly structured, the AI has a much better chance of generating something that matches your idea. It’s like giving good directions—you don’t need to be an expert, but the more clearly you guide the AI, the better the results will reflect what you have in mind.

***

## The Different Parts of a Prompt

Each part of a prompt adds structure and clarity. A clear structure also helps with prompt adherence, making it more likely that Ideogram will follow your description accurately and generate results that reflect your intent.

Each part below includes three numbered examples. Each number represents a part of a different image prompt, which will later be assembled into full, complete prompts in section 3.2.

### **1- Image Summary**

**Purpose**: This is where the entire image is described in a single sentence. Think of it as how someone might describe the image after glancing at it for just two seconds. <mark style="color:blue;">**If you could only write one sentence for the prompt, this is the part you’d want to get right.**</mark> It also works well with tools like **Magic Prompt** to expand on. It establishes the visual form (e.g., photo, logo, painting), identifies the main subject, and gives a hint of the visual tone or context of the image.

**Examples**:

1. *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup.*
2. *A whimsical watercolor painting of a little girl playing with her bunny in a flower-filled field.*
3. *A logo design for a local football team called “Rhinos” in green, blue, and white.*

### **2- Main Subject Details**

**Purpose**: This part gives more information about the main subject in the image. What does it look like? What color is it? What shape, material or texture? Whether it’s a person, animal, or object, this section ensures that the subject is described clearly and specifically so the AI can generate it precisely. This is also the best place to include any text you want rendered in the image, such as titles, signs, or labels. For best results, enclose the exact wording in quotation marks `“ ”` and place it early in the prompt when possible. Describe where the text appears and how it looks to increase accuracy.

1. *The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass, a matte black cap, and silver lettering. The text “Nightlife for men” appears on the label in bold, modern font.*
2. *The girl has short brown hair, a yellow dress, and rosy cheeks. She holds a fluffy white bunny in her arms, and both are smiling.*
3. *The main graphic shows a strong, stylized rhino head viewed from a three-quarter angle, with sharp lines and a bold expression. The word “Rhinos” appears in large, blocky letters beneath the icon.*

### **3- Pose or Action**

**Purpose**: This section describes what the main subject is doing — or how it’s placed. If it’s a person, maybe they’re smiling or sitting. If it’s an object, is it standing upright or tilted? This adds life and personality to the image, even when it’s still.

1. *The bottle stands upright with a slight reflection on the surface below.*
2. *The bunny is leaning into her, with its ears flopping gently.*
3. *The rhino’s horn points slightly forward and up, adding a sense of motion.*

### **4- Secondary Elements**

**Purpose**: These are the smaller things around or near the main subject. They help tell the story, establish relationships or complete the scene, but they don’t steal the spotlight. Think of things like props, background objects, accessories, ambient visual details, or smaller characters that make the image feel fuller.

1. *A wristwatch and a pair of sunglasses sit nearby, adding a masculine vibe.*
2. *Wildflowers, butterflies, and a toy picnic basket surround them.*
3. *Stars and shield shapes accent the logo without crowding it.*

### **5- Setting & Background**

**Purpose**: This part explains where the image takes place. Is it outside or indoors? In a forest, a city, a room, or an empty space? You can also say if it’s daytime, sunset, or a certain time in history. Whether highly detailed or minimalistic, the background contributes to anchor the image in a coherent visual context.

1. *The scene is set on a smooth black surface with blurred city lights in the background.*
2. *They are outdoors in a grassy meadow, under a wide blue sky.*
3. *The background is flat white, with no scene or setting.*

### **6- Lighting & Atmosphere**

**Purpose**: This is about how the light looks and how the image feels. Is the light soft or bright? Is it warm and cozy, or dramatic and dark? Atmosphere includes mood-related descriptors like ethereal, cozy, ominous, cinematic, etc. This helps set the mood of the image and makes it feel more real or more emotional.

1. *Lighting is moody and cool, with soft blue highlights and deep shadows.*
2. *The light is soft and sunny, with warm pastel tones and a dreamy atmosphere.*
3. *The color palette is vivid, with deep blue outlines, white highlights, and green fills.*

### **7- Framing & Composition**

**Purpose**: This describes how the subject and elements are visually arranged within the frame. It can describe the camera or viewer angle (top-down, low angle), shot type (close-up, wide), and subject placement (centered, rule of thirds). For non-photographic works, it still applies—e.g., how a figure is balanced in a painting or how elements are spaced in a logo. It enhances clarity, focus, and aesthetics.

1. *The bottle is centered in the frame, captured at eye level.*
2. *The girl and bunny are slightly off-center, framed from a gentle downward angle.*
3. *The logo is center-aligned with a tight, symmetrical layout.*

### **8- Technical Enhancers**

**Purpose**: These are the extra details that make the image look more polished or professional. They don’t change the content, but they improve how it looks — like lens type, lighting effects, bokeh, brush textures, or rendering style. These are useful when you want a certain artistic finish.

1. *A shallow depth of field gives the image a polished, professional look.*
2. *The brush strokes are loose and textured, with light color bleeds that add charm and softness.*
3. *The lines are clean, the edges sharp, and the style is vector-based with a modern, sporty look.*

**It is not necessary to use all the parts described above**. For example, when prompting for a logo design, you might not need to add anything about any secondary elements. Your prompt can be short or detailed, depending on your goal. The more parts you include, the more control you’ll have — but sometimes, a short or abstract prompt is the best way to explore creative results.

Now that you’ve seen each part in isolation, let’s bring them together.

***

## Assembling the Parts

Here’s a basic prompt template that is making use of all the parts described above:

> *\[Image summary]. \[Main subject details], \[Pose or action], \[Secondary elements], \[Setting & Background], \[Lighting & Atmosphere], \[Framing & Composition], \[Technical enhancers]*

By combining all the example parts from the example in section 3.1 above, we can build the following three complete prompts:

1. > *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup. The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass, a matte black cap, and silver lettering. The text “Nightlife for men” appears on the label in bold, modern font. The bottle stands upright with a slight reflection on the surface below. A wristwatch and a pair of sunglasses sit nearby, adding a masculine vibe. The scene is set on a smooth black surface with blurred city lights in the background. Lighting is moody and cool, with soft blue highlights and deep shadows. The bottle is centered in the frame, captured at eye level. A shallow depth of field gives the image a polished, professional look.*
2. > *A whimsical watercolor painting of a little girl playing with her bunny in a flower-filled field. The girl has short brown hair, a yellow dress, and rosy cheeks. She holds a fluffy white bunny in her arms, and both are smiling. The bunny is leaning into her, with its ears flopping gently. Wildflowers, butterflies, and a toy picnic basket surround them. They are outdoors in a grassy meadow, under a wide blue sky. The light is soft and sunny, with warm pastel tones and a dreamy atmosphere. The girl and bunny are slightly off-center, framed from a gentle downward angle. The brush strokes are loose and textured, with light color bleeds that add charm and softness.*
3. > *A logo design for a local football team called “Rhinos” in green, blue, and white. The main graphic shows a strong, stylized rhino head viewed from a three-quarter angle, with sharp lines and a bold expression. The word “Rhinos” appears in large, blocky letters beneath the icon. The rhino’s horn points slightly forward and up, adding a sense of motion. Stars and shield shapes accent the logo without crowding it. The background is flat white, with no scene or setting. The color palette is vivid, with deep blue outlines, white highlights, and green fills. The logo is center-aligned with a tight, symmetrical layout. The lines are clean, the edges sharp, and the style is vector-based with a modern, sporty look.*

{% hint style="warning" %}

> **Note:** Ideogram supports prompts **up to roughly 150-160 words or about 200 tokens** depending on the vocabulary. Anything beyond that limit may be **less effective or ignored entirely** by the AI when generating the image. To avoid losing key details, make sure the most important parts of your prompt come near the beginning. The assembled examples above approach that upper limit and are designed to give the AI strong visual and stylistic guidance while staying concise and well-structured.

# 4- Handling Negatives

## Why Negative Phrasing Often Fails

Ideogram, like many text-to-image AIs, struggles with understanding negation. When you describe something in terms of what it shouldn't include, the AI often misinterprets or ignores the negation. Instead, it focuses on the keywords themselves. For example, prompting *“a man without a beard”* may result in an image of a man with a beard, as the AI emphasizes the word *“beard”* without processing the *“without”* modifier.

This issue arises because these models are trained to associate words with visual elements, but they don't inherently grasp the concept of absence or exclusion. Therefore, using negative terms like *“no,”* *“without,”* or *“not”* can lead to unintended results.

***

## Turn Negatives Into Positives

When people want to exclude something from the image, they usually write the prompt using negative concept and phrasing of what they don't want—*“no people,” “without clouds,” “not dark.”* That’s completely natural in everyday language, but it doesn’t work well with text-to-image AI like Ideogram.

Instead, try to shift your thinking: describe the *positive visual opposite* of the thing you want to exclude.

Ask yourself: *“If this thing wasn’t there, what would I see instead?”*

For example:

* Don't write *“no people in the room”* but write *“an empty room with chairs neatly arranged”*
* Avoid *“without hair”* and replace it by “a bald figure with smooth skin”
* Instead of *“a beach without people”* use *“an empty beach at sunrise”*
* Rather than *“a robot with no eyes”* try *“a robot with a smooth, featureless face”*
* Don't write *“no cars on the street”* but opt for *“a quiet pedestrian-only street”*

This might feel less intuitive at first, but it gets easier with practice and is far more effective. If you're unsure how to flip your idea into a positive phrase, turn on Magic Prompt—it will often converts the sentence to a positive phrase—or use a Large Language Models AI (LLM) like ChatGPT to suggest an affirmative rewrite.

# 5- Common Pitfalls and Fixes

Even with a good understanding of prompting, it’s easy to make small mistakes that lead to strange or disappointing results—especially when you're trying to get a very specific image from the AI. This section highlights some of the most common issues users run into when they want precise results and shows how to fix them with simple changes.

These tips are especially useful when you have a clear image in mind and want Ideogram to follow your descriptions closely. If you're prompting more for creative discovery or artistic exploration, some of these “mistakes” may actually lead to interesting results—so feel free to experiment.

## Vague Adjectives

**Issue:** Using non-specific descriptors like *“beautiful,” “interesting,” “nice”* or *“cool”* can lead to unpredictable outcomes, as the AI lacks a clear visual reference for these terms.

**Fix:** Replace vague adjectives with specific visual details.

> **Instead of:** *“A beautiful forest”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A dense forest with tall pine trees and soft rays of sunlight filtering through the branches”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“A beautiful dress.”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A red satin evening gown with intricate lace details.”*

***

## Generic Style Terms

**Issue:** Using broad style descriptors like “artistic” or “modern”—often seen at the beginning of the prompt to define the medium and style of the image—may not provide the AI with enough guidance to what kind of art you expect.

**Fix:** Specify the desired style using well-known art movements, techniques, or mediums.

> **Instead of:** *“a modern painting of a landscape”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “An impressionist painting of a rolling countryside with thick brushstrokes and pastel tones”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“an artistic photo of a dancer”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Try:** “A soft-focus photo of a ballet dancer mid-leap on a dimly lit stage”*

***

## Contradictory Descriptions

**Issue:** Writing conflicting information in a prompt can confuse the AI, leading to inconsistent or nonsensical images.

**Fix:** Ensure all elements of the prompt are coherent and compatible.

> **Instead of:** *“A minimalist sculpture with fine and intricate details”*\
> **Try:** *“A minimalist sculpture with smooth, simple geometric shapes in white marble”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Or:** “A detailed sculpture carved with delicate patterns and ornamental features, displayed on a minimal white pedestal”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“A clean, empty room cluttered with artifacts”*\
> **Try:** *“A clean, empty room with plain white walls and a single wooden chair”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Or:** “A room filled with ancient artifacts, displayed on simple white pedestals in a clean, open space”*

***

## Abstract Concepts Tied to a Subject

**Issue:** Prompts centered on abstract ideas without concrete visual elements can lead to a wide variety of results.

**Fix:** Anchor abstract concepts with tangible visuals.

> **Instead of:** *“A symbol of hope”*\
> **Try*****:** “A single flower blooming through a crack in the concrete”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“*&#x41; child caught in a moment of wonde&#x72;*”*\
> **Try*****:** “A child staring up at a night sky filled with stars, mouth slightly open in awe”*
>
> **Instead of:** *“An old man lost in regret”*\
> **Try*****:** “An old man sitting alone on a park bench, staring down at a faded photo in his hands”*

***

## Aspect Ratio Influence on Framing

Even with the exact same prompt, Ideogram may generate very different results depending on the aspect ratio you choose.

This is because the AI tries to fill the entire canvas based on the image it was trained with, and different aspect ratios naturally suggest different types of framing. For example:

A prompt like *“A woman walking on a busy city street sidewalk”*

* In **portrait (1:2)**, the result may show her full body from head to toe.
* In **landscape (2:1)**, the framing may shift closer—showing her from the waist up or knees up to fit the wider format.

If you're aiming for a specific composition—like a wide scenic view, a full-body portrait, or a tight close-up—it helps to:

* **Choose an aspect ratio** that matches your intent
* **Include clear framing cues** in your prompt, such as *“full-body,” “head and shoulders,” “wide establishing shot,”* and so on

However, even with a matching prompt and aspect ratio, the AI may still frame your subject differently than expected. For example:

* You might ask for a **full-body view** in landscape format, but the result shows only the upper body
* Or you might want a **close-up** in portrait format, but the AI includes the full body anyway

To guide the framing more precisely, here are two simple strategies that work in both cases:

1. **Include visual elements that hint at how much of the subject should be shown**
   * For **full-body results**, describe things near the feet—like shoes, sidewalk texture, shadows, or puddles
   * For **close-ups**, focus only on upper-body features—like eyes, lips, hands, or shoulders
2. **Adjust the focus of the prompt**
   * For wider framing, make the **environment** the main subject (e.g., *“a crowded city sidewalk”*) and describe the person as a key detail within it
   * For tighter framing, keep the **person** as the main subject and avoid describing large-scale surroundings that suggest a wide shot

These small changes help steer the AI toward the type of framing that fits your goal—whether it’s a full scene or a focused portrait. Combining descriptive language with the right aspect ratio gives you much better control over what appears in the final image.

***

In conclusion, learning to spot these small issues—and knowing how to fix them—can make a big difference in how well your prompt is understood. With just a few adjustments, you'll start getting images that feel a lot closer to what you had in mind.

In the next section, you’ll see how to iterate and refine your prompt step by step.

# Importance of Precision

Ideogram, particularly sensitive to how your prompt is constructed, the words you use, the semantics and punctuation. Here, we will cover some few tips to get the most out of your prompts and generate the best possible results.

## Precision to avoid confusion

In your prompt, if you write: “*<mark style="color:green;">A painting of a cat.</mark>*” you will probably get something painterly. But being precise might get you better results.

As you can see, precision determines the kind of painting you want. The same applies to just about everything you want to put in your prompt. The more precise you are, the more likely you are to generate the image you want.

See how Ideogram can adhere to what you describe in your prompt, often with great precision. Of course, there are times when Ideogram can't seem to generate exactly what you describe in your message. The following section may be able to provide you with some help.

## Avoid contradictions

In this example we will see how a simple notion or a simple word may affect the image being generated.

Here we want a photographic portrait of a young boy, from the waist up. We also want to describe as many elements and other aspects as possible.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FO1nzQUBjrO5bMIPqhoLT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c14417e0-a93c-4e6d-9fe1-d9b9c05b1a7d" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Portrait photo of a young boy blond boy, with blue eyes, wearing headphones, a deep red hoodie and jeans, and red sneakers, in front of a music store.</em></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FD2Hj2E781uUC10ZXlawh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bade4418-49cf-418a-88bd-65fe833a53de" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Portrait photo of a young boy blond boy, with blue eyes, wearing headphones, a deep red hoodie and jeans, </em><del><em><mark style="color:purple;">and red sneakers</mark></em></del><em>, in front of a music store.</em></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FVGxkS4jXkGJsqcVjVYLf%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7701f75a-4353-49c1-9f80-fbfb60d761dc" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p><em>Portrait photo of a young boy blond boy, with blue eyes, wearing headphones, a deep red hoodie </em><del><em><mark style="color:purple;">and jeans, and red sneakers</mark></em></del><em>, in front of a music store.</em></p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Can you see the difference? If you describe something, the AI will **always** try to show it to you, even if you've specifically asked for a certain style that usually prevent you from seeing it. By simply removing some unnecessary descriptions, we were able to get exactly what we wanted.

## Gradation and relative sizes

Huge, big, normal, small, minuscule… Using the right qualifier to describe the importance of an element in an image is a simple way of defining an order of proportion. Let's look at an example:

**Prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A striking and vivid magazine cover, featuring an anthropomorphic cat exuding wealth and success sitting on an armchair, a paws on each arm. The cat is dressed in a tailored suit and dark sunglasses, striking a confident pose in an opulent living room. The huge magazine modern title in sans-serif font of "Cat Life" dominates the cover, a smaller mention "magazine" just under it on the right side, while the big headline "How I Make Them Clean the Litter Box Every Day" piques the reader's curiosity. The second smaller headline read: "The full story". The dynamic lighting enhances Mr. Whiskers' regal presence, making this a truly unique and memorable cover.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FHWjSeIUXTFCUatLwaINA%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=628f1c4c-72ad-40cf-90d2-90378086294e" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The simple way of describing the relative sizes for each text element was sufficient to produce an expected result.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the complexity of the text and visual composition, this image needed more than one attempt to get it done like this.
{% endhint %}


# 6- Prompt Iteration and Refinement

Even with a well-structured prompt, the first image you generate might not be exactly what you envisioned. That's perfectly normal. Refining your prompt through small, thoughtful changes can help you get closer to your desired result.

This section covers practical strategies for adjusting and improving your prompts to achieve better outcomes.

***

## Why Iterate?

Each prompt you write is a starting point. If the result isn't quite right—maybe the composition feels off, or the subject isn't clear—making small adjustments can lead to significant improvements. Iteration helps you fine-tune your prompt to guide the AI more effectively.

***

## The One-Change Rule

When refining your prompt, it's helpful to change only one thing at a time. This approach allows you to see how each specific change affects the outcome, making it easier to understand what works and what doesn't.

> **Original:**\
> \&#xNAN;*“A black cat sitting on a windowsill during a storm”*\
> **Possible changes:**\
> 1\. *“A black cat sitting on a windowsill during a **light drizzle**”*\
> 2\. *“A black **dog** sitting on a windowsill during a light drizzle”*\
> \&#xNAN;*3. “A black dog sitting on a **porch** during a light drizzle”*

By altering just the nature of the storm, you can observe how this single change impacts the image.

***

## Prompt Chaining (Progressive Detailing)

Start with a simple prompt and gradually add more details in subsequent iterations. This method helps you build complexity step by step, ensuring each addition enhances the image without overwhelming it.

> **Step 1:** *“A medieval castle”*\
> **Step 2:** *“A medieval castle on a hilltop”*\*\
> **Step 3:** *“A medieval castle on a hilltop at sunset”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Step 4:** “A medieval castle on a hilltop at sunset with a dragon flying overhead”*

Each step adds a new element, allowing you to monitor how the image evolves.

***

## Try Alternate Wording

Sometimes a specific word or phrase just doesn't produce the result you're looking for. When that happens, try swapping it with a synonym, rephrasing the idea in a different way, or using a slightly different expression. Even a small change in wording can lead to very different outcomes—especially if the new term is more visually recognizable to the AI.

> **Instead of** “*lush jungle*”, **try** “*dense rainforest*” **or** “*tropical forest*”\
> **Instead of** “*futuristic city*”, **try** “*sci-fi metropolis*” **or** “*neon cyberpunk skyline*”\
> **Instead of** “*sad expression*”, **try** “*a face with downturned eyes and a slight frown*”

If something isn’t working right, it doesn’t mean your idea is wrong—just that the phrasing might need a small nudge.

A quick thesaurus search—or even asking a language model—can help you find wording that triggers the look you really want. Keep experimenting, one small change at a time, and you’ll quickly discover what works best.

***

## Emphasize Important Parts of the Image

Sometimes the AI might generate your image correctly in general, but miss something that feels too small, unbalanced, or visually incorrect. In these cases, two small techniques can make a big difference: **repetition** and **description for emphasis**.

### **Repeat Key Elements**

You can repeat the same element in different parts of the prompt to reinforce its importance. This doesn’t mean saying the exact same thing twice, but rather **referencing the same subject in multiple ways**.

> *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup. The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass… The bottle stands upright… The bottle is centered in the frame…*

By mentioning the bottle multiple times — in the summary, the details, and the framing — the AI is more likely to understand it’s the focal point and treat it with more visual weight.

### **Add Extra Description to Reinforce Details**

If the AI keeps omitting or downplaying something important, try **describing it more fully**:

* Add more visual detail about size, color, texture, or placement
* Mention it in different parts of the prompt (e.g., summary and composition)
* Reinforce its relationship to the rest of the image

For example, if the shoes of a person are missing or awkward, adding *“wearing black leather boots that cast a shadow on the sidewalk”* gives the AI both a visual anchor and spatial context.

These two techniques are especially helpful when:

* The AI misplaces or forgets a key detail
* You’re generating a busy or layered scene
* You want to draw focus to a specific object or subject

Use them as subtle tools to guide the AI’s attention — without needing to rewrite the entire prompt.


# 7- Creative Tools in Ideogram

Ideogram comes with several built‑in helpers that can *shift* or *amplify* whatever your prompt says. Think of them as “prompt modifiers.” They don’t replace good wording, but they can change the direction, polish, or diversity of the result.

Below is what each tool *does* to your prompt or image—and when to reach for it. (Full button locations and step‑by‑step instructions live in the official docs.)

***

## Describe – “Image to Prompt”

* **What it does**: Reads an existing image (uploaded or generated) and writes a fresh prompt that would recreate something similar.
* **Why use it**:
  * Kick‑start a new idea when you don’t know how to word it.
  * Borrow phrasing tricks from images whose style you like.
* **Best practice**: Treat the generated text as a *draft*. Edit details, reorder parts, or shorten it before re‑using.

Describe documentation link to come.

***

## Magic Prompt

* **What it does**: Expands or beautifies your text with an on‑device LLM. Short prompts grow; long prompts change only slightly.
* **Why use it**:
  * Add richer adjectives, lighting cues, or stylistic hints automatically.
  * Translate your ideas from any language into well‑formed English if desired.
* **Best practice**:
  * Short, exploratory prompt? Let Magic Prompt run wild.
  * Highly detailed prompt? Expect tiny tweaks—review to be sure it hasn’t added unwanted elements.
* **Examples**:

  > **Short prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*Photo of a cat sitting, gazing outside at the falling snow.*
  >
  > **Magic Prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*A cozy, warm photograph of a fluffy Persian cat sitting on a window sill, gazing intently at the falling snow. The cat has long, luxurious white fur, bright emerald-green eyes, and a slightly flattened face, creating a charming and endearing expression. Outside the window, large snowflakes gently drift down, partially obscuring a blurred landscape of snow-covered trees and rooftops. Soft, diffused light illuminates the cat’s fur from within, casting a gentle glow on its face and creating a peaceful, tranquil atmosphere.*

  > **Long prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*A cozy indoor photo of a black-and-white cat sitting peacefully on a wooden windowsill. The cat has thick, fluffy fur and green eyes, looking outside with a calm expression. Snow is falling gently outside the window, creating a soft wintery backdrop. A leafy houseplant in a terracotta pot sits nearby, and light condensation covers the lower edge of the glass. The scene is lit by natural morning light, with soft shadows and a warm, quiet atmosphere. The cat is centered in the frame, captured at eye level, and the background is slightly blurred to focus attention on the subject.*
  >
  > **Magic Prompt**:\
  > \&#xNAN;*A serene, soft-focus photograph of a black-and-white cat perched gracefully on a weathered wooden windowsill, its thick, fluffy fur contrasting with the aged wood. The cat's bright green eyes gaze thoughtfully outwards, reflecting the gentle snowfall beyond the windowpane with a calm, almost contemplative expression. Outside, delicate snowflakes drift past a frosted window, while inside, a vibrant fiddle-leaf fig in a terracotta pot provides a splash of life near a softly blurred stack of antique books. Natural morning light illuminates the scene, creating a cozy and quiet atmosphere with subtle shadows and a delicate layer of condensation on the lower edge of the glass.*

## Random Style & Reference Style

* **Reference Style**: Lets you supply an image (uploaded or existing Ideogram output) whose *look* guides the next image.
* **Random Style**: Injects an unpredictable and random image as a reference style before generation—ideal for visual experimentation.

**Why use them:**

* **Random Style** pushes a familiar prompt into new artistic territory—great for concept discovery.
* **Reference Style** anchors colours, textures, or composition to a source image—useful when you want variation without losing a core aesthetic.\\

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro tip**: Combine a **short prompt** + **Magic Prompt** + **Random Style** and get ready to explore a variety of wild images and possibilities.
{% endhint %}

Random/Reference style documentation links to come.

***

## Remix

* **What it does**: Use an existing image (uploaded or generated) as a parent image for the AI to regenerate while re‑using the prompt and other settings to make small or big changes.
* **Why use it**:
  * Fix small flaws without re‑writing the entire prompt.
  * Try minor lighting, color, or pose changes but keep overall composition.
* **Best practice**:
  1. Identify what you like in the current image.
  2. Change one phrase in the prompt (see Section 6).
  3. Hit Remix to preview the tweak side‑by‑side.

# Using Magic Prompt

The [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) feature in Ideogram can be very helpful to provide additional content, details, ambiance and stylistic information in a prompt. The more basic is the prompt, the more Magic Prompt will add to it.

{% hint style="info" %}
To find out more about the Magic Prompt function and familiarize yourself with it, you can also visit the section linked below.

[magic-prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt "mention")
{% endhint %}

## From basic to magic

Let's use a simple prompt and used it to explore what the Magic Prompt would come up with.&#x20;

**Original prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with a dog in a park.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FY2OJrRjzddvghl0xvPaj%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=80b2d47f-7ca6-4add-99c3-e82d47068bb5" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When used, the Magic Prompt function generates a new, improved and embellished prompt based on your original prompt, then sends it to the AI to generate an image based on this new prompt. Here are two examples:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FsMw3lFRvS5KFaRamk80h%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1fed4da9-3d06-4fbc-a13b-fcf301c44942" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Magic Prompt:</strong><br><em>A heartwarming scene of a young boy playing with his happy, wagging dog in a lush, green park. The boy has a playful smile on his face while he tosses a bright yellow ball for his furry friend to fetch. The park is filled with beautiful flowers and trees, creating a serene atmosphere for this bonding moment between boy and dog.</em></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaQnexqjZEsz99w4OrYxT%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eb3462c1-01d3-4545-ad9a-cf5934993dff" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Magic Prompt:</strong><br><em>A charming image of a young boy playing with a cute, wagging-tail dog in a lush green park. The boy's joyful smile and the dog's playful eyes convey a sense of happiness and connection. The park is full of colorful flowers and trees, with a sunny sky overhead. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and uplifting.</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Even if there is no mention of any style in the original prompt or in the Magic Prompts, the AI decided to generate the images in styles that seemed appropriate for the text.
{% endhint %}

## Styles with Magic Prompt

The Magic Prompt also allows you to illustrate and explain in greater detail a basic style that you can request in your prompt. Here an example:

**Original prompt:**\
\&#xNAN;*A boy with a dog in a park, <mark style="color:green;">abstract art</mark>.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8mKyTHOZ040Fkdbc48N7%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2c412387-4f5c-4eb5-a7a1-b46573df89a0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The boy is holding a ball, and the dog is running with a playful expression. The park is full of vibrant colors, with trees, flowers, and a winding path. The overall atmosphere of the painting is lively and joyful.</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fpz0NTCnunCck2VW0C1wP%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0853be95-4f97-4374-98c2-2418f8876695" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Magic Prompt:</strong><br><em>A vibrant abstract painting of a boy playing with a dog in a lush park.

The overall art piece exudes a joyful and playful atmosphere.</em></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

As you can see, the Magic Prompt has expanded on the original prompt while expanding and refining certain aspects of the requested style. Each proposal gave a relatively different image, while remaining within the parameters of the original prompt.

## Magic Prompt for inspiration

We all suffer from a lack of inspiration, the so-called blank page syndrome. To help you get started and stimulate your creativity, there's nothing like using the Magic Prompt. Let's look at a few examples.

**Original prompt:**\

# 8- Troubleshooting

##

Even with a well-structured prompt, the AI may not always interpret your intent exactly as expected. This section highlights common issues that can occur while prompting, along with practical fixes and links to relevant sections of the guide where you can learn more.

<details>

<summary>The AI adds something I specifically said I didn’t want.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Prompt uses negative phrasing (e.g., “*no hair*,” “*no people*”).
* AI fails to process negation and focuses on the mentioned object instead.
* The unwanted object or concept is inadvertently suggested elsewhere in the prompt.
* Use of Magic Prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Rewrite using **affirmative descriptions** (e.g., “*bald*” or “*empty city*”).
* Use **visual substitution** to describe what *is* present instead of what isn’t.
* Double check you prompt for possible contradiction, even subtle.
* Turn Magic Prompt off.

→ **See:** [Handling Negatives](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/4-handling-negatives), [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/7-creative-tools-in-ideogram#magic-prompt)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Text appears broken, misspelled, or missing.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Text isn’t properly indicated in prompt.
* Text placed too late in the prompt.
* Too much or too complex text.
* Text in foreign language or non-Latin characters.
* Conflicts with visual complexity.

**Fixes:**

* Put the text in **quotes** (e.g., *a sign that says “Open 24 Hours”*).
* Place the text early in the prompt.
* Limit the amount of generated text.
* Break long text into chunks with placement cues.
* Use **Magic Fill** to correct errors after generation.
* For long copy, add it later in a third party editor.

→ **See:** [Generating Text in Images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#generating-text-in-images)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Facial features, hands, or limbs look distorted (especially from a distance).</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Subject appears too small or far away in the frame for the AI to render detail properly.
* Low emphasis on face or limbs in the prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Move the subject closer by adjusting framing (“*close-up*,” “*portrait*”).
* Emphasize details explicitly (e.g., hands, eyes, facial features).
* Fix imperfections afterward using **Magic Fill**, recommended if you like the image.

*\*This isn't really a problem of wording or style, but rather the fact that most AIs struggle to handle fine detail at a distance, partly because of the lack of available pixels the AI has to work with.* [*Magic Fill*](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) *can help fixing this as it can work with greater pixel density over small areas.*

</details>

<details>

<summary>The subject is cropped when it should be shown fully (or vice versa).</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Aspect ratio doesn't match intended framing.
* The aspect ratio isn't commonly used for that type of image.
* Insufficient framing cues in prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Explicitly include framing cues like “full body,” “head and shoulders,” or “wide view.”
* Describe elements near the cropped area (feet, shoes, ground) to encourage full framing.
* Adjust the **aspect ratio** to better fit your subject and match intended composition.

→ **See:** [Aspect Ratio Influence on Framing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/5-common-pitfalls-and-fixes#aspect-ratio-influence-on-framing)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Important words or concepts are not visually present in the image.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Important ideas are too abstract, ambiguous, or visually unclear.
* Terms used are not visually grounded enough.

**Fixes:**

* Use alternate, more visually concrete wording or synonyms.
* Add more explicit visual cues or repetition of terms.

→ **See:** [Try Alternate Wording](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/6-prompt-iteration-and-refinement#try-alternate-wording), [Emphasize Important Parts of the Image](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/6-prompt-iteration-and-refinement#emphasize-important-parts-of-the-image)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Unwanted object, person or text appears in the image.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Vague or overloaded prompt.
* Ambiguous language indirectly suggesting extra items.
* Uses of Magic Prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Simplify or clarify your prompt to remove ambiguity.
* Emphasize the desired subject and exclude unnecessary ideas.
* Use visual substitution (e.g., “empty field” instead of “no one around”).
* Turn off Magic Prompt.

→ **See:** [Prompt Length and Clarity](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#prompt-length-and-clarity), [Handling Negatives](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/4-handling-negatives), [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/7-creative-tools-in-ideogram#magic-prompt)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Non-English or non-Latin text is incorrect or unreadable.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* AI has limitations rendering non-Latin alphabets (Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese).

**Fixes:**

* Use English for best text rendering.
* Add add non-Latin text manually afterward (if necessary).
* Keep non-Latin text very short (logo-length).

→ **See:** [Prompting Uses Natural Language](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#prompting-uses-natural-language), [Generating Text in Images](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/2-prompting-fundamentals#generating-text-in-images)

</details>

<details>

<summary>A phrase isn’t giving the result I expected.</summary>

**Possible Causes:**

* Wording is too vague or abstract.
* Phrase not visually grounded.
* Uses of Magic Prompt.

**Fixes:**

* Use more **visually grounded** synonyms or phrasing.

**Androgynous / Gender-Neutral**\
Androgynous figure, gender-neutral body, flat chest, minimal curves, straight waist, soft features, unisex appearance, balanced proportions.


# Memory Colors for Naming Color Nuances

When describing colors in a prompt, using specific, visually grounded references is much more effective than generic terms like “red” or “green.” Since Ideogram doesn’t understand numerical color codes (like RGB or hex) in prompts yet, using familiar, real-world references — often called *memory colors* — helps convey a more accurate color nuance. These references evoke a mental image based on shared visual experience, such as “cherry red” or “sky blue.”

The list below groups memory-based color terms by base color. Each one can help you fine-tune your prompt and get closer to the exact hue you’re aiming for.

**🔴 Red**\
Apple, cherry, cranberry, blood, scarlet, ruby, wine, burgundy, brick, rose, garnet, fire engine, tomato, coral, blush, pomegranate, strawberry, chili, paprika, beet, firelight, jam, sangria, red velvet, ember

**🟠 Orange**\
Pumpkin, tangerine, apricot, rust, amber, carrot, marmalade, clay, copper, burnt orange, squash, paprika, cantaloupe, butternut, saffron, cheddar, flame, tiger, persimmon, ginger, ochre

**🟡 Yellow**\

**🌈 Multicolored / Iridescent**\
Oil slick, holographic, rainbow, opal, abalone, prism, pearlized, shimmer, aurora, peacock feather, soap bubble, CD surface, crystal sheen, beetle shell, starlight, dragonfly wing

#### Descriptive Modifiers for Color

To further refine the color you're describing, you can combine memory-based color terms with descriptive modifiers. These help define the **intensity**, **temperature**, **finish**, or **lighting** of the color — allowing for more control and expressiveness in your prompts.

Here are common categories and examples of useful modifiers:

* **Intensity or Brightness**\
  Pale, light, soft, faint, pastel, bright, deep, vivid, bold, dark, muted, rich, intense
* **Warmth and Temperature**\
  Warm, cool, neutral, icy, frosted, fiery, dusky, earthy
* **Finish or Surface Quality**\
  Glossy, matte, metallic, shimmering, iridescent, pearlescent, velvet-like, translucent, silky, powdery
* **Light and Shadow Modifiers**\
  Sunlit, shadowed, backlit, faded, dimmed, glowing, reflective, foggy, moonlit

**Examples**\
You can combine these with memory-based color terms for added clarity and control:

> * *Powdery sky blue*
> * *Rich cherry red*
> * *Frosted mint green*
> * *Dusky rose pink*
> * *Shimmering sapphire blue*
> * *Matte ivory white*


# Angle of View and Perspective

In image generation, the angle from which a scene or subject is viewed can dramatically affect the composition, storytelling, and overall feel of the result. This appendix outlines a variety of useful terms for describing point of view — both for the scene as a whole, and for individual people, animals, or objects within it.

#### 📸 Scene-Level Perspective (Camera-to-Environment Angle)

These terms describe how the viewer is positioned relative to the entire scene or environment.

* **Bird’s-eye view** — looking down from high above (also: aerial view, top-down perspective)
* **Worm’s-eye view** — looking up from ground level (also: low-ground view)
* **Overhead view** — directly above the subject (similar to: bird’s-eye, top-down)
* **Aerial view** — wide view from a high altitude (drone-style)
* **Isometric view** — angled top-down with parallel lines and no distortion (also: game map view, simulated 3D)
* **Wide-angle view** — expansive field of vision (also: cinematic wide shot, landscape framing)
* **Establishing shot** — broad scene-setting view (also: intro frame, scene overview)
* **Panoramic view** — ultra-wide horizontal framing (also: 360° view, landscape sweep)
* **Side view** — looking across from the left or right (also: lateral view, profile of the scene)
* **Tilted angle (Dutch angle)** — slanted horizon (also: skewed angle, off-kilter frame)
* **Point of view (POV)** — from a character’s visual perspective (also: first-person view)
* **Over-the-shoulder** — behind a subject, viewing what they see (also: behind POV)
* **Distant view** — subject seen from afar (also: far-shot, wide establishing)

#### 👁️ Subject-Level Perspective (Viewing a Person, Animal, or Object)

These terms describe how the subject itself is being viewed or framed in the composition.

* **Front view** — directly facing the subject (also: straight-on view)
* **Side profile** — side of the face or body (also: profile view, lateral angle)
* **Back view** — viewing the subject from behind (also: rear angle)
* **Three-quarter view** — angled between front and side (also: partial side view)
* **Close-up** — tightly framed (also: portrait crop, detail view)
* **Extreme close-up** — single facial feature or small detail (e.g., just eyes, lips, hand)
* **Full-body shot** — head to toe (also: wide crop of the subject)
* **Headshot** — upper torso and face (also: bust shot, portrait frame)
* **Low angle** — looking up (also: heroic angle, upward shot)
* **High angle** — looking down (also: downward shot, overhead crop)
* **Eye-level** — neutral, straight-on framing (also: natural perspective)
* **Overhead angle** — directly above the subject (like from a drone or ceiling)
* **Underside view** — from beneath the subject (also: under-angle, worm’s/ant's perspective)
* **Behind-the-subject** — subject turned away (also: back-facing composition)
* **Obscured or cropped view** — subject partially hidden or off-frame (also: partial view)

You can combine these terms with emotional cues, lens types, or action words for even more control.\
For example:

> * *Aerial view of a foggy village*
> * *Over-the-shoulder shot of a warrior facing the horizon*
> * *Three-quarter close-up of a woman smiling*
> * *Low-angle view of a tree glowing in moonlight*
> * *Full-body front view of a seated child*

#### Be Careful With Conflicting Perspective Elements

When using angle or point-of-view terms in your prompts, make sure the other details you describe make sense from that same viewpoint. Since the AI tries to include everything you mention, asking for something that wouldn’t normally be visible from a specific angle can confuse it — and may cause the model to ignore the perspective altogether.

**Examples of possible contradictions:**

> * *A top-down bird’s-eye view of a city \[…] the sky is filled with fluffy white clouds.*
> * *A rear view of a man walking away \[…] he is smiling at the camera.*
> * *An extreme close-up of a woman’s face \[…] she is wearing a knee-length red dress.*


# Describing Age and Life Stage

When prompting for people, describing age clearly can shape the outcome just as much as physical features or clothing. However, many AIs don’t reliably interpret numeric ages (e.g., “a 7-year-old girl”) with visual accuracy. Instead of specifying numbers, it’s more effective to use descriptive, life stage–based terms. This appendix breaks those terms into two parts per group: age terms and modifiers to help communicate the age and physical traits more accurately.

You can mix and match across each category for more controlled image generation.

#### **Infant (0–1)**

* **Age Terms**\
  Newborn, baby, infant
* **Modifiers**\
  Chubby, swaddled, soft-cheeked, sleeping, wide-eyed, tiny limbs, smooth skin, round cheeks

#### **Toddler (1–3)**

* **Age Terms**\
  Toddler, young toddler, early walker
* **Modifiers**\
  Baby-faced, wobbling, curly-haired, pudgy, chubby cheeks, short limbs, clumsy

#### **Young Adult (18–25)**

* **Age Terms**\
  Young adult, college-aged adult, late teen, youthful adult, stylish young man/woman
* **Modifiers**\
  Fresh-faced, smooth-skinned, subtly mature, vibrant, minimal wrinkles, soft features

#### **Adult (26–39)**

* **Age Terms**\
  Adult, early 30s adult, adult in their prime, mature young man/woman

  Refined features, confident, glowing skin, strong jawline, well-groomed, composed, healthy appearance, mature presence

#### **Middle-Aged (40–59)**

* **Age Terms**\
  Middle-aged adult, mature adult, adult in their 40s or 50s

* **Age Terms**\
  Elder, aged elder, very old person
* **Modifiers**\
  Frail, thin white hair, deeply wrinkled, slow-moving, hunched posture, fragile yet dignified, timeless expression

#### Age Modifiers by Life Stage

These descriptive modifiers can enhance the emotional tone, physical appearance, or personality of a character based on their age group. While some are flexible, most are naturally suited to a specific stage of life.

* **Youth-Oriented Modifiers:**\
  Youthful, baby-faced, radiant with youth, fresh-faced, full of life, soft-featured, innocent-looking
* **Neutral or Crossover Modifiers:**\
  Mature presence, confident, refined, composed, healthy-looking, well-groomed, graceful
* **Age-Related or Elder-Oriented Modifiers:**\
  Aging gracefully, time-worn, dignified aging, weathered by time, wise-looking, timeless beauty, deeply lined, gentle presence

# Available Models

When generating images with Ideogram, you can choose between different *model versions*. Each version offers distinct characteristics that determine image quality, style fidelity, and performance.

Your selected model affects how Ideogram interprets your prompt, the level of detail in the output, and the consistency across generations.

To select a model:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to expand it (if not already expanded) and display the generation settings.
2. Select **Model + variations** (displayed as the actual model and number of images, for example, **3.0 Default x 4**)  to open the dropdown menu.
3. Choose the **Model**, **Number of images** (1–4), and [Render speed](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed).

# Color Palette

Available to all users, the Color Palette setting lets you guide the overall color tone of your image generations. It’s best used as a creative direction tool rather than for precise color matching. When combined with descriptive color terms in your prompt, Color Palette produces more consistent and visually cohesive results.

To access the Color Palette menu:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to expand it (if not already expanded) and display the generation settings.
2. Select **Color** (or the already used color palette thumbnail), to open the **Color palette** menu.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Color Palette option is hidden when a **Character Reference** is active. If you previously selected a palette, it’s temporarily disabled and automatically restored once the Character Reference is removed.
{% endhint %}

Once selected, the chosen palette replaces the text label of the **Color** button, showing the active palette.

## Examples

The following examples show how different color palettes can influence the tone and color expression of generated images.

## Creativity and Experimentation

Using Color Palette not only refines the overall color tone but also influences the composition and atmosphere of the generated image. It encourages experimentation and creative exploration.

# Magic Prompt

Magic Prompt helps you craft better prompts effortlessly. It uses Ideogram’s built-in language model to interpret, refine, or expand your text to increase variety and visual quality in the generated images. You can also write in your native language — Magic Prompt translates and enhances it for you.

## Magic Prompt Options

To access the Magic Prompt options:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to reveal the generation settings (if not already visible).
2. Select **Magic Prompt** (displayed as the selected option such as <kbd>**Auto**</kbd>) to open the dropdown menu.

### Magic Prompt Modes

* **Auto** — Lets Ideogram decide how many images use enhanced prompts based on the length of your original prompt.
* **On** — Applies the enhanced prompt to all four generated images.
* **Off** — Uses your original prompt without any modification.

***

## Examples

Here are a few examples of Magic Prompt in action, showing the enhanced prompts and resulting images.

### Example 1 — Cat and Beach Ball

> **Original Prompt:**&#x20;
>
> *A cat on the right side of a beach ball on a sunny beach.*

#### With Magic Prompt Off:

With Magic Prompt set to **Off**, Ideogram generated four images that follow the instructions from your original prompt.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fqwq1jbLVksOgYAarolPu%2FOFF%20images.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=37b42cd8-a10f-46cf-8f63-617c52156fcb" alt="Images generated with Magic Prompt set to Off, using the original prompt."><figcaption><p>With Magic Prompt set to Off, your original prompt is used without modification.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### With Magic Prompt On

In this example, Magic Prompt generated an enhanced version of the prompt, adding common beach elements and introducing artistic and playful details

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fw0gpByPrFQAeiKb4OMmm%2F2024-04-11_06-03-46.033.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e3837209-5284-4abe-81e6-fe700b8da44a" alt="Images generated with Magic Prompt set to On, showing enhanced prompts with artistic variations."><figcaption><p>With Magic Prompt set to On, the feature enhances your prompt to produce more interesting images.</p></figcaption></figure>

In the example above, the first image was generated by the AI according to the enhanced *Magic Prompt* prompt below:

> **Magic Prompt:**
>
> *A playful cat is sitting on the right side of a vibrant beach ball, situated on a sunny, sandy beach. The beach is dotted with sunbathers and colorful umbrellas. Waves gently lap at the shore, and a pristine blue sky is adorned with a few fluffy white clouds. Seagulls soar overhead, adding to the lively and carefree atmosphere.*

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** When you select an image, the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel) shows both the original and enhanced prompts if *Magic Prompt* was active when generating that image.
{% endhint %}

Below are a few other examples of images generated with and without Magic Prompt.

### Example 2 — Cupcake and Strawberries

> **Original Prompt:**&#x20;
>
> *Photo of cupcake and strawberries.*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxArbjXW2Puk0yppN8aI3%2FCupcake%20OFF.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6a65b17c-2e30-4a4a-bd83-06c7c501aeb6" alt="Photo of a cupcake and strawberries generated with Magic Prompt Off." width="375"><figcaption><p>Photo of a cupcake and strawberries as asked in the prompt.</p></figcaption></figure>

> **Magic Prompt:**&#x20;
>
> *A delectable photo of a scrumptious cupcake adorned with fresh, vibrant strawberries. The cupcake features a soft, fluffy frosting covered in colorful sprinkles, while the strawberries add a touch of natural sweetness and elegance. The background evokes a sense of warmth and comfort, with a rustic, vintage feel, and a hint of a sunlit afternoon.*

### Example 3 — Summer Camp Logo

> **Original Prompt:**&#x20;

# Negative Prompt

The Negative Prompt feature guides the AI away from generating specific types of images or content. It instructs the AI on what to avoid or exclude in the generated images.

For example, if you’re using an AI to create landscape images but want to avoid beaches, you could use a negative prompt like "beach" or "beach, sand, water, ocean." This helps the AI understand your preferences and constraints so it can generate images that more closely match your intended outcome.

To access the Negative Prompt feature:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to reveal the generation settings (if not already visible).
2. Select the **More** button <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FsULvZOcJ9KEtw0cwW7Em%2FPB%20-%20More%20Button%20-%20Dark.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ee8e8a50-c3b7-42de-bdb3-31b87a7c336e" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQMg6DKTYV1xcFS8gwDal%2FPB%20-%20More%20Button%20-%20Light.png?alt=media&#x26;token=883b737c-c2c6-4c15-86cc-378824550c3c" alt="More button in the Prompt Box." data-size="line"></picture> to open a dropdown menu where you can enter the terms or concepts you want the AI to avoid.
3. In the **Negative prompt** field, enter the terms or concepts you want the AI to avoid. Separate multiple items with commas (for example: green, green candies, cheese, cheddar.)

#### Tips:

Here are some tips to get the most out of the feature:

* Use multiple keywords to describe what you don't want.
* Be as precise as possible without providing excessive detail.
* It is often simpler and more effective to write prompts that naturally exclude unwanted elements instead of relying heavily on negative prompts. See the [Handling Negatives](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/prompting-guide/4-handling-negatives) section of the *Prompting Guide* for more details.
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important tip:** If your negative prompt does not seem to work, check whether something in your main prompt interferes with or contradicts it. The content of the regular prompt will always be favored over the negative prompt. For example, a prompt asking for a classical guitar will almost always imply a guitar with strings. Trying to generate a guitar without strings may be difficult because the model usually interprets “guitar” as an object with strings.
{% endhint %}


# Private Generations

With an Ideogram **Plus Plan** or higher, you can generate private images that only you can view.\
Private images remain private even after your subscription ends — you can still access and download them in JPG format. To unlock all download options again, resubscribe to a *Plus Plan* or higher.

For more details about purchasing, upgrading, or managing your subscription, visit the [Plans and Pricing](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing) page.

## Generating Private Images

You can set your generation visibility using the **Visibility** button.

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to show the generation settings (if not already visible).

# Render Speed

The Render Speed setting, available to all paid plan users, lets you control how long the AI spends generating an image, which also affects image detail and overall quality.

To select a specific Render Speed:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to expand it (if not already expanded) and show the available options.
2. Select **Model + variations** (displayed as the actual model and number of images, for example, **3.0 Default x 4**)  to open the dropdown menu.
3. Use the **Render speed** selector at the bottom of the menu to choose your desired speed.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FX8eQYMcIPS9P9sNUZRrW%2FRender%20Speed%20-%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3e1cc572-a0d8-49d2-8d9a-013a9005c925" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Frk4WHHEZoGX2v4vWq8U4%2FRender%20Speed%20-%20Light%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b3de861e-bc41-4002-8efa-e2e7a19c4701" alt="Render speed portion of the Model + variations menu." width="272"></picture><figcaption><p>Render speed portion of the Model + variations menu.</p></figcaption></figure>

The *Render Speed* setting adjusts how long the AI spends refining the requested image. There are three available render speeds:

* **Turbo** — Generates images quickly, ideal for brainstorming or testing ideas. Results may appear rougher or more sketch-like.
* **Default** — Balanced speed and quality; the standard mode for most generations.
* **Quality** — Produces more detailed and refined results. It can correct small imperfections that may appear in faster modes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Render speed varies between models. For example, **Model 2a** is faster than **Model 2.0** when using the same rendering settings.
{% endhint %}

Here are examples generated with **Model 2.0**:

If no Seed Number is entered, the AI will automatically assign a random value. You can enter any number to act as a seed for generation.

When viewing an image, its Seed Number appears in the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel) on the right (desktop) or below the image (mobile).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning:** In Ideogram **Model v3.0**, using the same Seed Number with different [Render Speeds](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed) won’t generate identical images as in earlier versions. However, the results will remain visually similar if the same prompt is used.
{% endhint %}

## Seed Number Use Cases

One example is to keep the same Seed Number and generate the same prompt using different Render speeds, as shown below:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seed: 406220<br>Rendering: Turbo</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FYz0LcGrTj58en9FZ3CQe%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a3abb3de-b326-4ce9-97a7-bde06f325253" alt="Image generated with Turbo render speed using Seed 406220" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td>Seed: 406220<br>Rendering: Default</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0ZxfLbi2t3aum0amBSeN%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b2d4ed15-8b50-4d20-87d0-85ba83e45c44" alt="Image generated with Default render speed using Seed 406220" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td>Seed: 406220<br>Rendering: Quality</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8hugIeBdZcmhoUJlChvI%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=57d209e3-405a-4431-8591-c4042f3d2747" alt="Image generated with Quality render speed using Seed 406220" data-size="original"></td></tr></tbody></table>

You can also use the Seed Number to make small prompt adjustments while preserving most of the original composition.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>... The background is a dark <mark style="color:green;">blue</mark> gradient, ...</em><br><strong>Seed</strong>: 406220<br><strong>Rendering</strong>: Default</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FWxQSzpQIymJVeZEYveZF%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=59f180f6-fd6e-4665-a80c-1775773e9b0b" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>...

The images aren’t identical, but they maintain the same composition and overall appearance. Only the background changes as specified.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning:** Even when using the same *Seed Number*, changing a key concept in the prompt — for example, replacing “photography” with “painting,” or switching to another **model** — will generate different images.
{% endhint %}


# Tile

## Using the Tile Feature

The Tile feature lets you generate images that repeat seamlessly without visible borders or interruptions. It’s available to **all paid users** and is ideal for creating backgrounds, textures, and repeating patterns directly from a prompt.

To access Tile:

1. Select the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to expand it (if not already open) and display the generation settings.
2. Ensure **Model version 1.0** is selected under [Models + variations](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/available-models) — the Tile option is greyed out and unavailable when using any other model version.
3. Select the **More** button <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FsULvZOcJ9KEtw0cwW7Em%2FPB%20-%20More%20Button%20-%20Dark.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ee8e8a50-c3b7-42de-bdb3-31b87a7c336e" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQMg6DKTYV1xcFS8gwDal%2FPB%20-%20More%20Button%20-%20Light.png?alt=media&#x26;token=883b737c-c2c6-4c15-86cc-378824550c3c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>  to open a dropdown menu.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important note:** The Tile feature is available only in **Ideogram model version 1.0**.
{% endhint %}

4. Select the **dropdown arrow** at the right end of the **Tile** option to display a list of available tiling styles.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3XpEs2mcUbIwqAXrX9ca%2FTile%20Animation%20-%20Dark.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=2f0831d5-c212-49ce-b9fa-2148f737a992" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FCGHOWv0OxRdupdLonLdC%2FTile%20Animation%20-%20Light.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=5ec6db30-1935-4d1d-9e85-62524dab1010" alt="" width="375"></picture><figcaption><p>Available grid options.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Grid Styles

These options define how your image repeats:

* **Off** — Disables the tiling feature.
* **Grid** — Arranges images in a regular checkered grid.
* **Vertical brick** — Offsets each column by half its height relative to the one beside it.
* **Horizontal brick** — Offsets each row by half its width relative to the one above or below.
* **Column** — Tiles images in a single vertical column.
* **Row** — Tiles images in a single horizontal row, ideal for banners.

Here are some visual examples of each grid style:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>No tile (generated without tiling)</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fvqbh2aY693HfXUUngr5C%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=01293803-41c4-457b-b4e4-7c26eb18dc54" alt="Original image to be remixed." data-size="original"></td><td>This is the image that will be remixed to generate the tile examples.</td></tr><tr><td>Grid (4x4)</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FibQmZH2MvVXBimO9xp7i%2F4x4%20Grid.png?alt=media&#x26;token=97c53e0a-b6e3-4765-9642-26081a37a801" alt="Example of the Grid tiling style (4×4)" data-size="original"></td><td>This is the most common type of tile, arranged in a checkered grid.</td></tr><tr><td>Vertical brick (4x4)</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FITLDTVxEMNhgSI0rvYjF%2F4x4%20Vertical%20brick.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5a076506-3d82-4597-bc90-1028f5eefe45" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td>In this example, you can see that the columns are aligned but the rows alternate.</td></tr><tr><td>Horizontal brick (4x4)</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fv36xMTO3OY8UYkQIIKK8%2F4x4%20Horizontal%20brick.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e9d76752-afb1-4d8a-875d-9d38d6ccc012" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td>Here, in contrast, you can see that the rows are aligned but the columns alternate.</td></tr><tr><td>Column (1x1)</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FrctLijkBLydkjCLRo5Si%2F1x1%20Column.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a9aac7eb-ddff-40de-ab83-359581523994" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td>It's often a good idea to create your image in the same direction of the column (or row) to minimize the effect of repetition.</td></tr><tr><td>Column (2x1)</td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FKGmzxMa6UnKMyJfxAEPm%2F2x1%20Columnpng.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f2bf5288-1ffe-4abf-aeaa-7d4cc213c1b8" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Downloading Tiles

You can export your seamless Tile images in two ways:

1. From the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel) — While viewing a tile image, select the **dropdown arrow** at the right end of the **Download** button, then choose a format. Available formats vary depending on the tile type generated.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FwXhYwAzWS1XqD1nwXQYn%2FDownload%20-%20Tile%20Formats%20-%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=34c65114-d3d0-4f5f-a85e-3d3c0d625133" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FvNWUwHO8d5ah5FHx4HaD%2FDownload%20-%20Tile%20Formats%20-%20Light%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=131d4e5f-a811-4877-a3b0-340967f6500a" alt="" width="160"></picture><figcaption><p>Menu showing the available download Tile formats.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. From the **Creations** page — When one or more tiles are selected, click **Download** below the image gallery. The **2×2** (or **2×1 / 1×2**, depending on the tile type) versions are automatically packaged in a **ZIP** file and downloaded to your computer.

## Combining Remix and Tile

You can combine [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) and Tile to refine or extend an image for use as a banner, pattern, or background. This combination helps you generate exactly the composition and repetition you want.

Here are some examples:

### Example 1

## Formatting Tips

* Re-save your file as `CSV UTF-8 (comma-delimited)` if a **“Sorry, something went wrong”** error appears.
* Ensure all column headers match the template exactly (case-sensitive).
* The order of columns is flexible.
* In Excel, format cells **as Text** to avoid unwanted conversions (e.g., `2:3` → date).
  {% endhint %}

## Combining *Batch Generation* with Other AI Tools

You can pair Batch Generation with external tools like ChatGPT to automatically fill your CSV with creative prompts.

**Example workflow:**

1. Download the CSV template from the Batch Generation page.
2. Provide that template to ChatGPT and ask it to fill a CSV file following the same structure.
3. Include instructions such as:
   * Design goal
   * Example prompts that worked well for you
   * Desired settings (*aspect ratio*, *visibility*, *model*, *style*, *rendering*)
4. Upload the ChatGPT-generated CSV file to Ideogram to create all images automatically.

For instance, here’s a simplified ChatGPT instruction:

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="false" %}

```
Task: Generate a CSV file with 20 prompts following the template of the provided CSV file.

Context: The prompts will be used to create sticker designs for the Christmas Holidays. Ensure the prompts are diverse, creative, and engaging.

Settings: Use 1:1 aspect ratio, set visibility to private, model to 2.0, rendering to "default", magic prompt to "on" and use "design" as style.

Please follow the language style of the following examples:

1- A sticker design of a cartoon-like figure with a cheerful expression holding a brain upright. The figure is standing on a cloud. There is a speech bubble above its head that reads, "HEY, YOU DROPPED THIS!".

2- A sticker design of a stylized, cartoon-like depiction of a fox. The fox appears to be curled up, with its tail wrapped around its body. Its eyes are closed, giving it a peaceful or sleepy expression. The fox is predominantly orange with white accents, especially around its muzzle and eyes. The fox is set against a white background.

3- A sticker design of a cute cat with a curious expression peeking out of a cardboard box where it barely fits. The cat is sitting on the edge of the box. The text "If I Fits, I Sits" is written in a quirky font below the cat. The background is white.

4- A sticker illustration of a whimsical and adorable cartoon sloth relaxing in a hammock, hanging between two palm trees on a beach. The sloth is wearing stylish sunglasses and has a relaxed grin. The background contains a serene blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and a few other palm trees.

5- A charming and whimsical sticker design featuring a sleepy owl perched on a book, its eyes half-closed. The background neutral grey and the sticker has a thick white outline.

6- A vibrant, retro-inspired sticker with bold white outlines. The motivational phrase "NEVER GIVE UP!" is written in a dynamic, flowing cursive font reminiscent of 1950s Americana signage. The text has a subtle neon glow. The phrase is surrounded by playful, abstract shapes and vintage-inspired patterns. The overall design is bright, cheerful, and evokes energy and optimism.

```

Here are some results showing Christmas sticker designs generated via Batch + ChatGPT workflow.

## Examples of Descriptions

When you activate **Describe**, Ideogram analyzes your image and generates a prompt that describes its visual content.

{% hint style="info" %}

## Tips

The description output depends on the **Model version** you selected.

* **Model version 3.0** produces more detailed and slightly longer prompts.
* **Model versions 2.0**, **2a**, and **1.0** return shorter, simpler descriptions.

If the result isn’t what you expected, crop or zoom in on your image using the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor). Adjusting the framing can generate a different prompt and improve the results.
{% endhint %}

The following examples show how Describe converts real photos into text prompts. Each prompt was then used to generate new images, **without** [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) or [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) enabled.

The goldfinch's beak is bright orange-yellow, and its eye is dark and alert. The bird is positioned facing right, gripping the rough-textured branch with its feet. In the background, there are green leaves visible, slightly out of focus, creating a natural bokeh effect. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the bird's bright yellow feathers. The composition is sharp and detailed, with the goldfinch positioned in the left two-thirds of the frame. The background has a blue-green tint, suggesting a summer or late spring setting.*

> *An aerial photograph of a small town during autumn, captured from a high drone perspective. The main road runs through the center of the image, a two-lane asphalt road with yellow center lines. The town is nestled between dense forested hills covered in vibrant fall foliage featuring orange, yellow, and red leaves. The buildings are predominantly white and gray residential homes with pitched roofs, scattered along both sides of the main road. A large body of water, a lake, is visible on the right side of the image, with dark blue water and a rocky shoreline. The sky is bright blue with wispy white cirrus clouds stretching across it. The landscape shows a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees, with the foliage displaying various shades of autumn colors. The terrain rises from the town toward the hills in the background. The image has natural lighting from a clear day, creating strong contrast between the bright foliage and the deep blue sky. The photograph captures the entire town layout, from the dense residential area to the waterfront, showing the natural integration between the town and its surrounding natural landscape.*

> **Prompt from Describe v2.0:**

> *A picturesque town nestled between a dense forest and a serene lake. The town is characterized by a main road that runs through it, flanked by houses on both sides. The houses vary in size and color, with some having red roofs. The forest is ablaze with autumn colors, ranging from golden yellows to fiery reds and deep oranges. In the background, majestic mountains rise, partially obscured by the mist. The sky above is clear with a few wispy clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day.*

# Reference Features


# Character Reference

Creating visually consistent characters across multiple images has long been a challenge in AI image generation—until now.&#x20;

With Character Reference, you can define and reuse distinctive characters so that facial features, hairstyles, and other key traits remain consistent from one image to the next.

This feature gives you greater creative control and continuity, whether you’re illustrating a story or  exploring different settings with the same character.

Once defined, your characters can be customized and reused with new prompts, helping you build cohesive image series quickly.

In the sections below, you’ll learn how to create, manage, and use Character References effectively, along with tips for combining them with other features such as [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) and [Magic Fill](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill).

## Accessing Character Reference

### From the Prompt Box

Click or tap inside the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to reveal the option bar (if it isn’t already visible). Then select the **Character** button to open a popup where you can access your existing Character References or create a new one.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FRHcmXz2h1OCwhdorEtjb%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7ab392b1-b349-4dbc-baca-46c4db611f50" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0lhQZyJpdNvvk5D18bnz%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=226aff5a-177b-4958-8122-236d6d37cd34" alt="Popup showing your Character References."></picture><figcaption><p>Popup showing your Character References.</p></figcaption></figure>

If you select an existing character, its thumbnail appears in one of two locations depending on context. In standard views, it appears below your prompt in the Prompt Box. On the Character Page, the thumbnail appears larger at the top left of the Prompt Box.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FN9BYxfb0NOFN6lxkpMkM%2FPB%20-%20Character%20Image%20-%20Light.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a126aee5-7aba-44ae-8dcf-0de96e211f87" alt="Character thumbnail in the Prompt Box."><figcaption><p>Character thumbnail in the Prompt Box.</p></figcaption></figure>

Selecting **New Character** opens the dedicated **Character** page, where you can define and manage your custom Character References.

### From Other Locations

You can also access the Character feature from several other locations:

1. Select the **Character** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FdlePgI9eRA6RqsV4doHb%2FCharacter%20-%20Dark%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=b5c1859d-f143-4ae3-9e3a-82ab5e37c316" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FgzasJUhVATpQJ3SwqjR8%2FCharacter%20-%20Light%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=90d20bb9-31dc-48a0-9c89-e0b2dca2b1af" alt="Character icon"></picture> on the [Navigation Bar](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/navigation-bar) to open the Character page.
2. Click or tap the **Character** button in the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel) when viewing a single image to use that image as a Character Reference.
3. Click the **More** icon  <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt="More icon"></picture>  while hovering over an image in the [Image Gallery](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/image-gallery), then choose **Character** from the [More menu](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/more-menu-...).

## How to Use a Character Reference

### Create or Choose a Character

On the Character page, click or tap the **New Character** button in the upper-right corner to create a new Character Reference.

You can add an image as a Character Reference in one of three ways:

1. **Camera** — This enables you to take a picture with your device/computer and use it as a character reference. You may need to authorize your browser or app to access your camera.
2. **Upload** — Browse images from your device or computer and upload one.
3. **Creations** — Browse your creations on Ideogram and select one as a reference.

Alternatively, you can select an existing *Character Reference*.

Your selected image appears in the top-left corner of the *Prompt Box*.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7gttFbaADKgznMlatC6d%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1bd4b8e7-9694-435c-bf49-45b151872951" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FLYyY57A1ZxLiz37dxNpd%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1f928a0a-5cf4-4948-923a-c62c9ad3ad0e" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>*Prompt Box on the Character Page showing a selected Character Reference.*</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** A portrait-style image with a clear, well-lit face (preferably at a slight angle) yields the best results.
{% endhint %}

#### When on the Home Page

If a Character Reference is active in the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box), selecting on it will display two buttons:

* **Describe** — Activates the Describe function, which adds a description of the image to the Prompt Box.
* **Edit Mask** — Opens the mask editor, allowing you to modify how the AI interprets the selected Character Reference. (See [How Masking Works](#how-masking-works) below for details.)

Selecting the **X** icon removes the Character Reference from the Prompt Box.

#### When on the Character Page

Hovering over the Character thumbnail at the top of the prompt box will reveal the **More** Icon  <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt="More icon"></picture>  and clicking on it will give you two options:

* **Edit character mask** — Opens the mask editor so you can adjust which areas of the image are used by the AI.
* **Remove image** — Deletes the image from the Character Reference. Once removed, <mark style="background-color:$danger;">the reference will no longer have an associated image</mark>. You can select or upload a new one to replace it.

Alternatively, selecting the image itself opens the Edit Character Mask function directly.

### Personalizing Your Character

Now that you’ve selected a Character Reference image, follow these steps to generate an image with it:

1. Choose how you want to describe the image to be generated:
   * **Write a prompt** that details your character and background, or
   * **Choose a template** from the available predefined options for a quick start.\
     (Templates appear below the Prompt Box on the Character Page. You can reopen them by selecting the **Templates** button next to **Generate**.)
2. Select a **Style**:
   * **Auto** — Automatically selects the optimal style based on your prompt.
   * **Realistic** — Creates lifelike photography with natural colors, textures, and lighting.
   * **Fiction** — Creates imaginative characters with artistic variation.

3. Apply the other generation options such as **Public/Private**, **Aspect Ratio**, and others, except:
   1. **Unavailable options**: *Color Palette, Negative Prompt, Seed Number.*
   2. Any previously selected Style Reference is disabled when using a Character Reference.
4. Once ready, click **Generate** to create your image.

Here are a few examples:

## How Masking Works

When you select an image as a Character Reference, the AI automatically identifies and masks the face and hair from that image.

You can adjust the mask to refine results—for example, to modify a character’s hairstyle or preserve accessories.

For instance, consider the following prompt:

> *A woman with vibrant blue pixie-cut hair.*

With the default mask, the generated image doesn’t fully reflect the requested hairstyle, only a small color overlay appears on the original hair.

<div><figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FidbSGEHTPD8zEQOSBZ5X%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2015ccc5-7000-4f37-b277-d8e1a5d4ba82" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxtGwXaCiLj1T6iiwTwWn%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=992a0cbc-9542-4177-93ad-b0cfe0281516" alt="Default mask highlighting the face and hair." width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>Default mask highlighting the face and hair.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fi2OKi15TSspTVDNTvYdD%2Fpixie-1.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4c03c230-62c7-42be-b182-a6714562484e" alt="Generated image using the default mask." width="563"><figcaption><p>Generated image using the default mask.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

By erasing the hair area from the default mask, the AI can replace the hairstyle and apply a consistent color more effectively.

<div><figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQEUSBmRezBAofsT02vFk%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=acf24912-02a4-4ae1-b487-c70c72991018" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpE7HS5o2OQdy5Of1Ihfy%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=91c1ac94-2790-4a00-8cf8-a5f4227a5a68" alt="Modified mask excluding hair." width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>Modified mask excluding hair.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0LxhhyvF4WelQGmKGMNA%2Fpixie-2.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1ba0ed7a-90a1-4a1b-9025-8ad5ab195805" alt="Result showing new hairstyle with uniform color." width="563"><figcaption><p>Result showing new hairstyle with uniform color.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Conversely, you can preserve more of the original image to maintain specific details, such as a hat, jewelry, or other distinctive elements.

Consider the following prompt:

> *A woman wearing a red ruby pendant and a red evening gown.*

With the default AI mask, the generated image doesn’t preserve the look of the pendant and generates one with a different appearance.

<div><figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FkH1kzdhpTAz8qZJWSixR%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5b5c1982-5f48-4d36-8740-9bcb171fbf4e" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPGG2cUE9aP1fDOUEuYTA%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=11e7bbe1-d61c-48bd-897d-cdbbad4008bc" alt="Default mask excluding pendant area." width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>Default mask excluding pendant area.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0pIG5Y81ifM79rckdL47%2FCharacter%20Reference%20%E2%80%93%20Pendant%201.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0614e3ac-6f06-4b00-bdcb-32900726a75a" alt="Generated image showing altered pendant design." width="563"><figcaption><p>Generated image showing altered pendant design.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

By editing the default mask to include the pendant, the generated image successfully preserved the pendant’s original appearance.

## Using a Character Reference with Other Features

While Character Reference is a powerful feature on its own, combining it with tools like [Magic Fill](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) and [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) allows you to create exactly the image you have in mind.

For example, you might already have generated an image that meets most of your requirements. However, the image may not fully match your vision. Below are two methods you can use, depending on your needs.

### Using Remix

To preserve the overall composition and environment of the original image, Remix is an excellent solution. Here’s how:

1. Select the image you want to remix, then click **Remix** in the right-side panel.
2. In the Prompt Box, click the **Character** tab to access existing Character References or create a new one.
3. Provide a detailed prompt describing the character’s physical appearance and the environment.
4. Adjust the image weight for the remixed image (usually between 60–80; some experimentation may be needed to find the optimal value).
5. Set the other options to your liking. It’s recommended to turn Magic Prompt **Off** to preserve the intended character and environment.
6. Click **Remix** to generate the images.

### Using Magic Fill

If you need to preserve as much of the background and environment as possible, Magic Fill can be an excellent solution. There are many ways to proceed, here’s one of them:

1. Select the original image where you want to change the character.
2. Click **Open** in Canvas in the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel).
3. Select the **Magic Fill** icon in the Left Sidebar.
4. Mask the area of the character you want to replace.
5. Click or tap **Next**.
6. Click **Character** at the bottom of the Prompt Box.
7. Select or create a Character Reference.
8. Write a detailed prompt describing the new character’s physical features and the environment.
9. Click **Magic Fill** to generate the images.

### Available Modes

* **Auto** – Automatically selects the most suitable style based on your prompt.
* **General** – A flexible mode suitable for most uses, including artistic and abstract work.
* **Realistic** – Produces lifelike photography with authentic colors, textures, and lighting.
* **Design** – Ideal for clean, vector-style images such as logos, posters, and other design assets.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning:** The **Random** mode is **deprecated** and no longer available.
{% endhint %}

#### While Using a Character Reference

If a [Character Reference](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/character-reference) is present in the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box), the available modes adapt automatically. The selected Mode applies to the next generated image and incorporates the active Character Reference:

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FY7CqxALNEOFoqEAZuGYQ%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=fcc673b6-a99d-43bf-b05d-f8f32047a913" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxpmyiNK91j0w1eAB3MLN%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d31cacba-f3d1-49ab-9326-a2f4d6a496e0" alt="Modes available when a Character Reference is active."></picture><figcaption><p>Modes available when a Character Reference is active.</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Auto** – Automatically determines the most suitable rendering style based on your prompt and the referenced character.
* **Realistic** – Generates lifelike results, preserving the character’s facial features, colors, and textures as faithfully as possible.
* **Fiction** – Interprets the character creatively, blending stylized elements while keeping key traits recognizable.

### Style Presets

The following preset options are always available, regardless of whether you are generating normally or using a Character Reference.

* **Explore** – Select a style from a curated library of popular aesthetics.
* **Recents** – Reuse a style from your most recently used styles.
* **My styles** – Choose one of your custom styles.
* **Quick reference** – Upload or select up to three images to define a **temporary custom style** that will not be saved.

### Examples

These examples show how different style presets reimagine Grant Wood’s *American Gothic* using the same prompt.

> **Prompt:**
>
> *A stern couple in front of a white church with a Gothic-style window. The woman wears a brown polka-dotted dress with a white lace collar and a large brown brooch, while the man holds a pitchfork and wears a black suit with a light blue shirt, white collar, and round wire-rimmed glasses. The church's white exterior features vertical siding, and the background includes green trees and a red barn.*

The following images show the output produced by a few preset styles.

{% hint style="success" %}

### Tips & Tricks

#### To generate the best images using Styles:

* **Turn** Magic Prompt **off** to avoid unintended stylistic additions to your original prompt.
* **Avoid** adding **style-related keywords** in your prompt, especially those that may conflict with the selected style.
* Short, focused prompts usually yield the best results.
  {% endhint %}

### Creating Your Own Style

In addition to using preset styles, you can also create your own custom styles to achieve a personalized aesthetic.

How to create a style:

1. Select **Style** in the *Prompt Box*.
2. Open the **My styles** tab.
3. Select **Create new style**.
4. Upload or choose **up to three images** as visual references for your style.
5. Name your style.
6. Click or tap **Create**.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FXt2jfUTagZxFmZM9B5Xb%2FUntitled%20Aug%2020%20204%20PM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9bdea57c-68a2-45be-aa2b-3e4df4ef007c" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpUBvumQW1wmJuNZOW3Ph%2FUntitled%20Aug%2020%20204%20PM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8b5c6473-0741-4746-8b00-db8442b78736" alt="" width="375"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Your custom style appears under **My styles** and can be reused in any prompt.

{% hint style="success" %}

### Tips & Tricks

#### **Selecting the best images for custom styles:**

* **For a strong, unified style:** Choose images that share a similar look, mood, aesthetic, and composition.
* **For creative, unexpected results:** Mix diverse references to let the AI blend aesthetics and produce surprising outcomes.
* **Using gradients to control color:** Upload a gradient-based image as one of your three references to influence the overall tone.
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The reference images for your custom styles **cannot be changed after creation**. This ensures that anyone who uses your style in the future will see consistent results based on the images you originally uploaded.
{% endhint %}

## Combine Style Reference With Other Features

Style Reference integrates seamlessly with other Ideogram features to expand creative possibilities:

* [Describe](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) – Generate prompts from existing images and apply a style.
* [Remix](#remix) – Reimagine existing images with a chosen style.
* [Character Reference](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/character-reference) – Maintain a consistent subject across different aesthetics.
* [Color Palette](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/color-palette) – Match your prompt to a specific mood or tone.

### Describe + Style Reference

Use Describe to generate detailed text prompts from existing images, then apply a style to create a new version.

{% hint style="success" %}
Remove any stylistic keywords from Describe results for cleaner, more controlled outputs.
{% endhint %}

Example using the image below:&#x20;

<div align="center"><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FfleZYHu1wg2HK6Hcsz0h%2FGuitarist%20original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bb026913-ded1-401b-9991-b4413d33944a" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

> **Original Describe prompt:**
>
> A dynamic ~~indoor photograph~~ of a young man playing an electric guitar with intense emotion. The musician wears a <mark style="color:green;">burgundy red</mark> hoodie and <mark style="color:green;">light blue</mark> jeans, displaying an enthusiastic expression with eyes closed and mouth open in a passionate singing pose. He holds a <mark style="color:green;">cream-colored</mark> Fender electric guitar with a <mark style="color:green;">black</mark> pickguard. The setting features a <mark style="color:green;">dark green</mark> wall with two black and white framed photographs visible in the background. A <mark style="color:green;">brown</mark> leather couch is partially visible in the lower portion of the frame. ~~The lighting creates a warm, indoor atmosphere, highlighting the musician's features and the guitar's cream finish. The composition captures a moment of musical expression, with the subject positioned slightly left of center in the frame.~~

Stylistic words and sentences shown with ~~strikethrough~~ were removed or replaced to optimize how the AI interprets and applies styles. Additionally, any words highlighted in <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> — which indicated the colors of elements in the image — have also been removed.

> **Adjusted Describe prompt:**
>
> A dynamic image of a young man playing an electric guitar with intense emotion. The musician wears a hoodie and jeans, displaying an enthusiastic expression with eyes closed and mouth open in a passionate singing pose. He holds a Fender electric guitar with a pickguard. The setting features a wall with two black and white framed photographs visible in the background. A leather couch is partially visible in the lower portion of the frame.

The images below show how different styles reinterpret the adjusted prompt.

### Remix + Style Reference

Add a Style Reference to [Remix](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) to refresh existing images while preserving their structure. This method usually matches the composition better than using Describe alone.

* **Higher Remix weight** → Keeps composition closer to the original image.
* **Lower Remix weight** → Produces results more influenced by the selected style.

The example below uses Remix at 60% with the same original image and adjusted Describe prompt:

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FfleZYHu1wg2HK6Hcsz0h%2FGuitarist%20original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=bb026913-ded1-401b-9991-b4413d33944a" alt=""><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FOAw5JOsEkU1bB3mPsuoN%2FGuitarist%20-%2080s%20Illustration%20-%20Remix%2060.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a4ae4f56-58ad-4d3e-8a59-34d51605eaa2" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: 80s Illustration - Remix at 60%.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FMopzC9GOL4LXyFQ4jIAV%2FGuitariste%20-%20Avant%20Garde%20-%20Remix%2060.png?alt=media&#x26;token=35eae76e-0009-48a7-a6dd-33620896c757" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: Avant Garde - Remix at 60%.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Character Reference + Style Reference

Combine a Character Reference with Style Reference to maintain a consistent subject across multiple images while exploring different aesthetics. Perfect for creating variations while maintaining consistency.

The following example shows how combining a character reference with different styles affects the final output.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FYEiB3w9wMPmUzI2tLWlC%2FGuitarist%20-%20Character.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4d86382c-c8eb-4928-837f-75ed21f95cdb" alt=""><figcaption><p>Character Reference.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F2m9YPVgBKInEQaTeakwB%2FMixed%20media.png?alt=media&#x26;token=24c97361-b0b4-428f-a0eb-557cc28e5dbf" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: Mixed Media.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F72ZZFLwhbTLFoKG57nmE%2FGuitarist%20-%20Monochrome.png?alt=media&#x26;token=26a76238-8895-42d8-9097-1661a5dd161c" alt=""><figcaption><p>Style: Monochrome.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Color Palette + Style Reference

Use them together to influence the overall tone and mood of your image. When a [Color Palette](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/color-palette) is applied, the selected colors are incorporated while maintaining the style’s visual identity.

The images below show how different color palettes influence a single style. The selected palette appears in the lower-left corner of each image.

# Styles in Older Models

Older Ideogram models (versions 1.0, 2.0, and 2a) use styles differently from Model 3.0. This page explains how Style work in these earlier models and how they affect your prompts.

## Styles in Version 2.0 and 2a

To access the Style options:

* Click or tap inside the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to reveal the option bar (if not already visible).&#x20;
* Select **Style** to open the dropdown.

The examples below compare the Style options available in versions 2.0/2a and 1.0 as they vary depending on the model you select

The styles available in version 2.0 and 2a are specialized AI models and do not add any extra text to your prompt, unlike styles in version 1.0.

Here are the available styles:

* **Auto**, **General**, **Realistic** and **Design** are just like their counterparts in [Version 3.0](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/..#available-modes).
* **3D** – Generates characters, objects, and other creations with a 3D visual look.
* **Anime** – Creates images and characters inspired by anime-style artwork.

### Example Styles in 2.0

Here are some examples of the 2.0 styles.

> **Prompt:**
>
> Portrait of a fireman.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro tip**: Experiment with the same prompt in different Styles. Each one can produce distinct and sometimes unexpected results, even when it was not originally designed for your use case.
{% endhint %}

## Styles in Version 1.0

In version 1.0, using a style adds the corresponding keywords to the end of your prompt just before the image is generated. This helps the AI understand the type of image you want.

Select a Style to apply it. You can select and apply multiple Styles at once.

# Remix

The Remix tool lets you modify an existing image, whether it was generated in Ideogram or uploaded. The AI uses the original image as a base for the new one, letting you control how much it influences the final result.

## How to Use Remix

You can access Remix in several ways:

1. **From image feeds** (Home and Creations pages) –\
   Hover over any image in the [Image Gallery](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/image-gallery), select the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt=""></picture> at the top of the image, and choose **Remix** from the [More menu](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/more-menu-...).
2. **From image details** –\
   In the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel), select the **Remix** button.\
   Alternatively, select the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt=""></picture> in the upper-right corner and choose **Remix** from the More menu.
3. **When importing an image into the** [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) –\
   In the popup window, select **Remix** to use the feature on that image.

When using Remix, the original prompt — or the auto-generated description from an uploaded image — automatically fills the Prompt Box. The parent image’s [Aspect Ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratio-and-dimensions) (or the closest available ratio) is applied automatically.

You can edit the prompt and settings, except for the aspect rati&#x6F;*.*\
To change it, use the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor) to crop, resize, or adjust the image before launching Remix.

## Adjusting the Strength

Remix lets you control how much influence (called **Strength**) the parent image has on the new one.\
Click the **Remix** thumbnail in the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) to open its options.

* Use the **Strength** slider or enter a value between 1 and 100.
* Higher values make the new image closer to the original.
* Set the **Strength** to 0 to remove the parent image entirely and generate a new one based only on the prompt and style tags.

To remove the parent image from the Prompt Box, hover over the Remix thumbnail and select the "X" icon in its top-right corner.


# Replace or Remove Background

The Replace Background or Remove Background features let you isolate the main subject of an image by either removing the existing background or replacing it with a new one.

This feature is available to all paid plans:

* **Remove Background** makes the background transparent, leaving only the main subject. This is free (no credits used).
* **Replace Background** generates a new background based on your prompt. This uses credits, depending on:
  * The **Model** you selected.
  * The **Number of images** generated.
  * The **Render Speed.**

## How to Access the Feature

You can access Replace or Remove Background in several ways:

1. **From image details** –\
   When viewing an image in the [Details panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel), select the **Remove BG** button or the dropdown arrow to access **Replace BG**.\
   Alternatively, select the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt=""></picture> in the upper-right corner and choose **Remove Background** or **Replace Background** from the [More menu](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/more-menu-...).
2. **When importing or pasting an image** –\
   In the popup window, select **Replace BG** or use the dropdown arrow to access **Remove BG**.

## Remove Background

You can remove the background of an image either directly from the Details panel while viewing a single image or while working in the Canvas. Each method behaves slightly differently.

### When Viewing an Image

* In the [Details panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel), select the **Remove BG** button.
* The image updates automatically with a transparent background and is saved to your Creations.&#x20;
* You can preview the before-and-after comparison by selecting the **Split View** button at the top right.

The Details panel updates to show new options. To refine the result, select **Edit Background** to open the image in [Edit Background mode](#edit-background-mode) within the Canvas.

### When in Canvas

If you opened the image in Canvas or were already editing there:

* Select the image for which you want the background to be removed.
* Click on **Remove BG** on the right-side panel.
* You will enter [Edit Background mode](#edit-background-mode).&#x20;

### Edit Background Mode

In Edit Background mode, you can refine the transparent or masked areas of your image using several tools:

After removing the background, you can download the image using the **Download** option in the left panel or continue editing it in the Canvas. In both cases, the image is also saved in your Creations.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**: For sharper and more precise results, use *Upscale* before removing the background. Higher-resolution images produce cleaner edges and better transparency.
{% endhint %}

## Replace Background

The Replace Background feature lets you replace the background behind the main subject with a new one generated from your text prompt.

For example, you can replace the background of a studio photo featuring a perfume bottle with a more dynamic scene, such as cascading water.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fn2Td1GACxg5dYM897wah%2FR-BG%20Original%20image.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9a917dd9-a243-4780-9d7f-37ca5343320d" alt="Original studio image before background replacement." width="375"><figcaption><p>Original studio image before background replacement.</p></figcaption></figure>

1. After selecting **Replace BG**, describe the new background you want to generate in the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box).
2. Select **Replace** to generate the new images. Results appear in your Creations or directly in the Canvas, depending on where the action was performed.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FLx5Dn46eJbPa1d1oU2Ww%2FR-BG%20Final%20image.png?alt=media&#x26;token=065c89e9-4c37-4743-90b4-e5964c9f4243" alt="Final image after Replace Background applied." width="375"><figcaption><p>Final image after Replace Background applied.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** When integrating the subject into the new background, the AI may slightly adjust the image’s edges for a smoother blend.
{% endhint %}


# Search

# Upscale

The Upscale feature, available to users on the **Basic Plan** or higher, increases the resolution of your Ideogram-generated images, and of any images you’ve uploaded using the [Image Upload](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/image-upload) function (available on the **Plus Plan** or higher), by up to **2×**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** Upscale **crops** images to the nearest supported aspect ratio listed in the table below. This behavior applies to all images, including both default and custom aspect ratios used in Ideogram v2.0 and later.
{% endhint %}

Aspect ratios and their final pixel dimensions after upscaling:

| Aspect ratio | Final dimensions (pixels) |
| :----------: | :-----------------------: |
|   **`1:3`**  |        1024 x 3072        |
|  **`9:16`**  |        1440 x 2560        |
|  **`10:16`** |        1536 x 2464        |
|   **`2:3`**  |        1536 x 2304        |
|   **`3:4`**  |        1536 x 2048        |
|   **`1:1`**  |        2048 x 2048        |
|   **`4:3`**  |        2048 x 1536        |
|   **`3:2`**  |        2304 x 1536        |
|  **`16:10`** |        2464 x 1536        |
|  **`16:9`**  |        2560 x 1440        |
|   **`3:1`**  |        3072 x 1024        |

**Example 1** — If you upload an image that is 1500 pixels by 1500 pixels, which has an aspect ratio of 1:1, the upscale will result in a 2048 pixels by 2048 pixels image.&#x20;

**Example 2** — If you generate an image with a custom aspect ratio of 17:12 (1088 × 768 pixels) and then use *Upscale*, the image will be cropped it to the nearest available aspect ratio, which is 3:2, and the final image will be 2304 pixels by 1536 pixels.

## Upscaling an Image

You can access Upscale in several ways:

1. **From image feeds** (Home and Creations pages) –\
   Hover over any image in the [Image Gallery](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/image-gallery), select the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt=""></picture> at the top of the image, and select **Upscale** from the [More menu](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/more-menu-...).
2. **From image details** –\
   In the [Details Panel](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/details-panel), select the **Upscale** button.\
   Alternatively, select the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPYS9T78uhmDmuEqNWvcb%2FMore%20-%20White%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cba9b268-f5f2-4895-bef0-fa43e5ae3724" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqhNBoUUnrp0grTzHJonA%2FMore%20-%20Black%2020px.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=dee426ba-09fe-4735-bdd3-81c5ecb71035" alt=""></picture> in the upper-right corner and choose **Upscale** from the More menu.
3. **When** [importing an image](https://docs.ideogram.ai/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box#importing-an-image) **into the** [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box) –\
   In the popup window, select **Upscale** to generate an automatic description.

## Parameters

To adjust settings, select the Upscale thumbnail in the [Prompt Box](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/ui-overview/ui-components/prompt-box). A pop-up window appears, allowing you to fine-tune the **Resemblance** and **Detail** parameters. You also have the option to [Describe](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) the image or to edit it in the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor) before applying the upscale.

Upscale lets you control how much **Resemblance** the new image retains from the original, and how much **Detail** the AI adds during generation.

Select the **Upscale** thumbnail in the Prompt Box to open its options.

### Resemblance

This parameter determines how closely you want the enlarged image to resemble the original. A value of 1 allows the AI more freedom to be creative with the image, which can be useful for correcting certain defects or enhancing specific details. On the other hand, a value of 100 will produce a result that is as close as possible to the original image while still enlarging it and maintaining optimal sharpness.

### Detail Slider

This slider allows you to adjust the level of detail in the enlarged image. A higher value will increase the visibility of details, while a lower value will reduce them.

**Detail value: 1 vs 100**

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FbPhj4woVM1DnAbUnEiN0%2FDog%20Detail%20Compare.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=1ff00210-115a-47ce-9df8-e1703a74470b" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Animation of two upscaled images generated with a Detail value of 1 compared to the same generated with a value of 100.</p></figcaption></figure>

# Canvas and Editing


# Canvas


# Canvas Overview

## What is Canvas?

Ideogram **Canvas** is an infinite creative board designed for generating, editing, and organizing images. It’s the ideal workspace for projects involving multiple images, whether they’re generated directly within Ideogram or uploaded from your computer.

With Canvas, you can:

* **Upload your own images** by clicking Upload, using copy-paste or simply dragging in an image.
* **Edit images** using two new powerful tools:
  * **Magic Fill** (inpainting) to add or modify elements within an image.
  * **Extend** (outpainting) to expand your image beyond its original edges.
* **Generate** images using text prompts.
* **Remix** images and compositions.
* Add **Text** to your images.
* **Download** your final composition/work as an image.

***

The options are:

1. **Select**: Select, move, resize, and arrange images.
2. **Rectangular mask**: Create a mask from a rectangular shape
3. **Freeform mask**: Create a mask from a freeform shape.
4. **Brush mask**: Create a mask using a brush.
   1. Click the down arrow on the right to reveal a slider for adjusting brush size.
5. **Eraser mode**: The selected tool will erase masked areas.
6. **Invert mask**: Reverses the mask; masked areas become unmasked and vice versa.
7. **Load previous mask**: Restores the last mask used.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you’re a new user or simply new to Canvas, consider experimenting with the [**Generate**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/generating-images) and [**Remix**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) functions outside of Canvas to familiarize yourself with their features. Additionally, explore key features such as [**Private Generations**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/private-generations), [**Aspect Ratios**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratio-and-dimensions), [**Style**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models), [**Magic Prompt**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) and [**Color Palettes**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/color-palette), as they play an integral role in the generative tools within Canvas.

## Working with Canvas

### Renaming the Canvas

By default, each new canvas is named “Untitled canvas.” or a name based on the beginning of the prompt from the image opened in **Canvas**. To rename it, click the canvas name at the top-left corner, next to the **Menu** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpEtJqrsaDujCKZvnYSIB%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2010.15.13%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ce87b280-7cf9-483c-ae11-c0364ab2bb4f" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FXsvdb3ilYp1AdXju7KMA%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2010.13.00%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0eafa398-16ad-4af6-87ef-63a5fbc61c39" alt="" data-size="line"></picture>, and enter your desired name.

## Understanding the Generation Window and Image Frames

### Generation Windows

**Generation windows** are bounding boxes used by the **Magic Fill**, **Extend**, **Remix** and **Download** functions to define the size, aspect ratio, and placement of the image to be generated or downloaded.

**Resizing generation windows**:

* **By corners**: Preserves the actual aspect ratio.
* **By sides**: Snaps to the nearest supported [aspect ratio](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratio-and-dimensions#defaults-aspect-ratios-and-sizes).&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FmLFfqlfbRGG6cyPVwzyU%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9d096858-3c39-407b-92fd-9d9e3e44526a" alt="" width="152"><figcaption><p>A generation window</p></figcaption></figure>

### Image Frames

**Image frames** are the containers that hold already generated images. Each generative function produces four images per prompt.&#x20;

* **Generate** and **Remix**: All four images are placed separately on the canvas, each in its own image frame.
* **Magic Fill** and **Extend**: These tools place one selected image on the canvas, maintaining the size and position of the generation window used.

### Switching Between Generated Images

1\. Make sure the Select tool is active in the left-side panel.

2\. Click on the desired image frame to display a the image panel below it.

3\. Use the arrows in the menu to scroll through the four generated images.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fk3iqgLRYZHEtFR5tKAsH%2FCanvas%20-%20Image%20Select.webp?alt=media&#x26;token=9cefa9f6-7e0d-4c41-bc4c-eb6db93213b3" alt="" width="262"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Image frames can be freely resized and repositioned on the canvas.

## How to Download Images

To download your final composite image, use the **Download** function, which works like an adjustable screen capture.

* Click on the **Download** button on the left-side panel.
* Alternatively, if you have activated the **Always show download outline** option, click the download icon at the top left of the inactive download generation window on your canvas.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaQspCjj7dL5zwlxOGce4%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d474395d-dacd-48c1-aba0-a871f0b9ea9e" alt="" width="237"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Resize and position the download generation window to capture the final image you wish to download.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FTEkhRn0rl83YsfIkTFIk%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f13bd11e-2c82-434a-af8a-63e4e85c3830" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>The download context frame placed and resized.</p></figcaption></figure>

* On the left side, near the Download icon, a small panel will appear with the final dimensions of the image. You can adjust the size by manually editing the width and height, then click the arrow next to the Download button to choose the image format (for highest quality PNG downloads, you'll need [Ideogram Basic or above](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans). Finally, click Download to save the image.

## Canvas and Image Sizes

Consider the following aspects regarding image sizes on the canvas:

* **Canvas grid**: The canvas has an underlying pixel grid, visible when zoomed in at 2000% or more.
* **Image placement**: When uploading or generating images, they will at first align with the canvas grid, with one pixel on the image equaling one pixel on the grid.
* **Generation window sizes**: When you use the Remix, Magic Fill, or Extend tool, the generation window will adopt one of the default predefined aspect ratios, each with a fixed pixel size. **The generated image will have this specific size, regardless of how you resize the context frame on the canvas.**
* **Image scaling**: Images retain their original width and height in pixels, even if resized on the canvas.
* **Download dimensions**: The Download tool uses the canvas grid to define the size of the image to be downloaded.

{% hint style="info" %}
The most common aspect ratios and their corresponding sizes can be found in the[Aspect Ratios & Resolutions](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/aspect-ratio-and-dimensions#defaults-aspect-ratios-and-sizes) section of the documentation.
{% endhint %}

### Example

Let's start with an image generated in Ideogram at a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024 x 1024 pixels):

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FhxvRxcRYWr2Miq07SIRu%2FMadame%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5f558654-2bb9-40b6-94db-846cfebd5747" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The original image to be modified.</p></figcaption></figure>

Sometimes, faces and hands can be distorted when they are small in size, as seen in the generated image above. In such cases, you can use **Magic Fill** to correct these imperfections.

Here's how to do it:

* Mask the head and hands using **Magic Fill**.
* Resize the generation window to be smaller than the original image but large enough to include a significant portion of the image. This ensures the AI has enough context to analyze the image and accurately interpret the prompt.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why make the generation window smaller?** Using a smaller generation window gives the AI more pixels relative to the original image, resulting in a higher pixel density for the selected area. This leads to more detailed faces and hands.

However, keep in mind that some of these details or the apparent sharpness may be lost during processing. This happens because everything is interpolated or extrapolated to fit the pixel grid on the canvas when downloading the resulting composite image. More details in this [section below](#a-note-on-final-image-quality).
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaTjJxrVZnjIqBS6Xtm42%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=603bef76-7a3a-4b55-abd5-b5c4702eb9de" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Masked areas and the small generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Adjust the prompt based on the content of the generation window:\
  `A photo of an elderly woman with white hair wearing a floral dress and a necklace. She is seated in a wooden chair in a dimly lit room. The background reveals lush green plants. The overall ambiance is warm and nostalgic.`
* Click **Magic Fill**.

Here is the final result after downloading the image:

## A Note on Final Image Quality

When downloading your composite image, it’s important to understand how scaling and pixel density affect the final output because the final image is based on the canvas’s pixel grid. This means that any images you’ve scaled up or down will not retain their original resolutions in the downloaded image. Enlarged images won’t have extra detail, and reduced images won’t keep their apparent increased sharpness.

### Simple Examples to Illustrate This

#### Example 1: Enlarging a small image or generating in a bigger generation window than the canvas grid

Suppose you place a small photo (say, 200 x 200 pixels) on the canvas and enlarge it to double its size (400 x 400 pixels):

* **On the canvas**: It looks bigger, filling more space.
* **When downloaded**: That part of the image may appear blurry or pixelated because enlarging doesn’t add new details; it just makes the existing ones bigger and less clear. The small photo doesn’t have enough detail to look good at a larger size. Essentially, it **will not** act like the [Upscale](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/upscale) function does.

#### Example 2: Shrinking a large image or generating in a smaller generation window than the canvas grid

Now, you place a large photo (800 x 800 pixels) and shrink it down to half its size (400 x 400 pixels):

* **On the canvas**: It looks smaller but very clear and possibly sharper than the ones around that were not resized.
* **When downloaded**: This area will loose its sharpness and some details because the grid will have to transform an image from 800 x 800 pixels to 400 x 400 pixels, loosing details in the process.&#x20;

**In simple terms**: The final image you download captures everything within the download area roughly as it appears when the canvas is viewed at 100% zoom, but the overall resolution is determined by the canvas grid.

**For best results**

* **Avoid excessive resizing**: Don’t enlarge small images too much or shrink large images significantly.
* **Use appropriate generation window sizes**: When generating images, try to use generation windows that are not overly big or small relative to the canvas' pixel grid. Try to reach a good balance when, for example, you are fixing defect part of an image by using a smaller generation window than the original image.


# Extend

Extend, also known as outpainting, lets you expand your image beyond its original edges. It can also modify existing parts of the image, similar to Magic Fill.

## How to Use Extend

{% hint style="info" %}
It is best to review the [Canvas](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview) page beforehand to gain a better understanding of its interface and various elements. This will help you more easily follow the steps in the examples shown below.
{% endhint %}

### Extending an Image

In the example below, the Extend function is used to generate a visual extension and add context that seamlessly blends around the main image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F8ZEcu2wAnnflBzFn6Fvi%2FCookies%20-%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=86fb4586-e5ee-439b-ab61-77cd8dfb9208" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure>

Here's how to do it:

1. Open or import the image in Canvas.
2. Click the Extend button on the left-side panel.
3. Reposition and resize the Extend generation window around the original image, leaving empty space around it where you want to add to the original image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FaDbTsCtTs2qib3OA1PJT%2FCookies%20-%20inpaint.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=e626255e-92c6-495a-bf8d-c5d75b092b3e" alt=""><figcaption><p>Placement of the original image within the frame and the empty space left around it.</p></figcaption></figure>

4. Write a detailed prompt containing all visual aspect of the final image you want.

Here's the prompt used: `A photo of a young boy holding a chocolate chip cookie beside a rustic kitchen table with a cookie jar full of cookies, a plate with two cookies and a glass of milk. He is wearing a white t-shirt and green overalls. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting with a neutral color palette.`

5. Adjust any additional options, like Style and Magic Prompt, as desired.
6. Click Extend to generate the images.
7. Once the process is complete, you can cycle through the four generated images by selecting the generated image and clicking the left or right arrow in the menu at the bottom of the image.

### Refining While Extending an Image

In this example, two modifications will be done at the same time:

## Advanced and Creative Examples

The Extend tool can be used creatively to achieve impressive results. The examples below demonstrate how using the tool in creative ways can lead to surprising outcomes. For example, you can take an image of an object and create a whole environment around it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The advanced techniques presented below sometimes push the tool to its limits. They are more about creative exploration and achieving good results can be challenging at times. Indeed, many factors influence the final rendering of the image like the prompt, the original image, the options used, etc.

Experimenting with prompts and different options is often essential, but even then, results may vary. If you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help in the [#prompt-w-friend](https://discord.com/channels/1106248220687994911/1145120589955223602) channel on our Discord server. Simply share your prompt, the generated image, and a brief description of the issue. Other users may be able to help you achieve better results.
{% endhint %}

### Generate Context Around an Object

In this example, a whole environment will be created around the image of a wine bottle.

Here's how to do it:

1. Upload or copy/paste your image in Canvas.
2. If possible, use the remove background tool to get a transparent background.
   1. Alternatively, you can mask out the areas around the object manually using the mask tools that will be available in the Extend tool after the next step.
3. Click the Extend tool on the left-side panel.
4. Reposition and resize the Extend generation window to your liking with the object inside the generation window.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fsji5lf8mZo42mssSiKUE%2FWine%201%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=df01cc76-dc98-4fe0-a9fb-8fa046ab7296" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The original wine bottle image.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FAvIk70AgubPT22y6dxGd%2FWine%202%20Inpaint.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=f6b21e3a-c207-483f-bb78-4ec4251296f7" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Background removed and bottle placed in the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

5. Write a detailed prompt that describe the image to be generated in details. Prompt used: `A bottle of red wine labeled 'CASTLE CELLARS' is in a dimly lit room, featuring a wooden table and a candle. A glass of wine is near the bottle, and a cork is on the wooden surface. In the background, there are red and blue grapes. The label is embossed with intricate designs and the castle logo is prominently displayed in the center.`
6. Select the image and use the arrows at the bottom to view all four generated images and choose the one you like.

### Same Subject in Another Image Style

In the example below, a woman in a photo will be transformed into a caricature.

Here's how:

1. Open, upload or copy/paste your image in Canvas.
   1. It might be a good idea to have a good description of that image. If a prompt or description isn't already available, use the Describe feature to get one provided by the AI. It will be used later.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FjzGtAuOqZ7f1h7cnTNyf%2FTransfo%201%20Original.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f02a1f41-68ff-4d1d-bfd2-b1fda5dd7d16" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. Click Extend then resize an position the generation window in a way where the original image will be on one side and the other side will be about the same size as the original image.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FWR9yS6WTiGwdXHwbRFMW%2FTransfo%202%20Generation%20Window.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=23bccd72-301b-4312-8034-4f291991bdc8" alt=""><figcaption><p>The generation window adjusted to overlap the original image and extend on the right side.</p></figcaption></figure>

3. Write a detailed prompt that describe both the original image and the image you want to generate.

Prompt used: `On the left, a woman with long, wavy, light brown hair and glasses. On the right, a hand drawn funny caricature portraying the same woman.`

Style used: General

4. Select the image and use the arrows at the bottom to view all four generated images and choose the one you like.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FW4ACSEEPipZWcq7PlURY%2FTransfo%20Caricature.png?alt=media&#x26;token=58a0445e-1a00-494e-b70b-1af7a683dddf" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Final image as caricature.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Tips and Tricks for Best Results

Achieving great results with **Magic Fill** and **Extend**, especially with advanced techniques, takes a mix of creativity, experimentation, and a bit of patience. Here are some key factors that can impact the final outcome:

* **Craft precise and detailed prompts** – Clarity in wording helps the AI understand what to generate.
* **Experiment with synonyms and rephrase** - Changing a few words or testing different ways of expressing the same idea in a prompt can make big difference.
* **Start with a high-quality image** – The better the input, the better the output.
* **Consider the complexity of the image** – Simpler modifications often yield more accurate results.
* **Optimize the generation window size** – Keeping it as small as possible while including enough context leads to sharper and more realistic outcomes.
* **Manage your expectations** – AI-generated results can vary, so refining your approach and testing different options is key to success.

By experimenting with different approaches, adjusting prompts, and fine-tuning generation settings, you can push the boundaries of what's possible and create stunning images.


# Generate & Remix

## Generate

The **Generate** function in **Canvas** works just like it does in the standard website UI. You provide a detailed description of what you want to see, adjust some options, and the AI generates four images based on your input.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxnV7dxqo75SDJqXjBSI6%2FMadame%20Cafe%CC%81%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4ecbc6d3-b6a8-4080-928b-aea561542050" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpMV7MUvBnztNgSBhGpq2%2FA%20photo%20of%20an%20elder%20man%20with%20a%20beard%20with%20a%20thou%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e3fa1a08-e1d8-48d2-8fc0-ad94b6956ea0" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>The available options when using Generate in Canvas.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Remix

The **Remix** function in **Canvas** is similar to the standard Remix but offers more flexibility. You can select a specific portion of an image or composition using the generation window and remix just that area.

#### Example

Suppose you want to create a close-up of a particular image, such as the face of a thinking man.

* Click the **Select** tool on the left-side panel.
* Use the generation window to adjust the bounding box around the part of the image you want to remix. You can change the size and aspect ratio.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F6cBmUxydhMX6mg79RUee%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2f5c208d-9de4-437d-823d-f0d01285affe" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>You can make a selection using the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

* Enter a prompt that describes the desired result and adjust the options to your liking. Modify the Image Weight slider as needed.

# Magic Fill

Magic Fill, also known as inpainting, allows you to modify a part of an image while keeping the rest intact.

Using Magic Fill is a simple two-step process:

1. Create a mask using the [**Masking Tools**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#masking-options) over the areas you want to modify.
2. Adjust the generation window and available options in the **Prompt box**, then click **Magic Fill**.

## How to Use Magic Fill

### Replacing and Adding an Element

In the example below, the glass of water will be replaced by a glass of milk while a watch will be added to her left wrist.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FIL3fqLAebEhH8eeHqiO1%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1ad34626-69ef-47b2-b63d-7978e25abc95" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The original image to be modified.</p></figcaption></figure>

Here’s how:

1. Click the Magic Fill button on the left-side panel.
2. Using the [**Masking Tools**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#masking-options)**,** Mask the hand holding the glass of water and the area where the watch should be placed.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fm6iirTJ3hzg8bAIkroVp%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5343992a-66c4-44d2-8372-154ccb8316ba" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The masked <strong>areas</strong> of the image.</p></figcaption></figure>

3. Click Next to access the Magic Fill options at the top of the canvas.
4. Adjust the generation window to include both masked areas and some surrounding image content for context. In this case, the whole image area was used.
5. Enter a prompt describing the scene and the desired modifications. In this example:\
   `A photo of a middle-aged woman with short hair holding a glass of milk in a modern, white kitchen with wooden countertops. She is wearing a blue shirt, a necklace and a watch...`

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F887agoJrooCstOeEv8Pd%2FMadame%20Cafe%CC%81%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3463dc08-84ed-45d7-a836-016a80af4fa2" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FMY0KSeB0JSUbqmkOxBkI%2FMadame%20Cafe%CC%81%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=57fe38f0-c389-4754-b7bd-56aad866732e" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Adding Elements

In the example below, an image of a rabbit was generated first in Ideogram as a starting image. Using Magic Fill, a basket of carrots is added in the background, and a carrot is placed in front of the rabbit.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FomDGyiCUPiZfg0uTUiqK%2FUntitled%20Feb%204%20217%20PM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3b6be647-9fd6-4476-9cc7-9f08c22074ed" alt=""><figcaption><p>Starting image.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7Ud5bYjm8Dz0b77iNb06%2FUntitled%20Feb%204%20217%20PM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0c9255d0-0eee-4ed3-a6b7-3ad179cf3458" alt=""><figcaption><p>Masked areas.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FEZhSotB9Sn9eegYLOKYJ%2FUntitled%20Feb%204%20217%20PM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c71a778c-e804-4281-aa2f-a8cf7f94cabc" alt=""><figcaption><p>Resulting Magic Fill image.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Original prompt: `Photo of a rabbit in a beautiful garden.`&#x20;

Magic Fill prompt: `Photo of a rabbit in a beautiful garden. There is a basket with carrots in the background and a big carrot in front of the rabbit.`

***

### Making Variations on an Element

Magic Fill can also be used to create variations of specific details while keeping other elements unchanged

For example, a woman’s hair color can be altered without modifying her face or the rest of the image.

The prompt used to generate the original image was modified each time in Magic Fill to request a different hair color.

### Fixing Parts of an Image

Magic Fill is great for refining AI-generated images where small details like faces and hands may appear distorted due to the limited number of pixels.

Here’s how to easily fix those issues using Magic Fill.

Below is an image generated with Ideogram v2.0 using a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024 × 1024 pixels). The original prompt was: `A dynamic photo of a family standing on the lawn in front of a well-maintained house. The sky is clear with scattered clouds. Overlaying the top of the image, there's a text that reads 'Welcome' in a curvy font. The family consists of four members in that order: a young boy, a father, a mother and a teenager girl. The house in the background has a classic design with a gabled roof.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FV1piELRiQjaKr5g6d6eV%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e01b6855-7e47-4d5d-a4c1-723e5a8a6fe3" alt=""><figcaption><p>Original image generated with a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024 × 1024 pixels).</p></figcaption></figure>

Notice how the faces and hands appear very small in relation to the whole image. Because of this, the AI had difficulty rendering them correctly.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FwsPJM8q7xzzVa3ZplbU4%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png%20%40%20400%20(RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b269bedf-dade-4f19-95e9-97ad85610b31" alt=""><figcaption><p>400% zoomed-in detailed view.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FuHLpoGPd0XO92owvIRjS%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png%20%40%20400%20(RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=21e2e1d2-25dc-4106-bc7b-98087852a992" alt=""><figcaption><p>400% zoomed-in detailed view.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FIYuOqWU5bEgdNVQ7vOPg%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%201.png%20%40%20400%20(RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=86a238b2-e2bc-4120-a87d-d00d2d22c6d0" alt=""><figcaption><p>400% zoomed-in detailed view.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

To fix this:

* Mask the areas that need correction.
* Adjust the generation window to be as small as possible, covering all masked areas while keeping some unmasked visual references to help the AI understand the context.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because the aspect ratio dictates the dimensions (in pixels) of the generated image, it can be leveraged to improve pixel density in specific areas. This technique is particularly useful for fixing small details that were not properly rendered in the original image.
{% endhint %}

In the example below, the generation window boundaries has a custom aspect ratio of 17:14, thus a dimension of 1088 × 986 pixels. The AI will have more pixels to work with for generating the faces and hands in masked areas.

The prompt was also simplified to reflect only the content within the generation window: `A dynamic photo of a family standing on the lawn in front of a well-maintained house. The family consists of four members in that order: a young boy, a father, a mother and a teenager girl.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FJu1l4QuakdQ0MAxAY2DP%2FA%20dynamic%20photo%20of%20a%20family%20standing%20on%20the%20lawn%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=be18e770-0fb8-4344-bfde-28a700d9c3ad" alt=""><figcaption><p>Masked areas to be generated. The generation window is kept as small as possible to achieve greater pixel density.</p></figcaption></figure>

The AI generated the updated image directly over the original, modifying only the masked parts while leaving the rest intact.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fegz5Rv7MeweRYK1gU8Zi%2FA%20dynamic%20photo%20of%20a%20family%20standing%20on%20the%20lawn%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8e119995-1b91-40e0-b683-a606202aff95" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

While the faces now look significantly better, there is still room for improvement—particularly for the father holding his son’s hand. To refine this further:

* Mask that specific part of the image again.
* Resize the generation window to be even smaller.
* Ensure the young boy is included in the generation window to provide the AI with proper proportions and context.

This time, the generation window was set to a 1:1 aspect ratio, meaning the newly generated section had a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FrsbfYoIgmM7HyJ63H9xZ%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%20intermediaire.png%20%40%20400%20(Layer%201%20RGB8%23)%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d0d76e18-3759-4c36-98c7-1eb14f0183d8" alt=""><figcaption><p>The hands still require some adjustment.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FSVtFC9Uo760ZGoPWY39H%2FA%20dynamic%20photo%20of%20a%20family%20standing%20on%20the%20lawn%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=919dd91a-cb32-4a8a-b11e-180162bfbed4" alt=""><figcaption><p>The masked area and the small generation window. </p></figcaption></figure></div>

The final image below was downloaded using the Download feature. While the downloaded image retained a 1024 × 1024 resolution, areas with a higher pixel density were downscaled but still preserved the improvements made.

For more details on resolution and pixel density in Canvas, refer to the last two sections of the [Canvas documentation](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas-overview#canvas-and-image-sizes).

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FUx7Y8vOosjDf8o5pMmkg%2FMagic%20Fill%20-%20Family%20final.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0c73453d-9484-4445-acea-7a70cca5e5ec" alt=""><figcaption><p>The final image.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Getting even better results**

To further enhance image quality, consider using the Upscale feature before attempting any fixes. This will provide the AI with up to twice as many pixels to work with for the same selected area.

Keep in mind:

• The generation window has a fixed number of pixels based on its aspect ratio.

• If you upscale a 1:1 image (e.g., from 1024 × 1024 to 2048 × 2048), then use Magic Fill at a 1:1 aspect ratio (which generates a 1024 × 1024 image), it’s best to keep the generation window under half the size—both horizontally and vertically—of the upscaled image for optimal results.

## Advanced and Creative Examples

Magic Fill can be used creatively to achieve impressive results. The examples below demonstrate how pushing the limits of the tool can lead to surprising outcomes. For example, you can take an image of a product and seamlessly integrate it into another existing image.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The advanced techniques presented below sometimes push the tool to its limits. They are more about creative exploration and achieving good results can be challenging at times. Indeed, many factors influence the final rendering of the image like the prompt, the original image, the options used, etc.

Experimenting with prompts and different options is often essential, but even then, results may vary. If you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help in the [#prompt-w-friend](https://discord.com/channels/1106248220687994911/1145120589955223602) channel on our Discord server. Simply share your prompt, the generated image, and a brief description of the issue. Other users may be able to help you achieve better results.

### Inserting an Item from One Image into Another

In the example below, there is a photo of a decorative pillow with a geometric pattern and an image of a loveseat with some pillows in a living room. The goal is to modify the loveseat pillows so they match the design of the patterned pillow.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FbpfHOqDVlTqOEiQpAal7%2FUntitled%20Feb%2012%201156%20AM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=240c95bd-516f-48a7-85be-21e04bef6598" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FhDr3L9wKV0gy3jlQeXci%2FUntitled%20Feb%2012%201156%20AM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c4fef874-521b-497c-8257-cd841153d234" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

1. Obtain a good description of both images.
   1. These descriptions will later be merged and optimized into a single prompt.
   2. If the image was generated directly in Ideogram, you can reuse the original prompt.
   3. If not, it is strongly recommended to use the Describe feature to generate an accurate description.
2. Place the two images side by side and resize one if necessary.
3. Click Magic Fill and mask the pillows in the loveseat image.
4. Click Next and adjust the generation window to cover:
   1. The entire pillow with the geometric pattern image.
   2. The masked area and a sufficient portion of the loveseat image to provide proper context.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPIYmo0ymgyQrzHe7VzcF%2FUntitled%20Feb%2012%201156%20AM%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e4e9f10d-b521-4434-ba18-73c8e0e6a8d7" alt=""><figcaption><p>The masked pillow on the right and the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

5. Merge and optimize the descriptions of both images:
   1. Description of the patterned pillow: `A decorative pillow with a geometric pattern. The primary color of the pillow is a soft and dark olive green, and the pattern consists of intertwined white lines forming intricate designs. The design appears symmetrical, with two mirrored patterns on either side of the pillow. The pillow is on a white background.`
   2. Prompt used to generate the loveseat image: `A close-up view of a cozy loveseat, without any pillow, in a modern living room. There are a few soft and dark olive green accents.`
   3. Merged and optimized prompt: **`On the left`**`, a decorative pillow with a geometric pattern. The primary color of the pillow is a soft and dark olive green, and the pattern consists of intertwined white lines forming intricate designs. The design appears symmetrical, with two mirrored patterns on either side of the pillow.`` `**`On the right`**`, a close-up view of a cozy loveseat with two pillows like the one on the left.`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why optimize the prompt?**

* The revised prompt removes unnecessary details and focuses on the most relevant elements for the AI.
* The pillow description is detailed since it is the main element being generated.
* The background context remains slightly less detailed, as long as it provides enough visual reference.
  {% endhint %}

6. Adjust other options such as Style and Magic Prompt (it is recommended not to use Magic Prompt, as it might alter your optimized prompt)
7. Click Magic Fill and wait for the generation to complete.
8. Once the image is generated, click on it to cycle through the four generated variations using the arrows at the bottom.

### Integrate Text and Logos in Images

It’s easy to overlay text on an image using the Text tool in Canvas, but seamlessly integrating text into the natural elements of an image can be more challenging.

In the example below, the goal is to make it look as if a message is handwritten in the sand on a beach.

Once a beach image is selected, the Text tool is used to choose a suitable font and position the text where it should appear in the final image.

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxkOxl9ChMs6CV76rGypw%2FText%20on%20the%20beach%201.png?alt=media&#x26;token=20177f01-e03d-4374-8529-7b5b6e3f54bc" alt=""><figcaption><p>The original image.</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FjN4VOcaPMob5GWGLrB3s%2FA%20close-up%20bird%20eye%20view%20of%20an%20undisturbed%20sandy%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d603ab43-f27a-460f-829e-29aab2ab124b" alt=""><figcaption><p>Positioning the text on the image.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

At this point, the text itself cannot be used directly to create the writing effect in the sand. Instead, follow these steps before proceeding to Magic Fill:

1. Move the text aside and make it completely black.
2. Use Remix on the text, setting the image weight to 100.\
   \&#xNAN;*This is necessary because a text box cannot be used directly in this technique—it must first be converted into an image.*
3. Place the newly created image near the beach image.

Now, apply the same technique used in the first example:

* Mask the area where the text should appear in the beach image.
* Adjust the Magic Fill generation window to include both the masked area and the black text image, ensuring the AI understands the reference.

Here's the prompt that was used:

**`On the left`**`, a text saying "Time for a little vacation?".`` `**`On the right`**`, the same text in the same style, roughly written by hand in the sand of an undisturbed sandy beach with seashells and other objects.`

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FHIiecse63rpLJXnbANKf%2FA%20close-up%20bird%20eye%20view%20of%20an%20undisturbed%20sandy%E2%80%A6%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=da608baf-750f-4add-a812-26733121c1f8" alt=""><figcaption><p>The rendered text on the left and the masked area on the right, both encompassed within the generation window.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important notes**

The final image may appear more blurry or pixelated compared to the original. This happens because the Magic Fill-generated section is often about twice the size of the original image.

**Why does this happen?**

The total number of pixels remains constant for any aspect ratio, regardless of the generation window size on the canvas. This is a current limitation of this technique.

However, to achieve the best possible results, consider the following:

* Minimize the generation window
  * Keep it as small as possible while maintaining enough visual context for the AI.
* Reduce the size of the reference text or object
  * The AI can work with a smaller image as long as the prompt description is detailed enough.
  * Reducing the reference image by half often works just as well while helping shrink the generation window.
* Use the Upscale feature on the final image
  * Upscale makes the image larger and sharper.
  * Don’t forget to provide a detailed prompt when using Upscale for the best results.
    {% endhint %}

Here’s another example where text was integrated as embroidery on a baseball cap using the same technique.

Here's the prompt that was used: **`On the right`**`, the word "Baseball" written in a bold script font.`` `**`On the left`**`, the same word and font style than the one on the right but embroidered in red on the front of a baseball cap.`

Finally, using the same technique, it’s easy to integrate a logo onto an object.

Here's the prompt used for the example above: **`On the left`**`, logo for a brand of beer named "Iron Helm". At the center of the logo is a detailed illustration of a knight's helmet, which appears to be made of metal with rivets and a nose guard. The helmet is depicted in a frontal view. The logo is enclosed within a shield-like emblem, which is predominantly dark red and white.`` `**`On the right`**`, the exact same logo on a glass of beer.`

### Product Placement

In this example, a perfume bottle from a photo will be integrated into two different scenes:

1. A studio photography setup.
2. An image where a woman holds the bottle.

The original image of the perfume bottle was generated in Ideogram, but any image could be used. There is no need to remove the background, as long as the image isn’t cluttered with other objects.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FJZd75BZAH2mCt0Styr3F%2FProduct%201%20-%20Bottle.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9e52dde7-4e85-4b28-ba61-95461b313421" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Original image to be integrated, generated with Ideogram.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Integrating the perfume bottle into a studio setup

Using the same technique as described in the previous examples:

* An area was masked where the bottle should be integrated.
* A part of a plate was also masked, allowing the AI to transform it into a more suitable pedestal, which it successfully did.

The perfume bottle image was placed on the left side of the studio setup image, and the generation window was made as small as possible while keeping some context.

Prompt used: **`To the left`**`, a perfume bottle for women named 'Azure' stands out prominently. The bottle has a gem-like, faceted design, predominantly blue with a silver cap and a black neck. The word 'AZURE' is prominently displayed on both the bottle and the neck.`` `**`On the right`**`, a close-up view of the same bottle is captured, placed atop a short white pedestal in a studio photography setup.`

Note the subtle shadow and reflection.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

#### Integrating the perfume bottle into a lifestyle scene

For the next integration, an image of a woman holding a perfume bottle was generated in Ideogram. The goal was to create a suitable scene for integration.

As before:

* The perfume bottle image was placed to the left of the woman’s image.
* The affected areas (her hands and the existing bottle) were masked.
* The generation window was made as small as possible while keeping enough context for the AI, including part of the face and the base of the hands.

Prompt used: **`On the left`**`, a woman’s perfume bottle named 'Azure' features a unique, faceted design. The bottle is predominantly blue, with a silver cap and a black neck. The word 'AZURE' is prominently displayed on both the bottle and the neck.`` `**`On the right`**`, a chic woman holds the very same bottle of perfume.`

## Tips and Tricks for Best Results

Achieving great results with **Magic Fill** and **Extend**, especially with advanced techniques, takes a mix of creativity, experimentation, and a bit of patience. Here are some key factors that can impact the final outcome:

* **Craft precise and detailed prompts** – Clarity in wording helps the AI understand what to generate.
* **Experiment with synonyms and rephrase** - Changing a few words or testing different ways of expressing the same idea in a prompt can make big difference.
* **Start with a high-quality image** – The better the input, the better the output.
* **Consider the complexity of the image** – Simpler modifications often yield more accurate results.
* **Optimize the generation window size** – Keeping it as small as possible while including enough context leads to sharper and more realistic outcomes.
* **Manage your expectations** – AI-generated results can vary, so refining your approach and testing different options is key to success.

By experimenting with different approaches, adjusting prompts, and fine-tuning generation settings, you can push the boundaries of what's possible and create stunning images.


# Text Tool

Part of the [Canvas](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview) feature, feature, the text tool adds text to an image or a composition on the canvas. Depending on how you use the feature—by writing, remixing, etc.—it might be really useful to:

1. Write formatted text the way you want, without any errors.
2. Get a specific typography style.
3. Replace/add text when it is not possible to do so via a prompt.
4. Add text in Ideogram rather than having to switch to another third-party app.
5. And more...

## Writing Text

1. While in Canvas, click the **Text tool** icon in the left-side panel.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FBYre95OACCfJlsg225dv%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=337eafe1-5c45-4387-b82a-2dc93e0f0269" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FlIL5jKEpOzlXulv6fXWq%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d11a42f0-2b73-4f2b-ba41-4c8e12155dac" alt="" width="96"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Click on the canvas to place the text at that position. A text box will then be placed on the canvas with a placeholder text already selected.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FpAbb2MS8hg6vJw7fxd3f%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=17b854a5-82f9-4bf1-8bb0-48bbc6056643" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Type in the text you want to write.

## Text Options

When the text box is selected you get access to different options in the right-side panel.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7kbfcDU5MpyJwHL4kZQB%2FPhoto%20of%20a%20rabbit%20in%20a%20garden%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4d5c0bf3-9100-4932-bec3-6f3ca030a0af" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F31m1mUnHOsEH6mcvGm87%2FPhoto%20of%20a%20rabbit%20in%20a%20garden%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=183b9e0d-fa72-4596-99cd-f9ac46094308" alt="" width="366"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These options will enable you to:

* Select the font you want from a pop-up menu.
* Adjust the size of the text.
* Choose the font weight if different weights are available.
* Apply bold and italic text formatting.
* Align the text.
* Choose or change the color of the text.
* Arrange the text box relative to other elements: Bring to front/forward, Send to back/backward.

Most of these options can be applied to the whole text box at once or to specific words or letters.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FJeTPplBpZruRiKMuSaJA%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=b87c923d-3001-4d54-b31e-aa11c401ba81" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of different colors and font weight applied on text.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Example

Of course, it would be easy to add text to an image using the Text tool. However, let’s explore a way to use it more creatively.

1. Generate or upload an image in [Canvas](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview). It’s important to have either the prompt used to generate the image or to run the Describe function on an uploaded image to get a suitable starting prompt.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FFvT2L2tWv7Hkbr1NX5II%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7134cbf3-6af5-4600-9ecf-e3f0b68fdbda" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. With the Type tool, write the text you want to appear. Choose your preferred font and adjust the size and color to your liking.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FhZdTjdmz9e7KvEL9G7Yt%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ceba4661-50d4-447f-b947-c4a29ac55976" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Use the Remix tool and adjust the generation window exactly over the originale image and text.

Here are the settings used to create the two images below:

**Prompt**: *A photo of a plain, dull dark blue baseball cap. The text: "Baseball" is embroidered in tan color on the front. The cap is placed on a wooden surface. The background is clean and neutral.*\
**Image weight**: 60-70/100 (your value may vary)\
**Style**: General\
**Magic Prompt**: Off\
**Color**: Auto

<div><figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FWz4UDzj3yESBjprucj2U%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=dad2fef7-dbb8-413e-8128-dc4a38b972d9" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FGeEa8qdQjDcgGWRnouLO%2FUntitled%20canvas%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=300fa854-a4a9-4b0a-8193-feb46114698b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Because this technique uses Remix, the generated image is expected to be slightly different from the original. However, it has the advantage of maintaining a font style very similar to the original without requiring a detailed description. Additionally, it realistically makes the design appear embroidered on the baseball cap.


# Editor

With Ideogram’s Editor feature, you can modify an image as you see fit, including cropping, resizing, tweaking, and making adjustments that will be considered along with your prompt the next time you remix it. You can even use it to design, from scratch, the visual composition of the image you want to achieve.

## How to Access the Feature

4. **Crop**: When you are ready to crop your image, save it and return to the Editor.

## Examples

### Draw an Image from Scratch

You can use the editor to create any image from scratch and let Ideogram generate an enhanced version based on your drawing and prompt.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FCUFRnwnCphxUzuO8TGxB%2F01%20-%20Sketch.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e3ddd70f-2121-4ce9-a183-fb1b076ec542" alt=""><figcaption><p>Basic drawing representing the subject, colour and composition of the elements of the prompt.</p></figcaption></figure>

Once the drawing is complete and saved, simply run a remix on it using a suitable prompt to describe what you want in the final image.

**Prompt:** *Illustration of a frog on a country road at sunset.* \
**Model**: Ideogram version 2.0 \
**Remixed image weight** of 45/100\
**Magic Prompt**: Off\
**Style**: General\
**Rendering**: Default

Result:

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FRJ44mgYZDRKcNNqQEtCH%2F02-Frog.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4df18062-729f-4705-be27-f7d3e93bc563" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Remove Unwanted Elements

You can remove unwanted elements from the image by using the pen tool and selecting the background color. In this example, the placeholder text on the menu design was removed, leaving space for a blank copywriting area.

In this case, the little spots around the pets were removed and a little patch of gold/brown removed from the dog's fur.

# Image Upload

Available to users on the Ideogram Plus plan and higher, the Image Upload feature allows you to upload your own images to Ideogram and use them in various ways.

## Uploading an Image

You can upload an image by simply pasting it into the prompt area or by clicking on the **Image upload** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FxCWWXQ3us4HjDU254i1b%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6ef0042e-3762-4252-a6cd-737894de06a7" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F0dn1LcMqBKWVY0MwqYUI%2FIdeogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a158fb11-b7b1-4e12-9279-9f8036129273" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> located on the right side of the prompt box. You can also upload images in **Canvas** as described [here](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas/canvas-overview#uploading-external-images).

{% hint style="info" %}
Uploaded images are private and can be found in the "Creations" section of the website or in the "Private" section of your profile page.
{% endhint %}

You will then be presented with three options:

1. [**Describe**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe): This option will use AI to generate a description of your image and use it as a prompt without retaining the original image.
2. [**Remix**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix): This option will also describe the uploaded image but will retain the image as a base for generating the new one.
3. [**Upscale**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/upscale): This option is used to enhance your image to a higher resolution.
4. **Style reference**: Use the image as a style reference when generating images.
5. Open in [**Canvas**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/canvas-overview): Open image in Canvas. You can alternatively click on the down arrow to:
   1. Select [**Magic Fill**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/magic-fill) to set-up Magic Fill with the image in Canvas.
   2. Select [**Extend**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/canvas/extend) to use Extend with the image in Canvas.
6. [**Remove bg**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/replace-or-remove-background): This option will remove the background from the main subject of the image.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FTO8sVJHwj93khBYls0Iw%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a1cc7afe-71fb-481d-abdb-3a99075d2431" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FTlgpSmymILapD5qsACo1%2FIdeogram%20%E2%80%93%20phil_ozoff%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e6c28925-da68-40c7-bb84-e0ba7b32b365" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this example, we will choose the **Remix** option.&#x20;

Selecting the [**Remix**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/remix) option keeps the image in the prompt area, allowing it to be used as a base for the next remixed image. Additionally, the AI automatically provides a description of your image by using the [**Describe**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) function, which can serve as the starting point for your prompt.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note a notification at the top of the prompt might appear when your image doesn't have a dimension similar to a default aspect ratio. It will indicate that your image will be automatically cropped to the nearest supported aspect ratio in Ideogram. If you wish to adjust the image manually before remixing, consider using the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor).
{% endhint %}

Once you have adjusted all the parameters and the prompt to your liking, simply press the "Remix" button to generate the image.

In this example, the prompt was modified to reflect the desired image and used in conjunction with the [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) feature to produce the result shown in the image below.

### Metrics Used

The metrics used to determine how titles are awarded include, but are not limited to:

* Total number of generations created
* Total number of distinct users that liked your generations
* Total number of followers
* Total number of times your generations have been remixed by other users

These metrics are computed on a weekly basis, and titles are assigned to the top users in each category for one week.

### Perks

By default, users on the free plan have 10 [Slow credits](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans#slow-credits) per week. When you have a title, this number increases:

<table><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Number of Slow credits / Week</th><th data-hidden>Number of Generations</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elite Creator</td><td>500</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Top Creator</td><td>200</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leading Creator</td><td>100</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The [Slow credits](https://docs.ideogram.ai/plans-and-pricing/available-plans#slow-credits) associated with users who have earned a Creator title reset every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (overnight from Friday to Saturday).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a Plus plan and up, these titles won't matter much, as you already have an unlimited number of standard generations.

We're committed to making Ideogram a safe and relaxing experience for everyone. If you don't want to see someone's images and notifications in your feed, you can mute them. They will not be notified that they have been muted by you.

## Muting a Creator

There are three methods to access this feature:

1. **When viewing a user profile page.**

When you're on a user's profile page, click the menu icon  <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FQv2bkEyP7H3Ox3wbdrXJ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ddf39952-d74d-4c02-854d-3bbb2ebf5637" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> , then then click "Mute creator" within the menu.

### The Basic plan is now a legacy plan

Please note that the Basic plan is no longer available for purchase.

* If you already have a Basic plan (legacy), you can continue to keep it until a future deadline (which will be communicated at a later date) or until you cancel — whichever comes first.
* If you cancel, you keep all Basic benefits and privileges until the end of your current billing cycle.
* After cancellation (or once the deadline is reached), the Basic plan can’t be purchased again.
* Existing Basic subscribers will still see the Basic plan on the website’s pricing page, but the plan won’t be visible to anyone else.

## The Credit System

Ideogram uses a credit system for all generations in all available templates and will depend on certain parameters used, such as [Rendering](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed), when generating images.

Ideogram uses a credit system for all image generations. The credit cost depends on various parameters, such as the Rendering setting, which determines the level of detail when generating images. Below are the details:

### Credit Costs

*The* [***Describe***](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/describe) *feature cost 1 credit for users on the free tier* but is free for all paid subscriptions. *The* [***Batch Generation***](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/batch-generation) *tool will only use Priority credits to generate images, based on the selected model and Rendering option above.*

{% hint style="info" %}
The [**Rendering**](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/render-speed) setting allows you to specify how much time the AI should dedicate to working on an image, which affects the level of detail in the final result.
{% endhint %}

### **Priority Credits**

Generations made with **Priority credits** are processed ahead of those made with Slow credits, ensuring minimal to no wait times. Certain tools, such as Batch Generation, exclusively use Priority credits.

### **Slow Credits**

Generations that are made with **Slow credits** may have wait times of up to several minutes, depending on 1- available server capacity and 2- your recent usage of the slow queue since the last billing date. This is to ensure a fair experience for all users in the slow queue.

{% hint style="danger" %} <mark style="color:red;">Any unused Priority credits awarded through the monthly plan will expire at the end of each monthly billing cycle</mark>. However, **Priority credits** purchased as a top-up will roll over to the next month and will only be used after your monthly **Priority credits** are depleted.

If you cancel your subscription, any unused credits will expire at the end of the current billing period. The same applies to Slow credits for existing subscribers on the legacy Basic plan.
{% endhint %}

## Priority Credits Top-Up

When you exhaust your monthly allocation of Priority credits, you automatically switch to using Slow credits. If you wish, you can get more Priority credits by purchasing a Priority credits top-up.&#x20;

#### Benefits:

* Top-up credit packs cost $4 USD each. One pack adds 100 credits to users of the legacy Basic plan, 150 credits to Plus, or 250 credits to Pro/Team, making the cost per credit lowest for Pro/Team users. You may purchase up to 10 packs per transaction.
* Any unused **Priority credits** purchased via a top-up will roll over to the following month and will only be used if you exhaust your monthly Priority credits. These rolled-over credits will continue to carry over month-to-month until they are fully used.

#### Usage order:

Credits will be used in the following order:

Monthly Priority credits  >  Top-up Priority credits  >  Slow credits

#### How to Purchase Top-Up Priority Credits

1. Open the **Profile panel** by clicking your **Profile icon** located at the bottom of the left-side panel of the page.
2. Click on **Top up credits.**

# Team Plan

The **Team** subscription is extremely useful for sharing access to Ideogram with others. Whether it’s for family members, a few partners, or an entire production team, a Team plan enables one paid account to provide access to multiple users.&#x20;

## Overview

Here are some features of the Team subscription:

* **Centralized billing and administration** for multiple members under a single team account.
* **1,500 Priority credits per month** per member.
* Add Priority credits to members with **Top up credits**.
* **Unlimited slow credits** for every member.
* **Full access to all premium features** for you and your team.
* Full access to the **Batch Generation** feature.
* **Add or remove** **team members** as needed.
* And more...

## Team Owner

The **Team owner** is the user who created the team and manages its subscription. They have full control over team settings, including inviting and removing members, allocating more Priority credits to members through the **Top-up credits** feature, and overseeing team activity. The **Team owner** operates under a single account tied to the team subscription and does not have the option to switch to a personal account like the other members of the team.

### Managing the Team

Selecting **Manage team subscription** from the Profile menu, will lead to the team's page similar to the one below. This is where you will be able to do all the management of the team.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FoAOowcX0FaSc9G8zD6TK%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=fd7f7935-0a3f-4e31-ba2e-e780b0cfc3fe" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FqukObBISjNk55fDu1DzI%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4533c0ee-7eaf-46fe-8f7e-ea4c5452d551" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>The Manage team subscription page.</p></figcaption></figure>

On the team's page, you will be able to:

1. **Set or change** your team's name and icon.
2. **View** and **manage** your subscription and billing.
3. **Manage** your team members.
   1. Invite members to join the team.
   2. Top up members' credits if necessary.
   3. Remove members from the team.

### Managing Billing

To manage the billing of the Team subscription, navigate to the Team’s page by clicking your **Profile icon** located at the bottom of the left-side panel and selecting **Manage team subscription.** From there, click on the **Manage Billing** button to access the billing information for the account.

### Inviting New Members

1. Click on **Invite members** on the team's page. An invite modal window will appear like the example below.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FciXvtKK4qUTMLYOvF52t%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=933a0464-1d65-4f71-bd9c-a91cc2b0a8f5" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Fyc7oA34C61GDah0Fxdq4%2FTeam&#x27;s%20name%20%E2%80%93%20Ideogram%20-%20Light%20Dark%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=50cdbf1b-6f89-4e85-94ff-c3c5d169865b" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>The modal window to invite new members to your team.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. You can invite a member in two ways:
   1. **By username**
      1. The username is the unique identifier for a person on Ideogram. It appears at the top when you click on your profile icon. As you enter the username, a list of user accounts may appear—ensure you select the correct one before sending the invitation. The person will receive an email and a notification in Ideogram, inviting them to join your team as a member.
   2. **By email**
      1. If the person is already on Ideogram and the email you specified to invite them is already associated with their account (via Google or Apple), they will receive **both an email and a notification** inviting them to join your team.
      2. If the person **is not** yet on Ideogram, they will receive **an email** inviting them to create an account (using Google or Apple) before joining your team.
3. Once the invitation is sent, a new row will appear in the member list with the status “Pending”, indicating that the person has not yet joined.
4. At the moment a member joins the team, they will immediately have all the privileges of team membership, **and the Team account will be charged for an additional member**.

### Managing Team Members

To top up credits for a particular member or remove a member from your team, click on the **More** icon <picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F3Ks1Q3ZANIcb52iR6lgs%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.45.56%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=548d57b2-b767-419d-9107-63c173c74315" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FASmJIf2Iinfih7gkJRNF%2FCleanShot%202024-07-18%20at%2016.46.07%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a347c007-cd25-4e9e-a9cf-9d2b9893500c" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> located at the right end of the member's row.

1. Select **Top up credits** to buy **Priority credits** for that member.
2. Choose **Remove from team** to remove a member from your team.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When **removing a member** from the team, <mark style="color:red;">**you will not receive any reimbursement**</mark> for unused credits or time remaining on the subscription.

**Re-inviting** the same user again <mark style="color:red;">**will incur a new charge**</mark> on the subscription.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing Your Team Members Images

Click on a team member’s name to access their profile page. To view images generated by that team member, they must set the image to public, allowing it to appear in the "All tab. They can also pin the image to make them appear in the "Pin" tab, as a mean of image management.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recognize the importance of sharing within the team while not making the image public. The Ideogram the team is working towards solutions to allow that.
{% endhint %}

***

## Team Members

Team members are users who have been invited to a team by the team owner. They receive a set amount of credits and full access to all premium features to generate images. Team members can make their images available for the team to view by setting them to public. They can also pin images for better organization and management within their profile.

### Being Invited

To join the team, they simply need to click the “Join Team” button in the email or select “Accept” in the notification.

### Personal Space vs Team Space

Members of a team can switch between their personal space and the team’s space when generating images. Once selected, the credits used to generate images will be deducted from the chosen account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **Team owner** operates under a single account tied to the team subscription and does not have the option to switch to a personal space like the other members of the team.
{% endhint %}

To switch between spaces, simply click on your profile icon, then select either your team’s name or “Personal” to choose the account you want to use. In the example below, the member also has a personal Plus subscription. Note how the number of Priority credits differs between the team space and the personal space.

A quick way to check which space you are currently using is to look at your profile icon. If it contains a square with the first letter of your team’s name, then you are using the team space. Otherwise, you are in your personal space.

## Generating Images

Generating images with a team account is the very same as generating images with a personal account. The only differences are:

* You are using your Team's account credits instead of your own.
* You'll have to make the images public so the other members can see them.


# Ideogram API

The Ideogram API offers powerful image generation and editing capabilities for developers and businesses looking to integrate Ideogram into their applications.

Read our API Docs to learn more: <https://developer.ideogram.ai>

Review API pricing here: <https://about.ideogram.ai/api-pricing>

## Signup&#x20;

To set up or access the Ideogram API, you first need to log in to your [Ideogram user account](https://ideogram.ai/). If you don’t have an account, you can easily create one by following [these steps](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/getting-started/signup-and-registration).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Ideogram user subscriptions and API accounts are separate, each with its own payment system. Please note that you must log in to your Ideogram user account (which can be a free account) to set up or access your API account.
{% endhint %}

Once logged in, click your **Profile icon**, located at the bottom of the left-side panel, to access the **Profile panel** and then select **API Beta**.

You will need then need to accept the [Developer API Agreement and Policy](https://about.ideogram.ai/api-tos) to proceed.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FFhklauRSbOOcsVT1FMww%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.08.10%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f1b32de0-1d40-468f-a0f5-23a2ce76079e" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FNqKKsbxxvMnTdJ3vmqdU%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.07.52%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=154e0451-1d34-4fee-babf-2ebdec7da226" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption><p>You need to accept the Developer API Agreement and Policy before continuing with the signup process.</p></figcaption></figure>

After accepting the agreement, you will be directed to the API dashboard. Select the "Manage Payment" button in the lower left corner to add your payment information, which will be linked and used to fund your API credit balance.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Foz4tNLFh3SlFhfnoyjPa%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.25.21%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=57a43ff1-e0c0-478d-b7fe-82d673c5b766" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FPbnGKbP05kFlDq62oVo5%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2009.25.04%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=cd264005-941b-4ec4-b651-fcea9e734074" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, choose whether you are using the API for personal or business purposes.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FcC6lWLl9eRaY9TIpqljZ%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2010.40.39%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=eef13563-92d6-4b5c-a1e2-eda739686744" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FMCs8DBTq2R8qLmPeeLy5%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2010.40.25%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=79df00b0-f849-4095-a2db-4f296d292f45" alt="" width="563"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will then be forwarded to the payment page, where you will need to provide all necessary payment information. You will only be charged when you create your first API key.

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FtydERQ4FMjjFKdT2w1p6%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2010.59.40%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d498c328-a22a-4e4b-ae3b-4dd483fbb3c8" alt=""><figcaption><p>Provide all payment information here.

## Generating an API Key

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT**:\
• The full API key <mark style="color:red;">**will only be shown to you once**</mark>, at the time of its creation. You need to store it in a safe place immediately, as it will not be displayed again afterward.

• Generating the API key may take some time. Please <mark style="color:red;">**do not refresh or close the window**</mark> until the process is complete.
{% endhint %}

At this point, you will be ready to create your first API key, which will trigger an initial funding that will be added to your balance. As you use the API, funds will be deducted from your credit balance based on our [API pricing](https://about.ideogram.ai/api-pricing). Your balance will automatically top-up to a predetermined value when it drops below a certain threshold. In the example image below, the Top-up Balance is $20.00 and the Minimum Balance Threshold is $10.00.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2F7eBjqFOrDrG622QFTPYJ%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2011.17.34%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=7105bee2-371e-4e0b-b92e-072e3aa7b965" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FBwAYCvHrkXeFtIAhLorD%2FCleanShot%202024-09-03%20at%2011.14.57%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a714a663-19b3-44d8-a1e4-f3592e89ed6e" alt=""></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can now click the "Create API key" button to generate your first API key, which will allow you to integrate Ideogram into your applications. You may create multiple API keys, and all  keys you generate will be billed under the same plan.

Once created, the keys will appear as partial keys, displaying only the first few characters as a security measure. They will appear as shown in the image below.

<figure><picture><source srcset="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FdVcYlMPIwVKqEYEu6pX0%2FAPI%20Keys%20-%20Dark.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d8ce0b86-8b9e-4d3b-a9ef-a090fdc571a7" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FUUDoxRByuyuZDPRMrn2T%2FAPI%20Keys%20-%20Light.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5d80ad27-186a-4ded-8e74-e52f9730e120" alt=""></picture><figcaption><p>This is how generated API keys appear in the Manage API </p></figcaption></figure>

You can click "Manage payment", located near the bottom of the API management window, at any time to update your linked payment information or billing details.

## Adjusting the Top-Up Balance and Threshold

You can adjust the minimum balance that triggers an automatic top-up. Additionally, you can set the account balance level that you want your automatic top-up to bring you to. By default, the minimum balance threshold is $10 and the top-up balance is $20. To adjust these values, click the Edit button and enter your desired amounts in the respective fields. Then, click Save to confirm your changes.

After that modification, every time the balance dips to $5.00 or below, it will automatically top-up to the predetermined amount of $80.00.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The minimum balance threshold must be above $2.00 and the top up balance must be above $10.00.
