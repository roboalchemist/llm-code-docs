# Text and Typography

One of the areas in which Ideogram excels is in the generation and integration of text into an image. Whether as an overlay (e.g. a meme), as a typographic design (e.g. a t-shirt design) or as an integral part of various image elements (e.g. the name of a bottle of perfume), it's easy to get good results, often on the very first try.

To do this, all you need to do is write your prompt using complete sentences and punctuation, and indicate the text to be written by putting it in quotation marks and describing the context.

Here's an example:

**Prompt**:\
\&#xNAN;*A poster on a wall with text that reads: "Everything you can imagine is real. – Pablo Picasso"*

<figure><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FfO4lAMxbqFuRZtHZWAqv%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a8e1fa55-cf26-4463-a80b-b2af30b1d12c" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The AI generated the requested text on a poster, on a wall.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
In the image above, the AI has decided on the style and type of wall and poster that will be generated, as well as other visual aspects. Of course, you can describe these or any other elements you'd like to appear in the image yourself in the prompt, and the AI will generate them accordingly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For the time being, text that you would like to be written using a non-Latin alphabet or accented Latin characters may have some difficulty being generated correctly, if at all.
{% endhint %}

## Various types of text renderings

As you will see in the examples below, Ideogram can easily integrate text in just about any situation.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Simple text</strong></td><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FcY7xFQIEaUD7bjny8MHH%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c5e02db6-9595-47fd-8f2b-acb1a61eb548" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Prompt</strong>:<br>A striking image split in three, where on the left part, a minimalist set of three black geometric forms are arranged vertically on a light grey background.

Note how, in the examples above, there was no need to use [Style Tags](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models), not even the Typography one. Everything was indicated in the prompt.

## Fonts and styles

There are times when you would like to use a particular font or typographic style. Although it is not currently possible to specify a typeface by name, it is possible to describe certain stylistic properties in order to obtain a satisfactory result.

Bear in mind that the AI will also do its best to find an appropriate font style or typography for the image it needs to render. The result will be even better if you activate the [Magic Prompt](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/generation-settings/magic-prompt) function. Here are two examples:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2Flnc6lF8xA1xkqicV0e1G%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ef5d13da-8008-4007-9a5a-3e6675447940" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Prompt</strong>:<br>A fun whimsical birthday card design featuring a rabbit offering a cake and the text: "Happy Birthday"</td><td><strong>Magic Prompt</strong>:<br>A delightful and whimsical birthday card illustration featuring an adorable rabbit, wearing a cute chef's hat and apron, proudly offering a sumptuous cake with lit candles on it.

The text 'Happy Birthday' is written in a playful, cursive font, adding a touch of cheerfulness to the overall design.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://1799634369-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FzjhNby3LLsIikYuvxAJP%2Fuploads%2FtnpVzyt1QJPaR87cYUsp%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=96d9602e-d6af-4400-874d-ec6a9d76453d" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Prompt</strong>:<br>A cyberpunk cityscape with the word: "New Horizons"</td><td><strong>Magic Prompt</strong>:<br>An expansive and futuristic cyberpunk cityscape, with towering skyscrapers and neon lights that stretch into the night. The word "New Horizons" is prominently displayed in large, futuristic letters, signifying the beginning of a new era. The background features a holographic sky filled with multicolored clouds and a crescent moon. A few flying vehicles can be seen in the distance, adding to the bustling city atmosphere.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Fonts and copyrights

It is important to know that the Ideogram's AI doesn't use real fonts to generate images the same way you use font in your computer. To put it simply, the AI learns by looking at lots of different text images and how it looks and what are the actual styles. As it learns, it figures out how to make text that matches those different styles. So, when you ask it to make text, it uses what it's learned to make text that looks like it's from a specific style or font, even if it's not using that exact font.

## Errors and misspelled words or phrases.

Although Ideogram excels at generating text in images, an image can sometimes contain a spelling error, a missing or extra word or letter. Depending on the nature of the error, it is possible to correct the situation in various ways.

* Simply generate your prompt again a few times and see if you get the text you want.
* Change some of the longer, more complex words for shorter synonyms.
* Use the [Editor](https://docs.ideogram.ai/canvas-and-editing/editor) to modify the text, adding or deleting parts and then remix the image.
* Use the Typographic [Style Tag](https://docs.ideogram.ai/using-ideogram/features-and-tools/reference-features/style-reference/styles-in-older-models) with version 1.0 as it helps to achieve better results.
* Upload an image containing the desired text, which will serve as a starting point and composition source for the image to be created by remixing it.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's a well-known fact that long, complex words and long sentences are harder to generate correctly than short, everyday words. But don't despair, it can be done with patience, and it will get easier as the AI is updated and gets better.

It is often easier to remix an image to fix the image content itself while keeping the text right rather than trying to remix to fix the text while keeping the rest of the image.
{% endhint %}

Here's an example on how to fix text with the editor:
