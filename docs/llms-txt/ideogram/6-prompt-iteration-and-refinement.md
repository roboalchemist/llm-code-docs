# 6- Prompt Iteration and Refinement

Even with a well-structured prompt, the first image you generate might not be exactly what you envisioned. That's perfectly normal. Refining your prompt through small, thoughtful changes can help you get closer to your desired result.

This section covers practical strategies for adjusting and improving your prompts to achieve better outcomes.

## Why Iterate?

Each prompt you write is a starting point. If the result isn't quite right—maybe the composition feels off, or the subject isn't clear—making small adjustments can lead to significant improvements. Iteration helps you fine-tune your prompt to guide the AI more effectively.

## The One-Change Rule

When refining your prompt, it's helpful to change only one thing at a time. This approach allows you to see how each specific change affects the outcome, making it easier to understand what works and what doesn't.

> **Original:**\
> \&#xNAN;*“A black cat sitting on a windowsill during a storm”*\
> **Possible changes:**\
> 1\. *“A black cat sitting on a windowsill during a **light drizzle**”*\
> 2\. *“A black **dog** sitting on a windowsill during a light drizzle”*\
> \&#xNAN;*3. “A black dog sitting on a **porch** during a light drizzle”*

By altering just the nature of the storm, you can observe how this single change impacts the image.

## Prompt Chaining (Progressive Detailing)

Start with a simple prompt and gradually add more details in subsequent iterations. This method helps you build complexity step by step, ensuring each addition enhances the image without overwhelming it.

> **Step 1:** *“A medieval castle”*\
> **Step 2:** *“A medieval castle on a hilltop”*\*\
> **Step 3:** *“A medieval castle on a hilltop at sunset”*\
> \&#xNAN;***Step 4:** “A medieval castle on a hilltop at sunset with a dragon flying overhead”*

Each step adds a new element, allowing you to monitor how the image evolves.

## Try Alternate Wording

Sometimes a specific word or phrase just doesn't produce the result you're looking for. When that happens, try swapping it with a synonym, rephrasing the idea in a different way, or using a slightly different expression. Even a small change in wording can lead to very different outcomes—especially if the new term is more visually recognizable to the AI.

> **Instead of** “*lush jungle*”, **try** “*dense rainforest*” **or** “*tropical forest*”\
> **Instead of** “*futuristic city*”, **try** “*sci-fi metropolis*” **or** “*neon cyberpunk skyline*”\
> **Instead of** “*sad expression*”, **try** “*a face with downturned eyes and a slight frown*”

If something isn’t working right, it doesn’t mean your idea is wrong—just that the phrasing might need a small nudge.

A quick thesaurus search—or even asking a language model—can help you find wording that triggers the look you really want. Keep experimenting, one small change at a time, and you’ll quickly discover what works best.

## Emphasize Important Parts of the Image

Sometimes the AI might generate your image correctly in general, but miss something that feels too small, unbalanced, or visually incorrect. In these cases, two small techniques can make a big difference: **repetition** and **description for emphasis**.

### **Repeat Key Elements**

You can repeat the same element in different parts of the prompt to reinforce its importance. This doesn’t mean saying the exact same thing twice, but rather **referencing the same subject in multiple ways**.

> *A product photo of a men’s perfume bottle named “Nightlife for men” in a sleek studio setup. The bottle is tall and rectangular with dark glass… The bottle stands upright… The bottle is centered in the frame…*

By mentioning the bottle multiple times — in the summary, the details, and the framing — the AI is more likely to understand it’s the focal point and treat it with more visual weight.

### **Add Extra Description to Reinforce Details**

If the AI keeps omitting or downplaying something important, try **describing it more fully**:

* Add more visual detail about size, color, texture, or placement
* Mention it in different parts of the prompt (e.g., summary and composition)
* Reinforce its relationship to the rest of the image

For example, if the shoes of a person are missing or awkward, adding *“wearing black leather boots that cast a shadow on the sidewalk”* gives the AI both a visual anchor and spatial context.

These two techniques are especially helpful when:

* The AI misplaces or forgets a key detail
* You’re generating a busy or layered scene
* You want to draw focus to a specific object or subject

Use them as subtle tools to guide the AI’s attention — without needing to rewrite the entire prompt.
