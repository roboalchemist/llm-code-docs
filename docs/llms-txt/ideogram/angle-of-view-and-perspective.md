# Angle of View and Perspective

In image generation, the angle from which a scene or subject is viewed can dramatically affect the composition, storytelling, and overall feel of the result. This appendix outlines a variety of useful terms for describing point of view — both for the scene as a whole, and for individual people, animals, or objects within it.

#### 📸 Scene-Level Perspective (Camera-to-Environment Angle)

These terms describe how the viewer is positioned relative to the entire scene or environment.

* **Bird’s-eye view** — looking down from high above (also: aerial view, top-down perspective)
* **Worm’s-eye view** — looking up from ground level (also: low-ground view)
* **Overhead view** — directly above the subject (similar to: bird’s-eye, top-down)
* **Aerial view** — wide view from a high altitude (drone-style)
* **Isometric view** — angled top-down with parallel lines and no distortion (also: game map view, simulated 3D)
* **Wide-angle view** — expansive field of vision (also: cinematic wide shot, landscape framing)
* **Establishing shot** — broad scene-setting view (also: intro frame, scene overview)
* **Panoramic view** — ultra-wide horizontal framing (also: 360° view, landscape sweep)
* **Side view** — looking across from the left or right (also: lateral view, profile of the scene)
* **Tilted angle (Dutch angle)** — slanted horizon (also: skewed angle, off-kilter frame)
* **Point of view (POV)** — from a character’s visual perspective (also: first-person view)
* **Over-the-shoulder** — behind a subject, viewing what they see (also: behind POV)
* **Distant view** — subject seen from afar (also: far-shot, wide establishing)

#### 👁️ Subject-Level Perspective (Viewing a Person, Animal, or Object)

These terms describe how the subject itself is being viewed or framed in the composition.

* **Front view** — directly facing the subject (also: straight-on view)
* **Side profile** — side of the face or body (also: profile view, lateral angle)
* **Back view** — viewing the subject from behind (also: rear angle)
* **Three-quarter view** — angled between front and side (also: partial side view)
* **Close-up** — tightly framed (also: portrait crop, detail view)
* **Extreme close-up** — single facial feature or small detail (e.g., just eyes, lips, hand)
* **Full-body shot** — head to toe (also: wide crop of the subject)
* **Headshot** — upper torso and face (also: bust shot, portrait frame)
* **Low angle** — looking up (also: heroic angle, upward shot)
* **High angle** — looking down (also: downward shot, overhead crop)
* **Eye-level** — neutral, straight-on framing (also: natural perspective)
* **Overhead angle** — directly above the subject (like from a drone or ceiling)
* **Underside view** — from beneath the subject (also: under-angle, worm’s/ant's perspective)
* **Behind-the-subject** — subject turned away (also: back-facing composition)
* **Obscured or cropped view** — subject partially hidden or off-frame (also: partial view)

You can combine these terms with emotional cues, lens types, or action words for even more control.\
For example:

> * *Aerial view of a foggy village*
> * *Over-the-shoulder shot of a warrior facing the horizon*
> * *Three-quarter close-up of a woman smiling*
> * *Low-angle view of a tree glowing in moonlight*
> * *Full-body front view of a seated child*

#### Be Careful With Conflicting Perspective Elements

When using angle or point-of-view terms in your prompts, make sure the other details you describe make sense from that same viewpoint. Since the AI tries to include everything you mention, asking for something that wouldn’t normally be visible from a specific angle can confuse it — and may cause the model to ignore the perspective altogether.

**Examples of possible contradictions:**

> * *A top-down bird’s-eye view of a city \[…] the sky is filled with fluffy white clouds.*
> * *A rear view of a man walking away \[…] he is smiling at the camera.*
> * *An extreme close-up of a woman’s face \[…] she is wearing a knee-length red dress.*
