# 1- What is Prompting

## Prompting? What's That Exactly?

Prompting is the process of providing a description or instruction to an AI model to generate a specific output. In the context of Ideogram, you write a textual description of the image you want to create, and the AI generates an image based on that description.

For example:

> *“A serene landscape with rolling hills under a starry night sky.”*

This prompt guides the AI to produce an image matching the described scene.

A good prompt can be short or detailed, precise or poetic, depending on your goals. You'll learn how to choose the best approach based on the type of image you want.

## Why Prompting Matters

Prompting is how you describe to a text-to-image AI exactly what you want to see. The words you choose directly influence the result—whether you're aiming for something precise or exploring a creative idea. A clear, well-structured prompt helps the AI produce accurate and visually appealing images.

This guide teaches you effective prompting techniques, balancing clarity and creativity to get the best results possible.

## Why Structure and Wording Matter

Text-to-image AI models like Ideogram don’t interpret meaning intuitively like people do. They follow your instructions literally and try to visually represent every word in your prompt. Because of this, your prompt’s wording and structure significantly affect image quality.

A clear prompt structure helps Ideogram:

* Understand the main subject clearly.
* Focus on important visual attributes.
* Separate foreground from background elements.
* Accurately apply artistic style, lighting, and atmosphere.

Prompting with Ideogram is both a skill and a creative process. Whether you’re aiming for a specific visual or simply exploring artistic ideas, writing clear, thoughtful prompts gives you more control over the results. As you’ve seen throughout this guide, even small changes in structure, wording, or strategy can make a big difference. With practice, experimentation, and the right tools, you’ll learn how to shape the AI’s output to better match your intent—or discover something unexpectedly brilliant along the way.

**Happy prompting!**
