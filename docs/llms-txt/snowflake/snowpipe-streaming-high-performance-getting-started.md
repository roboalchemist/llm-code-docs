# Tutorial: Get started with Snowpipe Streaming high-performance architecture SDK

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running a demo application that utilizes the new high-performance architecture with the `snowpipe-streaming` SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the demo, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* Snowflake account: Verify that you have access to a Snowflake account. You will need a user with sufficient privileges (e.g., ACCOUNTADMIN or USERADMIN for the initial setup) to create the dedicated user and custom role detailed in Step 1: Configure Snowflake objects.
* Network access: Ensure that your network allows outbound connectivity to Snowflake and Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Platform (GCS) or Azure Blob Storage. Adjust firewall rules if necessary because the SDK makes REST API calls to Snowflake and to your cloud storage provider.

  * To verify network connectivity, use the following command:

  ```bash
  # Test connectivity to Snowflake; replace with your account URL
  curl -I https://<your_account_identifier>.snowflakecomputing.com

  # Test connectivity to AWS S3
  curl -I https://s3.amazonaws.com

  # Test connectivity to GCS
  curl -I https://storage.googleapis.com

  # Test connectivity to Azure Blob Storage
  curl -I https://azure.blob.core.windows.net  or curl -I https://<your_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net
  ```

* Java Development Environment: Install Java 11 or later, and Maven for dependency management.
* Python: Install Python version 3.9 or later.
* System requirements: The SDK requires glibc version 2.26 or later. You can check your current glibc version with:

  ```bash
  ldd --version
  ```

* Snowpipe Streaming SDKs and the sample code:

  * For **AWS**: Obtain the [Java SDK](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.snowflake/snowpipe-streaming) or [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/snowpipe-streaming/) (any version).
  * For **Azure**: Requires SDK version 1.1.0 or later.
  * For **GCP**: Requires SDK version 1.1.0 or later.

  Download the sample code for your preferred language from the [Snowpipe Streaming SDK examples in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowpipe-streaming-sdk-examples).

## Get started

This section outlines the steps required to set up and run the demo application.

### Step 1: Configure Snowflake objects

Before you can use the `snowpipe-streaming` SDK, you must create a target table within your Snowflake environment. Unlike the classic architecture, the high-performance architecture requires a PIPE object for data ingestion. This tutorial uses the default pipe that is automatically created at ingest time for your target table. If you require additional features, such as in-flight transformations or clustering at ingest time, see [CREATE PIPE](../../sql-reference/sql/create-pipe.md).

#### Generate a key pair for authentication

Generate a private-public key pair for authentication using OpenSSL. For more information, see [Key-pair authentication and key-pair rotation](../key-pair-auth.md).

Run the following commands in your terminal to generate the keys:

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt
openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
```

```bash
PUBK=$(cat ./rsa_key.pub | grep -v KEY- | tr -d '\012')
echo "ALTER USER MY_USER SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='$PUBK';"
```

> **Important:**
>
> Save the generated `rsa_key.p8` (private key) and `rsa_key.pub` (public key) files securely. You will use these keys in subsequent authentication steps.

#### Create database, schema, table, and configure user authentication

Run the following SQL commands in your Snowflake account; for example, by using Snowsight or Snowflake CLI). You must have a role with permissions to create users, roles, and databases — such as ACCOUNTADMIN or USERADMIN for the first few lines, and then switching to the new role. Replace placeholders like MY_USER, MY_ROLE, MY_DATABASE, and so on, with the names that you want.

```sqlexample
-- 1. Create a dedicated role and user (Run with a highly-privileged role)
CREATE OR REPLACE USER MY_USER;
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS MY_ROLE;
GRANT ROLE MY_ROLE TO USER MY_USER;

-- 2. Set the public key for key-pair authentication
-- NOTE: Replace 'YOUR_FORMATTED_PUBLIC_KEY' with the output of the PUBK variable from the key generation step.
ALTER USER MY_USER SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='YOUR_FORMATTED_PUBLIC_KEY';

-- 3. Set the default role (Recommended)
ALTER USER MY_USER SET DEFAULT_ROLE=MY_ROLE;

-- 4. Switch to the new role and create objects
USE ROLE MY_ROLE;
-- NOTE: You may also need to run USE WAREHOUSE YOUR_WH; here if a default warehouse isn't set.

-- Create database and schema
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE MY_DATABASE;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA MY_SCHEMA;

-- Create a target table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE MY_TABLE (
    data VARIANT,
    c1 NUMBER,
    c2 STRING
);

-- 5. Configure authentication policy (Optional, but recommended for explicit control)
CREATE OR REPLACE AUTHENTICATION POLICY testing_auth_policy
  AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = ('KEYPAIR')
  CLIENT_TYPES = ('DRIVERS');

-- Apply authentication policy (if created)
ALTER USER MY_USER SET AUTHENTICATION POLICY testing_auth_policy;
```

> **Note:**
>
> The `data` column in the sample table is a VARIANT type. The high-performance SDK requires that data for this column be passed as a native object; for example, a Java `Map` or Python dictionary. Passing a raw JSON string results in the data being stored as a string literal.

### Step 2: Configure an authentication profile

The demo application requires a `profile.json` file to store connection settings, including authentication details. The SDK uses key-pair authentication for secure connections.

#### Create a profile configuration file

Create or update the `profile.json` file in the root directory of your demo project.

#### profile.json template

```json
{
    "user": "MY_USER",
    "account": "your_account_identifier",
    "url": "https://your_account_identifier.snowflakecomputing.com:443",
    "private_key_file": "rsa_key.p8",
    "role": "MY_ROLE"
}
```

Replace the placeholders:

* `MY_USER`: Your Snowflake username configured in Step 1: Configure Snowflake objects.
* `your_account_identifier`: Your Snowflake account identifier (for example, `xy12345`).
* `rsa_key.p8`: The private key file you generated in Step 1: Configure Snowflake objects.
* `MY_ROLE`: The dedicated role (`MY_ROLE`) you created and granted to the user in Step 1: Configure Snowflake objects.

### Step 3: Set up the demo project

JavaPython

**Download:** [Sample Java code](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowpipe-streaming-sdk-examples/tree/main/java-example)

**Add the JAR dependency**

To include the Snowpipe Streaming SDK, add the following dependency to your Maven `pom.xml`. Maven automatically downloads the JAR from the public repository.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.snowflake</groupId>
    <artifactId>snowpipe-streaming</artifactId>
    <version>YOUR_SDK_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.18.1</version>
</dependency>
```

> **Important:**
>
> Replace `YOUR_SDK_VERSION` with the specific version available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.snowflake/snowpipe-streaming).

**Download:** [Sample Python code](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowpipe-streaming-sdk-examples/tree/main/python-example)

**Add the Python dependency**

The SDK requires Python version 3.9 or later.

To install the Snowpipe Streaming SDK for Python, run the following command:

```bash
pip install snowpipe-streaming
```

For more information about the package, see [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/snowpipe-streaming/).

#### Place the profile file

Ensure that the `profile.json` file that you configured in Step 2: Configure an authentication profile is located in the root directory of your project.

### Step 4: Use the provided code example and run the demo application

In your terminal, navigate to the project’s root directory.

JavaPython

**Build and execute**

* Build the project:

  > ```bash
  > mvn clean install
  > ```
>
* Run the main class:

  > ```bash
  > mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.snowflake.snowpipestreaming.demo.Main"
  > ```

**Run the demo application**

Run the Python demo:

```bash
python example.py
```

### Step 5: Verify the data

After running the demo, verify the ingested data in Snowflake:

```sqlexample
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MY_DATABASE.MY_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE;
SELECT * FROM MY_DATABASE.MY_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE LIMIT 10;
```

Verify that your data was ingested as a structured object rather than a string literal:

```sqlexample
SELECT
    data,
    TYPEOF(data) as data_type
FROM MY_DATABASE.MY_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE
LIMIT 10;
```

* If `data_type` returns `OBJECT`, the ingestion is correct.
* If `data_type` returns `VARCHAR`, your application is passing a string literal that isn’t being parsed.
