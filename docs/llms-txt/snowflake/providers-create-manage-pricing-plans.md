## Create a pricing plan

Follow the steps below to create a new listing with a pricing plan.

SnowsightSQL

1. Follow the steps for [sharing data on the Snowflake Marketplace](../../../../collaboration/provider-listings-creating-publishing.md).
2. After you add a data product to your share, in the Access type dropdown, select Paid listing.

   A Pricing section and a Trial (optional) section are added to the listing page.
3. In the Pricing section, select Add pricing plans.

   The Create pricing plan page opens.
4. On the Settings page, specify a name for the plan, then select Next.

   You can optionally specify a product SKU for the pricing plan.
5. On the Pricing details page, select a pricing model for the plan:

   * If you select Flat-fee, specify the access fee price and the billing frequency (monthly or annually) for the plan.
   * If you select Usage-based, specify the monthly access fee, the price per query, and the maximum monthly charge.
6. Select Next.
7. Review the pricing plan summary, and then select Done.
8. Optional: To add another pricing plan, select Add pricing plan, and then repeat the previous steps.
9. Select Submit for approval » Publish once approved to publish the listing. Only published listings can be offered to consumers.

If you want to create additional pricing plans for a specific listing, select the listing, select the Pricing plans tab, and then select + Create pricing plan.

1. Create a [pricing plan manifest reference](pricing-plan-manifest-reference.md) named PRICING_PLAN_1.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > The pricing plan name must be uppercase.

   ```yaml
   display_name: Default pricing plan display name
   currency: USD
   pricing_model: FLAT_FEE
   base_fee: 100.0
   billing_duration_months: 1
   sales_motion: SELF_SERVE
   comment: Comment for the pricing plan
   metadata:
     description: Pricing plan description
     price: $100 / unit
     button_text: Buy Now
     value_propositions:
       - val 1
       - val 2
     visibility: VISIBLE
     contract_type: LIMITED_TIME
     contract_duration_months: 12
     state: PUBLISHED
   ```

2. Create a [listing manifest reference](../../../../progaccess/listing-manifest-reference.md) that includes the pricing plan.

   ```yaml
   title: my_listing
   subtitle: Subtitle for my_listing
   description: Description for my_listing
   listing_terms:
     type: OFFLINE
   targets:
     regions: PUBLIC.AWS_US_EAST_1
   usage_examples:
     - title: this is a test sql
       description: Simple example
       query: select *
   pricing_plans:
     - name: PRICING_PLAN_1
       type: FILE
       path: pricingPlans/PRICING_PLAN_1.yaml
   ```

3. Stage the pricing plan and listing manifest reference files.

   ```sqlexample
   PUT file:///local/path/to/PRICING_PLAN_1.yaml @DB.SCHEMA.STAGE/pricingPlans/PRICING_PLAN_1
     SOURCE_COMPRESSION=NONE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE;

   PUT file:///local/path/to/manifest.yaml @DB.SCHEMA.STAGE/listings/my_manifest
     SOURCE_COMPRESSION=NONE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE;
   ```

4. Create a listing that uses the manifest files uploaded to the stage.

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE EXTERNAL LISTING my_listing
     FROM @DB.SCHEMA.STAGE/listings/my_manifest
     REVIEW = TRUE
     PUBLISH = FALSE;
   ```
