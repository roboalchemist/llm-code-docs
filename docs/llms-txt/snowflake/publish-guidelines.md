# Guidelines for publishing an app to the Snowflake Marketplace

This topic describes the criteria for publishing a Snowflake Native App to the Snowflake Marketplace.

## Publish an app in the Snowflake Marketplace

When your application package is ready to be published on the Snowflake Marketplace, you must submit it
to Snowflake for approval.

> **Note:**
>
> The approval process required to publish an app on the Snowflake Marketplace is in addition to the
> [automated security scan](security-overview.md) that is run when
> the DISTRIBUTION property of an application package is set to EXTERNAL.

Before creating a listing, verify that you understand the
enforced requirements and ensure that your
application package follows each requirement. If an application package does not follow these requirements,
your submission may be rejected.

If you receive a rejection notification for the application package you submitted, make the recommended
changes and resubmit your application package for approval.

## Standards for Snowflake Native Apps on the Snowflake Marketplace

Snowflake provides a platform that allows providers to build, distribute, and monetize apps.

The Snowflake review process ensures the quality of the apps that are published to the Snowflake
Marketplace. To ensure a streamlined review process, Snowflake provides the following requirements and
guidelines for apps that are published to the Snowflake Marketplace.

Immediate utility:
:   The app functionality must be provided within the consumer account and the app must be operational once installed.

Standalone:
:   Apps must deliver product experience on Snowflake and facilitate external requirements through Snowflake functionality.

Data-centric:
:   Apps should be based on data-centric use cases that leverage data stored in Snowflake.

Transparent and simple:
:   Apps must use Snowflake features to disclose the app’s resource and access requirements and simplify the configuration process
    for the consumer.

## Enforced requirements

Snowflake uses the following guidelines to determine if a Snowflake Native App meets the
requirements for publication on the Snowflake Marketplace. These requirements are verified when
you submit a listing with an attached application package to the Snowflake Marketplace.

1. Immediate utility

   1. Apps must not be shell apps that advertise functionality. Apps must deliver the advertised functionality.
   2. Apps must include a clear framework and instruction for utilizing app functionality.
   3. Apps should not crash, freeze, or otherwise function abnormally.
   4. Apps must list all required credentials and providers must share required credentials with
      Snowflake at submission for testing.
   5. If apps are not immediately actionable, they must document the expected workflow for a consumer,
      allowing consumers to fully install and configure the app.
2. Standalone

   1. Apps must not be pass-through. For example, they must not redirect consumers to an external
      service to enable the app’s core functionality.
   2. App interfaces must be accessible after installation directly from Snowflake.
   3. Apps cannot require consumers to create users or roles that provide access to an external service
      in the Snowflake consumer’s account.
   4. Apps cannot use the Snowflake Marketplace as a distribution platform for cross-selling external
      applications or services.
3. Data-centric

   1. Apps must leverage Snowflake data in one of the following ways:

      1. Share data from the app provider’s account.
      2. Use datasets from the Snowflake Marketplace.
      3. Access data in the consumer account.
4. Transparent

   1. All account-level privileges and references that the app requires must be listed in the
      application package manifest file.
   2. All resource requirements for the Snowflake Native App must be listed in the
      [marketplace.yml](marketplace-file.md)
      file of the app. The app must create these resources as part of installation and setup.
   3. All account-level privileges and references listed in the application package manifest file must be requested
      from the consumer through Snowsight or the Python Permission SDK.
   4. Apps must provide a readme file. Apps that do not include a Streamlit or custom user interface must include the
      following information in the readme file:

      1. A description of what the app does.
      2. The steps the consumer must perform to configure the app after it is installed.
      3. The stored procedures and user-defined functions the app uses.
      4. The privileges the app requires.
      5. Example SQL commands that show consumers how to use the app.
   5. All required SQL commands must be delivered using Snowflake and formatted as code blocks.
   6. If the app provides sample data, you must include procedures on how to use the sample data.
   7. If an application package contains a Streamlit app but does not contain a `readme` file,
      you must [configure a default Streamlit app](adding-streamlit.md).

## Best practices when publishing a Snowflake Native App

In addition to the requirements for submitting an application package to the Snowflake Marketplace,
Snowflake also recommends the following best practices when publishing a Snowflake Native App:

* Ensure that all required files are uploaded to the named stage for the version of the app you are
  submitting, including:

  * The manifest file.
  * The setup script.
  * The README file.
  * Any external stored procedures or user-defined functions required by the application package.
  * Any Streamlit files required by the application package.
  * Any external source code, including Python, Java, etc.
* Ensure that the version of the app you are developing passes the
  [automated security scan](security-overview.md).
* Test the new version of your application package by creating the application object locally by using the
  [CREATE APPLICATION](../../sql-reference/sql/create-application.md) command.

  * Do not add a new version to your application package or set the DISTRIBUTION property to EXTERNAL
    while you are developing and testing an app. These actions trigger the
    [automated security scan](security-overview.md) which
    delays the development cycle.

    Instead, create the application object using
    [files on a named stage](installing-testing-application.md).
  * If your app includes a Streamlit app, test the application in Snowsight to ensure
    the Streamlit app works as expected.
  * Verify that interactions between the Streamlit app and Snowflake Worksheets are seamless
    and that the consumer does not have to navigate excessively between the two.
* Review all parts of a listing before submitting it for approval.
* Ensure that there are no typos or other textual errors in the listing, `readme` file, and
  Streamlit app.

### Recommendations for trial listings

When an app trial listing expires, Snowflake automatically suspends the app to avoid consumers incurring
extra compute costs to the consumer. Snowflake only suspends the objects owned by the app that are currently
active. Snowflake does not modify the status of objects that are already suspended.

When a trial listing is converted to a full or paid listing, Snowflake attempts to re-enable the
app by resuming tasks, containers, and compute pools. Snowflake only resumes services and compute pools
that have the `auto_resume` property set to false.

### Recommendations for apps with containers

* Compute pools should be set to automatically suspend in combination with Snowpark Container Services
  jobs to avoid idle compute nodes.
* For higher availability during upgrades and to reduce cold start latency, Snowflake recommends that you
  set the `MIN_NODES` parameter greater than 1.
* If connections across different services are required in the same app, use the DNS name of the service
  instead of configuring an external access integration.

### Recommendations for event sharing

* Providers should configure an app to emit log messages and trace events that conform
  to [supported event definitions](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/native-apps/consumer-enable-logging#about-event-sharing)
  to ensure that consumers understand what information is collected.
* Mandatory event definitions should be limited to the log messages and trace events required by the app. Excessive or unnecessary
  mandatory event definitions should be avoided.
* Adding new mandatory event definitions in a version upgrade must require the consumer re-enable event definitions
  for the app.
* Use the Python Permission SDK to allow consumers to share optional events.
