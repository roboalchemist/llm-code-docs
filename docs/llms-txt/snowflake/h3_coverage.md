# H3_COVERAGE

Returns an [array](../data-types-semistructured.md) of IDs (as INTEGER values) identifying the minimal set of
[H3](../data-types-geospatial.md) cells that completely cover a shape (specified by a
[GEOGRAPHY](../data-types-geospatial.md) object).

See also:
:   [H3_COVERAGE_STRINGS](h3_coverage_strings.md) , [H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS](h3_polygon_to_cells.md)

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
H3_COVERAGE( <geography_expression> , <target_resolution> )
```

## Arguments

`geography_expression`
:   A GEOGRAPHY object.

`target_resolution`
:   An INTEGER between 0 and 15 (inclusive) specifying the H3 [resolution](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable) that you want to use for the returned H3 cells.

    Specifying any other INTEGER value results in an error.

## Returns

Returns an ARRAY of INTEGER values for the IDs of the minimal set of H3 cells that have completely cover the specified input
shape.

## Usage notes

* The function uses spherical approximation, which treats points on the Earth’s surface as if they were connected by arcs, rather
  than straight lines. If you need a planar approximation, use [H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS](h3_polygon_to_cells.md) instead.
* A cell is included in the result set if its boundary intersects the input shape.
* When you apply [FLATTEN](flatten.md) to the ARRAY returned by the function,
  [cast](../data-type-conversion.md) each value explicitly to an integer.

## Examples

The following example returns an ARRAY of the IDs that identify the minimal set of H3 cells that completely cover the specified
Polygon.

```sqlexample
SELECT H3_COVERAGE(
  TO_GEOGRAPHY(
    'POLYGON((-122.481889 37.826683,-122.479487 37.808548,-122.474150 37.808904,-122.476510 37.826935,-122.481889 37.826683))'),
  8) AS set_of_h3_cells_covering_polygon;
```

```output
