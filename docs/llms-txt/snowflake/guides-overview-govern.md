# Data Governance in Snowflake

Snowflake provides industry-leading features that ensure the highest levels of governance for your account and users, as well as all the data you store and access in Snowflake.

[Data Quality Monitoring and data metric functions](user-guide/data-quality-intro.md)
:   Allows the monitoring of the state and integrity of your data using system data metric functions and user-defined data metric functions.

[Column-level Security](user-guide/security-column-intro.md)
:   Allows the application of a masking policy to a column within a table or view.

[Row-level Security](user-guide/security-row-intro.md)
:   Allows the application of a row access policy to a table or view to determine which rows are visible in the query result.

[Introduction to object tagging](user-guide/object-tagging/introduction.md)
:   Allows the tracking of sensitive data for compliance, discovery, protection, and resource usage.

[Tag-based masking policies](user-guide/tag-based-masking-policies.md)
:   Allows protecting column data by assigning a masking policy to a tag and then setting the tag on a database object or the Snowflake
    account.

[Sensitive data classification](user-guide/classify-intro.md)
:   Allows categorizing potentially personal and/or sensitive data to support compliance and privacy regulations.

[Access History](user-guide/access-history.md)
:   Allows the auditing of the user access history through the Account Usage [ACCESS_HISTORY view](sql-reference/account-usage/access_history.md).

[Object Dependencies](user-guide/object-dependencies.md)
:   Allows the auditing of how one object references another object by its metadata (e.g. creating a view depends on a table name and column
    names) through the Account Usage [OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES](sql-reference/account-usage/object_dependencies.md) view.

Data Governance area in Snowsight
:   Allows using the Governance & security » Tags & policies area to monitor and report on the usage of policies and tags with
    tables, views, and columns using two different interfaces: Dashboard and Tagged Objects. For details, see:
