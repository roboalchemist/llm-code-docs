# REMAINING_BALANCE_DAILY view

The REMAINING_BALANCE_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema can be used to return the daily remaining balance and on demand
consumption daily for an organization.

## Columns

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ORGANIZATION_NAME | VARCHAR | Name of the organization. |
| CONTRACT_NUMBER | VARCHAR | Contract number for the organization. |
| DATE | DATE | The date of the FREE_USAGE_BALANCE or CAPACITY_BALANCE in the UTC time zone. |
| CURRENCY | VARCHAR | The currency of the FREE_USAGE_BALANCE or CAPACITY_BALANCE or ON_DEMAND_CONSUMPTION_BALANCE. |
| FREE_USAGE_BALANCE | NUMBER (38,2) | The amount of free usage in currency that is available for use as of the date. This is the end of day balance. |
| CAPACITY_BALANCE | NUMBER (38,2) | The amount of capacity in currency that is available for use as of the date. This is the end of day balance. |
| ON_DEMAND_CONSUMPTION_BALANCE | NUMBER (38,2) | The amount of consumption at on demand prices that will be invoiced given that all the free usage and capacity balances have been exhausted. This is a negative value (e.g. -250) until the invoice is paid. This is the end of day balance. |

## Usage notes

* Latency for the view may be up to 72 hours.
* If multiple organizations draw down from the same capacity contract, only the primary organization can access this view. The primary
  organization is also known as the funding organization.
* On demand consumption balance resets after month close (typically on the 3rd or 4th day of the next month) after it is invoiced and paid.
* Until month close, data for a given day in a month can change to account for any end-of-month adjustments/credits or contract amendments
  between Snowflake organizations.
* Customers who signed a contract through a Snowflake reseller cannot access data in this view.
* Data is retained indefinitely.
* This view does not include data generated prior to June 2020. To obtain data before this date, contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).
