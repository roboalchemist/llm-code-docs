# Editing and running Notebooks in Workspaces

## Set the execution context

Notebooks in Workspaces do not automatically set a database or schema. To query data, you must define the execution context in a cell using the
following SQL commands:

```sqlsyntax
USE DATABASE <database>;
USE SCHEMA <schema>;
```

To ensure notebooks run consistently across environments and clients, use fully qualified names for tables and other objects. For example:

```sqlexample
-- Query data objects using a fully qualified name
SELECT * FROM TABLE <database_name.schema_name.table_name>;

-- Create a table using a fully qualified name
WITH filtered_events AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        event_type,
        event_timestamp
    FROM raw_events
    WHERE event_timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE <database_name.schema_name.table_name> AS
SELECT *
FROM filtered_events;
```

## Use the role and warehouse picker

You can set the active role and warehouse for your notebook.

SnowsightSQL

Use the picker at the top left of the Notebooks editor:

Run the following SQL commands:

```sqlsyntax
USE ROLE <role>;
USE WAREHOUSE <warehouse>;
```

The query warehouse is used to run SQL queries and Snowpark pushdown compute invoked by the notebook. It is also used to render the interactive
datagrid, but there is no credit charge for this operation.

To learn more about credit usage, see [Setting up compute](notebooks-in-workspaces-compute-setup.md).

## Create a Snowpark session

Snowpark is a Snowflake developer framework that lets you build data pipelines, transformations, and machine learning logic directly inside
Snowflake without moving data out of the platform. It provides APIs that operate on Snowflake data as DataFrames, pushing computation down to
Snowflake’s engine for scalability, performance, and security.

To use [Snowpark Python APIs](../../../developer-guide/snowpark/python/index.md) in Notebooks, first create a Snowpark session in a Python cell:

```python
from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
session = get_active_session()
```

## Run cells

There are four supported execution options:

* Run all cells
* Run one single cell
* Run current cell and all above cells (via the cell’s ellipsis menu)
* Run current cell and all below cells (via the cell’s ellipsis menu)

### Cancel cell execution

Use Stop at the top of the notebook or Cancel execution in a cell.

Both actions stop the currently executing cell and any queued cells triggered by Run all.

> **Note:**
>
> The Run all button may temporarily change to Stop when the notebook is connecting or reconnecting to the service.

## Cell names

You can assign names to cells to make navigation easier and provide contextual labels.

If an imported `.ipynb` file already contains name or title metadata, those values are used automatically.

## Cell referencing

Bidirectional SQL to Python cell referencing allows you to reuse results and variables across cells in either language, enabling seamless transitions
between SQL and Python workflows.

You can hover over the result tooltip to see the DataFrame name you can use to reference the result in Python and SQL.

### Referencing SQL cell results

Each SQL cell exposes its result as a pandas DataFrame pointer named `dataframe_x`.

* In SQL, reference it using double curly braces: `{{dataframe_1}}`.
* In Python, reference it directly as a pandas DataFrame: `dataframe_1`.

### Referencing Python variables

To reference Python variables in SQL queries, wrap them in double curly braces. For example:

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM {{uploaded_df}} WHERE "price" > 326;
```

DataFrame variables are also supported when referencing Python variables in SQL.

### Example workflow

**Python cell**

```python
import pandas as pd

uploaded_df = pd.read_csv("../data/diamonds.csv")
uploaded_df
```

**SQL cell referencing Python variable**

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM {{uploaded_df}} WHERE "price" > 326;
```

**SQL cell referencing SQL cell results**

The result of a SQL cell provides a DataFrame pointer called `dataframe_1`. You can reference it in another SQL query:

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM {{dataframe_1}} WHERE "carat" < 1.0
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM {{dataframe_2}} WHERE "carat" >= 1.0;
```

## Interactive datagrid

The datagrid supports:

* Scrolling
* Search
* Filtering
* Sorting
* Chart creation without code

### Built-in chart builder

Provides a consistent user experience for data manipulation and visualization across editing surfaces in Workspaces.

## Minimap and cell status

The minimap generates a table of contents from Markdown headers and displays a comprehensive in-session status for each cell (running, succeeded,
failed, and modified).

## Global search and replace

You can search for keywords across all cells in the current notebook. If you’re editing a particular cell, press `esc` to exit the edit mode for that cell first.

To search keywords across all cells in the current notebook, do the following:

* To search for keywords, select Search in the minimap, or use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL` + `F`.

  Matching keywords in all cells are shown. Optionally, you can replace the search term with the desired value using Replace next or Replace all.

## Notebook kernel

The notebook kernel remains active as long as the notebook service is in the `RUNNING` state, allowing uninterrupted execution of critical,
long-running processes such as ML training and data engineering jobs.

Actions that do not affect kernel execution:

* Navigating to other pages
* Working elsewhere in Snowsight
* Closing your browser
* Shutting down your computer

You can shut down or restart the kernel using the Connected dropdown.

> **Note:**
>
> Using Shut down kernel or Restart kernel will clear variables in memory but retain any user-installed packages. If you want a completely clean
> environment with only the pre-installed packages, you must restart the service or create a new service and connect to it.

If the notebook service is suspended, the notebook kernel is also shut down. For more information, see [Setting up compute](notebooks-in-workspaces-compute-setup.md).

## Cell output

* Cell outputs are not saved to the `.ipynb` file and cannot be exported.
* Cell output in a notebook in Workspaces (both private and shared workspaces) is accessible to the user who executed the notebook.
* Cell output visibility is restricted to the user who initiated the execution. To run cells, your active default role must be granted either
  OWNERSHIP or USAGE privileges on the [notebook project object (NPO)](notebooks-in-workspaces-schedule.md).

## Jupyter magics

Notebooks in Workspaces run the IPython (Interactive Python) kernel and provide standard Jupyter cell and line magics. Run `%lsmagic` to view available magics.

For example, you can use the `%run` magic command to invoke another notebook:

* In a Python cell of `notebook_a`, call `%run path/to/notebook_b.ipynb`. This executes `notebook_b` in the same Python process as `notebook_a`.
* For variables and pandas DataFrames in `notebook_b` to render in `notebook_a` cell results, make sure to explicitly print them. For example:
  `print(var)` or `display(df)`.

## Developer tools

Developer tools include the Terminal, the Scratchpad, and the Variables Explorer. These tools allow you to explore and interact with your data
and the notebook environment.

To access the developer tools, in the control bar at the top of the notebook, select <icon>:ui:`Tools`.

You must be connected to a notebook service to use the developer tools. Switching to a different service will restart the tools.

### Using the Terminal

The Terminal lets you run any shell command in the notebook’s container environment:

* Install dependencies - `pip install`, `pip list`, or check installed packages.
* Manage files - `ls`, `pwd`, navigate directories, and view files.
* Run parallel jobs
* Monitor compute resource usage

Example for installing and running `htop` for monitoring compute resource usage in real time:

```bash
# If installation fails, run `apt update` first
# Install `htop`
apt install htop

# Run `htop`
htop
```

### Using the Scratchpad

The Scratchpad is an exploratory space for you to quickly experiment — for example, with code, ideas, calculations, or notes — without worrying about structure or polish.
Commands that you execute in the Scratchpad do not change the notebook file.

You can do the following in the Scratchpad:

* Quick ad-hoc queries - Test SQL without adding cells to your notebook.
* Data exploration - Verify table contents, schemas, or run exploratory queries.
* Debugging - Verify data or test query fragments before adding them to a notebook cells.
* One-off operations - Run commands that don’t need to be saved (such as SHOW GRANTS or DESCRIBE TABLE).

Results stay visible while you work but aren’t saved with the notebook.

### Using the Variables Explorer

The Variables Explorer is a visual tool that lets you inspect the variables currently loaded in your session while you are working interactively.
It shows the Name, Type, Shape, and Preview for each variable. Variables are updated when a cell finishes running.
