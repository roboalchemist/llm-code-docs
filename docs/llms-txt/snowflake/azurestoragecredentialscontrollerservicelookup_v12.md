# AzureStorageCredentialsControllerServiceLookup_v12

## Description

Provides an AzureStorageCredentialsService_v12 that can be used to dynamically select another AzureStorageCredentialsService_v12. This service requires an attribute named ‘azure.storage.credentials.name’ to be passed in, and will throw an exception if the attribute is missing. The value of ‘azure.storage.credentials.name’ will be used to select the AzureStorageCredentialsService_v12 that has been registered with that name. This will allow multiple AzureStorageCredentialsServices_v12 to be defined and registered, and then selected dynamically at runtime by tagging flow files with the appropriate ‘azure.storage.credentials.name’ attribute.
