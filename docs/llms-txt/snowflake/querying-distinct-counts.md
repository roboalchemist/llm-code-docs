# Computing the Number of Distinct Values

To compute the number of rows that have distinct values, you can use one of the following approaches:

* Call the SQL [COUNT](../sql-reference/functions/count.md) function with the `DISTINCT` keyword.
* If you just need an approximate count of distinct values, you can use the HyperLogLog functions
  (e.g. `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`). For details, see [Estimating the Number of Distinct Values](querying-approximate-cardinality.md).
* If you are counting distinct values for hierarchical aggregations (e.g. multiple grouping sets, rollups, or cubes), you can
  improve performance by using one of the following approaches (rather than using `COUNT(DISTINCT <expr>)`):

  * [Use bitmaps to identify the number of distinct values](querying-bitmaps-for-distinct-counts.md).

    With this approach, you use the bitmap functions to produce bitmaps that identify the distinct integer values in a column.
    Because a bitmap can represent at most 32,768 distinct values, this approach requires “bucketizing” (using multiple bitmaps)
    if the number of distinct values exceeds 32,768.

    For details, see [Using Bitmaps to Compute Distinct Values for Hierarchical Aggregations](querying-bitmaps-for-distinct-counts.md).
  * [Produce arrays that contain the distinct values](querying-arrays-for-distinct-counts.md).

    With this approach, you use the aggregate functions that produce arrays containing the unique values in a column. You can then
    call [ARRAY_SIZE](../sql-reference/functions/array_size.md) to get the count of values.

    This approach works for values of any data type (e.g. [VARIANT](../sql-reference/data-types-semistructured.md)) and does not require
    “bucketizing”, unless the size of the data in the ARRAY exceeds the maximum size of an ARRAY.

    For details, see [Using Arrays to Compute Distinct Values for Hierarchical Aggregations](querying-arrays-for-distinct-counts.md).
