# Load unstructured data with Document AI

By integrating with [Document AI](snowflake-cortex/document-ai/overview.md), Snowflake now supports loading unstructured data, similar to loading structured and semi-structured data.

Unstructured data is information that does not fit into a predefined data model or schema. Typically text-heavy, such as form responses and social media conversations, unstructured data also encompasses images, video, and audio.

To load unstructured data with this preview feature, you can run the same COPY INTO table command with a copy option `file_processor`.

## Prerequisites

Before using this feature, you must prepare a Document AI model and make sure the user who runs the COPY command has access to this model. For more information, see [Document AI](snowflake-cortex/document-ai/overview.md).

## Use the COPY INTO command

You can load unstructured data by using the COPY INTO command with the `file_processor` copy option. You can specify `document_ai` as the type of custom scanner for the `file_processor` copy option and specify the associated properties for the scanner.

For more information, see [COPY INTO TABLE syntax](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.md) and [COPY INTO Copy Options](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.md).

To load unstructured data, we recommend specifying the type of the source stage as `CUSTOM`, which is a stage format type in preview. The other stage format types `(TYPE = { CSV | JSON | AVRO | ORC | PARQUET | XML })` are supported for backwards compatibility.

You can specify the stage type by using the `file_format` parameter when creating a stage. The `CUSTOM` stage type specifies that the underlying stage holds unstructured data and can only be used with the `FILE_PROCESSOR` copy option.

## Examples

The following example shows loading unstructured data files from a stage `custom_stage` to a table `my_table`, with the `document_ai` function specified by a model name `predict` and model version `1`.

> ```sqlexample
> COPY INTO my_table FROM @custom_stage
>   FILE_PROCESSOR = (
>     SCANNER = 'document_ai'
>     SCANNER_OPTIONS = (project_name = 'DEMO0200', model_name = 'predict' model_version = '1'));
> ```

The following example shows loading unstructured data files to a table `docai_results` and transforming the raw data using a [SELECT](../sql-reference/sql/select.md) statement.

> ```sqlexample
> CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE docai_results (inspection_date date, inspector varchar);
>
> COPY INTO docai_results FROM (SELECT $1:inspection_date[0].value::date, $1:inspector[0].value FROM @custom_stage)
>   FILE_PROCESSOR = (
>     SCANNER = 'document_ai'
>     SCANNER_OPTIONS = (project_name = 'DEMO0201', model_name = 'predict' model_version = '1'));
> ```

## Considerations and limitations

* This feature does not support the following:

  * [Enable automatic table schema evolution](data-load-schema-evolution.md)
  * [MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.md) COPY option
  * [Snowpipe](data-load-snowpipe-intro.md)
* Only the default ON_ERROR COPY option `ON_ERROR = ABORT_STATEMENT` is supported. Attempts to use other ON_ERROR options will result in compilation failure.
* The number of files per query cannot exceed 1000.
