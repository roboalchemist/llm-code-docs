# Supported cloud regions

Regions let your organization choose where your data is geographically stored across your regional, national, and international operations.
Regions also determine where your compute resources are provisioned.

Snowflake supports regions across all of the Snowflake-supported [cloud platforms](intro-cloud-platforms.md), grouped into
three global geographic segments (North/South America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia Pacific/China).

> **Important:**
>
> Each Snowflake account is hosted in a single region. If you wish to use Snowflake across multiple regions, you must maintain a Snowflake
> account in each of the desired regions.

> **Note:**
>
> For details about the cloud regions where your data can be hosted when using the Egress Cost Optimizer,
> see [Optimizing data transfer costs with Egress Cost Optimizer](../collaboration/provider-listings-auto-fulfillment-eco.md) documentation.

## North and South America

These regions are supported for organizations that prefer or require their data to be stored in the United States, Canada, or Brazil. Multiple
regions are provided to allow your organization to meet its individual compliance requirements for general purpose use.

Additional regions are provided in the United States for organizations that must comply with US government regulations.

### Commercial regions

Snowflake supports the following regions in North America (U.S., Canada, and Mexico) and South America (Brazil) for general commercial use:

U.S. SnowGov Regions
:   Snowflake makes the following SnowGov Regions on AWS GovCloud (US) and Microsoft Azure Government
    available to customers who require additional security designed for US government regulated workloads and other types of sensitive data.
    These regions are operated by Snowflake personnel who are U.S. persons located within the U.S. Certain features that are available in
    Snowflake’s commercial regions might not be available or might be different in its SnowGov Regions. Use of and access to Snowflake in any of
    the SnowGov Regions are limited solely to U.S. Government Customers or U.S. Government Contractors (unless otherwise agreed upon by
    Snowflake in its sole discretion) and are subject to Snowflake’s [U.S. SnowGov Region Terms of Service](https://www.snowflake.com/en/legal-gov/terms-of-service/us-snowgov-terms-of-service/). As used here, a
    “U.S. Government Customer” means a Snowflake customer that is: (a) a U.S. Federal, state, or local government entity or (b) a tribal
    government entity; and a “U.S. Government Contractor” means a commercial entity that is required to process data provided by a U.S.
    Government Customer to perform a prime contract or subcontract with or for such entity.

    The SnowGov Regions support U.S. government standards, such as FedRAMP, Department of War Impact Levels, GovRAMP, TX-RAMP, FIPS-140-2, and the
    International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) among others. As noted in the table below, certain standards require the customer to
    accept supplemental contract terms. You must contact Snowflake and agree to the supplemental terms before uploading workloads covered by
    these standards.

    Self-provisioning of initial Snowflake accounts is not available in the SnowGov Regions. To provision an initial account in these regions,
    you must contact Snowflake.

## Asia Pacific and China

These regions are supported for organizations that prefer or require their data to be stored in Japan, Korea, India, Southeast Asia,
Australia, and China. Multiple regions are provided to allow your organization to meet its individual compliance and data sovereignty
requirements.

Snowflake supports the following Asia Pacific and China regions:

| Cloud Platform | Cloud Region ID [1] | Region Name | Additional Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** | | | |
|  | ap-northeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Tokyo) | Completed assessment and supports compliance with the Japanese government’s Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) |
| ap-northeast-2 | Asia Pacific (Seoul) |  |
| ap-northeast-3 | Asia Pacific (Osaka) | Completed assessment and supports compliance with ISMAP |
| ap-south-1 | Asia Pacific (Mumbai) |  |
| ap-southeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Singapore) |  |
| ap-southeast-2 | Asia Pacific (Sydney) | Completed assessment and supports compliance with the Australian government’s Infosec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) - Protected |
| ap-southeast-3 | Asia Pacific (Jakarta) |  |
| cn-northwest-1 | China (Ningxia) | The China region is separate from other Snowflake regions. It utilizes a separate domain name (`snowflakecomputing.cn`) and is wholly operated by Digital China Cloud Technology Limited (DCC), an authorized operating partner of Snowflake, Inc. Customers who wish to create and use Snowflake accounts in the China region must sign a separate agreement with DCC in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations.  Additionally, customers cannot use self-service to create their initial account in the China region. Instead, they must request the account through [DCC](mailto:snowflake.hosting%40dcclouds.com). Once the initial account is created within their org, they can create additional accounts in the org using all other supported methods.  Customers with existing Snowflake accounts are not able to access resources in the China region, and vice versa. Some features might not be available in the China region. |

## Region time zones for support

Snowflake supports multiple [editions](intro-editions.md) with each edition offering different levels of service.

Effective May 1, 2020:

* All new accounts, regardless of Snowflake Edition, receive Premier support, which includes 24/7 coverage.
* Standard Edition accounts that were provisioned before this date will continue to receive Standard support until the accounts are
  transitioned to Premier support.

  Standard support hours are Monday - Friday, 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM, across all regions, but the time zones vary depending on the geographic
  location of the region:

  > North America:
  > :   Pacific Time (PST or PDT)
  >
  > Europe, Middle East, & Africa:
  > :   Central Europe Time (CET or CEST)
  >
  > Asia Pacific:
  > :   Australian Eastern Time (AEST or AEDT)

## Differences between regions

Snowflake features and services are identical across regions except for some newly-introduced features (based on cloud platform or region).
However, there are some differences in unit costs for credits and data storage between regions.

Another factor that impacts unit costs is whether your Snowflake account is *On Demand* or *Capacity*.

For more information about pricing as it pertains to a specific region and account type, see the
[pricing page](http://www.snowflake.com/pricing) (on the Snowflake website).

## View a list of regions available for an organization

An [organization administrator](organization-administrators.md) can view a list of regions available for an organization
through [Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs.md) or using SQL:

> Snowsight:
> :   In the navigation menu, select Admin » Accounts, and then select + Account. Browse through Region.
>
> SQL:
> :   Execute the [SHOW REGIONS](../sql-reference/sql/show-regions.md) command.

## Considerations for choosing a region for your account

When you request a Snowflake account, either through self-service or a Snowflake representative, you can choose the region where the
account is located. For example, you can decide to locate an account in a particular region on a particular cloud platform to address
latency concerns and/or provide additional backup and disaster recovery beyond the standard recovery support provided by Snowflake.
Snowflake does not place any restrictions on the region where you choose to locate each account.

If latency is a concern, you should choose the available region with the closest geographic proximity to your end users; however, this might
have cost implications, due to pricing differences between the regions. For more details, see the
[pricing page](http://www.snowflake.com/pricing) (on the Snowflake website).

If you are a government agency or a commercial organization that must comply with specific privacy and security requirements of the US
government, you can choose between two dedicated government regions provided by Snowflake.

> **Important:**
>
> Regions do not limit user access to Snowflake; they only dictate the geographic location where data is stored and compute resources are
> provisioned.
>
> In addition, Snowflake does not move data between accounts, so any data in an account in a region remains in the region unless users
> explicitly choose to copy, move, or [replicate](account-replication-intro.md) the data.

## Specify region information in your account hostname

A hostname for a Snowflake account starts with an *account identifier* and ends with the Snowflake domain
(`snowflakecomputing.com`). Snowflake supports two formats to use as the
[account identifier](admin-account-identifier.md) in your hostname:

* Account name (preferred)
* Account locator

> **Important:**
>
> If you choose the account locator as your account identifier, you might need to include additional segments in the locator that
> specify the cloud region and [cloud platform](intro-cloud-platforms.md) where your account is hosted.
>
> For more details, see [Format 2: Account locator in a region](admin-account-identifier.md).
