* Manage Postgres instances within Snowflake.

For more information about these and other tasks that you can perform, see [Snowsight: The Snowflake web interface](ui-snowsight.md).

## Work with data

### Workspaces

Workspaces is the unified editor for creating, organizing, and managing code across multiple file types. Workspaces provides a file-based
development environment where you can write SQL and Python, organize projects with folders, and integrate with Git for version control.

For more information, see:

* [Workspaces](ui-snowsight/workspaces.md)
* [Integrate workspaces with a Git repository](ui-snowsight/workspaces-git.md)
* [Work with worksheets in Snowsight](ui-snowsight-worksheets.md)

### Notebooks in Workspaces

Notebooks in Workspaces provide an interactive, cell-based environment for Python, SQL, and Markdown. Use notebooks for exploratory data analysis,
machine learning model development, and data science workflows with embedded visualizations and Git integration.

For more information, see:

* [Snowflake Notebooks in Workspaces](ui-snowsight/notebooks-in-workspaces/notebooks-in-workspaces-overview.md)

### Streamlit

Build and deploy interactive data applications with Streamlit in Snowflake. Create custom dashboards, reports, and data apps
using Python without managing infrastructure.

For more information, see:

* [About Streamlit in Snowflake](../developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit.md)
* [Create and deploy Streamlit apps using Snowsight](../developer-guide/streamlit/getting-started/create-streamlit-ui.md)

### dbt projects

Develop and manage dbt projects with a web-based IDE that connects to Git repositories. Build, test, and run SQL-based data
transformation pipelines directly in Snowflake with version control integration.

For more information, see:

* [Workspaces for dbt Projects on Snowflake](data-engineering/dbt-projects-on-snowflake-using-workspaces.md)

### Ingestion

Load data into Snowflake using Snowpipe for continuous ingestion, connectors for various data sources, and file uploads through the UI.

For more information, see:

* [Load data using Snowsight](data-load-web-ui.md)
* [Snowpipe](data-load-snowpipe-intro.md)
* [Staging files using Snowsight](data-load-local-file-system-stage-ui.md)

### Transformation

Transform your data with dbt projects for analytics engineering, dynamic tables for continuously refreshed materialized views,
and tasks for scheduling transformation workflows.

For more information, see:

* [Dynamic tables](dynamic-tables-about.md)
* [Introduction to tasks](tasks-intro.md)
* [View tasks and task graphs in Snowsight](ui-snowsight-tasks.md)

### AI & ML

Build AI-powered applications with AI Studio, interact with data conversationally using Snowflake Intelligence, and leverage
Cortex AI functions for text analysis and LLM capabilities. Use Cortex Agents for natural language interactions, Cortex Analyst
for data analysis, Cortex Search for vector similarity search, and Cortex Code for AI-powered coding assistance. Manage machine
learning models, features, and experiments for production ML workflows.

* [Overview of Snowflake Intelligence](snowflake-cortex/snowflake-intelligence.md)
* [Snowflake Cortex AI Functions (including LLM functions)](snowflake-cortex/aisql.md)
* [Cortex Code](cortex-code/cortex-code.md)

### Monitoring

Monitor and track query performance, container services and jobs, task execution, data loading activity, and system health.
Review query history with Performance Explorer to analyze and optimize queries, view traces and logs for observability,
and debug failed operations.

For more information, see:

* [Monitor query activity with Query History](ui-snowsight-activity.md)
* [View tasks and task graphs in Snowsight](ui-snowsight-tasks.md)
* [Monitor data loading activity by using Copy History](data-load-monitor.md)

### Marketplace

Discover and share data products on the Snowflake Marketplace. As a provider, publish data products and application packages
on the Snowflake Marketplace to share with the broader Snowflake community. As a consumer, access datasets and application packages
from providers to derive real-time data insights without needing to set up a data pipeline or write any code.

For more information, see:

* [About Snowflake Marketplace](../collaboration/collaboration-marketplace-about.md)
* [Create and configure shares](data-sharing-provider.md)
* [About the Snowflake Native App Framework](../developer-guide/native-apps/native-apps-about.md)

## Explore the Horizon Catalog

### Catalog

Discover database objects across your entire data estate with Universal Search and the Horizon Catalog. Explore databases, tables,
functions, views, and more using the Database Explorer. Browse the Internal Marketplace to find data products shared within
your organization, and manage apps and native application packages.

* [Snowflake Horizon Catalog](snowflake-horizon.md)
* [Explore and manage database objects in Snowsight](ui-snowsight-data.md)
* [About organizational listings](collaboration/listings/organizational/org-listing-about.md)

### Data sharing

Collaborate with users in other Snowflake accounts by sharing data and application packages securely through Internal sharing
(within your organization) or External sharing (to other organizations). As a provider, create data product listings, manage
sharing agreements, and use auto-fulfillment to provide data across regions. As a consumer, access datasets and application
packages shared with your account.
