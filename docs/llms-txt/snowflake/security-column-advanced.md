# Advanced Column-level Security topics

This topic provides an introduction to two advanced concepts related to Column-level Security masking policies:

1. Role hierarchy.
2. Using multiple [Context functions](../sql-reference/functions-context.md).

## Context functions and role hierarchy

Column-level Security supports using [Context functions](../sql-reference/functions-context.md) in the conditions of the masking policy body to enforce
whether a user has authorization to see data. To determine whether a user can see data in a given SQL statement, it is helpful to consider:

The current session:
:   Masking policy conditions using [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role.md) target the role in use for the current session.

Database and schema:
:   If you specify the [CURRENT_DATABASE](../sql-reference/functions/current_database.md) or [CURRENT_SCHEMA](../sql-reference/functions/current_schema.md) function in the
    body of a masking or row access policy, the function returns the database or schema that contains the protected table, not the database or
    schema in use for the session.

The executing role:
:   Masking policy conditions using [INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_role.md) target the executing role in a SQL statement.

Role hierarchy:
:   If role hierarchy is necessary in the policy conditions, use [IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session.md).

    Determine if a specified role in a masking policy condition (e.g. `analyst` custom role) is a lower privilege role in the
    CURRENT_ROLE or INVOKER_ROLE role hierarchy. If so, then the role returned by the CURRENT_ROLE or INVOKER_ROLE functions inherits the
    privileges of the specified role. For more information about role hierarchy and privilege inheritance, see:

    * [Overview of Access Control](security-access-control-overview.md)
    * [Configuring access control](security-access-control-configure.md)

The following table shows common context functions in masking policies that target the session, the executing role, and role hierarchy.

| Context function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role.md) | Returns the name of the role in use for the current session. |
| [CURRENT_DATABASE](../sql-reference/functions/current_database.md) | In a policy body, returns the database that contains the table that is protected by the masking policy. |
| [CURRENT_SCHEMA](../sql-reference/functions/current_schema.md) | In a policy body, returns the schema that contains the table that is protected by the masking policy. |
| [IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session.md) | Returns TRUE if the user’s current role in the session (i.e. the role returned by [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role.md)) inherits the privileges of the specified role. |
| [INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_role.md) | Returns the name of the executing role. |
| [IS_GRANTED_TO_INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/is_granted_to_invoker_role.md) | Returns TRUE if the role returned by the INVOKER_ROLE function inherits the privileges of the specified role in the argument based on the context in which the function is called. |
| [INVOKER_SHARE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_share.md) | Returns the name of the share that directly accessed the table or view where the INVOKER_SHARE function is invoked. |

### Use CURRENT_ROLE and IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION

A masking policy condition using CURRENT_ROLE targets the current session and is not affected by the execution context of the SQL statement.

If role activation and role hierarchy is necessary in the policy conditions, use [IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION](../sql-reference/functions/is_role_in_session.md).

Consider the following masking policy body:

> ```sqlexample
> CREATE OR REPLACE MASKING POLICY mask_string AS
> (val string) RETURNS string ->
> CASE
>   WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('ANALYST') THEN val
>   ELSE '********'
> END;
> ```

To determine whether a given user has authorization to see data in a column where this masking policy is set on that column, complete the
following steps:

1. Evaluate the masking policy conditions.
2. Determine if the specified role is in the CURRENT_ROLE hierarchy.
3. Run a test query to verify.

#### Step 1: Evaluate the masking policy conditions

The following table summarizes the consequences of the masking policy body conditions.

| Context | Sees unmasked data | Sees masked data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CURRENT_ROLE = ANALYST custom role. | ✔ |  |
| CURRENT_ROLE is in the ANALYST custom role in hierarchy. | ✔ |  |
| CURRENT_ROLE is not in the ANALYST custom role hierarchy. |  | ✔ |

Next, evaluate the role hierarchy.

#### Step 2: Determine if the specified role is in the CURRENT_ROLE hierarchy

Assuming that the CURRENT_ROLE is not the ANALYST custom role, determine if the CURRENT_ROLE inherits the privileges granted to the ANALYST custom role.

Execute the following statement:

> ```sqlexample
> SELECT IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION('ANALYST');
> ```
>
> ```output
> +-------------------------------+
> | IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION('ANALYST') |
> +-------------------------------+
> | FALSE                         |
> +-------------------------------+
> ```

Since Snowflake returns FALSE, the CURRENT_ROLE does not inherit privileges granted to the ANALYST custom role. Therefore, based on the masking policy body in this example, the user should see a fixed mask value.

#### Step 3: Run a test query to verify

Execute a query on the column that has the masking policy in this example applied to that column to verify that the user sees a fixed masked value.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE analyst;

SELECT * FROM mydb.mysch.mytable;
```

### Use INVOKER_ROLE

A masking policy condition using INVOKER_ROLE targets the execution context of the SQL statement.

The following table summarizes the execution context and the value that INVOKER_ROLE returns in a masking policy condition:

| Context | Evaluated role |
| --- | --- |
| User | [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role.md) |
| Table | CURRENT_ROLE. |
| View | View owner role. |
| UDF | UDF owner role. |
| Stored procedure with caller’s right | CURRENT_ROLE. |
| Stored procedure with owner’s right | Stored procedure owner role. |
| Task | Task owner role. |
| Stream | The role that queries a given [stream](streams-intro.md). |

Consider the following masking policy body that is applied to a single view on a table:

> ```sqlexample
> CREATE OR REPLACE MASKING POLICY mask_string AS
> (val string) RETURNS string ->
> CASE
>   WHEN INVOKER_ROLE() IN ('ANALYST') THEN val
>   ELSE '********'
> END;
> ```

To determine whether a given user running a query on the column has authorization to see data, complete the following steps:

1. Evaluate the masking policy conditions.
2. Determine if the specified role owns the view.
3. Run a test query to verify.

#### Step 1: Evaluate the masking policy conditions

The following table summarizes the consequences of the masking policy body conditions applied to a view column.

| Context | Sees unmasked data | Sees masked data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `analyst` custom role is the view owner role. | ✔ |  |
| `analyst` custom role is not the view owner role. |  | ✔ |

Next, determine if the ANALYST custom role owns the view.

#### Step 2: Determine if the ANALYST role owns the view

To determine if the ANALYST custom role owns the view, execute the following statement:

```sqlexample
SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE analyst;
```

If the `analyst` custom role owns the view, then a query on the view column should result in unmasked data.

If the `analyst` custom role does not own the view, masked data should be seen.

#### Step 3: Run a test query to verify

Execute a query on the view column to determine whether the ANALYST custom role sees masked or unmasked data.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE analyst;

SELECT * FROM mydb.mysch.myview;
```

### Use IS_GRANTED_TO_INVOKER_ROLE

The IS_GRANTED_TO_INVOKER_ROLE function can be passed into a masking policy body as part of a condition. When the function evaluates to TRUE, the role in the function argument is in the INVOKER_ROLE hierarchy.

Consider the following masking policy body that is applied to a view column of social security numbers (SSNs):

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE MASKING POLICY mask_string AS
(val string) RETURNS string ->
CASE
  WHEN IS_GRANTED_TO_INVOKER_ROLE('PAYROLL') THEN val
  WHEN IS_GRANTED_TO_INVOKER_ROLE('ANALYST') THEN REGEXP_REPLACE(val, '[0-9]', '*', 7)
  ELSE '*******'
END;
```

To determine whether a given user running a query on the view column has authorization to see data, complete the following steps:

1. Evaluate the masking policy conditions.
2. Determine if the specified role is in invoker role hierarchy. For example, if the policy is set on a view, the specified role must
   be in the view owner role hierarchy to return TRUE. For details, see the [usage notes](../sql-reference/functions/is_granted_to_invoker_role.md).
3. Run a test query to verify.

#### Step 1: Evaluate the masking policy conditions

The following table summarizes the consequences of the masking policy body conditions applied to a view column and viewing data in the view column.

| Context | Unmasked data | Partially masked data | Masked data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payroll` custom role is in the view owner role hierarchy. | ✔ |  |  |
| `analyst` custom role is in the view owner role hierarchy. |  | ✔ |  |
| Neither the `payroll` nor `analyst` custom roles are in the view owner hierarchy. |  |  | ✔ |

#### Step 2: Determine if the specified role is in the view owner role hierarchy

If either the `payroll` or `analyst` custom roles are in the view owner hierarchy, then executing a
[SHOW GRANTS](../sql-reference/sql/show-grants.md) command on the view owner role can verify the role hierarchy. For example:

> ```sqlexample
> SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE view_owner_role;
> ```

The outputs of the SQL statement will state whether the view owner role has been granted either the `payroll` or `analyst` custom roles.

#### Step 3: Run a test query to verify

Execute a query on the column that has the masking policy in this example applied to that column to verify how the user sees data in the
view column.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE payroll;

SELECT * FROM mydb.mysch.myview;

USE ROLE analyst;

SELECT * FROM mydb.mysch.myview;
```

## Combine CURRENT_ROLE and INVOKER_ROLE in masking policies

Snowflake supports creating a single masking policy to differentiate the role in use for the session that executes a query
(i.e. [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role.md)) and the object owner executing a query
(e.g. view owner, [INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_role.md)). Uses cases of this type are typically more complicated than simply
determining a set of values to mask and a relatively small audience (e.g. users with the `analyst` custom role) that can see unmasked
values.

### Hashing, cryptographic, and encryption functions in masking policies

[Hashing](../sql-reference/functions-hash-scalar.md) and [cryptographic/checksum](../sql-reference/functions-string.md) can be used in masking policies to mask sensitive data.

Before implementing any of these functions in a [masking policy](security-column-intro.md), it is important to consider
whether your use case with these functions involve [JOIN](../sql-reference/constructs/join.md) operations. Under certain masking policy
implementations, creative JOIN operations that involve tables and views can lead to reverse engineering the masked value to its true value
based upon the following limitation:

* It is possible that collisions may occur because there may not be a 1:1 representation of the actual value (i.e. input) and the hashed,
  cryptographic, or checksum value based on the total number of values (i.e. output, the range of values) to transform.

A 1:1 representation is more likely to occur until the total number of input values reaches the square root of the output values to
transform.

For example, if the output values to hash is 144, then it is reasonable to expect that the first 12 values
(i.e. 144^(1/2) – the square root of 144) will be unique and that collisions might occur for the remaining 132 values. Since this
limitation and its consequence is possible, it is advisable to never use hashed, cryptographic, or checksum functions in masking policies
whose values may be used in JOIN operations.

> **Tip:**
>
> If the masking policy use case prioritizes collision avoidance for enhanced security, implement
> [External Tokenization](security-column-ext-token-intro.md). Tokenization does not result in collisions because there is
> always a 1:1 representation of the input and output values.
>
> If tokenization is not possible, one possible workaround is to implement a masking policy to differentiate between the session role
> executing a query (i.e. [CURRENT_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/current_role.md)) and the object owner executing a query
> (i.e. [INVOKER_ROLE](../sql-reference/functions/invoker_role.md)).
>
> For example, the following masking policy assumes two different custom roles, CSR_EMPL_INFO and DBA_EMPL_INFO, to regulate access to
> employee information.
>
> > ```sqlexample
> > CREATE OR REPLACE MASKING POLICY mask_string AS
> > (val string) RETURNS string ->
> > CASE
> >     WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('CSR_EMPL_INFO') THEN HASH(val)
> >     WHEN INVOKER_ROLE() IN ('DBA_EMPL_INFO') THEN val
> >     ELSE null
> > END;
> > ```
>
> If the policy is applied to the table, then the policy will be inherited to any view created from the table. If the custom role
> `dba_empl_info` owns the view created from this table (i.e. has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the view), then only users with this custom
> role can see the actual values if querying the view. Users with the `csr_empl_info` custom role always see a hashed value whether query
> is made on the table or view. All other users see `NULL`.
