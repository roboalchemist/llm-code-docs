# Parsing documents with AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT

AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT is a Cortex AI Function that extracts text, data, layout elements, and images from documents.
It can be used with other functions to create custom document processing pipelines for a variety of use cases
(see [Cortex AI Functions: Documents](ai-documents.md)).

For information on using AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT to extract images, with examples, see [Cortex AI Functions: Image extraction with AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT](image-extraction.md).

The function extracts text and layout from documents stored on internal or external stages and preserves reading order and structures like
tables and headers. For information about creating a stage suitable for storing documents, see [Create stage for media files](aisql.md).

AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT orchestrates advanced AI models for document understanding and layout analysis and processes complex
multi-page documents with high fidelity.

The AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT function offers two modes for processing PDF documents:

* **LAYOUT** mode is the preferred choice for most use cases, especially for complex documents.
  It’s specifically optimized for extracting text and layout elements like tables, making it the best option for
  building knowledge bases, optimizing retrieval systems, and enhancing AI based applications.
* **OCR** mode is recommended for quick, high-quality text extraction from documents such as
  manuals, agreements or contracts, product detail pages, insurance policies and claims, and
  [SharePoint documents](../../connectors/unstructured-data-connectors/sharepoint/about.md).

For both modes, use the `page_split` option to split multi-page documents into separate
pages in the response. You can also use the `page_filter` option to process only specified pages.
If using `page_filter`, `page_split` is implied, and you do not need to set it explicitly.

AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT is horizontally scalable, enabling efficient batch processing of multiple
documents simultaneously. Documents can be processed directly from object storage to avoid unnecessary data movement.

> **Note:**
>
> AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT is currently incompatible with custom [network policies](../network-policies.md).

## Examples

### Simple layout example

This example uses AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT’s LAYOUT mode to process a two-column research paper. The `page_split` parameter
is set to TRUE in order to separate the document into pages in the response. AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT returns the content in Markdown
format. The following shows rendered Markdown for one of the processed pages (page index 4 in the JSON output) next to
the original page. The raw Markdown is shown in the JSON response following the images.

The following is the SQL command to process the original document:

```sqlexample
SELECT AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT (
    TO_FILE('@docs.doc_stage','research-paper-example.pdf'),
    {'mode': 'LAYOUT' , 'page_split': true}) AS research_paper_example;
```

The response from AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT is a JSON object containing metadata and text from the pages of the document, like
the following. Some page objects have been omitted for brevity.

      and code-generation, typically observe much longer prompt than generations, leading to high prefill cost and response
      latency. We present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure targeted at reducing the prefill
      compute (in FLOPs) of prompt tokens while preserving high generation quality. First, SwiftKV prefills later layers' KV
      cache using an earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip those later layers. Second, SwiftKV employs a
      lightweight knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs with minimal accuracy impact. Third,
      SwiftKV can naturally incorporate KV cache compression to improve inference performance in low-memory scenarios. Our
      comprehensive experiments show that SwiftKV can effectively reduce prefill computation by $25-50 \\%$ across several LLM
      families while incurring minimum quality degradation. In the end-to-end inference serving, SwiftKV realizes up to $2
      \\times$ higher aggregate throughput and $60 \\%$ lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU
      of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16 K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B. SwiftKV is open-sourced at
      https://github . com/snowflakedb/arctictraining.\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are now an
      integral enabler of enterprise applications and offerings, including code and data co-pilots (Chen et al., 2021; Pourreza
      and Rafiei, 2024), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2024), summarization (Pu et al.,
      2023; Zhang et al., 2024), and agentic workflows (Wang et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2023). However, the cost and speed of
      inference determine their practicality, and improving the throughput and latency of LLM inference has become increasingly
      important.\n\nWhile prior works, such as model pruning (Ma et al., 2023; Sreenivas et al., 2024), KV cache compression
      (Hooper et al., 2024; Shazeer, 2019; Ainslie et al., 2023b; Chang et al., 2024), and sparse attention (Zhao et al., 2024;
      Jiang et al., 2024), have been developed to accelerate LLM inference, they typically significantly degrade the model
      quality or work best in niche scenarios, such as lowmemory environments or extremely long contexts requests (e.g. $>100
      \\mathrm{~K}$ tokens). On the other hand, production deployments are often compute-bound rather than memory-bound, and
      such long-context requests are rare amongst diverse enterprise use cases (e.g. those observed at Snowflake).\n\nIn this
      paper, we take a different approach to improving LLM inference based on the key observation that typical enterprise
      workloads process more input tokens than output tokens. For example, tasks like code completion, text-to-SQL,
      summarization, and RAG each submit long prompts but produce fewer output tokens (a 10:1 ratio with average prompt length
      between 500 and 1000 is observed in our production). In these scenarios, inference throughput and latency are often
      dominated by the cost of prompt processing (i.e. prefill), and reducing this cost is key to improving their performance.
      \n\nBased on this observation, we designed SwiftKV, which improves throughput and latency by reducing the prefill
      computation for prompt tokens. SwiftKV (Fig. 1) consists of three key components:\n\nModel transformation. SwiftKV rewires
      an existing LLM so that the prefill stage during inference can skip a number of later transformer layers, and their KV
      cache are computed by the last unskipped layer. This is motivated by the observation that the hidden states of later
      layers do not change significantly (see Sec. 3.2 and (Liu et al., 2024b)). With SwiftKV, prefill compute is reduced by
      approximately the number of layers skipped.\n\nOptionally, for low-memory scenarios, we",

    {
      "content": "Efficient Distillation. Since only a few $\\mathbf{W}_{Q K V}$ parameters need training, we can keep just a
      single copy of the original model weights in memory that are frozen during training, and add an extra trainable copy of
      the $\\mathbf{W}_{Q K V}$ parameters for layers $>l$ initialized using the original model (See Fig. 1).\n\nDuring
      training, we create two modes for the later layers $>l$, one with original frozen parameters using original architecture,
      and another with the SwiftKV re-wiring using new QKV projections i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{y}_{\\text
      {teacher }}=\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{x}, \\text { SwiftKV }=\\text { False }) \\\\\n& \\mathbf{y}_{\\text {student }}=\\mathbf
      {M}(\\mathbf{x}, \\text { SwiftKV }=\\text { True })\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}$ is the final logits,
      $\\mathbf{M}$ is the model, and $\\mathbf{x}$ is the input. Afterwards, we apply the standard distillation loss (Hinton et
      al., 2015) on the outputs. After the distillation, the original KV projection layers $>l$ are discarded during inference.
      \n\nThis method allows us to distill Llama-3.1-8BInstruct on 680 M tokens of data in 3 hours using 8 H100 GPUs, and
      Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct in 5 hours using 32 H100 GPUs across 4 nodes. In contrast, many prune-and-distill (Sreenivas et
      al., 2024) and layer-skipping (Elhoushi et al., 2024) methods require much larger datasets (e.g. 10-100B tokens) and incur
      greater accuracy gaps than SwiftKV.\n\n### 3.5 Optimized Implementation for Inference\n\nLLM serving systems can be
      complex and incorporate many simultaneous optimizations at multiple layers of the stack, such as PagedAttention (Kwon et
      al., 2023), Speculative Decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), SplitFuse (Holmes et al., 2024; Agrawal et al., 2024), and
      more. A benefit of SwiftKV is that it makes minimal changes to the model architecture, so it can be integrated into
      existing serving systems without implementing new kernels (e.g. for custom attention operations or sparse computation) or
      novel inference procedures.\n\nImplementation in vLLM and SGLang. To show that the theoretical compute reductions of
      SwiftKV translates to real-world savings, we integrated it with vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and SGLang (Zheng et al., 2024).
      Our implementation is compatible with chunked prefill (Holmes et al., 2024; Agrawal et al., 2024), which mixes chunks of
      prefill tokens and decode tokens in each minibatch. During each forward pass, after completing layer $l$, the KV-cache for
      the remaining layers ( $>l$ ) are immediately computed, and only the decode tokens are propagated through the rest of the
      model layers.\n\n## 4 Main Results\n\nWe evaluated SwiftKV in terms of model accuracy (Sec. 4.1) compared to the original
      model and several baselines, and end-to-end inference performance (Sec. 4.2) in a real serving system.\n\nDistillation
      datasets. Our dataset is a mixture of Ultrachat (Ding et al., 2023), SlimOrca (Lian et al., 2023), and OpenHermes-2.5
      (Teknium, 2023), totaling roughly 680M Llama-3.1 tokens. For more details, please see Appendix A.1.\n\nSwiftKV Notation.
      For prefill computation, we report the approximate reduction as $(L-l) / L$ due to SwiftKV, and for KV cache, we report
      the exact memory reduction due to AcrossKV. For example, SwiftKV $(l=L / 2)$ and 4-way AcrossKV is reported as $50 \\%$
      prefill compute reduction and $37.5 \\% \\mathrm{KV}$ cache memory reduction.\n\n### 4.1 Model Quality Impact of
      SwiftKV\n\nTable 2 shows the quality results of all models we evaluated, including Llama-3.1-Instruct, Qwen2.
      5-14B-Instruct, Mistral-Small, and Deepseek-V2. Of these models, we note that the Llama models span two orders of
      magnitude in size (3B to 405B), Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct uses FP8 (W8A16) quantization, and Deepseek-V2-Lite-Chat is a
      mixture-of-experts model that implements a novel latent attention mechanism (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024).\n\nWe also compare
      with three baselines: (1) FFN-SkipLLM (Jaiswal et al., 2024), a training-free method for skipping FFN layers (no attention
      layers are skipped) based on hidden state similarity, (2) Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Sreenivas et al., 2024), which
      is pruned and distilled from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct using neural architecture search on 40B tokens, and (3) DarwinLM-8.4B
      (Tang et al., 2025), which is pruned and distilled from Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct using 10B tokens.\n\nSwiftKV. For Llama,
      Mistral, and Deepseek, we find the accuracy degradation for $25 \\%$ SwiftKV is less than $0.5 \\%$ from the original
      models (averaged across tasks). Additionally, the accuracy gap is within $1-2 \\%$ even at $40-50 \\%$ SwiftKV. Beyond $50
      \\%$ SwiftKV, model quality drops quickly. For example, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct incurs a 7\\% accuracy gap at $62.5 \\%$
      SwiftKV. We find that Qwen suffers larger degradations, at $1.1 \\%$ for $25 \\%$ SwiftKV and $7.4 \\%$ for $50 \\%$
      SwiftKV, which may be due to Qwen models having lower simularity between layer at 50-75\\% depth (Fig. 2). Even still,

      Subscriptions\n\nEnding Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions includes all Connected Fitness Subscriptions for which we are
      currently receiving payment (a successful credit card billing or prepaid subscription credit or waiver). We do not include
      paused Connected Fitness Subscriptions in our Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscription count.\n\n## Average Net Monthly
      Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn\n\nTo align with the definition of Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions
      above, our quarterly Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn is calculated as follows: Paid Connected
      Fitness Subscriber \"churn count\" in the quarter, divided by the average number of beginning Paid Connected Fitness
      Subscribers each month, divided by three months. \"Churn count\" is defined as quarterly Connected Fitness Subscription
      churn events minus Connected Fitness Subscription unpause events minus Connected Fitness Subscription reactivations.\n\nWe
      refer to any cancellation or pausing of a subscription for our All-Access Membership as a churn event. Because we do not
      receive payment for paused Connected Fitness Subscriptions, a paused Connected Fitness Subscription is treated as a churn
      event at the time the pause goes into effect, which is the start of the next billing cycle. An unpause event occurs when a
      pause period elapses without a cancellation and the Connected Fitness Subscription resumes, and is therefore counted as a
      reduction in our churn count in that period. Our churn count is shown net of reactivations and our new quarterly Average Net
      Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn metric averages the monthly Connected Fitness churn percentage across the
      three months of the reported quarter.\n\n## Ending Paid App Subscriptions\n\nEnding Paid App Subscriptions include all App
      One, App+, and Strength+ subscriptions for which we are currently receiving payment.\n\n## Average Monthly Paid App
      Subscription Churn\n\nWhen a Subscriber to App One, App+, or Strength+ cancels their membership (a churn event) and
      resubscribes in a subsequent period, the resubscription is considered a new subscription (rather than a reactivation that is
      counted as a reduction in our churn count). Average Paid App Subscription Churn is calculated as follows: Paid App
      Subscription cancellations in the quarter, divided by the average number of beginning Paid App Subscriptions each month,
      divided by three months.\n\n\n[^0]:    (1) Beginning January 1, 2025, the Company migrated its subscription data model for

      to changes to a subscription's payment status when they occur. The new model gives the Company more precise and timely data
      on subscription pause and churn behavior. Prior period information has been revised to conform with current period
      presentation. The impact of this change in the model on Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, Average Net Monthly

  und Jugendliche machen. Noch immer funktioniert es vielerorts nur auf dem Papier, dass alle gut zusammen lernen. Im Alltag
  fehlen dann die Lehrkräfte und Mittel, um zum Beispiel einen geflüchteten Jugendlichen oder einen mit ADHS so zu unterstützen,

Snowflake Cortex can produce a translation to any supported language (English, language code `'en'`, in this case) as follows:

```sqlexample
SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE (ger_example, '', 'en') from german_article;
```

The translation is as follows:

"Schools deserve to be good places. Here, we are supposed to learn knowledge and skills that will carry us through life. Many
spend a large part of their day here, and this is during a phase of life when time can seem almost endless and a double period
can feel like half a lifetime.

Whether it's the friend you would be lost without in the schoolyard. The teacher you can't get along with, but still have to
endure every day. The class trip where you see the sea for the first time and make out. In schools, experiences,
relationships, and memories are created that shape us for a lifetime.

The expectations for schools are correspondingly high. Nevertheless, they are quickly forgotten by society and pushed to the
back by politics. For decades, the German school system has been receiving devastating reports.

Even now, the level of education and the financial status of the parents still determine which school certificate children and
young people receive. It still only works on paper that everyone learns well together. In everyday life, the teachers and
resources are lacking to support, for example, a refugee youth or a student with ADHD so that they can sit in a classroom on
an equal footing. The societal insight that all school certificates have value and are needed also needs to be regained.

Now, let's get going!

The fact that school has to start so early is not a law. And it's not advisable either: teenagers have a different biological
rhythm and need more sleep than adults. A start time of 9 or 10 o'clock would be better for most, research agrees.

Reality sets in very quickly at schools. While society is still wondering how to deal with artificial intelligence, teachers,
students, and pupils are already being used for their purposes. While it was debated for years whether Germany is an
immigration country, it has been one in schools for a long time. And while other topics are pushing climate change out of the
public eye, it is especially students who are loudly pointing out the most pressing problem of our time. The challenges and
questions that schools face affect us all. School is the future.

School administrations, teachers, educational staff, and all those who take care of the success of everyday school life face
this every day. They try to shape school despite many problems and lack of appreciation, they try to convey to the students
that it's up to them. So that they believe in themselves. They deserve it."

### Using OCR mode

OCR mode extracts text from scanned documents, such as screenshots or PDFs containing images of text.
It does not preserve layout.

```sqlexample
SELECT AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT(
  TO_FILE( '@docs.doc_stage', 'document_1.pdf' ),
  { 'mode': 'OCR' } ) AS OCR;
```

Output:

```output
{
  "content": "content of the document"
}
```

### Process only certain pages of a document

This example demonstrates using the `page_filter` option to extract specific pages from a document, specifically
the first page of a 55-page research paper. Keep in mind that page indexes starts at 0 and ranges are inclusive of
the start value but exclusive of the end value. For example, `start: 0, end: 1` returns only the first page (index 0).

```sqlexample
SELECT AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT(
  TO_FILE('@my_documents', 'ResearchArticle.pdf'),
  {'mode': 'LAYOUT', 'page_filter': [{'start': 0, 'end': 1}]} );
```

Result:

```output

      Benefits and Implementation Strategies \n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nBackground: Strength training
      has emerged as one of the most powerful interventions for promoting health across the
      lifespan. This comprehensive review examines the extensive evidence supporting strength
      training's role in preventing chronic disease, maintaining functional independence, and
      enhancing quality of life.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed
      literature published between 2018-2024, analyzing 127 studies involving over 45,000
      participants across various populations.\n\nResults: Regular resistance exercise provides
      cardiovascular benefits ( $15-20 \\%$ reduction in heart disease risk), metabolic improvements
      ( $12-18 \\%$ better insulin sensitivity), cognitive enhancements ( $25 \\%$ slower
      cognitive decline), and psychological well-being improvements. Strength training increases
      bone mineral density by $1-3 \\%$ annually and reduces fall risk by up to $40 \\%$ in older
      adults.\n\nConclusions: Current guidelines recommend at least two sessions per week targeting
      all major muscle groups. Implementation of strength training programs should be considered a
      public health priority given the substantial evidence for disease prevention and health
      promotion.\n\n\nKeywords: resistance training, muscle strength, bone density, chronic
      disease prevention, healthy aging, exercise prescription\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe human
      musculoskeletal system is designed for regular mechanical loading and progressive challenge.
      Throughout evolutionary history, our ancestors engaged in strength-demanding activities
      essential for survival, maintaining robust muscle mass and bone density well into advanced age.
      However, the modern sedentary lifestyle has created an unprecedented mismatch between our
      biological needs and daily activities, contributing to rising rates of sarcopenia,
      osteoporosis, and metabolic dysfunction.\n\nStrength training, also known as resistance
      training or weight training, represents a targeted intervention that can address many
      contemporary health challenges. Unlike aerobic exercise alone, resistance training provides
      unique physiological adaptations that are essential for long-term health and functional
      independence. The World Health Organization now recognizes strength training as a fundamental
      component of physical activity guidelines for all adults.\n\nKey Statistics: Only 31\\% of
      adults meet strength training recommendations, despite evidence showing $20-30 \\%$ reductions
      in all-cause mortality among regular participants.\n\n## Physiological Mechanisms and
      Adaptations\n\n## Musculoskeletal Benefits\n\nStrength training stimulates muscle protein
      synthesis through mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation, leading to
      increased muscle fiber size and improved neuromuscular coordination. Research demonstrates
      that adults can increase muscle mass by $2-4 \\%$ per month during initial training phases,
      with continued improvements possible throughout life.\n\nBone tissue responds to mechanical
      loading through osteoblast activation and increased bone formation. Weight-bearing resistance
      exercises create piezoelectric effects that stimulate osteocyte networks, resulting in
      improved bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk. Studies show 1-3\\% annual",

### Classify multiple documents

To classify multiple documents, first create a table of the files by retrieving the document locations from a
directory, converting these locations to FILE objects.

```sqlexample
CREATE TABLE documents_table AS
  (SELECT TO_FILE('@my_documents', RELATIVE_PATH)
    AS docs FROM DIRECTORY(@my_documents));
```

Then apply AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT to each document in the table and process the results, for example by passing them
to AI_CLASSIFY to categorize the documents by type. This is an efficient approach to batch document analysis in a
document collection.

```sqlexample
WITH single_page_extraction as (
  SELECT
  TO_VARCHAR (AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT(docs, {'mode': 'LAYOUT',
    'page_filter': [{'start': 0, 'end': 1}]} )) AS first_page FROM documents_table)
SELECT AI_CLASSIFY(
  first_page,
  ['health', 'fitness','economics', 'science', 'psychology' ,'sociology','statistics', 'finance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Analytics'],
  {'output_mode': 'multi'} ) as article_classification
FROM single_page_extraction;
```

The query returns classification labels for each document.

```output
{ "labels": [ "health", "psychology", "science" ] }
{ "labels": [ "fitness", "health", "science" ] }
{ "labels": [ "Analytics", "Artificial Intelligence" ] }
{ "labels": [ "finance", "Analytics" ] }

..

{ "labels": [ "finance" ] }
{ "labels": [ "Artificial Intelligence", "science" ] }
{ "labels": [ "Artificial Intelligence", "science" ] }
{ "labels": [ "fitness", "health", "science" ] }
```

## Access control requirements

To use the AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT function, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role must grant the SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER database role to the user who
will call the function. See [Cortex LLM privileges](aisql.md) topic for details.

## Cost considerations

The Cortex AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT function incurs compute costs based on the number of pages per document processed. The following describes how pages are counted for different file formats:

* For paged file formats (PDF, DOCX), each page in the document is billed as a page.
* For image file formats (JPEG, JPG, TIF, TIFF, PNG), each individual image file is billed as a page.
* For HTML and TXT files, each chunk of 3,000 characters is billed as a page, including the last chunk, which may be less than 3,000 characters.

Snowflake recommends executing queries that call the Cortex AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT function in a smaller warehouse (no larger
than MEDIUM). Larger warehouses do not increase performance.
