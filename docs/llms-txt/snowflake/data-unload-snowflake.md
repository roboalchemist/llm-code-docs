# Unload into a Snowflake stage

This set of topics describes how to use the COPY command to unload data from a table into an internal (i.e. Snowflake) stage. You can then download the unloaded data files to your local file system.

As illustrated in the diagram below, unloading data to a local file system is performed in two, separate steps:

Step 1:
:   Use the [COPY INTO <location>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.md) command to copy the data from the Snowflake database table into one or more files in a Snowflake stage. In the SQL statement, you specify the
    stage (named stage or table/user stage) where the files are written.

    Regardless of the stage you use, this step requires a running, current virtual warehouse for the session if you execute the command
    manually or within a script. The warehouse provides the compute resources to write rows from the table.

Step 2:
:   Use the [GET](../sql-reference/sql/get.md) command to download the data files to your local file system.

## Unload the data

This section provides instructions for unloading table data to a named internal stage, table stage, or user stage.

### Unload data to a named internal stage

Internal stages are named database objects that provide the greatest degree of flexibility for data unloading. Because they are database objects, privileges for named stages can be granted to any role.

You can create an internal stage using either the web interface or SQL:

> Snowsight:
> :   In the navigation menu, select Catalog » Database Explorer. Then select the *<db_name>* » Stages.
>
> SQL:
> :   [CREATE STAGE](../sql-reference/sql/create-stage.md)

#### Create a named stage

The following example creates an internal stage that references the named file format object called `my_csv_unload_format` that was created in [File formats to unload data](data-unload-prepare.md):

> ```sqlexample
> CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_unload_stage
>   FILE_FORMAT = my_csv_unload_format;
> ```

#### Unload data to the named stage

1. Use the [COPY INTO <location>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.md) command to unload all the rows from a table into one or more files into the `my_csv_unload_format` stage. The statement prefixes the unloaded
   file(s) with `unload/` to organize the files in the stage:

   For example:

   > ```sqlexample
   > COPY INTO @mystage/unload/ from mytable;
   > ```

   Note that the `@` character by itself identifies a named stage.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > Because the file format options were defined for the stage, it is not necessary to specify the same file format options in the COPY command.
2. Use the [LIST](../sql-reference/sql/list.md) command to view a list of files that have been unloaded to the stage:

   ```sqlexample
   LIST @mystage;

   +----------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | name                             | size | md5                              | last_modified                 |
   |----------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------|
   | mystage/unload/data_0_0_0.csv.gz |  112 | 6f77daba007a643bdff4eae10de5bed3 | Mon, 11 Sep 2017 18:13:07 GMT |
   +----------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   ```

3. Use the [GET](../sql-reference/sql/get.md) command to download the generated file(s) from the table stage to your local machine. The following example downloads the files to the `data/unload` directory:

   For example:

   Linux or macOS:

   > ```sqlexample
   > GET @mystage/unload/data_0_0_0.csv.gz file:///data/unload;
   > ```

   Windows:

   > ```sqlexample
   > GET @mystage/unload/data_0_0_0.csv.gz file://C:\data\unload;
   > ```

### Unload data to a table stage

1. Use the [COPY INTO <location>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.md) command to unload all the rows from a table into one or more files in the stage for the table. The following example unloads data files to the stage
   using the named `my_csv_unload_format` file format created in [File formats to unload data](data-unload-prepare.md). The statement prefixes the unloaded file(s) with `unload/` to organize the files
   in the stage:

   For example:

   > ```sqlexample
   > COPY INTO @%mytable/unload/ from mytable FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = 'my_csv_unload_format' COMPRESSION = NONE);
   > ```

   Note that the `@%` character combination identifies a table stage.
2. Use the [LIST](../sql-reference/sql/list.md) command to view a list of files that have been unloaded to the stage:

   ```sqlexample
   LIST @%mytable;

   +-----------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | name                  | size | md5                              | last_modified                 |
   |-----------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------|
   | unload/data_0_0_0.csv |   96 | 29918f18bcb35e7b6b628ca41024236c | Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:45:20 GMT |
   +-----------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   ```

3. Use the [GET](../sql-reference/sql/get.md) command to download the generated file(s) from the table stage to your local machine. The following example downloads the files to the `data/unload` directory:

   For example:

   Linux or macOS:

   > ```sqlexample
   > GET @%mytable/unload/data_0_0_0.csv file:///data/unload;
   > ```

   Windows:

   > ```sqlexample
   > GET @%mytable/unload/data_0_0_0.csv file://C:\data\unload;
   > ```

### Unload data to your user stage

1. Use the [COPY INTO <location>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.md) command to unload all the rows from a table into one or more files in your stage. The following example unloads data files to your user stage using
   the named `my_csv_unload_format` file format created in [File formats to unload data](data-unload-prepare.md). The statement prefixes the unloaded file(s) with `unload/` to organize the files in the stage:

   For example:

   > ```sqlexample
   > COPY INTO @~/unload/ from mytable FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = 'my_csv_unload_format' COMPRESSION = NONE);
   > ```

   Note that the `@~` character combination identifies a user stage.
2. Use the [LIST](../sql-reference/sql/list.md) command to view a list of files that have been unloaded to the stage:

   ```sqlexample
   LIST @~;

   +-----------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | name                  | size | md5                              | last_modified                 |
   |-----------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------|
   | unload/data_0_0_0.csv |   96 | 94a306c55733b95a0887511ff355936b | Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:25:07 GMT |
   +-----------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   ```

3. Use the [GET](../sql-reference/sql/get.md) command to download the generated file(s) from your stage to your local machine. The following example downloads the files to the `data/unload` directory:

   For example:

   Linux or macOS:

   > ```sqlexample
   > GET @~/unload/data_0_0_0.csv file:///data/unload;
   > ```

   Windows:

   > ```sqlexample
   > GET @~/unload/data_0_0_0.csv file://C:\data\unload;
   > ```

## Manage unloaded data files

Staged files can be deleted from a Snowflake stage using the [REMOVE](../sql-reference/sql/remove.md) command to remove the files in the stage after you are finished with them.

Removing files improves performance when loading data, because it reduces the number of files that the [COPY INTO <table>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.md) command must scan to verify whether existing files in a
stage were loaded already.
