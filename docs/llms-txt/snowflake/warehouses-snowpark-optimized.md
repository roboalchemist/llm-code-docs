# Snowpark-optimized warehouses

Snowpark-optimized warehouses let you configure the available memory resources and CPU architecture on a single-node instance for
your workloads.

## When to use a Snowpark-optimized warehouse

While [Snowpark](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowpark/) workloads can be run on both standard and Snowpark-optimized warehouses,
Snowpark-optimized warehouses are recommended for running Snowpark workloads such as code that has large
memory requirements or dependencies on a specific CPU architecture. Example workloads include Machine Learning (ML) training
use cases using a [stored procedure](../developer-guide/stored-procedure/stored-procedures-overview.md) on a single virtual warehouse
node. Snowpark workloads, utilizing [UDF](../developer-guide/udf/udf-overview.md) or
[UDTF](../developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-tabular-functions.md), might also benefit from Snowpark-optimized warehouses.
Workloads that don’t use Snowpark might not benefit from running on Snowpark-optimized warehouses.

> **Note:**
>
> Initial creation and resumption of a Snowpark-optimized virtual warehouse might take longer than standard warehouses.

## Configuration options for Snowpark-optimized warehouses

[Preview Feature](../release-notes/preview-features.md) — Open

The 1 TB resource constraints (MEMORY_64X and MEMORY_64X_x86) are available as a preview feature.
The 1 TB constraints are available only on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

All other MEMORY_\* resource constraint sizes are generally available and are available for all cloud platforms.

The default configuration for a Snowpark-optimized warehouse provides 16x memory per node compared to a standard warehouse. You can
optionally configure additional memory per node and specify CPU architecture using the `resource_constraint` property
of the [CREATE WAREHOUSE](../sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.md) or [ALTER WAREHOUSE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse.md) command.
The following options are available:

| Memory (up to) | CPU architecture | RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT values | Minimum warehouse size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16GB | Default or x86 | MEMORY_1X, MEMORY_1X_x86 | XSMALL |
| 256GB | Default or x86 | MEMORY_16X, MEMORY_16X_x86 | M |
| 1TB | Default or x86 | MEMORY_64X, MEMORY_64X_x86 | L |

## Creating a Snowpark-optimized warehouse

To create a new Snowpark-optimized warehouse, you can set the warehouse type property in the following interfaces.

SQLPython

Set the WAREHOUSE_TYPE property to `'SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED'` when running the [CREATE WAREHOUSE](../sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.md) command. For example:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE snowpark_opt_wh WITH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
  WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED';
```

Create a large Snowpark-optimized warehouse `so_warehouse` with 256 GB of memory by specifying the resource constraint
`MEMORY_16X_X86`:

```sqlexample
CREATE WAREHOUSE so_warehouse WITH
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'
  WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED'
  RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT = 'MEMORY_16X_X86';
```

> **Note:**
>
> The default resource constraint is `MEMORY_16X`.

Set the `warehouse_type` property to `'SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED'` when constructing a [Warehouse](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/reference/latest/_autosummary/snowflake.core.warehouse.Warehouse) object.

Then, pass this `Warehouse` object to the [WarehouseCollection.create](/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/reference/latest/_autosummary/snowflake.core.warehouse.WarehouseCollection)
method to create the warehouse in Snowflake. For example:

```python
from snowflake.core import CreateMode
from snowflake.core.warehouse import Warehouse

my_wh = Warehouse(
  name="snowpark_opt_wh",
  warehouse_size="MEDIUM",
  warehouse_type="SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED"
)
root.warehouses.create(my_wh, mode=CreateMode.or_replace)
```

> **Note:**
>
> Resource constraints are currently not supported in the Snowflake Python APIs.

## Modifying Snowpark-optimized warehouse properties

To modify warehouse properties including the warehouse type, you can use the following interfaces.

> **Note:**
>
> You can change the warehouse type whether the warehouse is in the `STARTED` or `SUSPENDED` state.
> If you suspend a warehouse before changing the `warehouse_type` property, execute the following operation:
>
> SQLPython
>
> ```sqlexample
> ALTER WAREHOUSE snowpark_opt_wh SUSPEND;
> ```
>
> ```python
> root.warehouses["snowpark_opt_wh"].suspend()
> ```

SQLPython

Use the [ALTER WAREHOUSE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse.md) command to modify the memory resources and CPU architecture for Snowpark-optimized
warehouse `so_warehouse`:

```sqlexample
ALTER WAREHOUSE so_warehouse SET
  RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT = 'MEMORY_1X_x86';
```

Resource constraints are currently not supported in the Snowflake Python APIs.

## Using Snowpark Python Stored Procedures to run ML training workloads

For information on Machine Learning Models and Snowpark Python, see [Training Machine Learning Models with Snowpark Python](../developer-guide/snowpark/python/python-snowpark-training-ml.md).

## Billing for Snowpark-optimized warehouses

For information on Snowpark-optimized warehouse credit consumption, see
`Table 1` in the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

> **Tip:**
>
> For information about cost implications of changing the RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT property, see
> [considerations for changing RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT while a warehouse is running or suspended](warehouses-gen2.md).

## Region availability

Snowpark-optimized warehouses are available in all regions across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

1 TB memory options are not currently available for the Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
[cloud platforms](intro-cloud-platforms.md). On the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform,
the 1 TB memory option is also still a preview feature.
