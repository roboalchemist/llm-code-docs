# ALTER ICEBERG TABLE … CONVERT TO MANAGED

Converts an [Apache Iceberg™ table](../../user-guide/tables-iceberg.md) that uses
an external Iceberg catalog into a table that uses Snowflake as the catalog (a Snowflake-managed Iceberg table).

The converted table supports both read and write operations,
and Snowflake handles all life-cycle maintenance, such as compaction, for the table.
For more information, see [Before and after table conversion](../../user-guide/tables-iceberg-conversion.md).

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
ALTER ICEBERG TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] <table_name> CONVERT TO MANAGED
  [ BASE_LOCATION = '<directory_for_table_files>' ]
  [ STORAGE_SERIALIZATION_POLICY = { COMPATIBLE | OPTIMIZED } ]
```

## Parameters

`table_name`
:   Identifier for the table to convert.

    If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed in double quotes.
    Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.

    For more information, see [Identifier requirements](../identifiers-syntax.md).

`[ BASE_LOCATION = 'directory_for_table_files' ]`
:   The path to a directory where Snowflake can write data and metadata files for the table.
    Specify a relative path from the table’s `EXTERNAL_VOLUME` location.
    For more information, see [Data and metadata directories](../../user-guide/tables-iceberg-storage.md).

    You must specify a value for this property if the original CREATE ICEBERG TABLE statement did not allow or include a
    `BASE_LOCATION`.

    This directory can’t be changed after you convert a table.

`STORAGE_SERIALIZATION_POLICY = { COMPATIBLE | OPTIMIZED }`
:   Specifies the storage serialization policy for the table.
    If not specified during conversion, the table inherits the value set at the schema, database, or account level. If the value isn’t
    specified at any level, the table uses the default value.

    You can’t change the value of this parameter after you convert a table.

    * `COMPATIBLE`: Snowflake performs encoding and compression that ensures interoperability with third-party compute engines.
    * `OPTIMIZED`: Snowflake performs encoding and compression that ensures the best table performance within Snowflake.

    Default: `OPTIMIZED`

## Access control requirements

A [role](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md) used to execute this operation must have the following
[privileges](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md) at a minimum:

| Privilege | Object | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OWNERSHIP | Iceberg table | OWNERSHIP is a special privilege on an object that is automatically granted to the role that created the object, but can also be transferred using the [GRANT OWNERSHIP](grant-ownership.md) command to a different role by the owning role (or any role with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege). |
| USAGE | External volume |  |
| USAGE | Catalog integration |  |

Operating on an object in a schema requires at least one privilege on the parent database and at least one privilege on the parent schema.

For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see [Creating custom roles](../../user-guide/security-access-control-configure.md).

For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on
[securable objects](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md), see [Overview of Access Control](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md).

## Usage notes

* Only the table owner (that is, the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table) or higher can execute this command.
* Converting a table in a catalog-linked database isn’t supported.
* Regarding metadata:

  > **Attention:**
  >
  > Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see [Metadata fields in Snowflake](../metadata.md).

## Examples

The following example uses the ALTER ICEBERG TABLE … CONVERT TO MANAGED statement to
convert a table that Snowflake doesn’t manage into a table that uses Snowflake as the Iceberg catalog.

```sqlexample
ALTER ICEBERG TABLE myTable CONVERT TO MANAGED
  BASE_LOCATION = 'my/relative/path/from/external_volume';
```
