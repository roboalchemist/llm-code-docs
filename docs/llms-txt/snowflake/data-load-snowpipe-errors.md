# Snowpipe error notifications

Snowpipe can push error notifications to a cloud messaging service when it encounters errors while loading data. The notifications describe the errors encountered in each file, enabling further analysis of the data in the files.

> **Note:**
>
> Snowpipe error notifications only work when the ON_ERROR copy option is set to SKIP_FILE (the default). Snowpipe will not send any error notifications if the ON_ERROR copy option is set to CONTINUE.
>
> You can use the NOTIFICATION_HISTORY table function to query the history of notifications sent through Snowpipe. For more information, refer to [NOTIFICATION_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/notification_history.md).

Currently, cross-cloud support is not available for push notifications. Configure error notification support for the messaging service provided by the cloud platform where your Snowflake account is hosted.
