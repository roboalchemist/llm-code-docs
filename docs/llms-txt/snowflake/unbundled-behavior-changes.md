# Unbundled behavior changes

Unbundled behavior changes are not associated or released with a behavior change bundle.

To help you manage your operations and minimize disruption to your Snowflake service, we document behavior changes that may impact your usage,
including:

* Recently implemented changes that were previously pending/disabled, were not part of a behavior change bundle, and cannot be disabled.
* Upcoming pending changes that will not be part of a behavior change bundle and cannot be enabled in advance.
* [Canceled behavior changes](unbundled-cancelled-behavior-changes.md) that have been removed from BCR bundles and will not be implemented.

If you have questions about any of these behavior changes, please feel free to contact [Snowflake Support](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/contacting-support).

## Recently implemented changes

This table lists behavior changes that were implemented independently of a behavior change bundle.
These changes include certain types of changes to Snowflake clients (connectors, drivers, etc.), platforms, and libraries. Such changes cannot be disabled.

See also Upcoming pending changes.
