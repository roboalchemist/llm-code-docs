# Using SQL commands to create and manage semantic views

This topic explains how to use the following SQL commands to create and manage [semantic views](overview.md):

* [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md)
* [ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-semantic-view.md)
* [DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/desc-semantic-view.md)
* [DROP SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/drop-semantic-view.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-views.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-dimensions.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS FOR METRIC](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-dimensions-for-metric.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-facts.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-metrics.md)

This topic also explains how to call the following stored procedure and function to create a semantic view from a
[YAML specification](semantic-view-yaml-spec.md) and get the specification for a semantic view:

* [SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML](../../sql-reference/stored-procedures/system_create_semantic_view_from_yaml.md)
* [SYSTEM$READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW](../../sql-reference/functions/system_read_yaml_from_semantic_view.md)

## Privileges required to create or replace a semantic view

To create or replace a semantic view, you must use a role with the following privileges:

* CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW on the schema where you are creating the semantic view.
* USAGE on the database and schema where you are creating the semantic view.
* SELECT on the tables and views used in the semantic view.

For information about the privileges required to query a semantic view, see [Privileges required to query a semantic view](querying.md).

## Creating a semantic view

To create a semantic view, you can either:

* Run the [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command.
* Call the [SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML](../../sql-reference/stored-procedures/system_create_semantic_view_from_yaml.md) stored procedure, if you want to create a semantic view from a [YAML specification](semantic-view-yaml-spec.md).

The semantic view must be valid. See [How Snowflake validates semantic views](validation-rules.md).

The next sections explain how to create a semantic view:

### Using the CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW command

The following example uses the [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command to create a semantic view.

The example uses the [TPC-H sample data](../sample-data-tpch.md) available in Snowflake. This data set contains
tables that represent a simplified business scenario with customers, orders, and line items.

The example creates a semantic view named `tpch_rev_analysis`, using the tables in the TPC-H data set. The semantic view
defines:

* Three logical tables (`orders`, `customers`, and `line_items`).
* A relationship between the `orders` and `customers` tables.
* A relationship between the `line_items` and `orders` tables.
* Facts that will be used to calculate metrics.
* Dimensions for the customer name, the order date, and the year in which the order was placed.
* Metrics for the average value of an order and the average number of line items in an order.

```sqlexample
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW tpch_rev_analysis

  TABLES (
    orders AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
      PRIMARY KEY (o_orderkey)
      WITH SYNONYMS ('sales orders')
      COMMENT = 'All orders table for the sales domain',
    customers AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
      PRIMARY KEY (c_custkey)
      COMMENT = 'Main table for customer data',
    line_items AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
      PRIMARY KEY (l_orderkey, l_linenumber)
      COMMENT = 'Line items in orders'
  )

  RELATIONSHIPS (
    orders_to_customers AS
      orders (o_custkey) REFERENCES customers,
    line_item_to_orders AS
      line_items (l_orderkey) REFERENCES orders
  )

  FACTS (
    line_items.line_item_id AS CONCAT(l_orderkey, '-', l_linenumber),
    orders.count_line_items AS COUNT(line_items.line_item_id),
    line_items.discounted_price AS l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
      COMMENT = 'Extended price after discount'
  )

  DIMENSIONS (
    customers.customer_name AS customers.c_name
      WITH SYNONYMS = ('customer name')
      COMMENT = 'Name of the customer',
    orders.order_date AS o_orderdate
      COMMENT = 'Date when the order was placed',
    orders.order_year AS YEAR(o_orderdate)
      COMMENT = 'Year when the order was placed'
  )

  METRICS (
    customers.customer_count AS COUNT(c_custkey)
      COMMENT = 'Count of number of customers',
    orders.order_average_value AS AVG(orders.o_totalprice)
      COMMENT = 'Average order value across all orders',
    orders.average_line_items_per_order AS AVG(orders.count_line_items)
      COMMENT = 'Average number of line items per order'
  )

  COMMENT = 'Semantic view for revenue analysis';
```

The next sections explain this example in more detail:

> For a full example, see [Example of using SQL to create a semantic view](example.md).

#### Defining the logical tables

In the [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command, use the TABLES clause to define the logical tables in the view.
In this clause, you can:

* Specify the physical table name and an optional alias.
* Identify the following columns in the logical table:

  * Columns that serve as primary keys.
  * Columns that contain unique values (other than the primary key columns).

  You can use these columns to define relationships in this semantic view.
* Add synonyms for the table (for enhanced discoverability).
* Include a descriptive comment.

> **Note:**
>
> If there are multiple ways in which two tables can be joined, you should define a separate logical table for each of these ways.
> For information, see Defining different logical tables for different paths that join two tables.

In the example presented earlier, the TABLES clause defines three logical tables:

* An `orders` table containing the order information from the TPC-H `orders` table.
* A `customers` table containing the customer information from the TPC-H `customers` table.
* A `line_items` table containing the line items in orders from the TPC-H `lineitem` table.

The example uses the PRIMARY KEY clause to identify the columns to be used as primary keys for each logical table. Primary keys
and unique values help determine the types of relationships between the tables
(for example, many-to-one or one-to-one).

The example also provides synonyms and comments that describe the logical tables and make the data easier to discover.

```sqlexample
TABLES (
  orders AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
    PRIMARY KEY (o_orderkey)
    WITH SYNONYMS ('sales orders')
    COMMENT = 'All orders table for the sales domain',
  customers AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
    PRIMARY KEY (c_custkey)
    COMMENT = 'Main table for customer data',
  line_items AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
    PRIMARY KEY (l_orderkey, l_linenumber)
    COMMENT = 'Line items in orders'
)
```

#### Defining different logical tables for different paths that join two tables

If there are multiple paths that you can use to join two physical tables, you should define separate logical tables and
relationships for each path.

For example, in the [TPC-H sample data](../sample-data-tpch.md) available in Snowflake, there are two possible ways to
join the `region` and `lineitem` tables:

* `region` -> `nation` -> `supplier` -> `partsupp` -> `lineitem`
* `region` -> `nation` -> `customer` -> `orders` -> `lineitem`

The first path represents the region of the supplier, and the second path represents the region of the customer.

Although you can use a single logical table for `region` and a single logical table for `nation`, you should define separate
logical tables for the region of the supplier, the region of the customer, the nation of the supplier, and the nation of the
customer:

```sqlexample
TABLES (
  supplier_region AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.REGION PRIMARY KEY (r_regionkey).
  customer_region AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.REGION PRIMARY KEY (r_regionkey),
  supplier_nation AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION PRIMARY KEY (n_nationkey),
  customer_nation AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NATION PRIMARY KEY (n_nationkey),
  ...
)
```

Then, define separate relationships that represent the different paths:

```sqlexample
RELATIONSHIPS (
  supplier_nation (n_regionkey) REFERENCES supplier_region,
  customer_nation (n_regionkey) REFERENCES customer_region,
  ...
)
```

#### Identifying the relationships between logical tables

In the [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command, use the RELATIONSHIPS clause to identify the relationships between the tables in the
view. For each relationship, you specify:

* An optional name for the relationship.
* The name of the logical table containing the foreign key.
* The columns in that table that define the foreign key.
* The name of the logical table containing the primary key or columns with unique values.
* The columns in that table that define the primary key or that contain unique values.

  * If you already specified PRIMARY KEY for the logical table in the TABLES clause, you don’t need to specify the primary key
    column in the relationship.
  * If there is a single UNIQUE keyword for the logical table in the TABLES clause, you don’t need to specify the corresponding
    columns in the relationship.

  You can also specify a date, time, timestamp, or numeric column, if you want to
  join the columns on a range.

In the example presented earlier, the RELATIONSHIPS clause specifies two
relationships:

* A relationship between the `orders` and `customers` tables. In the `orders` table, `o_custkey` is the foreign key that
  refers to the primary key in the `customers` table (`c_custkey`).
* A relationship between the `line_items` and `orders` tables. In the `line_items` table, `l_orderkey` is the foreign key
  that refers to the primary key in the `orders` table (`o_orderkey`).

```sqlexample
RELATIONSHIPS (
  orders_to_customers AS
    orders (o_custkey) REFERENCES customers (c_custkey),
  line_item_to_orders AS
    line_items (l_orderkey) REFERENCES orders (o_orderkey)
)
```

#### Using a date, time, timestamp, or numeric range to join logical tables

By default, when you specify a relationship between two logical tables, the tables are joined on an equality condition.

If you need to join two logical tables on a date, time, timestamp, or numeric range (where the values in a column of one table
need to be in the same range as the values in a column of another table), you can specify the ASOF keyword with the column name
in the REFERENCES clause:

```sqlexample
RELATIONSHIPS(
  my_relationship AS
    logical_table_1(
      col_table_1
    )
    REFERENCES
    logical_table_2(
      ASOF col_table_2
    )
)
```

A query of the semantic view defined above produces an [ASOF JOIN](../../sql-reference/constructs/asof-join.md) that uses the
`>=` comparison operator in the MATCH_CONDITION clause. This joins the two tables so that the values in `col_table_1` are
greater than or equal to the values in `col_table_2`:

```sqlexample
...
FROM logical_table_1 ASOF JOIN logical_table_2
  MATCH_CONDITION(
    logical_table_1.col_table_1 >= logical_table_2.col_table_2
  )
...
```

> **Note:**
>
> No other comparison operator in MATCH_CONDITION clause is supported.

You can use the ASOF keyword for columns of
[the same types that you can use with ASOF JOIN](../../sql-reference/constructs/asof-join.md).

> **Note:**
>
> You can specify at most one ASOF keyword in the definition of a given relationship. You can specify this keyword before any
> column in the list.

For example, suppose that you have tables containing customer, customer address, and order data:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customer(
  c_cust_id VARCHAR,
  c_first_name VARCHAR,
  c_last_name VARCHAR);

INSERT INTO customer VALUES
  ('cust001', 'Mary', 'Smith'),
  ('cust002', 'Bill', 'Wilson');

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customer_address(
  ca_cust_id VARCHAR,
  ca_zipcode VARCHAR,
  ca_street_addr VARCHAR,
  ca_start_date DATE,
  ca_end_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO customer_address VALUES
  ('cust001', '94025', '100 Main Street', '2024-01-01', '2024-03-31'),
  ('cust001', '94026', '200 Main Street', '2024-04-01', '2024-06-30'),
  ('cust001', '94027', '300 Main Street', '2024-07-01', NULL),
  ('cust002', '94028', '400 Main Street', '2024-01-01', '2024-04-30'),
  ('cust002', '94029', '500 Main Street', '2024-05-01', '2024-07-31'),
  ('cust002', '94030', '600 Main Street', '2024-08-01', NULL);

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders(
  o_ord_id VARCHAR,
  o_cust_id VARCHAR,
  o_ord_date DATE,
  o_amount NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO orders VALUES
  ('ord100', 'cust001', '2024-02-01', 100),
  ('ord101', 'cust001', '2024-02-02', 200),
  ('ord102', 'cust001', '2024-05-01', 300),
  ('ord103', 'cust001', '2024-05-02', 400),
  ('ord104', 'cust001', '2024-08-01', 500),
  ('ord105', 'cust001', '2024-08-02', 600),
  ('ord106', 'cust002', '2024-03-01', 100),
  ('ord107', 'cust002', '2024-03-02', 200),
  ('ord108', 'cust002', '2024-06-01', 300),
  ('ord109', 'cust002', '2024-06-02', 400),
  ('ord110', 'cust002', '2024-09-01', 500),
  ('ord111', 'cust002', '2024-09-02', 600);
```

In this example, the `customer_address` table has a `ca_start_date` column, which indicates when the customer started residing
at the specified address. The `orders` table has a `o_ord_date` column, which is the date of the order.

Suppose that you want to be able to query information about customer orders and retrieve the zip codes corresponding to where the
customer resided when the orders were placed.

You can define a semantic view that specifies an ASOF join between the `ca_start_date` and `o_ord_date` columns:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW customer_orders_view
  TABLES (
    customer_address UNIQUE (ca_cust_id, ca_start_date),
    customer UNIQUE (c_cust_id),
    orders UNIQUE (o_ord_id)
  )
  RELATIONSHIPS (
    customer_address(ca_cust_id) REFERENCES customer,
    -- Defines an ASOF JOIN on the date columns.
    orders(o_cust_id, o_ord_date)
      REFERENCES
        customer_address(ca_cust_id, ASOF ca_start_date)
  )
  FACTS (
    customer_address.f_zipcode AS ca_zipcode
  )
  DIMENSIONS (
    -- Relies on the ASOF join to retrieve the zip code
    -- where the order date is greater than or equal to
    -- the address starting date.
    orders.f_cust_zipcode AS customer_address.f_zipcode,
    orders.dim_year_month AS DATE_TRUNC('month', o_ord_date)
  )
  METRICS (
    orders.m_order_amount AS SUM(o_amount)
  );
```

Suppose that you [query this semantic view](querying.md) to return the sum of the order amounts per month for each zip code:

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
  customer_orders_view
  DIMENSIONS orders.dim_year_month, orders.f_cust_zipcode
  METRICS orders.m_order_amount
);
```

```output
+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| DIM_YEAR_MONTH | F_CUST_ZIPCODE | M_ORDER_AMOUNT |
|----------------+----------------+----------------|
| 2024-02-01     | 94025          |            300 |
| 2024-05-01     | 94026          |            700 |
| 2024-08-01     | 94027          |           1100 |
| 2024-03-01     | 94028          |            300 |
| 2024-09-01     | 94030          |           1100 |
| 2024-06-01     | 94029          |            700 |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+
```

The query effectively uses an ASOF JOIN to join the tables on the date columns, where the order date is greater than or equal to
the address starting date:

```sqlexample
...
FROM orders ASOF JOIN customer_address
  MATCH_CONDITION(
    orders.o_ord_date >= customer_address.ca_start_date
  )
  ON
    orders.o_cust_id = customer_address.ca_cust_id
...
```

#### Joining logical tables that contain ranges of values

You can use a *range join* when you want to join a table with another table that defines a range of possible values in the
first table. For example, suppose that one table represents sales orders and has a column with the timestamp when the order
was placed. Suppose that another table represents fiscal quarters and contains the distinct ranges of time that represent
these quarters. You can create a semantic view that joins the two tables so that the row for an order includes the fiscal
quarter in which the order was placed.

In the table that contains the ranges, each range must be distinct. No two ranges can overlap.

In the table data, if you want to specify the lowest possible value for the range or the highest possible value for the range,
use NULL.

For example, the following table defines a set of ranges of times that do not overlap:

* The first row covers the range that includes everything up to (but not including) January 1, 2024.
* The last row covers the range that includes everything from March 20, 2024, onwards.

```output
+----------------+------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| TIME_PERIOD_ID | TIME_PERIOD_NAME | START_TIME              | END_TIME                |
|----------------+------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------|
|              1 | Before_January   | NULL                    | 2024-01-01 00:00:00.000 |
|              2 | Early_January    | 2024-01-01 00:00:00.000 | 2024-01-15 00:00:00.000 |
|              3 | Late_January     | 2024-01-15 00:00:00.000 | 2024-02-01 00:00:00.000 |
|              4 | Early_February   | 2024-02-01 00:00:00.000 | 2024-02-15 00:00:00.000 |
|              5 | Late_February    | 2024-02-15 00:00:00.000 | 2024-03-01 00:00:00.000 |
|              6 | Early_March      | 2024-03-01 00:00:00.000 | 2024-03-20 00:00:00.000 |
|              7 | After_March20    | 2024-03-20 00:00:00.000 | NULL                    |
+----------------+------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
```

> **Note:**
>
> No two rows can contain NULL in the start column, and no two rows can contain NULL in the end column.

For cases like these, you can set up a [semantic view](overview.md) that supports range-join
queries. When you create the semantic view, you must do the following:

1. For the logical table containing the start and end times of a time period,
   define a constraint that specifies that no two ranges can overlap.

   In the TABLE clause of the [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command, specify the CONSTRAINT clause in the logical
   table definition. For the syntax, see the
   [documentation for CONSTRAINT in the CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW topic](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md).
2. Define a relationship between the column containing the timestamp in one table
   and the start and end time columns in the other table.

   In the RELATIONSHIPS clause of the CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW command, use the BETWEEN clause to specify the columns containing the
   start and end times. For the syntax, see the
   [documentation for RELATIONSHIP in the CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW topic](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md).

For example, suppose that the `my_time_periods` table defines distinct periods of time:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE my_time_periods (
  time_period_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  time_period_name VARCHAR(50),
  start_time TIMESTAMP,
  end_time TIMESTAMP
);
```

```sqlexample
INSERT INTO my_time_periods (
    time_period_id, time_period_name, start_time, end_time
  ) VALUES
    (1, 'Before_January', NULL, '2024-01-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
    (2, 'Early_January', '2024-01-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP, '2024-01-15 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
    (3, 'Late_January', '2024-01-15 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP, '2024-02-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
    (4, 'Early_February', '2024-02-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP, '2024-02-15 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
    (5, 'Late_February', '2024-02-15 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP, '2024-03-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
    (6, 'Early_March', '2024-03-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP, '2024-03-20 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
    (7, 'After_March20', '2024-03-20 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP, NULL);
```

Suppose that the `my_events` table captures events that occurred within those periods of time:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE my_events (
  event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  event_name VARCHAR
);
```

```sqlexample
INSERT INTO my_events (event_id, event_name, event_timestamp) VALUES
  (1, 'Login', '2024-01-15 10:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
  (2, 'Purchase', '2024-01-15 14:30:00'::TIMESTAMP),
  (3, 'Logout', '2024-01-15 18:45:00'::TIMESTAMP),
  (4, 'Review', '2024-02-10 12:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
  (5, 'Support', '2024-02-20 09:30:00'::TIMESTAMP),
  (6, 'Upgrade', '2024-03-05 16:00:00'::TIMESTAMP),
  (7, 'Feedback', '2024-03-25 11:00:00'::TIMESTAMP);
```

You can define a semantic view that joins the tables. Rows in `my_events` are joined with rows in `my_time_periods`,
where the value in the `event_timestamp` column in `my_events` is within the range specified by the `start_time` and
`end_time` columns in `my_time_periods`.

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW my_semantic_view_range_join
  TABLES (
    my_events PRIMARY KEY (event_id),
    my_time_periods UNIQUE (start_time, end_time)
      CONSTRAINT my_time_period_range DISTINCT RANGE BETWEEN start_time AND end_time EXCLUSIVE
  )
  RELATIONSHIPS (
    my_time_periods_for_events AS
      my_events(event_timestamp) REFERENCES
        my_time_periods(BETWEEN start_time AND end_time EXCLUSIVE)
  )
  DIMENSIONS (
    my_events.dim_event_name AS event_name,
    my_events.dim_event_timestamp AS event_timestamp,
    my_time_periods.dim_time_period_name AS time_period_name
  )
  METRICS (
    my_events.m_event_count AS COUNT(*)
  );
```

The following query demonstrates how the rows are joined:

```sqlexample
SELECT
    sv.dim_event_name,
    sv.dim_event_timestamp,
    sv.dim_time_period_name,
    sv.m_event_count
  FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    my_semantic_view_range_join
    METRICS my_events.m_event_count
    DIMENSIONS
      my_events.dim_event_name,
      my_events.dim_event_timestamp,
      my_time_periods.dim_time_period_name
  ) AS sv
  ORDER BY
    sv.dim_event_timestamp,
    sv.dim_time_period_name;
```

```output
+----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+---------------+
| DIM_EVENT_NAME | DIM_EVENT_TIMESTAMP     | DIM_TIME_PERIOD_NAME | M_EVENT_COUNT |

As shown in the examples, the `dim_time_period_name` dimension for each row in the results is the name of the time period that
the `dim_event_timestamp` dimension falls into.

#### Defining facts, dimensions, and metrics

In the [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command, use the FACTS, DIMENSIONS, and METRICS clauses to define the facts, dimensions,
and metrics in the semantic view.

You must define at least one dimension or metric in the semantic view.

For each fact, dimension, or metric, you specify:

* The logical table it belongs to.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > If you want to define a derived metric (a metric that is not specific to one logical table), you must omit the logical table
  > name. See Defining derived metrics.
* A name for the fact, dimension, or metric.
* The SQL expression to calculate it.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > For dimensions, you can specify a
  > [Cortex Search Service](../snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview.md) to use for the dimension. For
  > information, see Defining a dimension that uses a Cortex Search Service.
* Optional synonyms and comments.

> **Note:**
>
> If a metric should not be aggregated across specific dimensions, you should specify that those dimensions should be
> *non-additive*.
>
> For information, see Identifying the dimensions that should be non-additive for a metric.

The example presented earlier defines several facts, dimensions, and metrics:

```sqlexample
FACTS (
  line_items.line_item_id AS CONCAT(l_orderkey, '-', l_linenumber),
  orders.count_line_items AS COUNT(line_items.line_item_id),
  line_items.discounted_price AS l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
    COMMENT = 'Extended price after discount'
)

DIMENSIONS (
  customers.customer_name AS customers.c_name
    WITH SYNONYMS = ('customer name')
    COMMENT = 'Name of the customer',
  orders.order_date AS o_orderdate
    COMMENT = 'Date when the order was placed',
  orders.order_year AS YEAR(o_orderdate)
    COMMENT = 'Year when the order was placed'
)

METRICS (
  customers.customer_count AS COUNT(c_custkey)
    COMMENT = 'Count of number of customers',
  orders.order_average_value AS AVG(orders.o_totalprice)
    COMMENT = 'Average order value across all orders',
  orders.average_line_items_per_order AS AVG(orders.count_line_items)
    COMMENT = 'Average number of line items per order'
)
```

> **Note:**
>
> For additional guidelines on defining metrics that use window functions, see [Defining and querying window function metrics](querying.md).

#### Defining a dimension that uses a Cortex Search Service

To define a dimension that uses a
[Cortex Search Service](../snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview.md), set the
WITH CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE clause to the name of the Cortex Search Service. If the service is in a different database or schema,
[qualify the name of the service](../../sql-reference/name-resolution.md). For example:

```sqlexample
DIMENSIONS (
  my_table.my_dimension AS my_dimension_expression
    WITH CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE my_db.my_schema.my_dimension_search_service
)
```

#### Defining derived metrics

When you define a metric, you specify the name of the logical table that the metric belongs to. This is the logical table on which
the metric is aggregated.

If you want to define a metric based on metrics from different logical tables, you can define a *derived metric*. A derived metric
is a metric that is scoped to the semantic view (rather than to a specific logical table). A derived metric can combine metrics
from multiple logical tables.

In the definition of a derived metric, omit the logical table name.

For example, suppose that you want to define a metric `my_derived_metric_1` that is the sum of the metrics `table_1.metric_1`
and `table_2.metric_2`. When you define `my_derived_metric_1`, don’t qualify the name with any logical table name:

```sqlexample
CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW sv_with_derived_metrics
  TABLES (
    table_1 PRIMARY KEY (column_1),
    table_2 PRIMARY KEY (column_2)
  )
  ...
  METRICS (
    table_1.metric_1 AS SUM(...),
    table_2.metric_2 AS SUM(...),
    my_derived_metric_1 AS table_1.metric_1 + table_2.metric_2
  )
 ...
```

You can use other derived metrics in the expression. For example:

```sqlexample
METRICS (
  ...
  my_derived_metric_1 AS table_1.metric_1 + table_2.metric_2,
  my_view_metric_2 AS my_derived_metric_1 + table_3.metric_3
)
```

Note the following restrictions when you define a derived metric:

* You cannot use the same name for a derived metric and a regular metric.
* The expression for a derived metric can use:

  * Aggregations of dimensions and facts defined in any logical table in the semantic view.
  * Scalar expressions of metrics defined in any logical table in the semantic view.
  * Other derived metrics.

  In the following example:

  * `derived_metric_1` uses a scalar expression with two metrics.
  * `derived_metric_2` uses an aggregation of a dimension.
  * `derived_metric_3` adds an aggregation of a dimension to another derived metric.

  ```sqlexample
  CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW sv_derived_metrics
    TABLES (t1)
    DIMENSIONS (t1.dim1 AS t1.col1)
    METRICS (
      t1.m1 AS SUM(t1.col1),
      t2.m2 AS SUM(t1.col2),
      derived_metric_1 AS t1.m1 + t2.m2,
      derived_metric_2 AS SUM(t1.dim1),
      derived_metric_3 AS SUM(t1.dim1) + derived_metric_2
    )
    ...
  ```

* You don’t need to qualify the name of a metric, dimension, or fact in the expression if the name is not ambiguous. For example:

  ```sqlexample
  METRICS (
    table_1.metric_1 AS ...,
    table_1.my_unique_metric_name AS ...,
    table_2.metric_1 AS ...,
    my_derived_metric_1 AS table_1.metric_1 + my_unique_metric_name
  )
  ```

  Note that `metric_1` needs to be qualified by `table_1` because there are two metrics named `metric_1`, but
  `my_unique_metric_name` does not need to be qualified because the name is unique.
* In the expression for a derived metric, you cannot use the following:

  * Aggregations of metrics.
  * Window functions.
  * References to physical columns.
  * References to facts or dimensions that are not aggregated.
* You cannot use a derived metric in the expression for a regular metric, dimension, or fact. Only another derived metric
  can use a derived metric in its expression.

#### Identifying the dimensions that should be non-additive for a metric

In some cases, a metric should not be aggregated across specific dimensions. In these cases, you can mark the dimensions as
*non-additive*.

##### Understanding the problem with aggregating metrics across some dimensions

Suppose you have a table that contains the account balances of each customer’s checking and savings accounts on a specific day.

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE bank_accounts (
  customer_id VARCHAR,
  account_type VARCHAR,
  year NUMBER,
  month NUMBER,
  day NUMBER,
  balance NUMBER
);
```

```sqlexample
INSERT INTO bank_accounts VALUES
  ('cust-001', 'checking', 2024, 01, 01, 100),
  ('cust-001', 'savings', 2024, 01, 01, 110),
  ('cust-001', 'checking', 2024, 02, 10, 140),
  ('cust-001', 'savings', 2024, 02, 10, 150),
  ('cust-001', 'checking', 2024, 03, 15, 200),
  ('cust-001', 'savings', 2024, 03, 30, 210),
  ('cust-001', 'checking', 2025, 02, 15, 280),
  ('cust-001', 'savings', 2025, 02, 15, 290),
  ('cust-001', 'checking', 2025, 03, 20, 300),
  ('cust-001', 'savings', 2025, 03, 20, 310),
  ('cust-002', 'checking', 2025, 03, 30, 200),
  ('cust-002', 'savings', 2025, 03, 30, 310);
```

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM bank_accounts;
```

```output
+-------------+--------------+------+-------+-----+---------+
| CUSTOMER_ID | ACCOUNT_TYPE | YEAR | MONTH | DAY | BALANCE |
|-------------+--------------+------+-------+-----+---------|
| cust-001    | checking     | 2024 |     1 |   1 |     100 |
| cust-001    | savings      | 2024 |     1 |   1 |     110 |
| cust-001    | checking     | 2024 |     2 |  10 |     140 |
| cust-001    | savings      | 2024 |     2 |  10 |     150 |
| cust-001    | checking     | 2024 |     3 |  15 |     200 |
| cust-001    | savings      | 2024 |     3 |  30 |     210 |
| cust-001    | checking     | 2025 |     2 |  15 |     280 |
| cust-001    | savings      | 2025 |     2 |  15 |     290 |
| cust-001    | checking     | 2025 |     3 |  20 |     300 |
| cust-001    | savings      | 2025 |     3 |  20 |     310 |
| cust-002    | checking     | 2025 |     3 |  30 |     200 |
| cust-002    | savings      | 2025 |     3 |  30 |     310 |
+-------------+--------------+------+-------+-----+---------+
```

Suppose that you want to define a semantic view that includes:

* The following dimensions:

  * Customer ID
  * Account type
  * Year
  * Month
  * Day
* A metric for the sum of the balance.

The following statement creates a semantic view that includes the dimensions and metrics listed above:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW bank_accounts_sv
  TABLES (
    bank_accounts
  )
  DIMENSIONS (
    bank_accounts.customer_id_dim AS bank_accounts.customer_id,
    bank_accounts.account_type_dim AS bank_accounts.account_type,
    bank_accounts.year_dim AS bank_accounts.year,
    bank_accounts.month_dim AS bank_accounts.month,
    bank_accounts.day_dim AS bank_accounts.day
  )
  METRICS (
    bank_accounts.m_account_balance AS SUM(balance)
  );
```

If you want to retrieve the total balance of the checking and savings accounts for each customer at the end of each year, you can
query the semantic view for the `m_account_balance` metric and specify the `customer_id_dim` and `year_dim` dimensions.

However, the `m_account_balance` metric will be the sum of the balances of each day for each customer because the metric is
aggregated by the date dimensions.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    bank_accounts_sv
    METRICS bank_accounts.m_account_balance
    DIMENSIONS customer_id_dim, year_dim
  )
  ORDER BY customer_id_dim, year_dim;
```

```output
+-------------------+-----------------+----------+
| M_ACCOUNT_BALANCE | CUSTOMER_ID_DIM | YEAR_DIM |
|-------------------+-----------------+----------|
|               910 | cust-001        |     2024 |
|              1180 | cust-001        |     2025 |
|               510 | cust-002        |     2025 |
+-------------------+-----------------+----------+
```

In the example above, for `cust-001` in 2024, `910` is the sum of the balances for each day
(`100 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 200 + 210`).

##### Preventing a metric from being aggregated across specific dimensions

To prevent the metric from being aggregated by the date dimensions, specify the date dimensions in the NON ADDITIVE BY clause
when creating the semantic view:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW bank_accounts_sv
  TABLES (
    bank_accounts
  )
  DIMENSIONS (
    bank_accounts.customer_id_dim AS bank_accounts.customer_id,
    bank_accounts.account_type_dim AS bank_accounts.account_type,
    bank_accounts.year_dim AS bank_accounts.year,
    bank_accounts.month_dim AS bank_accounts.month,
    bank_accounts.day_dim AS bank_accounts.day
  )
  METRICS (
    bank_accounts.m_account_balance
      NON ADDITIVE BY (year_dim, month_dim, day_dim)
      AS SUM(balance)
  );
```

> **Note:**
>
> * If you specify the NON ADDITIVE BY clause in a metric, you cannot refer to that metric in the definitions of metrics that are
>   not derived. Only derived metrics can refer to metrics that specify non-additive dimensions.

Specifying the NON ADDITIVE BY clause makes the metric a *semi-additive* metric.

When you query this semantic view, the `m_account_balance` metric is no longer aggregated by the date dimensions. The query
aggregates the account balances at the end of the period in each group of queried dimensions.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    bank_accounts_sv
    METRICS bank_accounts.m_account_balance
    DIMENSIONS customer_id_dim, year_dim
  )
  ORDER BY customer_id_dim, year_dim;
```

```output
+-------------------+-----------------+----------+
| M_ACCOUNT_BALANCE | CUSTOMER_ID_DIM | YEAR_DIM |
|-------------------+-----------------+----------|
|               210 | cust-001        |     2024 |
|               610 | cust-001        |     2025 |
|               510 | cust-002        |     2025 |
+-------------------+-----------------+----------+
```

In the example above, for `cust-001` in 2024, `210` is the sum of the checking and savings account balances for the last day
of the year that contains data:

* The last day of 2024 that contains data is `2024-03-30`.
* There is no row with that date for the checking account, so the resulting metric is the balance of the savings account
  (`210`).

As another example, if you just want the total account balance for all customers at the end of the year, you can specify the
`year_dim` dimension.

Because the date dimensions are marked as non-additive, the query sums the values at the end of the period (by date) for the
checking and savings account balances for each customer.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
    bank_accounts_sv
    METRICS bank_accounts.m_account_balance
    DIMENSIONS year_dim
  )
  ORDER BY year_dim;
```

```output
+-------------------+----------+
| M_ACCOUNT_BALANCE | YEAR_DIM |
|-------------------+----------|
|               210 |     2024 |
|               510 |     2025 |
+-------------------+----------+
```

During query processing, the rows are sorted by the non-additive dimensions, and the values from the last rows (the
*latest snapshots of values*) are aggregated to compute the metric.

> **Note:**
>
> Because the rows are sorted by the non-additive dimensions, the order in which you specify the dimensions is important. This
> is similar to the order in which you specify columns in the [ORDER BY](../../sql-reference/constructs/order-by.md) clause.

##### Specifying the sort order for non-additive dimensions

As demonstrated in the example, the metric aggregates the values of the checking and savings balances for each customer at the
end of a period. If you want to change the sort order, you can specify the ASC or DESC keyword next to the dimension name. For
example:

```sqlexample
METRICS (
  bank_accounts.m_account_balance
    NON ADDITIVE BY (year_dim DESC, month_dim DESC, day_dim DESC)
    AS SUM(balance)
);
```

In this example, the metric evaluates to the earliest date specified by `year_dim`, `month_dim`, and `day_dim`.

If the dimension includes NULL values, you can use the NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST keywords to specify whether NULL values are
sorted first or last in the results:

```sqlexample
METRICS (
  bank_accounts.m_account_balance
    NON ADDITIVE BY (
      year_dim DESC NULLS FIRST,
      month_dim DESC NULLS FIRST,
      day_dim DESC NULLS FIRST
    )
    AS SUM(balance)
```

#### Marking a fact or metric as private

If you are defining a fact or metric only for use in calculations in the semantic view and you don’t want the fact or metric to
be returned in a query, you can specify the PRIVATE keyword to mark the fact or metric as private. For example:

```sqlexample
FACTS (
  PRIVATE my_private_fact AS ...
)

METRICS (
  PRIVATE my_private_metric AS ...
)
```

> **Note:**
>
> You cannot mark a dimension as private. Dimensions are always public.

When you query a semantic view that has private facts or metrics, you cannot specify a private fact or metric in the following
clauses:

* The SELECT list
* FACTS in the [SEMANTIC_VIEW](../../sql-reference/constructs/semantic_view.md) clause
* METRICS in the [SEMANTIC_VIEW](../../sql-reference/constructs/semantic_view.md) clause
* METRICS
* WHERE in the SELECT statement or the [SEMANTIC_VIEW](../../sql-reference/constructs/semantic_view.md) clause

Some commands and functions include private facts and metrics:

* Private facts and metrics do appear in the output of the [DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/desc-semantic-view.md) command. The rows for
  private facts and metrics have `PRIVATE` in the `access_modifier` column.
* Private facts and metrics are listed in the return value of a [GET_DDL](../../sql-reference/functions/get_ddl.md) function call, as noted
  in Getting the SQL statement for a semantic view.

Some commands and functions include private facts and metrics only under specific conditions:

* Private facts and metrics are listed in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA [SEMANTIC_FACTS](../../sql-reference/info-schema/semantic_facts.md) and
  [SEMANTIC_METRICS](../../sql-reference/info-schema/semantic_metrics.md) views only if you are using a role that has been
  granted the REFERENCES or OWNERSHIP privilege on the semantic view.

  Otherwise, these views list only the public facts and metrics.

Other commands and functions do not include private facts and metrics:

* Private facts do not appear in the output of the [SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-facts.md) command.
* Private metrics do not appear in the output of the [SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-metrics.md) command.

#### Providing custom instructions for Cortex Analyst

In a semantic view, you can provide
[instructions for Cortex Analyst](../snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst/custom-instructions.md) that explain how to:

* Generate the SQL statement
* Classify questions and prompt for additional information

To provide these custom instructions, use the following clauses:

* For instructions on how to generate the SQL statement, use the AI_SQL_GENERATION clause in the
  [CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md) command.

  For example, to tell Cortex Analyst to generate the SQL statement so that all numeric columns are rounded to two decimal
  points, specify the following:

  ```sqlexample
  CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW my_semantic_view
    ...
    -- Definitions of logical tables, relationships, dimensions, facts, and metrics
    ...
    AI_SQL_GENERATION 'Ensure that all numeric columns are rounded to 2 decimal points.'
    ...
    -- Additional clauses
  ```

* For instructions on how to classify questions, use the AI_QUESTION_CATEGORIZATION clause.

  For example, to tell Cortex Analyst to reject questions about users, specify the following:

  ```sqlexample
  CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW my_semantic_view
    ...
    -- Definitions of logical tables, relationships, dimensions, facts, and metrics
    ...
    AI_QUESTION_CATEGORIZATION 'Reject all questions asking about users. Ask users to contact their admin.'
    ...
    -- Additional clauses
  ```

  You can also provide instructions to ask for more details, if the question isn’t clear. For example:

  ```sqlexample
  AI_QUESTION_CATEGORIZATION 'If the question asks for users without providing a product_type, consider this question UNCLEAR and ask the user to specify product_type.'
  ```

### Creating a semantic view from a YAML specification

To create a semantic view from a [YAML specification](semantic-view-yaml-spec.md), you can call the
[SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML](../../sql-reference/stored-procedures/system_create_semantic_view_from_yaml.md) stored procedure.

First, pass TRUE as the third argument to verify that you can create the semantic view from the YAML specification.

The following example verifies that you can use a given semantic model specification in YAML to create a semantic view named
`tpch_analysis` in the database `my_db` and schema `my_schema`:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML(
  'my_db.my_schema',

```

If the specification is valid, the stored procedure returns the following message:

```output
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YAML file is valid for creating a semantic view. No object has been created yet. |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If the YAML syntax is invalid, the stored procedure throw an exception. For example, if a colon is missing:

```yaml
relationships
  - name: LINE_ITEM_TO_ORDERS
```

the stored procedure throws an exception, indicating that the YAML syntax is invalid:

```output
392400 (22023): Uncaught exception of type 'EXPRESSION_ERROR' on line 3 at position 23 :
  Invalid semantic model YAML: while scanning a simple key
   in 'reader', line 90, column 3:
        relationships
        ^
  could not find expected ':'
   in 'reader', line 91, column 11:
          - name: LINE_ITEM_TO_ORDERS
                ^
```

If the specification refers to a physical table that does not exist, the stored procedure throws an exception:

```yaml
base_table:
  database: SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA
  schema: TPCH_SF1
  table: NONEXISTENT
```

```output
002003 (42S02): Uncaught exception of type 'EXPRESSION_ERROR' on line 3 at position 23 :
  SQL compilation error:
  Table 'SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.NONEXISTENT' does not exist or not authorized.
```

Similarly, if the specification refers to a primary key column that does not exist, the stored procedure throws an exception:

```yaml
primary_key:
  columns:
    - NONEXISTENT
```

```output
000904 (42000): Uncaught exception of type 'EXPRESSION_ERROR' on line 3 at position 23 :
  SQL compilation error: error line 0 at position -1
  invalid identifier 'NONEXISTENT'
```

You can then call the stored procedure without passing in the third argument to create the semantic view.

The following example creates a semantic view named `tpch_analysis` in the database `my_db` and schema `my_schema`:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML(
  'my_db.my_schema',

## Modifying the comment for an existing semantic view

To modify the comment for an existing semantic view, run the [ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-semantic-view.md) command. For example:

```sqlexample
ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW my_semantic_view SET COMMENT = 'my comment';
```

> **Note:**
>
> You can’t use the ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW command to change properties other than the comment. To change other properties of the
> semantic view, replace the semantic view. See Replacing an existing semantic view.

You can also use the [COMMENT](../../sql-reference/sql/comment.md) command to set a comment for a semantic view:

```sqlexample
COMMENT ON SEMANTIC VIEW my_semantic_view IS 'my comment';
```

## Replacing an existing semantic view

To replace an existing semantic view (for example, to change the definition of the view), specify OR REPLACE when executing
[CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view.md). If you want to preserve any privileges granted on the existing semantic view,
specify COPY GRANTS. For example:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE SEMANTIC VIEW tpch_rev_analysis

  TABLES (
    orders AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.ORDERS
      PRIMARY KEY (o_orderkey)
      WITH SYNONYMS ('sales orders')
      COMMENT = 'All orders table for the sales domain',
    customers AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER
      PRIMARY KEY (c_custkey)
      COMMENT = 'Main table for customer data',
    line_items AS SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF1.LINEITEM
      PRIMARY KEY (l_orderkey, l_linenumber)
      COMMENT = 'Line items in orders'
  )

  RELATIONSHIPS (
    orders_to_customers AS
      orders (o_custkey) REFERENCES customers,
    line_item_to_orders AS
      line_items (l_orderkey) REFERENCES orders
  )

  FACTS (
    line_items.line_item_id AS CONCAT(l_orderkey, '-', l_linenumber),
    orders.count_line_items AS COUNT(line_items.line_item_id),
    line_items.discounted_price AS l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
      COMMENT = 'Extended price after discount'
  )

  DIMENSIONS (
    customers.customer_name AS customers.c_name
      WITH SYNONYMS = ('customer name')
      COMMENT = 'Name of the customer',
    orders.order_date AS o_orderdate
      COMMENT = 'Date when the order was placed',
    orders.order_year AS YEAR(o_orderdate)
      COMMENT = 'Year when the order was placed'
  )

  METRICS (
    customers.customer_count AS COUNT(c_custkey)
      COMMENT = 'Count of number of customers',
    orders.order_average_value AS AVG(orders.o_totalprice)
      COMMENT = 'Average order value across all orders',
    orders.average_line_items_per_order AS AVG(orders.count_line_items)
      COMMENT = 'Average number of line items per order'
  )

  COMMENT = 'Semantic view for revenue analysis and different comment'
  COPY GRANTS;
```

## Listing semantic views

To list semantic views in the current schema or a specified schema, run the [SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-views.md)
command. For example:

```sqlexample
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS;
```

```output
+-------------------------------+-----------------------+---------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+
| created_on                    | name                  | database_name | schema_name       | comment                                      | owner           | owner_role_type | extension |

+-------------------------------+-----------------------+---------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+
```

The output of the [SHOW OBJECTS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-objects.md) command includes semantic views. In the `kind` column, the type of
object is listed as `VIEW`. For example:

```sqlexample
SHOW OBJECTS LIKE '%TPCH_ANALYSIS%' IN SCHEMA;
```

```output
+-------------------------------+---------------+---------------+-------------+------+---------+------------+------+-------+---------+----------------+-----------------+-----------+------------+------------+

+-------------------------------+---------------+---------------+-------------+------+---------+------------+------+-------+---------+----------------+-----------------+-----------+------------+------------+
```

You can also [query the views for semantic views in the ACCOUNT_USAGE and INFORMATION_SCHEMA schemas](views.md).

## Listing dimensions, facts, and metrics

To list the dimensions, facts, and metrics that are available in a view, schema, database, or account, you can run the following
commands:

* [SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-dimensions.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-facts.md)
* [SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-metrics.md)

By default, the commands list the dimensions, facts, and metrics that are available in semantic views defined in the current
schema:

```sqlexample
SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS;
```

```output
+---------------+-------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+--------------+-------------------+--------------------------------+
| database_name | schema_name | semantic_view_name | table_name | name          | data_type    | synonyms          | comment                        |
|---------------+-------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+--------------+-------------------+--------------------------------|
| MY_DB         | MY_SCHEMA   | TPCH_REV_ANALYSIS  | CUSTOMERS  | CUSTOMER_NAME | VARCHAR(25)  | ["customer name"] | Name of the customer           |
| MY_DB         | MY_SCHEMA   | TPCH_REV_ANALYSIS  | CUSTOMERS  | C_CUSTKEY     | NUMBER(38,0) | NULL              | NULL                           |

```

```sqlexample

```

```output

| MY_DB         | MY_SCHEMA   | TPCH_REV_ANALYSIS  | ORDERS     | AVERAGE_LINE_ITEMS_PER_ORDER | NUMBER(36,6) | NULL     | Average number of line items per order |
...
```

The following examples demonstrate how to list the dimensions, facts, and metrics for semantic views within different scopes:

* List the dimensions, facts, and metrics in semantic views in the current database:

  ```sqlexample
  SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS IN DATABASE;

  SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS IN DATABASE;

  SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS IN DATABASE;
  ```

* List the dimensions, facts, and metrics in semantic views in a specific schema or database:

  ```sqlexample
  SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS IN SCHEMA my_db.my_other_schema;

  SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS IN DATABASE my_db;

  SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS IN SCHEMA my_db.my_other_schema;

  SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS IN DATABASE my_db;

  SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS IN SCHEMA my_db.my_other_schema;

  SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS IN DATABASE my_db;
  ```

* List the dimensions, facts, and metrics in semantic views in the account:

  ```sqlexample
  SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS IN ACCOUNT;

  SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS IN ACCOUNT;

  SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS IN ACCOUNT;
  ```

* List the dimensions, facts, and metrics in a specific semantic view:

  ```sqlexample
  SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS IN my_semantic_view;

  SHOW SEMANTIC FACTS IN my_semantic_view;

  SHOW SEMANTIC METRICS IN my_semantic_view;
  ```

If you are querying a semantic view, you can use the [SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS FOR METRIC](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-dimensions-for-metric.md) command to
determine which dimensions you can return when specifying a given metric. For details, see
[Choosing the dimensions that you can return for a given metric](querying.md).

When you run the [SHOW COLUMNS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-columns.md) command for a semantic view, the output includes the dimensions, facts,
and metrics in the semantic view. The `kind` column indicates if the row represents a dimension, fact, or metric.

For example:

```sqlexample
SHOW COLUMNS IN VIEW my_db.my_schema.tpch_analysis;
```

## Getting the SQL statement for a semantic view

You can call the [GET_DDL](../../sql-reference/functions/get_ddl.md) function to retrieve the DDL statement that created a semantic view.

> **Note:**
>
> To call this function for a semantic view, you must use a role that has been
> granted the REFERENCES or OWNERSHIP privilege on the semantic view.

When calling GET_DDL, pass in `'SEMANTIC_VIEW'` as the object type. For example:

```sqlexample
SELECT GET_DDL('SEMANTIC_VIEW', 'tpch_rev_analysis', TRUE);
```

```output
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Getting the YAML specification for a semantic view

To get the [YAML specification](semantic-view-yaml-spec.md) for a semantic view, call the
[SYSTEM$READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW](../../sql-reference/functions/system_read_yaml_from_semantic_view.md) function.

The following example returns the YAML specification for the semantic view named `tpch_analysis` in the database `my_db` and
schema `my_schema`:

```sqlexample
SELECT SYSTEM$READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW(
  'my_db.my_schema.tpch_rev_analysis'
);
```

```output

## Exporting a semantic view to a Tableau Data Source (TDS) file

To export a semantic view to a
[Tableau Data Source (TDS) file](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/export_connection.htm#options-for-saving-a-local-data-source),
call the [SYSTEM$EXPORT_TDS_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW](../../sql-reference/functions/system_export_tds_from_semantic_view.md) function.

The following example returns the TDS file content for the semantic view `my_sv_for_export`:

```sqlexample
SELECT SYSTEM$EXPORT_TDS_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW('my_sv_for_export');
```

```output

Copy the XML to a `.tds` file and open the file in Tableau Desktop.

Tableau Desktop displays a folder for each logical table in the list of folders on the left. The names of the folders use spaces
instead of underscores, and each word starts with an uppercase letter. For example, the folder name for the `date_dim` logical
table is `Date Dim`.

Each folder contains Tableau dimensions and measures that correspond to the dimensions, facts, and metrics in the semantic view.

The next sections provide more detail and the limitations of the conversion process:

### About the conversion

The function converts dimensions, facts, and metrics in the semantic view to the following equivalents in the Tableau TDS file:

| Element in the semantic view | Tableau equivalent (dimension or measure) | How the data is aggregated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dimension | Dimension | *For values of numeric dimensions, SUM is used.* Date dimensions are aggregated by year. * For dimensions of other types, COUNT is used. |
| Numeric fact | Measure | SUM |
| Non-numeric fact | Dimension | *Date dimensions are aggregated by year.* For dimensions of other types, COUNT is used. |
| Numeric metric | Measure | The TDS file uses a calculated field in place of the metric. The calculated field passes the value of the metric to the Snowflake [AGG](../../sql-reference/functions/agg.md) function. |
| Non-numeric metric | Dimension | *Date dimensions are aggregated by year.* For dimensions of other types, COUNT is used. |
| Numeric derived metric | Measure | The TDS file uses a calculated field in place of the metric. The calculated field passes the value of the metric to the Snowflake [AGG](../../sql-reference/functions/agg.md) function. |
| Non-numeric derived metric | Dimension | *Date dimensions are aggregated by year.* For dimensions of other types, COUNT is used. |

The following [Snowflake data types](../../sql-reference-data-types.md) are mapped to corresponding Tableau TDS data types:

| Snowflake data type | Equivalent Tableau data type |
| --- | --- |
| NUMBER/FIXED (if the scale is greater than 0) | real |
| NUMBER/FIXED (if the scale is 0 or null) | integer |
| FLOAT or DECFLOAT | real |
| STRING or BINARY | string |
| BOOLEAN | boolean |
| TIME | time |
| DATE | date |
| DATETIME or TIMESTAMP | datetime |
| GEOGRAPHY | spatial |
| Semi-structured (VARIANT, OBJECT, ARRAY), structured (ARRAY, OBJECT, MAP), unstructured (FILE), GEOMETRY, UUID, VECTOR | string |

The TDS file has the following [capabilities](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/odbc_capabilities.htm)
customized for the connection to Snowflake:

| Customization name | Value | Effect of the customization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_EXECUTED_QUERY` | `yes` | Prevents Tableau from actually running a query like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE 1=0` to see column names. |
| `CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_PREPARED_QUERY` | `yes` | Prevents Tableau from “preparing” a statement (sending it to Snowflake to be parsed without executing) to learn about types. |
| `CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_SELECT_STAR` | `yes` | Prevents Tableau from using a `SELECT *` query to read metadata. |
| `CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_SQLCOLUMNS_API` | `no` | Forces Tableau to enable and use the standard ODBC `SQLColumns` function to return column information about the semantic view. This column information includes the names, data types, and precision of columns. |
| `CAP_DISABLE_ESCAPE_UNDERSCORE_IN_CATALOG` | `yes` | Prevents Tableau from escaping underscores when searching for the database name. |

### Limitations when using a semantic view in Tableau Desktop

The following limitations apply to semantic views in Tableau Desktop:

* You cannot create an extract from a semantic view.

  If you change your connection from Live to Extract, Tableau Desktop fails with the following error:

  ```none
  SQL compilation error:
  Requested semantic expression 'XXX' in FACTS clause must be one of the following types: (DIMENSION, FACT).
  Unable to create extract
  ```

* You cannot use the Measure Values field in a semantic view.

  If you select the Measure Values field in a semantic view, Tableau Desktop reports the following error:

  ```none
  Unable to complete action

  Error Code: B9F09DDB
  SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
  Invalid metric expression 'SUM(1)'.
  ```

* You cannot select the Count field in a semantic view.

  If you select SemanticViewName(Count), Tableau Desktop reports the following error:

  ```none
  Unable to complete action

  Error Code: B9F09DDB
  SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 7
  Invalid metric expression 'SUM(1)'.
  ```

  Tableau Desktop cannot report the number of rows in the semantic view because the number of rows can vary, depending on the
  dimensions, facts, and metrics that are specified in the query.
* You cannot drag a measure by itself.

  If you drag a measure, Tableau Desktop reports the following error:

  ```none
  Unable to complete action

  Error Code: B9F09DDB
  SQL compilation error: error line 3 at position 8
  Invalid metric expression 'COUNT(1)'.
  ```

* You cannot directly use a non-numeric metric.

  SYSTEM$EXPORT_TDS_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW converts non-numeric metrics to dimensions in Tableau. If you attempt to use one of these
  dimensions, Tableau Desktop reports the following error:

  ```none
  Unable to complete action

  Error Code: B9F09DDB
  SQL compilation error:
  Requested semantic expression 'CUSTOMER.MIN_NAME' in DIMENSIONS clause must be one of the following types: (DIMENSION, FACT).
  ```

  To work around this, convert the dimension to a measure:

  1. Right-click on the dimension, and select Convert to Measure.

     This converts the dimension to a measure, using the default aggregation Count (Distinct).
  2. To use a different aggregation, right-click on the converted measure, select Default Properties »
     Aggregations, and select the aggregation that you want to use.

## Renaming a semantic view

To rename a semantic view, run [ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW … RENAME TO …](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-semantic-view.md). For
example:

```sqlexample
ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW sv RENAME TO sv_new_name;
```

## Removing a semantic view

To remove a semantic view, run the [DROP SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/drop-semantic-view.md) command. For example:

```sqlexample
DROP SEMANTIC VIEW tpch_rev_analysis;
```

## Granting privileges on semantic views

[Semantic view privileges](../security-access-control-privileges.md) lists the privileges that you can grant on a semantic view.

The following privileges on a semantic view are required to work with the view:

* Any privilege (for example, MONITOR, REFERENCES, or SELECT) on a view is required to run the
  [DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW](../../sql-reference/sql/desc-semantic-view.md) command on that view.
* Any privilege on a view is required to display that view in the output of the [SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS](../../sql-reference/sql/show-semantic-views.md)
  command.
* SELECT is required to query the semantic view.

> **Note:**
>
> To query a semantic view, you don’t need the SELECT privilege on the tables used in the semantic view. You only need the
> SELECT privilege on the semantic view itself.
>
> This behavior is consistent with [the privileges required to query standard views](../views-introduction.md).

To use a semantic view that you do not own in [Cortex Analyst](../snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst.md), you must use a
role that has the REFERENCES and SELECT privileges on that view.

To grant the REFERENCES and SELECT privileges on a semantic view, use the [GRANT <privileges> … TO ROLE](../../sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.md)
command. For example, to grant the REFERENCES and SELECT privileges on the semantic view named `my_semantic_view` to the role
`my_analyst_role`, you can run the following statement:

```sqlexample
GRANT REFERENCES, SELECT ON SEMANTIC VIEW my_semantic_view TO ROLE my_analyst_role;
```

If you have a schema containing semantic views that you want to share with Cortex Analyst users, you can use
[future grants](../security-access-control-configure.md) to grant the privileges on any semantic view that you create
in that schema. For example:

```sqlexample
GRANT REFERENCES, SELECT ON FUTURE SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA my_schema TO ROLE my_analyst_role;
```
