# Upload and use custom functions in Collaboration Clean Rooms

## Introduction

Any collaborator can upload custom Python UDFs and UDTFs into a collaboration. Templates in the collaboration can run these functions to perform complex data actions. Common usage includes machine learning or customized data manipulation within a query. Your uploaded code can import and use packages from an [approved bundle of Python packages](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake/)
and the [Snowpark API packages](../demo-flows/snowpark.md).

> **Note:**
>
> Python is the only coding language supported for custom UDFs.

The following sections show you how to upload and use a custom function.

## Define and use custom code bundles

Here is how to upload and use a custom function:

**The code submitter:**

1. Creates and registers the code by calling REGISTER_CODE_SPEC.

   The code can be inline in the spec, or linked from a stage.
2. Creates a template that references the code bundle spec by ID in the template’s `code_specs` array. Add this field as a peer of the template and parameters fields as shown in this example:

   ```yaml
    parameters:
      - name: <parameter_name>
        description: <parameter_description>
        required: <true_or_false>
        default: <default_value>
        type: <data_type>

    code_specs:             # Optional: List of code bundles used by this template
    - <code_spec_id>        # One or more code spec IDs.

    template: |
      <template_content>
   ```

3. Registers the template and then links the template into the collaboration.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > Snowflake scans uploaded code for security issues. If a security issue is found, the code, and the containing template, will not be added to the collaboration.

**The analysis runner:**

* Runs the template in the standard way by calling `RUN`.

> **Important:**
>
> Snowflake runs security checks on any uploaded bundles before deploying them into a clean room. If a security check fails, the template
> and its bundled code will not be deployed and available for use.
>
> To confirm that a template with a code bundle is deployed and ready for use, take the following steps:
>
> 1. Find the name of the clean room application where you are trying to deploy the code bundle:
>
>    ```sqlexample
>    SHOW APPLICATIONS LIKE 'SFDCR_<collaboration name>';
>    ```
>
> 2. Check the `upgrade_state` value in the DESCRIBE APPLICATION response. When the upgrade state is COMPLETE, the security checks have
>    passed and the new template and bundle are available to use. Pass in the application name returned by the command in the previous step using SQL like the following example:
>    SQL code:
>
>    ```sqlexample
>    DESCRIBE APPLICATION <application name>
>    ```

### Create and register the code bundle spec

The first step in uploading custom code is to create and register the code bundle spec.

Custom functions are defined in a YAML code bundle spec. Each code bundle exposes one or more functions that can be called by a template. The code bundle spec can either include the code in the spec inline, or link to code that lives on a Snowflake stage.

A collaborator registers a spec by calling `REGISTRY.REGISTER_CODE_SPEC`, which returns the bundle ID. Any collaborator with any role can register and link a code bundle.

After the code bundle is linked into the collaboration, that code bundle is visible to anyone in the collaboration who can access a template that links the code bundle. Call `VIEW_CODE_SPECS` to list accessible code bundles in a collaboration.

Anyone who can see a code bundle in a collaboration can see and use it in their own templates in that collaboration. Any inline code can be viewed by any member of the collaboration, but staged artifact code can’t be viewed by collaborators.

The following code bundle spec that exposes a single Python UDF called `normalize_value`, which calls the `normalize` function defined in that spec:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.REGISTRY.REGISTER_CODE_SPEC(
  $$
  api_version: 2.0.0
  spec_type: code_spec
  name: custom_udf
  version: v1
  functions:
    - name: normalize_value
      type: UDF
      language: PYTHON
      handler: normalize
      arguments:
        - name: value
          type: FLOAT
      returns: FLOAT
      code_body: |
        def normalize(value):
            return value / 100.0
  $$
);
```

### Create and register the calling template

After the code spec is registered, the collaborator then registers a template that uses this code bundle. To use a code bundle, add the bundle spec ID in the template’s `code_specs` field.

A template calls a custom function using the syntax `cleanroom.spec_name$function_name`. Note the literal `.` and `$` name scoping marks.

> **Note:**
>
> Use the spec name, not the spec ID, to reference a function in your template.

In the following example, a template uses function `normalize_value` from the code bundle `custom_udf`:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.REGISTRY.REGISTER_TEMPLATE(
  $$
  api_version: 2.0.0
  spec_type: template
  name: normalization_template
  version: v1
  type: sql_analysis
  code_specs:
    - custom_udf_v1  -- Imports the code bundle.
  template: |
    SELECT cleanroom.custom_udf$normalize_value(metric, 0, 100)  -- Calls the UDF.
      AS normalized
        FROM {{ source_tables[0] }}
  $$
);
```

### Add the template to a collaboration

Add the template that calls your function to the collaboration in the standard way. For more information, see [Templates](using.md).

Snowflake validates and uploads to the collaboration when the calling template is added to a collaboration. Snowflake scans uploaded code for security issues before installing the code.

The following example shows a request to add a template to an existing collaboration:

```sqlexample
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.COLLABORATION.ADD_TEMPLATE_REQUEST(
  'my_collaboration',
  'normalization_template_v1',
  ['consumer']
);
```

### Submit a new version of your code bundle

Every registered code spec must have a unique name + version across all registries in your account. A template loads a specific name and version of a code spec. If you want to create or consume a new version of your code, you must submit a new version of the template that references the new code version in the code_specs field. You don’t need to change the template body. For example:

**Step 1:** Consume version 1 of the code bundle:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.REGISTRY.REGISTER_TEMPLATE(
  $$
  api_version: 2.0.0
  spec_type: template
  name: normalization_template
  version: v1
  type: sql_analysis
  code_specs:
    - custom_udf_v1  -- Bundle ID includes the version number.
  template: |
    SELECT cleanroom.custom_udf$normalize_value(metric, 0, 100)  -- Calls the UDF.
      AS normalized
        FROM {{ source_tables[0] }}
  $$
);
```

**Step 2:** Update and register the new version of your code bundle, and then update your template to use the new version:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.REGISTRY.REGISTER_TEMPLATE(
  $$
  api_version: 2.0.0
  spec_type: template
  name: normalization_template
  version: v2        -- Update the template version.
  type: sql_analysis
  code_specs:
    - custom_udf_v2  -- Use the new code bundle.
  template: |
    SELECT cleanroom.custom_udf$normalize_value(metric, 0, 100)  -- No change needed here.
      AS normalized
        FROM {{ source_tables[0] }}
  $$
);
```

Notice that function names don’t include the version, so you don’t need to change the calling code in the template body when you upload a new version of a function.

## Code bundle specification

This specification defines a bundle of one or more code functions or procedures that can be called by a template.

A code bundle spec has a maximum of 5 functions plus procedures.

Identifiers in the code bundle spec have the following general requirements:

* **Names**: Must be valid [Snowflake identifiers](../../../sql-reference/identifiers-syntax.md) that start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
* **Quoted identifiers**: Double-quoted identifiers are supported for names with special characters.
* **Case sensitivity**: Unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive; quoted identifiers preserve case.

    `alias: identifier`
    :   An alias for referencing this artifact in imports. When referencing this alias within this spec, use the bare alias name rather than `cleanroom.spec_name$alias`; that is, use the bare function name to reference another function in this spec.

    `stage_path: stage_path`
    :   Full stage path to the artifact file; For example, `@DB.SCHEMA.STAGE/path/file.whl`.

    * **The stage must be internal.** External stages are not supported.

## API reference

The following procedures are used to manage custom code bundles in a collaboration:

### REGISTER_CODE_SPEC

Schema:
:   REGISTRY

Registers a code bundle. This stores the code in the clean rooms environment in the REGISTRY.CODE_SPECS table. After a code spec is registered, it can be used by a template.

Every code spec registered must have a unique name + version across all registries in your account.

#### Syntax

```sqlsyntax
REGISTER_CODE_SPEC( ['<registry_name>' ,] <code_spec> )
```

#### Arguments

`registry_name` *(Optional)*
:   Name of a [custom registry](registries.md) in which to register this code spec. If not specified, registers the code bundle in the default account registry.

`code_spec`
:   Code bundle spec definition in YAML format, as a string.

#### Returns

The generated code bundle spec ID.

#### Examples

Register a code bundle in the default registry:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.REGISTRY.REGISTER_CODE_SPEC(
  $$
  api_version: 2.0.0
  spec_type: code_spec
  name: custom_udf
  version: v1
  description: Custom UDF for data normalization

  functions:
    - name: normalize_value
      type: UDF
      language: PYTHON
      runtime_version: "3.10"
      handler: normalize
      arguments:
        - name: value
          type: FLOAT
        - name: min_val
          type: FLOAT
        - name: max_val
          type: FLOAT
      returns: FLOAT
      code_body: |
        def normalize(value, min_val, max_val):
            if max_val == min_val:
                return 0.0
            return (value - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
  $$
);
```

Register a code bundle in a custom registry:

```sqlexample-yaml
CALL SAMOOHA_BY_SNOWFLAKE_LOCAL_DB.REGISTRY.REGISTER_CODE_SPEC(
  'my_custom_registry',
  $$
  api_version: 2.0.0
  spec_type: code_spec
  name: custom_udf
  version: v1
  description: Custom UDF for data normalization

  functions:

### Multiple Python files as staged artifacts

Be sure to read the stage_path documentation requirements for linking to staged code in your code spec.

This example YAML uses multiple staged Python source files:

```yaml
api_version: 2.0.0
spec_type: code_spec
name: analytics_suite
version: v3
description: Analytics suite with multiple modules

artifacts:
  - alias: utils
    stage_path: "@MY_DB.PUBLIC.CODE_STAGE/analytics/utils.py"
    description: Utility functions
  - alias: transformers
    stage_path: "@MY_DB.PUBLIC.CODE_STAGE/analytics/transformers.py"
    description: Data transformation functions
  - alias: validators
    stage_path: "@MY_DB.PUBLIC.CODE_STAGE/analytics/validators.py"
    description: Validation functions

functions:
  - name: transform_and_validate
    type: UDF
    language: PYTHON
    runtime_version: "3.10"
    handler: transformers.transform_validate
    arguments:
      - name: data
        type: OBJECT
    returns: OBJECT
    imports:
      - utils
      - transformers
      - validators
    description: Transforms and validates input data
```

## Troubleshooting code bundles

Error:
:   `CodeSpecAlreadyExistsException`

Cause:
:   Code bundle spec with same name and version already registered.

Solution:
:   Use a different version or update the existing version.

---

Error:
:   `SpecValidationError`

Cause:
:   YAML doesn’t conform to schema.

Solution:
:   Check required fields and format.

---

Error:
:   `CodeSpecStageNotAccessibleError`

Cause:
:   Stage referenced in artifact isn’t accessible.

Solution:
:   Grant access to stage or verify stage exists.

---

Error:
:   `CodeSpecArtifactNotFoundAtStageError`

Cause:
:   File not found at specified stage path.

Solution:
:   Upload file to stage before registering.

---

Error:
:   `StageDirectoryNotEnabledError`

Cause:
:   Stage doesn’t have DIRECTORY enabled.

Solution:
:   Enable directory on the stage: `ALTER STAGE ... SET DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)`

---

Error:
:   `CodeSpecNotFoundForOwnerException`

Cause:
:   Template references unregistered code bundle spec.

Solution:
:   Register code bundle spec before registering template.
