# WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY

This table function can be used in queries to return the hourly credit usage for a single warehouse (or all the warehouses in your account) within a specified date range.

> **Note:**
>
> This function returns credit usage within the last 6 months. However, if you are querying multiple warehouses over a lengthy time period,
> it might not return a complete data set. To obtain a complete data set, use the
> [ACCOUNT_USAGE view](../account-usage/warehouse_metering_history.md) instead.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY(
      DATE_RANGE_START => <constant_expr>
      [ , DATE_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
      [ , WAREHOUSE_NAME => '<string>' ] )
```

## Arguments

**Required:**

`DATE_RANGE_START => constant_expr`
:   The starting date, within the last 6 months, for which warehouse usage is returned.

**Optional:**

`DATE_RANGE_END => constant_expr`
:   The ending date, within the last 6 months, for which warehouse usage is returned.

    Default: [CURRENT_DATE](current_date.md) is used.

`WAREHOUSE_NAME => 'string'`
:   The name of the warehouse to retrieve credit usage for. Note that the warehouse name must be enclosed in single quotes. Also, if the warehouse name any spaces, mixed-case characters,
    or special characters, the name must be double-quoted within the single quotes (e.g. `'"My Warehouse"'` vs `'mywarehouse'`).

    Default: All warehouses that ran during the specified date range.

## Usage notes

* Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role or any role that has been explicitly granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege.
* When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see
  [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).
* The order and structure of the arguments depends on whether the argument keywords (e.g. `DATE_RANGE_START`) are included:

  * The keywords are not required if the arguments are specified in order.
  * If the argument keywords are included, the arguments can be specified in any order.

## Output

The function returns the following columns, ordered by WAREHOUSE_NAME and START_TIME:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| START_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | The beginning of the hour in which this warehouse usage took place. |
| END_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | The end of the hour in which this warehouse usage took place. |
| WAREHOUSE_NAME | VARCHAR | Name of the warehouse. |
| CREDITS_USED | NUMBER | Number of credits billed for this warehouse in this hour. |
| CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE | NUMBER | Number of credits used for the warehouse in the hour. |
| CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES | NUMBER | Number of credits used for cloud services in the hour. |

## Examples

Retrieve hourly warehouse usage over the past 10 days for all warehouses that ran during this time period:

> ```sqlexample
> select *
> from table(information_schema.warehouse_metering_history(dateadd('days',-10,current_date())));
> ```

Retrieve hourly warehouse usage for the `testingwh` warehouse on a specified date:

> ```sqlexample
> select *
> from table(information_schema.warehouse_metering_history('2017-10-23', '2017-10-23', 'testingwh'));
> ```
