# Snowpark Developer Guide for Scala

The Snowpark library provides an intuitive API for querying and processing data in a data pipeline. Using the Snowpark library, you can
build applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system where your application code runs.

For an introduction to Snowpark, see [Snowpark API](../index.md).

## Get Started

[Setting Up Your Development Environment for Snowpark Scala](setup.md)
:   Set up to build Snowpark apps using any of several development environments.

[Snowpark Library for Scala and Java release notes](../../../release-notes/clients-drivers/snowpark-scala-java.md)
:   Get the latest release notes.

### Quickstarts

[Getting Started With Snowpark in Scala](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_snowpark_scala/index.html) (Snowflake Quickstarts)
:   Use a tutorial to learn the basics of Snowpark with Scala.

## Developer Guides

[Creating a Session for Snowpark Scala](creating-session.md)
:   Establish a session with which you interact with the Snowflake database.

[A Simple Example of Using Snowpark Scala](example.md)
:   See example code for an application that prints information about tables in Snowflake.

[Logging, tracing, and metrics](../../logging-tracing/logging-tracing-overview.md)
:   Record log messages and trace events in an event table for analysis later.

[Analyzing Queries and Troubleshooting with Snowpark Scala](troubleshooting.md)
:   Troubleshoot your code with logging and by viewing underlying SQL.
