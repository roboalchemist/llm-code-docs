[1] A dbt project object is a versioned snapshot of your project. Running the deps command on it doesn’t modify any files; it’s primarily
used to verify that your external access configuration is correct. When a dbt project object is created with an external access integration, dbt deps is run before dbt compile to package all dependencies and project files.

[2] dbt Projects on Snowflake don’t support dbt docs serve.

## About flags

In dbt Core, you run commands (for example, `dbt build`) and modify their behavior with flags. Flags are configuration options that modify how a command behaves; some are command-specific, others are global. For more information, see [flags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs).

You always run a command, and you attach flags to scope or alter it. For example, to run only incremental models and rebuild them, you would run the following command and flags:

```sqlexample
dbt run --select config.materialized:incremental --full-refresh;
```

The following flags aren’t supported in dbt Projects on Snowflake:

* `--state`
* `--target-path`
* `--log-path`
* `--profiles-dir`
* `--project-dir`
* `--log-format`
* `--log-format-file`
