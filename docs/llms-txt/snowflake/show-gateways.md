# SHOW GATEWAYS

Lists the [gateway](../../developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/gateway.md) for which you have access privileges.

:   [CREATE GATEWAY](create-gateway.md) , [ALTER GATEWAY](alter-gateway.md), [DROP GATEWAY](drop-gateway.md) , [DESCRIBE GATEWAY](desc-gateway.md)

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
SHOW GATEWAYS [ LIKE '<pattern>' ]
           [ IN
                {
                  ACCOUNT                  |

                  DATABASE                 |
                  DATABASE <database_name> |

                  SCHEMA                   |
                  SCHEMA <schema_name>     |
                  <schema_name>
                }
           ]
           [ STARTS WITH '<name_string>' ]
           [ LIMIT <rows> [ FROM '<name_string>' ] ]
```

## Parameters

`LIKE 'pattern'`
:   Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL
    wildcard characters (`%` and `_`).

    For example, the following patterns return the same results:

    `... LIKE '%testing%' ...`

    `... LIKE '%TESTING%' ...`

    . Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).

`[ IN ... ]`
:   Optionally specifies the scope of the command. Specify one of the following:

    `ACCOUNT`
    :   Returns records for the entire account.

    `DATABASE`, . `DATABASE db_name`
    :   Returns records for the current database in use or for a specified database (`db_name`).

        If you specify `DATABASE` without `db_name` and no database is in use, the keyword has no effect on the output.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > Using SHOW commands without an `IN` clause in a database context can result in fewer than expected results.
        >
        > Objects with the same name are only displayed once if no `IN` clause is used. For example, if you have table `t1` in
        > `schema1` and table `t1` in `schema2`, and they are both in scope of the database context you’ve specified (that is, the database
        > you’ve selected is the parent of `schema1` and `schema2`), then SHOW TABLES only displays one of the `t1` tables.

    `SCHEMA`, . `SCHEMA schema_name`
    :   Returns records for the current schema in use or a specified schema (`schema_name`).

        `SCHEMA` is optional if a database is in use or if you specify the fully qualified `schema_name` (for example, `db.schema`).

        If no database is in use, specifying `SCHEMA` has no effect on the output.

    If you omit `IN ...`, the scope of the command depends on whether the session currently has a database in use:

    * If a database is currently in use, the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in the database. This has the
      same effect as specifying `IN DATABASE`.
    * If no database is currently in use, the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in your account. This has the
      same effect as specifying `IN ACCOUNT`.

`STARTS WITH 'name_string'`
:   Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of
    the object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case sensitive.

    For example, the following strings return different results:

    `... STARTS WITH 'B' ...`

    `... STARTS WITH 'b' ...`

    . Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)

`LIMIT rows`
:   Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned. The actual number of rows returned might be less than the specified limit. For
    example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.

    Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output).

## Output

The command output provides gateway properties and metadata in the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `created_on` | Date and time when the gateway was created. |
| `name` | Gateway name. |
| `database_name` | Database in which the gateway is created. |
| `schema_name` | Schema in which the gateway is created. |
| `owner` | Role that owns the gateway. |
| `owner_role_type` | The type of role that owns the object, either ROLE or DATABASE_ROLE. |
| `gateway_type` | The type of gateway. |
| `comment` | Gateway related comment. |

> **Note:**
>
> Only gateways on which the role used has USAGE, MODIFY, or OWNERSHIP privilege will be shown.

## Access control requirements

A [role](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md) used to execute this SQL command must have at least one of the following
[privileges](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md) at a minimum:

| Privilege | Object | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USAGE, MODIFY, or OWNERSHIP | Gateway | Only gateways on which the role has one of these privileges will be shown. |
| USAGE | Database | Required on the database containing the gateways. |
| USAGE | Schema | Required on the schema containing the gateways. |

For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see [Creating custom roles](../../user-guide/security-access-control-configure.md).

For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on
[securable objects](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md), see [Overview of Access Control](../../user-guide/security-access-control-overview.md).

## Usage notes

* The command doesn’t require a running warehouse to execute.
* The command only returns objects for which the current user’s current role has been granted at least one access privilege.
* The MANAGE GRANTS access privilege implicitly allows its holder to see every object in the account. By default, only the account
  administrator (users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) and security administrator (users with the SECURITYADMIN role) have the
  MANAGE GRANTS privilege.

* To post-process the output of this command, you can use the [pipe operator](../operators-flow.md)
  (`->>`) or the [RESULT_SCAN](../functions/result_scan.md) function. Both constructs treat the output as a
  result set that you can query.

  For example, you can use the pipe operator or RESULT_SCAN function to select specific columns from the SHOW
  command output or filter the rows.

  When you refer to the output columns, use [double-quoted identifiers](../identifiers-syntax.md) for
  the column names. For example, to select the output column `type`, specify `SELECT "type"`.

  You must use double-quoted identifiers because the output column names for SHOW commands are in lowercase.
  The double quotes ensure that the column names in the SELECT list or WHERE clause match the column names
  in the SHOW command output that was scanned.

* The command returns a maximum of ten thousand records for the specified object type, as dictated by the access privileges for the role
  used to execute the command. Any records above the ten thousand records limit aren’t returned, even with a filter applied.

  To view results for which more than ten thousand records exist, query the corresponding view (if one exists) in the [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).

## Examples

The following example lists gateways in a specific schema:

```sqlexample
SHOW GATEWAYS IN SCHEMA db.schema;
```

The following example lists gateways in the current database and schema for the session:

```sqlexample
SHOW GATEWAYS;
```

The following example lists gateways with names containing “split”:

```sqlexample
SHOW GATEWAYS LIKE '%split%';
```

The following example lists one gateway:

```sqlexample
SHOW GATEWAYS LIMIT 1;
```
