# Openflow Snowflake Deployment cost and scaling considerations

When running Openflow - Snowflake Deployment you must be aware of the cost considerations associated with multiple Snowflake components, including, but not limited to the following cost categories:

* Compute pool costs
* Snowpark Container Services infrastructure
* Data Ingestion
* Telemetry Data Ingestion
* Other costs not explicitly mentioned in this topic

Using and scaling Openflow involves understanding these costs. The following sections describe Openflow costs in general, and provide a number of examples of scaling Openflow runtimes and associated costs.

## Openflow - Snowflake Deployment costs

When using Openflow - Snowflake Deployment, you can incur costs from multiple Snowflake components that
Openflow uses. These cost categories are described in the following sections.

However, your actual costs may vary based on your specific environment. See Examples for calculating Openflow - Snowflake Deployment consumption for examples of different
cost consumption scenarios.

### Openflow compute pool costs

> **Note:**
>
> This cost category is shown as **Openflow Compute Snowflake** on your Snowflake bill.

The total costs for running Openflow are based on the number and types of instances used by [Snowpark Container Service compute pools](../../../developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool.md) in your Snowflake account.

Openflow uses compute pools for two different purposes:

* Openflow Management Services

  Openflow Management Services run as part of an Openflow deployment. They
  use a compute pool to manage the Openflow deployment. This compute pool begins running
  as soon as you create a deployment. It continues to run as long as the deployment is
  active.

  > **Caution:**
  >
  > The compute pool associated with the Openflow Management Services continues to run and incurs costs, even if there are no runtimes running.
* Openflow runtimes

  Openflow uses compute pools to run the Openflow runtimes. The number of compute
  pools required and the number of nodes within each compute pool are scaled based on the
  number of runtimes that are currently running.

  When all runtimes associated with a runtime are stopped, the compute pool associated
  with the runtimes is scaled down to 0 nodes. No costs are incurred for a runtime compute pool when it is not in use.

Credits are billed per-second with a 5 minute minimum. For information on the rate per Snowpark Container Services
Compute Instance Family per hour, refer to Table 1(d) in the
[Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

The following views in the [Account Usage](../../../sql-reference/account-usage.md) schema provide additional details on Openflow
compute costs:

* [METERING_DAILY_HISTORY](../../../sql-reference/account-usage/metering_daily_history.md)
* [METERING_HISTORY](../../../sql-reference/account-usage/metering_history.md)

Compute pool costs related to Openflow appear under `SERVICE_TYPE` as `OPENFLOW_COMPUTE_SNOWFLAKE`.

> **Note:**
>
> The [OPENFLOW_USAGE_HISTORY](../../../sql-reference/account-usage/openflow_usage_history.md) view currently does not
> contain records for the `OPENFLOW_COMPUTE_SNOWFLAKE` service type.

For more information on compute costs in Snowflake, see [Exploring compute cost](../../cost-exploring-compute.md).

### Snowpark Container Services infrastructure costs

In addition to compute pool costs, there are costs associated with additional Snowpark Container Services infrastructure, including storage and data transfer.

For additional information, see [Snowpark Container Services costs](../../../developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/accounts-orgs-usage-views.md).

### Data ingestion costs

Costs are incurred when loading data into Snowflake using services such as Snowpipe or Snowpipe Streaming. These costs are based on the volume of data ingested.

> **Note:**
>
> These costs appear on your Snowflake bill under their respective ingestion services line items.

Additionally, some connectors may require a warehouse and will incur warehouse costs. For example, database CDC connectors require a warehouse for both the
initial snapshots and ongoing incremental Change Data Capture (CDC).

### Telemetry data ingestion costs

When using an event table to store telemetry data for Openflow, Snowflake charges
for sending logs and metrics to Openflow deployments. There are also charges for
sending runtime telemetry data to your event table within Snowflake.

The rate for credits per GB of telemetry data is specified in Table 5 in the
[Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf)
This item is referred to as Telemetry Data Ingest.

## Reducing Openflow credit consumption

If you have runtimes that are not actively in use, you can suspend them to reduce costs. Suspending a runtime
stops credit consumption for the associated runtime compute pool. When a runtime is suspended, its compute pool
scales down to 0 nodes and no longer incurs charges.

## Openflow - Snowflake Deployment costs associated with runtimes and scaling behavior

How you choose to configure and scale runtimes is important for managing costs effectively. Openflow supports different runtime types, each with its own scaling characteristics and associated costs.

### Mapping runtimes to Snowflake compute pools

The runtime type you choose determines the runtime pods that are scheduled on the associated compute pool. Using a larger runtime type will result in a larger compute pool being used, which will incur higher costs.

The runtime sizes and their scaling behavior are described in the following table:

| Runtime type | vCPUs | Available memory (GB) | Snowflake Compute Pool instance family | Snowflake Compute Pool | Instance Family - vCPUs | Instance Family - memory (GB) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 1 | 2 | CPU_X64_S | INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_SMALL | 4 | 16 |
| Medium | 4 | 10 | CPU_X64_SL | INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_MEDIUM | 16 | 64 |
| Large | 8 | 20 | CPU_X64_L | INTERNAL_OPENFLOW_0_LARGE | 32 | 128 |

Openflow scales the underlying Snowflake Compute Pools when additional compute pool
nodes need to be scheduled, based on CPU consumption, and up to the maximum node setting set during runtime creation.

Compute pools are configured with a minimum size of 0 nodes and a maximum of 50 nodes. The required size is dynamically adjusted depending on the CPU and memory
requirements of the runtimes.

If there are no resource demands, for example, if the runtime is not running, a compute pool scales down to 0 nodes after 600 seconds (10 minutes).

| Runtime | Activity | Snowflake costs | Cloud costs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No runtimes | None | Openflow Control Pool x 1 node = 1 CPU_X64_S instance-hour | None |
| 1 small runtime (1vCPU) (min=1 max=2) | Active for 1 hour.  Runtime does not scale to 2. | Openflow Control Pool x 1 node + Small Openflow Compute Pool (CPU_X64_S) x 1 node = 2 CPU_X64_S instance-hours | None |
| 2 small runtime (1 vCPU) (min/max=2) 1 large runtime (8 vCPU) (min/max=10) | Small: 4 nodes active for 1 hour Large: 10 nodes active for 1 hour | Openflow Control Pool x 1 node + Small Openflow Compute Pool (CPU_X64_S) x 2 node + Large Openflow Compute Pool (CPU_X64_L) x 4 nodes = 3 CPU_X64_S instance-hours + 4 CPU_X64_L instance-hours | None |
| 1 medium (4vCPU) (min=1 max=2) | First 20 minutes 1 node is running After 20 minutes, scales to 2 nodes After 40 minutes, scales back to 1 node Total 1 hour | Openflow Control Pool x 1 node + Medium Openflow Compute Pool (CPU_X64_SL) x 1 node = 1 CPU_X64_S instance-hour + 1 CPU_X64_SL instance-hour | None |
| 1 medium (4vCPU) (min/max=2) | First 30 minutes 2 nodes running Suspends after the first 30 minutes | Openflow Control Pool x 1 node + Medium Openflow Compute Pool (CPU_X64_SL) x 1 node x 1/2 hour = 1 CPU_X64_S instance-hour + 1/2 CPU_X64_SL instance-hour | None |
