# EXTERNAL_TABLES view

This Information Schema view displays a row for each external table in the specified (or current) database.

## Columns

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TABLE_CATALOG | VARCHAR | Database that the table belongs to |
| TABLE_SCHEMA | VARCHAR | Schema that the table belongs to |
| TABLE_NAME | VARCHAR | Name of the table |
| TABLE_OWNER | VARCHAR | Name of the role that owns the table |
| CREATED | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Creation time of the table |
| LAST_ALTERED | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Date and time the object was last altered by a DML, DDL, or background metadata operation. See Usage Notes. |
| LAST_DDL | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Timestamp of the last DDL operation performed on the table or view.  All supported table/view DDL operations update this field:   * { CREATE | ALTER | DROP | UNDROP } TABLE * { CREATE | ALTER | DROP } VIEW   All ALTER TABLE operations update this field, including setting or unsetting a table parameter (for example, COMMENT, DATA_RETENTION_TIME, etc.) and changes to table columns (ADD / MODIFY / RENAME / DROP).  For more information, see the Usage Notes. |
| LAST_DDL_BY | VARCHAR | The current username for the user who executed the last DDL operation. If the user has been dropped, shows `DROPPED_USER(<id>)`.  For dropped users, you can join the `<id>` with the USER_ID column in the USERS view of the ACCOUNT_USAGE or ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema. |
| AUTO_CLUSTERING_ON | BOOLEAN | Whether automatic clustering is enabled for the table |
| COMMENT | VARCHAR | Comment for this table |
| LOCATION | VARCHAR | External stage where the files containing data to be read are staged |
| FILE_FORMAT_NAME | VARCHAR | Named file format that describes the staged data files to scan when querying the external table |
| FILE_FORMAT_TYPE | VARCHAR | Format type of the staged data files to scan when querying the external table |

## Usage notes

* The view only displays objects for which the current role for the session has been granted access privileges. The view does not honor the MANAGE GRANTS privilege and consequently may show less
  information compared to a SHOW command when both are executed by a user who holds the MANAGE GRANTS privilege.
* The view does not include external tables that have been dropped.
* To view only external tables in your queries, filter using a WHERE clause, e.g.:

  > `... WHERE table_schema != 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'`
* The LAST_ALTERED column is updated when the following operations are performed on an object:

  * DDL operations.
  * DML operations (for tables only). This column is updated even when no rows are affected by the DML statement.
  * Background maintenance operations on metadata performed by Snowflake.

  For views and tables, use the LAST_DDL column for the last modification time for an object.
* The value in the LAST_DDL column is updated as follows:

  > * When a table or view is created, the LAST_DDL timestamp is the same as the CREATED timestamp.
  > * When a table or view is dropped, the LAST_DDL timestamp is the same as the DELETED timestamp.
  > * Last DDL data is not available for operations that occurred before the columns were
  >   [added](../../release-notes/bcr-bundles/2023_01/bcr-891.md). The new DDL fields contain `null` until a DDL operation is executed.
  > * For replicated databases, the LAST_DDL and LAST_DDL_BY fields are only updated for objects in the primary database. After failover, the
  >   LAST_DDL and LAST_DDL_BY fields are updated for DDL operations for the tables and views in the newly promoted primary database. These
  >   fields will remain unchanged for objects in the now secondary database.
  > * For objects in secondary databases that are newly created during a refresh operation, these fields are `null`.
* The LAST_ALTERED column does not necessarily indicate the last refreshed time for external tables.
  To retrieve the last refreshed time for an auto-refreshed external table, you can use the
  [SYSTEM$EXTERNAL_TABLE_PIPE_STATUS](../functions/system_external_table_pipe_status.md) function, which returns
  information such as the timestamp of the last file Snowflake has registered.

## Examples

Retrieve the list of all external tables in all schemas in the `mydatabase` database:

> ```sqlexample
> SELECT table_name, last_altered FROM mydatabase.information_schema.external_tables;
> ```
