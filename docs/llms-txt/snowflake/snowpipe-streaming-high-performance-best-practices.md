# Best practices for Snowpipe Streaming with high-performance architecture

This guide outlines key best practices to design and implement robust data ingestion pipelines by using Snowpipe Streaming with high-performance architecture. By following these best practices, you ensure that your pipelines are durable, reliable, and have efficient error handling.

## Manage channels strategically

Apply the following channel-management strategies for performance and long-term stability:

* **Use long-lived channels**: To minimize overhead, open a channel once, and then keep it active for the duration of the ingestion task. Avoid repeatedly opening and closing channels.
* **Use deterministic channel names**: Apply a consistent, predictable naming convention — for example, `source-env-region-client-id` — to simplify troubleshooting and facilitate automated recovery processes.
* **Scale out with multiple channels**: To increase throughput, open multiple channels. These channels can point to a single target pipe or to multiple pipes, depending on service limits and your throughput requirements.
* **Monitor channel status**: Regularly use the `getChannelStatus` method to monitor the health of your ingestion channels.

  * Track the `last_committed_offset_token` to verify that data is being ingested successfully and that the pipeline is making progress.
  * Monitor the `row_error_count` to detect bad records or other ingestion issues early.

## Validate the schema consistently

Ensure that incoming data conforms to the expected table schema to prevent ingestion failures and maintain data integrity:

* **Client-side validation**: Implement schema validation on the client side to provide immediate feedback and reduce server-side errors. Although full row-by-row validation offers maximum safety, a method that performs better might involve selective validation; for example, at batch boundaries or by sampling rows.
* **Server-side validation**: The high-performance architecture can offload schema validation to the server. Errors and their counts are reported through `getChannelStatus` if schema mismatches occur during ingestion into the target pipe and table.

## Add client-side metadata columns

To enable robust error detection and recovery, you must carry ingestion metadata as part of the row payload. This requires planning your data shape and PIPE definition in advance.

Add the following columns to your row payload before ingestion:

* `CHANNEL_ID`; for example, a compact INTEGER
* `STREAM_OFFSET`; a BIGINT that is monotonically increasing per channel, such as a Kafka partition offset

Together, these columns uniquely identify records per channel and enable you to trace the data’s origin.

Optionally, add a `PIPE_ID` column if multiple pipes ingest into the same target table. With this column, you can trace rows back to their ingestion pipeline. You can store descriptive pipe names in a separate lookup table, mapping them to compact integers to reduce storage costs.

## Detect and recover from errors using metadata offsets

Combine channel monitoring with your metadata columns to detect and recover from issues:

* **Monitor status**: Regularly check `getChannelStatus`. An increasing `row_error_count` is a strong indicator of a potential problem.
* **Detect missing records**: If errors are detected, use a SQL query to identify missing or out-of-order records by checking for gaps in your `STREAM_OFFSET` sequence.

```sqlexample
SELECT
  PIPE_ID,
  CHANNEL_ID,
  STREAM_OFFSET,
  LAG(STREAM_OFFSET) OVER (
    PARTITION BY PIPE_ID, CHANNEL_ID
    ORDER BY STREAM_OFFSET
  ) AS previous_offset,
  (LAG(STREAM_OFFSET) OVER (
    PARTITION BY PIPE_ID, CHANNEL_ID
    ORDER BY STREAM_OFFSET
  ) + 1) AS expected_next
FROM my_table
QUALIFY STREAM_OFFSET != previous_offset + 1;
```

## Use compression for REST API requests

When you use the Snowpipe Streaming REST API, use compression to send more data per request and reduce network overhead.

Although the REST API has a physical limit of 4 MB per request, this limit applies to the observed transfer size. By using compression, you can fit a larger uncompressed data volume into each request, enabling higher throughput and reducing the number of API calls required.

Snowflake recommends using ZSTD as the high-performance compression algorithm, although Gzip is also supported.

## Optimize ingestion performance and cost with MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME

Configure your pipe to map the necessary columns from your source data instead of ingesting all data into a single VARIANT column. To do this, use `MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME = CASE_SENSITIVE` or apply transformations in your pipe definition. This best practice not only optimizes your ingestion costs but also enhances the overall performance of your streaming data pipeline.

This best practice has the following important advantages:

* By using `MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME = CASE_SENSITIVE`, you’re only billed for the data values that are ingested into your target table. In contrast, ingesting data into a single VARIANT column bills you for all JSON bytes, including both the keys and the values. For data with verbose or numerous JSON keys, this can lead to a significant and unnecessary increase in your ingestion costs.
* Snowflake’s processing engine is more computationally efficient. Instead of parsing the entire JSON object into a VARIANT, and then extracting the required columns, this method directly extracts the necessary values.

## Use native data types for semi-structured data

For optimal performance and data integrity, provide semi-structured data by using native language objects rather than serialized strings.

* **Performance**: With native objects, the SDK can handle data more efficiently without requiring additional parsing steps on the Snowflake server.
* **Type Safety**: The high-performance architecture treats string literals as literal text. By using native objects, you ensure that your data is stored as structured JSON rather than escaped string values.

**Java example**:

```java
// Preferred: SDK converts the List to a structured ARRAY
row.put("tags", Arrays.asList("electronics", "sale"));
```

**Python example**:

```python
# Preferred: SDK converts the dict to a structured VARIANT
row["payload"] = {"event_id": 101, "status": "active"}
```

## Get Prometheus metrics

To get performance metrics from the Snowpipe Streaming high-performance client, you must enable the built-in Prometheus metrics server and configure your Prometheus service to scrape the endpoint.

Enable the metrics server by setting the environment variable `SS_ENABLE_METRICS` to `true` before running your application.

Scrape the metrics endpoint on the host that is running your Snowpipe Streaming ingest process. The default path is `/metrics` on the host and port defined by `SS_METRICS_IP` and `SS_METRICS_PORT`.

### Example: Verifying the metrics endpoint (local process/dev box)

```bash
# Enable Prometheus metrics
export SS_ENABLE_METRICS=true
# Run your application (the server starts on 127.0.0.1:50000 by default)

# Curl the endpoint to verify the metrics are exposed
curl http://127.0.0.1:50000/metrics
```

### Example: Prometheus scrape configuration

Point your Prometheus service at the host running the Snowpipe Streaming client.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: snowpipe_streaming_hp
    metrics_path: /metrics   # default is /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['127.0.0.1:50000']
```

## Designing for resiliency

### Wrap ingestion in try-catch blocks

Don’t assume that `insertRows` always succeeds. Ensure that your ingestion loop can catch `SFException` and interpret the HTTP status codes, specifically 409 for invalidations and 429 for throttling.

### Implement exponential back-off

For retryable errors (429, 500, 503), don’t retry immediately. Use an exponential back-off strategy —– increasing the wait time between each retry —– to allow the system to recover.

### Verify progress with offset tokens

Periodically call `getLatestCommittedOffsetToken` to track which data was successfully persisted. If a 409 error occurs, use this token to identify the exact point from which to replay data after reopening the channel.

### Monitor channel status

Regularly check `getChannelStatus()`. If the status code is anything other than `SUCCESS`, trigger your error-handling logic to reset the channel or client connection.
