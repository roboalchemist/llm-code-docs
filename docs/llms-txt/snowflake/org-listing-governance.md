# Organizational listing governance

[Organization-level access history](../../../access-history.md) provides data governors with the information they need to track
when a consumer’s query reads from a data product made available by a provider through an organizational listing. The data governor can
determine which account provided the organizational listing and exactly which data object was accessed. They can also determine if the data
object provided by the organizational listing is protected by a policy (such as a masking policy or row access policy) in the provider’s
account.

You can gain these insights into the consumer queries by using the [organization account](../../../organization-accounts.md) to query
the ACCESS_HISTORY view of the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema. This ACCESS_HISTORY view contains the
following columns related to the governance of organizational listings:

* `provider_base_objects_accessed` - Specifies the data objects in the provider’s account that were accessed by the consumer query.
* `provider_policies_referenced` - If a consumer query accessed base objects that are protected by a policy in the provider’s
  account, this column lists the policy.

For example, if an organization administrator wants to know all the intra-organization, cross-account queries that have accessed data
objects via organizational listings, they could execute the following query *from the organization account*:

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM snowflake.organization_usage.access_history
  WHERE provider_base_objects_accessed IS NOT NULL;
```
