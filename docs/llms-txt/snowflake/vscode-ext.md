# Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Snowflake [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) extension enables you to write and execute Snowflake SQL statements directly in VS Code. The extension also integrates with [Snowpark Python](../developer-guide/snowpark/python/index.md) to provide debugging, syntax highlighting, and autocomplete features for SQL in Python code.

You can either install the VS Code extension from the Visual Studio marketplace or download and install the `.vsix` file.

## Install the VS Code extension from Visual Studio Marketplace

1. In VS Code, select Code > Settings > Extensions.
2. In the Search Extensions in Marketplace field, enter **Snowflake**, and then select the **Snowflake** extension.

   To confirm you’ve selected the correct extension, look for the Snowflake badge as shown in the following image:
3. Select Install.

## Install the VS Code extension from a .vsix file

1. Download the extension:

   * Go to <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snowflake.snowflake-vsc>.
   * Select the Version History tab.
   * Select Download for the VS Code extension version you want to install. Note where the file is downloaded.
2. In VS Code, select Code > Settings > Extensions.
3. Select More (…) > Install from VSIX.
4. Browse to the location of the `snowflake-x.y.z.vsix` file on your computer, select the file, and then select Install.

   After the installation completes, the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code appears in the INSTALLED section of the Extensions menu in VS Code.

## Sign in to Snowflake with the VS Code extension

Before you can execute SQL statements, use Snowpark Python, or use Snowflake Native App Framework features, you must sign in to a Snowflake account.

Methods for signing in to Snowflake with the VS Code extension:

* Use your Snowflake account identifier, username, and password.
* Use federated authentication such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or Single sign-on (SSO).
* Use key-pair authentication.
* Use OAuth authentication in your `connections.toml` configuration file. See Edit the Snowflake connections.toml file.

The first time you use the VS Code extension to sign in to Snowflake, you need to enter either the account identifier for your Snowflake account or the URL that you use to connect to Snowflake. To determine your account identifier, see [Account identifiers](admin-account-identifier.md).

1. Select the Snowflake icon in the VS Code Activity Bar.
2. In the Account Identifier/URL field, enter the account identifier for your Snowflake account or the URL that you use to connect to Snowflake, and then select Continue.

   The Account Identifier/URL field isn’t available if you’ve previously provided your Snowflake account credentials.
3. Select one of the following options in the Auth Method list:

   * Select Single sign-on to use your SSO credentials to sign in to Snowflake.
   * Select Username/password to use your Snowflake username and password to sign in to Snowflake.
   * Select Key Pair to use your Snowflake username and password to sign in to Snowflake. For more information about key-pair authentication, see [Key-pair authentication and key-pair rotation](key-pair-auth.md).
4. Enter your credentials and then select Sign in.

   When you select SSO, a separate authentication page opens after you enter your username and select Sign in with single sign-on. Enter your SSO credentials and then return to VS Code to complete the Snowflake sign in.

   After you successfully sign in, the sidebar displays your account information, your default role, the OBJECT EXPLORER with a **Databases** list, and your QUERY HISTORY.

## Edit the Snowflake `connections.toml` file

You can add and modify connection definitions in the Snowflake `connections.toml` configuration file. A connection definition is a collection of connection-related parameters.

To connect to Snowflake with a TOML file, see [Connecting using the connections.toml file](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect.md). To learn more about managing connections with a TOML file, see [Managing Snowflake connections](../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/connecting/configure-connections.md).

1. In VS Code, open the Snowflake VS Code extension and sign in to Snowflake.
2. In the ACCOUNT pane, select Snowflake:Edit Connections File .
3. Edit the TOML file.
4. Select Save, and then close the TOML file.

## The VS Code extension interface

The following table provides descriptions of the VS Code extension interface functional areas.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The sidebar pane contains the *Account*, *Native App*, *Object Explorer*, and *Query History* panes. Use this pane to specify account details, examine database objects, and examine query results. |
| 2 | Use the Snowflake Native App pane to create and manage a Snowflake Native App. |
| 3 | The Query History pane shows recent queries. |
| 4 | The current session information, including the current role, database, schema, and active warehouse. |
| 5 | Snowflake SQL pane. Displays Snowflake SQL files. |
| 6 | The Query Results pane shows query results. Select a query to display its execution result. |

## Use the VS Code extension with SnowSQL configuration files

The Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code can use [Snow SQL configuration files](snowsql-config.md)
for loading connection configurations.

> **Note:**
>
> Only connection configuration values are used. Other SnowSQL configuration values are ignored.

1. In the VS Code search field, enter `>user settings` and then select Preferences: Open User Settings.
2. On the User tab, expand Extensions.
3. Scroll down and select Snowflake.
4. In the right pane, scroll down to Snowsql Config Path.
5. Enter a path to a valid SnowSQL configuration file.

   All connections defined in the configuration display in the **Account** pane.

## Work with SQL files

You can use the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code to create and load SQL files.
SQL files are text files that contain one or more SQL statements.

### Open or create SQL files

1. In VS Code, select File > Open, browse to the location of a SQL file, and then open it.

   To create a new SQL file, select File > New File and
   create a file of type Snowflake SQL File.
2. Add one or more Snowflake SQL statements to the file.
3. Optional. Select Snowflake: Execute All Statements () to execute a command.

### Execute commands or queries

> **Important:**
>
> To display Snowflake query results, the VS Code extension automatically runs `DESC RESULT '<query_id>'` in the background after every query. This process makes `LAST_QUERY_ID()` inaccurate. For more information about the DESCRIBE RESULT command and its parameters, see [DESCRIBE RESULT](../sql-reference/sql/desc-result.md).

In VS Code, select one of the following options:

* To execute all SQL statements in a file, select Snowflake: Execute All Statements ().
* To execute a specific command, place your cursor on the statement you want to run and then select Execute.
* To execute multiple commands, select the statements you want to run and then select Execute. The commands execute in order from top to bottom.

To use keyboard shortcuts to execute statements, select the SQL statements you want to run, press  + [enter] on a Mac keyboard, or  + [enter] on a Windows keyboard.

Executed SQL statement results display in the SNOWFLAKE pane.

To cancel in-progress queries, select a query in QUERY HISTORY list and select Cancel query ().

### View query history

1. In VS Code, expand Query History.
2. Select a statement.
3. Review the results in the SNOWFLAKE pane.
4. Optional. Select one of the following:

   * Select Snowflake: Copy to Clipboard () to copy the query text to the clipboard.
   * Select Snowflake: Remove Query () to delete a query.

### Work with query results

You can sort, reorder, hide, freeze, or save query results to disk.

1. In QUERY HISTORY, select a query.
2. In the SNOWFLAKE pane, choose a column.
3. Select the expander arrow (↓) and then one of: Sort Ascending, Sort Descending,
   Hide column “column name”, or Freeze columns up to “column name”.

   If a column was previously hidden, choose any other column and select Unhide N columns.
4. Optional. Select one of the following:

   * Select Cloud () to save the results as a compressed gzip file.
   * Select Save () to save the results as a comma-separated (CSV) file.

## Work with Snowpark Python code

You can use the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code to create, load, and execute SQL files.

### Debug Snowpark Python functions

1. Write a Snowflake stored procedure in a Python function where the first parameter is a Snowpark `Session` object.
2. An inline Snowflake: Debug option appears above the function name. Choose this option to run the stored procedure in
   the function, using your current active session through the extension. You can also set debug breakpoints.

### Detect SQL statements automatically

To set up automatic SQL syntax highlighting, enable the extension setting
Auto Detect Sql in Python. The extension automatically detects SQL statements by looking for a SQL keyword in all capital letters as
the first word in a Python string, as shown in the following image.

### Denote SQL statements manually

1. Optional. Disable the extension setting Auto Detect Sql in Python.
2. Use comments to denote the start and end of a SQL statement. You can use any combination of the following markers:

   * Start markers: `-–startsql`, `-–beginsql`, `-–start-sql`, `-–begin-sql`
   * End markers: `–-endsql`, `–-end-sql`

   The following image shows how the `--begin-sql` and `--end-sql` markers manually denote a SQL statement.

### Use SQL autocomplete in Python strings

1. In a Python file, create a Python string while connected to an active Snowflake session with the VS Code extension.
2. Write a SQL statement. The autocomplete suggestions appear.

   For example, when you start writing a statement such as `SELECT * FROM db1.public`, the extension automatically suggests table names.

   Similarly, when you start filling out columns inside a SELECT statement that references a table, the extension automatically suggests column
   names, as shown in the following image.

### Jinja template syntax highlighting

By default, the VS Code extension adds basic syntax highlighting and bracket autocomplete for writing
[Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) in Snowflake SQL, as shown in the following image.

## Work with the Snowflake Native App Framework

[Preview Feature](../release-notes/preview-features.md) — Open
