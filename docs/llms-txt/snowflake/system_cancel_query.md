# SYSTEM$CANCEL_QUERY

Cancels the specified query (or statement) if it is currently active/running.

See also:
:   [SYSTEM$CANCEL_ALL_QUERIES](system_cancel_all_queries.md)

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
SYSTEM$CANCEL_QUERY( <query_id> )
```

## Arguments

`query_id`
:   Identifier for the query to cancel. To obtain the ID for a query executed within the last 14 days, log into the web interface and go to the History  page.

## Usage notes

* A user can cancel their own running SQL operations using this SQL function. Canceling running operations executed by another user
  requires a role with one of the following privileges:

  * OWNERSHIP on the user who executed the operation.
  * OPERATE or OWNERSHIP on the warehouse that is running the operation (if applicable).
  * ACCOUNTADMIN role.
* For a query run by a [task](../../user-guide/tasks-intro.md), canceling running operations requires a role with one of the following privileges:

  * OPERATE or OWNERSHIP on the task that is running the operation.
  * ACCOUNTADMIN role.
* Snowflake query IDs are UUID text strings with hyphens, which are special characters, so the strings must be escaped by using single quotes.
* This function is not intended for canceling queries for a particular warehouse or user. Instead, use:

  > * [ALTER WAREHOUSE … ABORT ALL QUERIES](../sql/alter-warehouse.md)
  > * [ALTER USER … ABORT ALL QUERIES](../sql/alter-user.md)

## Examples

SELECT SYSTEM$CANCEL_QUERY('d5493e36-5e38-48c9-a47c-c476f2111ce5');
