# StandardJsonSchemaRegistry

## Description

Provides a service for registering and accessing JSON schemas. One can register a schema as a dynamic property where ‘name’ represents the schema name and ‘value’ represents the textual representation of the actual schema following the syntax and semantics of the JSON Schema format. Empty schemas and schemas only consisting of whitespace are not acceptable schemas. The registry is heterogeneous registry as it can store schemas of different schema draft versions. By default the registry is configured to store schemas of Draft 2020-12. When a schema is added, the version which is currently is set, is what the schema is saved as.
