# DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY

This table function returns information about each refresh (completed and running) of [dynamic tables](../../user-guide/dynamic-tables-about.md).

This table function returns all refreshes that are in progress as well as all refreshes that have a DATA_TIMESTAMP within 7 days
of the current time.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY(
  [ DATA_TIMESTAMP_START => <constant_expr> ]
  [ , DATA_TIMESTAMP_END => <constant_expr> ]
  [ , RESULT_LIMIT => <integer> ]
  [ , NAME => '<string>' ]
  [ , NAME_PREFIX => '<string>' ]
  [ , ERROR_ONLY => { TRUE | FALSE } ]
)
```

## Arguments

All the arguments are optional.
If no arguments are provided, 100 refreshes from all dynamic tables in the account will be returned.

`DATA_TIMESTAMP_START => constant_expr` , . `DATA_TIMESTAMP_END => constant_expr`
:   Time range (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format) during which the refreshes occurred.

    * If neither a start version nor an end version is specified, the default range will be the past day.
    * If an end version is not specified, [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP](current_timestamp.md) is used as the end of the range.
    * If a start version is not specified, the range starts 1 day prior to the start of DATE_TIMESTAMP_END.

`RESULT_LIMIT => integer`
:   A number specifying the maximum number of rows returned by the function. If the number of matching rows is greater than
    this limit, the refreshes that finished most recently (and those that are still running) are returned, up to the specified
    limit.

    To apply a filter on the results, also specify a large enough RESULT_LIMIT limit value for the filter to be applied on all
    dynamic tables.

    Range: `1` to `10000`

    Default: `100`.

`NAME => string`
:   The name of a dynamic table.

    Names must be single-quoted and are case insensitive.

    You can specify the unqualified name (`dynamic_table_name`),
    the partially qualified name (`schema_name.dynamic_table_name`),
    or the fully qualified name (`database_name.schema_name.dynamic_table_name`).

    For more information on object name resolution, refer to [Object name resolution](../name-resolution.md).

    The function returns the refreshes for this table.

`NAME_PREFIX => string`
:   A prefix for dynamic tables.

    Name prefixes must be single-quoted and are case insensitive.

    The function returns refreshes for tables with names that start with this prefix.

    You can use this argument to return the refreshes for dynamic tables in a specific database or schema.

`ERROR_ONLY => TRUE | FALSE`
:   When set to TRUE, this function returns only refreshes that failed or were cancelled.

## Output

The function returns the following columns.

To view these columns, you must use a role with the MONITOR privilege. For more information, see
[Privileges to view a dynamic table’s metadata](../../user-guide/dynamic-tables-privileges.md).

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NAME | TEXT | Name of the dynamic table. |
| SCHEMA_NAME | TEXT | Name of the schema that contains the dynamic table. |
| DATABASE_NAME | TEXT | Name of the database that contains the dynamic table. |
| STATE | TEXT | Status of the refresh for the dynamic table. The status can be one of the following:   *SCHEDULED: refresh scheduled, but not yet executed.* EXECUTING: refresh in progress. *SUCCEEDED: refresh completed successfully.* FAILED: refresh failed during execution. *CANCELLED: refresh was canceled before execution.* UPSTREAM_FAILED: refresh not performed due to an upstream failed refresh. |
| STATE_CODE | TEXT | Code representing the current state of the refresh. |
| STATE_MESSAGE | TEXT | Description of the current state of the refresh. |
| QUERY_ID | TEXT | ID of the SQL statement that produced the results for the dynamic table. |
| DATA_TIMESTAMP | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Transactional timestamp when the refresh was evaluated. (This might be slightly before the actual time of the refresh.) All data, in base objects, that arrived before this timestamp is currently included in the dynamic table. |
| REFRESH_START_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Time when the refresh job started. |
| REFRESH_END_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Time when the refresh completed. |
| COMPLETION_TARGET | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Time by which this refresh should complete to keep lag under the TARGET_LAG parameter for the dynamic table. This is equal to the DATA_TIMESTAMP of the last refresh + TARGET_LAG. |
| QUALIFIED_NAME | TEXT | Fully qualified name of the dynamic table as it appears in the graph of dynamic tables. You can use this to join the output with the output of the [DYNAMIC_TABLE_GRAPH_HISTORY](dynamic_table_graph_history.md) function. |
| LAST_COMPLETED_DEPENDENCY | OBJECT | Contains the following properties:   *`qualified_name`: The qualified name of the latest dependency to become available.* `data_timestamp`: The refresh version of that dependency. |
| STATISTICS | OBJECT | Contains the following properties:   *`numInsertedRows`: The number of inserted rows.* `numDeletedRows`: The number of rows that were deleted. *`numCopiedRows`: The number of rows that were copied unchanged.* `numAddedPartitions`: The number of added partitions. * `numRemovedPartitions` : The number of removed partitions.  For example:   If an UPDATE statement updates 1 row in a partition with 10 rows. Then the metrics above show 1 row inserted,   1 deleted, and 9 copied. Additionally, 1 partition is removed and 1 partition added. |
| REFRESH_ACTION | TEXT | One of:   *NO_DATA - no new data in base tables. Doesn’t apply to the initial refresh of newly created dynamic tables regardless of whether or not the base tables have data.* REINITIALIZE - base table changed or source table of a cloned dynamic table was refreshed during clone. *FULL - Full refresh, because dynamic table contains query elements that are not incrementalizable (see SHOW DYNAMIC TABLE refresh_mode_reason) or because full refresh was cheaper than incremental refresh.* INCREMENTAL - normal incremental refresh. |
| REFRESH_TRIGGER | TEXT | One of:   *SCHEDULED - normal background refresh to meet target lag or downstream target lag.* MANUAL - user/task used ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE <name> REFRESH * CREATION - refresh performed during the creation DDL statement, triggered by the creation of the dynamic table or any consumer dynamic tables. |
| TARGET_LAG_SEC | NUMBER | Describes the target lag value for the dynamic tables at the time the refresh occurred. |
| GRAPH_HISTORY_VALID_FROM | TIMESTAMP_NTZ | Encodes the VALID_FROM timestamp of the DYNAMIC_TABLE_GRAPH_HISTORY table function when the refresh occurred to clarify which version of a dynamic table a specific refresh corresponds to. This value can also be NULL if the corresponding dynamic table hasn’t been created. |

## Usage notes

* When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see
  [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).

## Examples

Retrieve the refreshes that failed or were canceled:

> ```sqlexample
> SELECT
>   name,
>   state,
>   state_code,
>   state_message,
>   query_id,
>   data_timestamp,
>   refresh_start_time,
>   refresh_end_time
> FROM
>   TABLE (
>     INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY (
>       NAME_PREFIX => 'MYDB.MYSCHEMA.', ERROR_ONLY => TRUE
>     )
>   )
> ORDER BY
>   name,
>   data_timestamp;
> ```
