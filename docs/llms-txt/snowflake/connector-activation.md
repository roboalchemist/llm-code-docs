8. Select Save.

> Here are the steps the provider (publisher) and consumer (advertiser) must take to activate the results of a the consumer’s analysis
> to the provider’s Display & Video 360-PAIR account.
>
> **General guidelines**

+ When using Google Display & Video 360-PAIR, the publisher is the provider, and the advertiser is the consumer.
+ The only template supported for this connector is Audience Overlap & Segmentation. Both provider and consumer join a
  single table on a PAIR version of a hashed email or phone.
+ Both provider and consumer tables must include email or phone data hashed according to [Google’s PAIR requirements](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/15067908).
+ If 4 million or more distinct rows are linked to the clean room, we recommend using the largest warehouse size (4XL).
+ Do not exceed 100 million unique rows in a dataset in a PAIR clean room for analysis and activation.
+ When you add Google Display & Video 360-PAIR connector to a clean room, the room allows no other activation connectors.
  The only identity connector allowed in the clean room is Google DV360 - PAIR.
+ This connector does not support provider-run analysis or activation.

  **Overview**

  Here is a brief overview of how to use this connector:

  1. The provider creates a clean room that uses the PAIR Display & Video 360 Identity activation and identity connectors, and
     links in a table that contains a hashed email or phone column.
  2. The provider uses the identity connector to generate a PAIR ID column based on the hashed email or hashed phone column in their
     table.
  3. The provider specifies the generated PAIR column as the join column.
  4. The provider specifies the Audience Overlap & Segmentation template (the only one allowed for Display & Video 360-PAIR),
     configures the template, shares, and publishes the clean room.
  5. The consumer joins the clean room, specifies tables, selects the PAIR Display & Video 360 Identity connector and generates
     a PAIR column from their hashed email or phone column.
  6. The consumer joins their PAIR column on the provider’s PAIR column, runs the analysis, and activates the results (the PAIR ID
     column) to Google.
  7. The provider downloads a mapping table that correlates each hashed email or phone values with its equivalent PAIR value. The
     provider sends this table to the Ad Server or the Sell-Side Platform (SSP) to match the PAIR values that the consumer activates to
     Display & Video 360.

  For details, read the Provider or Consumer section below.

  ProviderConsumer

  The provider takes the following steps to use Display & Video 360-PAIR in a clean room:

  1. Configure your Display & Video 360 account to link to Snowflake Data Clean Rooms. For instructions, see
     [Google’s documentation](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/9649053).
  2. Install and configure the Google Display & Video 360-PAIR connector as described in the Configuration guide
     tab.
  3. Create a clean room that encrypts identifying columns with Google PAIR, then share the clean room with the consumer
     (*described below*).
  4. Provide a mapping table of corresponding original and PAIR versions of the join column in the bid request sent to your SSP
     (*described below*).

  **Create and share a clean room**

  > 1. [Sign in to the clean room UI](web-app-introduction.md) and create a new clean room.
  > 2. In the Add Data step, select the tables to share with the consumer. Your tables must have email and/or phone number
  >    columns hashed according to Google’s requirements.
  > 3. In the Specify Join Policies step, set the following values:
  >
  >    1. Expand Identity Hub and select PAIR Display & Video 360.
  >    2. In the PAIR Join Columns section, select your hashed email or phone column. The connector generates a
  >       PAIR version of this column with `_PAIR` appended to the original column name:
  >
  >       1. Select Generate Preview to see the new column.
  >       2. Select Add Identity to add the new column to your dataset.
  >    3. In the Join Policies section, select the generated `_PAIR` column. Don’t join on any other columns.
  > 4. In the Configure Analysis & Query section, configure the Audience Overlap & Segmentation template.
  >
  >    + Choose the table containing the hashed email or phone.
  >    + Set any Segmentation & Attribute Columns values you want.
  >    + Under Privacy Settings, keep the Threshold Value at or above 1,000, as required by Google.
  > 5. In the Share Clean Room section, select the consumer as a collaborator and then select Finish to publish and share
  >    your clean room.
  > 6. Retrieve your PAIR ID mapping table as described below. This table was generated in your Snowflake account, and you just
  >    need to know the fully qualified name of this translation table to either download it or [bulk export it](../data-unload-overview.md). Send
  >    this table with your bid request to your SSP or your ad server.

  **Prepare and send a bid request**

  Send your exported translation table of corresponding original and encrypted hashed email or phone PAIR columns to your SSP. Your SSP uses
  this data to find the corresponding hashed value for the encrypted values sent by the consumer. Best practice is to use a
  URL-safe format such as Base64 encoding when providing these IDs in your bid request.

  The fully-scoped table name has this format:

  ```sqlsyntax
  SAMOOHA_CLEANROOM_<cleanroom ID>.SHARED_SCHEMA.PROVIDER_<source database>__<source schema>__<source table>_PAIR<digit>
  ```

  `cleanroom ID`
  :   This is the clean room ID, *not* the clean room name. You can find the clean room ID for a given clean
      room name by making the following call:

      ```sqlexample
      CALL samooha_by_snowflake_local_db.provider.view_cleanrooms();
      ```

  `source database`, `source schema`, `source table`
  :   The database, schema, and name of the source table linked into the clean room used in the template. Note the separation by
      single or double underscores as shown, not by dots.

  `PAIRdigit`
  :   A single digit, usually either 0 or 1.

  Here is an example fully-scoped table name:

  ```sqlexample
  SAMOOHA_CLEANROOM_MY_CLEANROOM.SHARED_SCHEMA.PROVIDER_SAMPLE_DATABASE__AUDIENCE_OVERLAP__CUSTOMERS_PAIR0
  ```

  Query the table as shown below, or use [bulk export](../data-unload-overview.md) to download the data as a flat
  text file to a stage or your computer.

  ```sqlexample
  SELECT * FROM SAMOOHA_CLEANROOM_MY_CLEANROOM.SHARED_SCHEMA.PROVIDER_SAMPLE_DATABASE__AUDIENCE_OVERLAP__CUSTOMERS_PAIR0;
  ```

  The consumer takes the following steps to activate PAIR overlap data to Google:

  1. Configure your Display & Video 360 account to link to Snowflake Data Clean Rooms. For instructions, see
     [Google’s documentation](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/9649053).
  2. Install and configure the Google Display & Video 360-PAIR connector as described in the Configuration guide
     tab.
  3. Install the clean room so it is PAIR-enabled (*described below*).
  4. Activate the results of your analysis to your Display & Video 360 account (*described below*).

  **Join and configure the clean room**

  1. [Sign in to the clean room UI](https://cleanroom.c1.us-east-1.aws.app.snowflake.com/) and join the appropriate clean room.
  2. In the Add Data section, select the tables that you want to include in the clean room. Your tables must have email and/or
     phone number columns hashed according to Google’s requirements.
  3. In the Specify Join Policies step, set the following values:

     1. In the PAIR Join Columns section, select your hashed email or phone column. The connector generates a PAIR
        version of this column with _PAIR appended to the original column name:

        1. Select Generate Preview to see the new columns.
        2. Select Add Identity to add these new columns to your schema. If you repeat this step, it will generate additional identical columns.
     2. In the Join Policies section, match your `_PAIR` columns to the corresponding `_PAIR` columns of the provider,
        and then define any additional join policies.
  4. In the Configure Analysis & Query section, configure the Audience Overlap & Segmentation template.

     + Set the Tables values to your table.
     + Set any Segmentation & Attribute Columns values you want.
  5. Select Finish and run your analysis, as described next.

  **Run the analysis and activate results**

  1. Run the clean room in your Joined tab.
  2. Run the Audience Overlap & Segmentation analysis, filling in any
     information you need for the analysis. Join on the _PAIR column that you generated.
