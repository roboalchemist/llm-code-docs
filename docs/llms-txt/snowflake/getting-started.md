# Getting started with Snowflake Intelligence

This topic provides information about getting started with Snowflake Intelligence with a simple example of creating an enterprise agent. This agent can be used with Snowflake Intelligence to respond to questions by reasoning over both structured and unstructured data. For a more detailed guide, see [Getting Started with Snowflake Intelligence](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/getting-started-with-snowflake-intelligence/).

## Prerequisites

* [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* A Snowflake account
* Access to the ACCOUNTADMIN role

## Create a database, schema, and tables and load data from AWS S3

To create the building blocks for the enterprise agent, you must create a database, schema, tables, and load data from AWS S3.

1. Clone the [Getting Started with Snowflake Intelligence GitHub repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-snowflake-intelligence/) to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-snowflake-intelligence.git
   ```

2. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../ui-snowsight-gs.md).
3. In the navigation menu, select Projects » Workspaces.
4. Select + Add new.
5. Select SQL File.
6. Enter a name for the file.
7. Open the file.
8. Copy the contents of the [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-getting-started-with-snowflake-intelligence/blob/main/setup.sql) file to the workspace.
9. Run all statements in order.
10. Run the following SQL statements in the workspace:

    ```sqlexample
    USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
    CREATE SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_OBJECT_DEFAULT;
    GRANT USAGE ON SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_OBJECT_DEFAULT TO ROLE snowflake_intelligence_admin;
    GRANT CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW ON SCHEMA DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
    ```

11. Optionally, run the following SQL statement to enable cross-region inference:

    ```sqlexample
    ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION = 'ANY_REGION';
    ```

12. Switch the user role in Snowsight to SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_ADMIN.

## Create tools for the agent to use

Create the tools that the agent will use.

**Create a semantic view for use with Cortex Analyst.**

1. In the navigation menu, select AI & ML » Cortex Analyst.
2. Select Create new, then select Create new Semantic View.
3. For the location to store the semantic view, select DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL.
4. For the name, enter `SALES_AND_MARKETING_DATA`.
5. For the description, enter `Semantic view for sales and marketing data analysis across campaigns, products, transactions, and social media engagement.`.
6. Select Next.
7. Select Skip.
8. Select the DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL schema.
9. For the tables, select the MARKETING_CAMPAIGN_METRICS, PRODUCTS, SALES, and SOCIAL_MEDIA tables.
10. Select Next.
11. For the columns, select all available columns for the selected tables.
12. Select Next.
13. Review and accept all of the relationship and metric suggestions.
14. Select Save.
15. Wait for the semantic view to be created.

**Create a Cortex search tool by creating a search service.**

1. In the navigation menu, select AI & ML » Cortex Search.
2. Select Create.
3. For Service database and schema, select **DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL**.
4. For Service name, enter **Support_Cases**, and then select Next.
5. In the list of data sources, select the SUPPORT_CASES table, and then select Next.
6. In the list of search columns, select **TRANSCRIPT**, and then select Next.
7. For the attribute columns, select **TITLE** and **PRODUCT**, and then select Next.
8. For the columns to include, select Select all, and then select Next.
9. For the warehouse, select **DASH_WH_SI** (if that warehouse is not available, select **COMPUTE_WH**), and then select Create.

## Create a Cortex Agent

To create the agent that will use the tools, follow these steps:

1. In the navigation menu, select AI & ML » Agents.
2. Select Create agent.
3. For the schema, use SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS.
4. For the agent object name, use `Sales_AI`.
5. For the display name, use `Sales AI`.
6. Select Create agent.

## Add the tools to the agent

**Add the Cortex Analyst tool to the agent.**

1. From the agent page, select the Tools tab.
2. Navigate to the Cortex Analyst entry.
3. Select + Add, then select Semantic view.
4. For the database and schema, select DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL.
5. For the semantic view, select `SALES_AND_MARKETING_DATA`.
6. For the name, use `SALES_AND_MARKETING_DATA`.
7. For the description, use the following:

   > ```text
   > The Sales and Marketing Data semantic view in DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL schema provides a complete view of retail business performance by connecting marketing campaigns, product information, sales data, and social media engagement. The view enables tracking of marketing campaign effectiveness through clicks and impressions, while linking to actual sales performance across different regions. Social media engagement is monitored through influencer activities and mentions, with all data connected through product categories and IDs. The temporal alignment across tables allows for comprehensive analysis of marketing impact on sales performance and social media engagement over time.
   > ```
>
8. For the warehouse, select Custom, then select DASH_WH_SI.
9. For the query timeout, use `60`.
10. Select Add.

**Add the Cortex Search tool to the agent.**

1. Navigate to the Cortex Search Services entry.
2. Select + Add.
3. For the database and schema, select DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL.
4. For the search service, select `DASH_DB_SI.RETAIL.Support_Cases`.
5. For the ID column, use `ID`.
6. For the title column, use `TITLE`.
7. For the name, use `Support_Cases`.
8. Select Add.

10. Add the following orchestration instructions:

    ```text
    Whenever you can answer visually with a chart, always choose to generate a chart even if the user didn't specify to.
    ```

11. Select Save.

## Use Snowflake Intelligence

Interact with the agent from Snowflake Intelligence.

1. Navigate to Snowflake Intelligence using one of the methods described in [Access the agent](deploy-agents.md).
2. Select the newly created agent.
3. Enter the following prompts:

   > * “What issues are reported with jackets recently in customer support tickets?”
   > * “Show me the trend of sales by product category between June and August.”
   > * “Why did sales of Fitness Wear grow so much in July?”
