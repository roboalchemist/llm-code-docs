# STAGE_DIRECTORY_FILE_REGISTRATION_HISTORY

This table function can be used to query information about the metadata history for a directory table, including:

* Files added or removed automatically as part of a metadata refresh.
* Any errors found when refreshing the metadata.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
STAGE_DIRECTORY_FILE_REGISTRATION_HISTORY (
      STAGE_NAME => '<string>'
      [, START_TIME => <constant_expr> ] )
```

## Arguments

**Required:**

`STAGE_NAME => 'string'`
:   A string specifying the name of a stage that has a directory table.

**Optional:**

`START_TIME => constant_expr`
:   Timestamp (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format), within the last 14 days, marking the start of the time range for retrieving metadata update events.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > * If no start time is specified, the function returns all update events within the last 14 days.
    > * If the start time falls outside the last 14 days, the function returns empty results.

## Usage notes

* Returns results for the stage owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the stage), or a higher role,
  or a role that has the USAGE privilege on the database and schema that contain a stage with a directory
  table and any privilege on the stage.
* The table function cannot retrieve metadata about staged data files until the directory table is refreshed
  (i.e. synched) to include the data files in its metadata.
* When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in
  use or the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).

## Output

The function returns the following columns:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JOB_CREATED_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Timestamp when the operation occurred. |
| FILE_NAME | TEXT | Name of the staged source file and relative path to the file. |
| OPERATION_STATUS | TEXT | Status: REGISTERED_NEW, REGISTERED_UPDATE, REGISTER_SKIPPED, REGISTER_FAILED, UNREGISTERED, or UNREGISTER_FAILED. |
| MESSAGE | TEXT | Message accompanying the operation status. |
| FILE_SIZE | NUMBER | Size of the file (in bytes) added to the directory table. |
| LAST_MODIFIED | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Timestamp when the file was last updated in the stage. |

## Examples

Retrieve the metadata stored for all data files referenced by the `mystage` stage:

> ```sqlexample
> SELECT *
>   FROM TABLE(information_schema.stage_directory_file_registration_history(
>   STAGE_NAME=>'MYSTAGE'));
> ```

Retrieve the registration events for the directory table on the `mydb.public.mystage` stage that started within the last hour:

> ```sqlexample
> SELECT *
>   FROM TABLE(information_schema.stage_directory_file_registration_history(
>     START_TIME=>DATEADD('hour',-1,current_timestamp()),
>     STAGE_NAME=>'mydb.public.mystage'));
> ```
