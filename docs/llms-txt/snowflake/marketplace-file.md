# Specify the resources required by an app

This topic describes how to use the `marketplace.yml` file to declare the resource
requirements for an Snowflake Native App.

The `marketplace.yml` is a configuration file similar to the manifest file of an app. Snowflake uses this file in the following contexts:

* The objects specified in `required_compute_pools` and `connections` properties
  appear in the listing in Snowsight. This allows the consumer to see the resources the app
  may require.
* This file can help avoid creating or using unnecessary resources, for example replicating an application
  package to a regions where it cannot be installed by a consumer. Before consumer requests the listing in a
  remote region, Snowflake ensures that the consumer meets the resource requirements declared in the
  `marketplace.yml` file. This helps prevent unnecessary replication costs.
* Before installing and upgrading the application, Snowsight ensures the requirements are satisfied,
  to prevent installing a broken/unusable application or upgrading a working application into a unusable state.

This optional file must be at the root directory of an app at the same level as the manifest file. If this file is not present, no action is taken.

## Specify the compute pools required by an app

The following example shows how to specify the compute pool resources required for a
specific version of an app:

```yaml
required_compute_pools:
  - HIGH_MEM_POOL_1:
      label: "High memory pool"
      description: "A compute pool for computational tasks."
      compatible_instance_families:
        - HIGHMEM_X64_M
        - HIGHMEM_X64_L
```

In this example, the `required_compute_pools` a compute pool named `HIGH_MEM_POOL_1`.

The `compatible_instance_families` property specifies the type of machine to provision
for the compute pool. You must specify at least one value declared for each compute pool.
See [CREATE COMPUTE POOL](../../sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool.md) for more information.

> **Note:**
>
> If the `compatible_instance_families` property is missing or the values are invalid,
> version creation fails.

## Specify the external endpoints required by an app

The following example shows how to declare the external endpoints required by an app:

```yaml
connections:
  - LAUNCH_DARKLY:
     label: "Launch Darkly"
     description: "Feature flag and configuration"
     required: true
     endpoints:
       - "mobile.launchdarkly.com"
       - "stream.launchdarkly.com"
  - OPEN_AI:
     label: "OpenAPI"
     description: "LLM Connection"
     required: false
     endpoints:
       - "openai.com"
```

In this example, the `connection` property specifies two external endpoints,
`LAUNCH_DARKLY` and `OPEN_AI`. The `required` property indicates to the
consumer in Snowsight that the connection is required.

If you specify the `connection` in this file, the `endpoints`, and `required` properties are
required. If these properties are not present, version creation fails. The `endpoints` property
requires at least one URL.
