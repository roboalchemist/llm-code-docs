# Metadata and retention for Apache Iceberg™ tables

Snowflake handles metadata for Apache Iceberg™ tables according to the type of catalog you use (Snowflake or external).

> **Note:**
>
> Specifying the default minimum number of snapshots with the `history.expire.min-snapshots-to-keep`
> [table property](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.2.1/configuration/#table-behavior-properties) is not supported
> for any type of Iceberg table.

## Tables that use Snowflake as the catalog

Snowflake manages the metadata life cycle for this table type,
and deletes old metadata, manifest lists, and manifest files based on the retention period for the table data and snapshots.

To set the retention period for table data and snapshots, set the [DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS](../sql-reference/parameters.md) parameter
at the account, database, schema, or table level.

### Creation

Snowflake generates metadata for version 2 of the Apache Iceberg specification
on a periodic basis, and writes the metadata to files on your external volume.
Each new metadata file contains all DML or DDL changes since the last Snowflake-generated metadata file was created.

You can also create metadata on demand by using the [SYSTEM$GET_ICEBERG_TABLE_INFORMATION](../sql-reference/functions/system_get_iceberg_table_information.md) function.
For instructions, see [Generate snapshots of DML changes](tables-iceberg-manage.md).

For information about locating metadata files, see [Data and metadata directories](tables-iceberg-storage.md).

### Viewing metadata creation history

To access a full history of metadata generation attempts, view the query history for your account and filter the results. Search for the
[SYSTEM$GET_ICEBERG_TABLE_INFORMATION](../sql-reference/functions/system_get_iceberg_table_information.md) function name in the SQL text.

Snowflake internally uses the same SYSTEM$GET_ICEBERG_TABLE_INFORMATION function to generate table metadata. Attempts made by Snowflake
appear under the user called `SYSTEM` in the query history. The `STATUS` column in the query history
indicates whether metadata was successfully generated.

For viewing options, see [Monitor query activity with Query History](ui-snowsight-activity.md).

### Deletion

Snowflake deletes Iceberg metadata from your external cloud storage when the following events occur:

* After you drop a table.
* When the Iceberg metadata refers to snapshots or table data that has expired.

Deletion doesn’t occur immediately after the data retention period expires.
As a result, metadata storage might incur costs with your cloud storage provider for longer than a table’s lifetime.

> **Warning:**
>
> Snowflake does not support [Fail-safe](data-failsafe.md) for Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables,
> because the table data is in external cloud storage that you manage.
> To protect Iceberg table data, you need to configure data protection and recovery with your cloud provider.

#### After dropping a table

When you drop a table, you can use the [UNDROP ICEBERG TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/undrop-iceberg-table.md) command
to restore it within the data retention period.

When the retention period expires, Snowflake deletes table metadata and snapshots that it
has written from your external volume location. Deletion occurs asynchronously and can take a few
days to complete after the retention period has passed.

> **Note:**
>
> For [converted tables](tables-iceberg-conversion.md),
> Snowflake deletes only metadata that was generated *after* table conversion.

#### After snapshots expire

Snowflake deletes Iceberg metadata files related to expired snapshots after the data retention period passes.
Deletion usually occurs 7-14 days after a snapshot expires.

Only previous table snapshots can expire. Snowflake never deletes metadata files that represent the latest (current) state of a table from
your external cloud storage.

## Tables that use an external catalog

For tables that use an external catalog, Snowflake uses the value of the [DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS](../sql-reference/parameters.md)
parameter to set a retention period for Snowflake Time Travel and undropping the table. When the retention period expires,
Snowflake does not delete the Iceberg metadata or snapshots from your external cloud storage.

Snowflake sets DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS at the table level to the smaller of
the following values:

* The `history.expire.max-snapshot-age-ms` value in the current metadata file. Snowflake converts the value to days (rounding down).
* The following value, depending on your [Snowflake account edition](intro-editions.md):

  * Standard Edition: 1 day.
  * Enterprise Edition or higher: 5 days.

You can’t manually change the value of DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS in Snowflake. To change the value, you must update
`history.expire.max-snapshot-age-ms` in your metadata file and then [refresh the table](tables-iceberg-manage.md).

You can use the following table functions to retrieve information about the files registered to an externally managed Iceberg table or
the most recent snapshot refresh history:

* [ICEBERG_TABLE_FILES](../sql-reference/functions/iceberg_table_files.md)
* [ICEBERG_TABLE_SNAPSHOT_REFRESH_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/iceberg_table_snapshot_refresh_history.md)

### Delta-based tables

> **Note:**
>
> If you want to use metadata writes for Delta-based Iceberg tables, the
> [2025_01 behavior change bundle](../release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_01_bundle.md) must not be disabled in your account.

For Iceberg tables created from Delta table files, Snowflake automatically writes Iceberg metadata to your external storage if you
configure your external volume with write access (see [ALLOW_WRITES](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-volume.md)).
For more information about the write location, see [Data and metadata directories](tables-iceberg-storage.md).

To prevent Snowflake from writing Iceberg metadata, you can set the ALLOW_WRITES parameter to FALSE on your
external volume as long as no Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables use the same external volume.

## Iceberg partitioning

This section describes Iceberg partitioning.

Snowflake supports the following partitioning use cases:

* Reading from and writing to partitioned Iceberg tables.
* Creating partitioned Iceberg tables
  that are Snowflake-managed or externally managed in a [catalog-linked database](tables-iceberg-catalog-linked-database.md)
  or [externally managed by an Iceberg REST catalog](tables-iceberg-externally-managed-writes.md).

  When you create a partitioned Iceberg table, you can enable hidden partitioning or
  partitioning with hierarchical paths, which is also called “Hive-style”
  partitioning.

### “Hidden” partitioning

[“Hidden” partitioning](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/partitioning/#icebergs-hidden-partitioning)
for Apache Iceberg™ is metadata-based and adaptable. Iceberg produces partition values
based on transforms that you define when you create a table. When they read from a partitioned table, Iceberg engines
use the partition values defined in your table metadata to efficiently identify relevant data.

This option is the default. With this option, Snowflake stores your Parquet data files by using a flat directory layout.

To create a partitioned Iceberg table that uses hidden partitioning, include the PARTITION BY clause with one or more [partition transforms](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partition-transforms)
in your regular [CREATE ICEBERG TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table.md) statement.

> **Note:**
>
> To create a partitioned Iceberg table that uses hidden partitioning, the PATH_LAYOUT parameter must be set to FLAT, which is the
> default, so you don’t need to specify this parameter in your CREATE ICEBERG TABLE statement.

For an example, see [Create an Iceberg table in a catalog-linked database](tables-iceberg-externally-managed-writes.md).

### Partitioning with hierarchical paths

With this option, Snowflake writes data to partitioned Iceberg tables by using a hierarchical path layout
for Parquet data files. Partitioning information is included in the file paths and the values are based on transforms that you define
when you create a table. This layout is also called
“Hive-style” partitioning. You might use this option for interoperability between Snowflake and external engines that support partitioned
writes with hierarchical paths.

Here’s an example of a data file stored under a hierarchical path:

`s3://my-bucket/iceberg/db_sales/orders/data/country=US/year=2025/month=02/day=21/part-00023.parquet`

For more information on the layout of the data and metadata directories for tables that use hierarchical paths,
see [File management](tables-iceberg-storage.md).

#### Create a table with hierarchical paths

To create a partitioned Iceberg table with a hierarchical path layout, set the following properties in your regular [CREATE ICEBERG TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table.md) statement:

* Set PATH_LAYOUT = HIERARCHICAL.
* Include the PARTITION BY clause with one or more [partition transforms](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partition-transforms).

For an example of creating a partitioned Iceberg table with a hierarchical path layout in a catalog-linked database,
see [Create an Iceberg table in a catalog-linked database with hierarchical path layout](tables-iceberg-externally-managed-writes.md).

### Partitioning support matrix

The following table shows which features and actions are supported for each type of partitioned Iceberg table, and indicates compliance with
version 2 of the Apache Iceberg specification. The table shows support for both hidden partitioning and partitioning with hierarchical paths.

> **Note:**
>
> * Support for version 3 of the Apache Iceberg™ specification is in public preview. This public preview includes support for using deletion
>   vectors with partitioned tables. For more information about this public preview, see [Apache Iceberg™ tables: Support for Apache Iceberg™ v3 (Preview)](tables-iceberg-v3-specification-support.md).
> * CLD stands for catalog-linked database.

### Partitioning considerations

Consider the following before you use partitioned writes for Iceberg tables:

* If you use an external engine to add, drop, or replace a partition field in an externally managed table,
  Snowflake writes data according to the latest partition specification.
* The [GET_DDL](../sql-reference/functions/get_ddl.md) function doesn’t include the PARTITION BY clause in its output.
* The sum of the sizes of the outputs for all partition transforms can’t exceed 1024 bytes for a single row.
* Because partition evolution isn’t supported for Snowflake-managed tables, you must drop the table and create a new one with partitioning.
* The DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR() partition transform parameters, which you specify within the PARTITION BY clause under table properties,
  are part of the Iceberg specification. For multiple days, months, or years, the partition expression parameter returns a partition for
  each calendar day, month, or year.
  For example, when the DAY() transform is used on a timestamp column that has 2 months of data, 61 partitions are created.

  In contrast, the [DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR() functions](../sql-reference/functions/year.md)
  in Snowflake are part of the SQL standard. For multiple days, months, or years, these functions extract the corresponding day, month, or
  year part from a date or timestamp. For example, when the DAY() function is used on a timestamp column that has multiple months of data,
  this function returns a day of the month ranging from 1 to 31.
* You can’t use the ALTER ICEBERG TABLE command to modify the PATH_LAYOUT property for an existing table.
* For partitioning with hierarchical paths:

  * For `float` values, Snowflake and external engines might behave differently.
  * Snowflake can’t guarantee that the paths Snowflake writes will match the paths that external query
    engines write.

    Snowflake can’t guarantee this because when a query engine writes a hierarchical path, the query engine must serialize values into a string
    and insert the resulting value into the path.
    The Apache Iceberg table specification doesn’t define a standard serialization method, so different engines might implement different
    methods.

    For example, Snowflake doesn’t encode the `~` character but Apache Spark™ encodes this character as `%7E`.
  * Snowflake always writes the hierarchical paths directly under the `/data` directory in your external cloud storage.

## Time travel

With [Snowflake Time Travel](data-time-travel.md),
you can use Snowflake to query historical data for a table.

You can also use a third-party compute engine to perform time travel
queries on Snowflake-managed tables when you [Sync a Snowflake-managed table with Snowflake Open Catalog](tables-iceberg-open-catalog-sync.md) or
use the [Snowflake Catalog SDK](tables-iceberg-catalog.md).

You can query any snapshots that were committed within the data retention period.
To specify the data retention period, set the [DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS](../sql-reference/parameters.md) object parameter.

When you delete table data or drop a table, Snowflake deletes objects after the table retention period expires.
This might incur costs with your cloud storage provider for longer than the table’s lifetime.
