# Snowflake Postgres instance management

Snowflake Postgres helps you manage your instances through a variety of instance management operations. These operations are forms of
maintenance that keep your instances operational and secure.

**A brief service interruption is required to perform instance management operations.** Please ensure that your applications are able to
automatically reconnect to the database.

> **Note:**
>
> An instance’s connection string will remain the same across instance management operations unless you explicitly rotate the credentials.

When required to ensure the health of your instance, we may schedule maintenance operations on your behalf (for example, to modify
instance storage size).

For a detailed description of how instance maintenance is carried out by our platform, see [Snowflake Postgres Maintenance](postgres-maintenance.md).

## Available operations

The following operations are available from the Manage dropdown menu on your instance details page in the dashboard:

* Fork - Create a new instance from an existing instance
* Modify - Change the instance size, storage size, or Postgres version of the instance
* Enable High Availability - Enable High Availability for the instance
* Create replica - Create a replica of the instance
* Instance Suspend and Resume - Spin down the Postgres server but retain data on disk
* Restarting services - Restart either PostgreSQL or the entire underlying server
* Regenerate credentials - Regenerate the credentials for the instance

### Fork

You can fork an instance to create a new instance from an existing instance, optionally choosing a point in time to fork from. By default
the new instance will be forked from the current state of the source instance. Read more about forking in [Snowflake Postgres point-in-time recovery](postgres-point-in-time-recovery.md).

### Modify

To make a change to an existing Snowflake Postgres instance, you must use a role that has been granted the OWNERSHIP or OPERATE privilege on that instance.

You can resize an instance in-place with minimal impact and no changes to your connection string. During an instance resize, you can:

* Change the [COMPUTE_FAMILY](postgres-instance-sizes.md) to a different size.
* Change the amount of storage. Both increases and decreases in storage size are supported.
* Upgrade the Postgres version to a newer major version.

Modifying your instance’s configuration requires maintenance. See [Snowflake Postgres Maintenance](postgres-maintenance.md) for more information.

To make a change:

SnowsightSQL

1. In the navigation menu, select Postgres.
2. Select your instance.
3. In the Manage menu at the top right, select Modify.
4. Select the new COMPUTE_FAMILY and/or storage size from the dropdown menus. See Postgres major version upgrades for more
   information about changing the Postgres version.
5. Select the Save button to confirm the changes.

> Run the [ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-postgres-instance.md) command to make changes to the configuration of a Snowflake Postgres instance.
>
> > **Note:**
> >
> > The changes to the instance are applied as an asynchronous operation.

**Modifying a Postgres instance examples**

Change an existing instance’s COMPUTE_FAMILY to STANDARD_M and storage size to 100GB in a single operation:

```sqlexample
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE my_instance
  SET COMPUTE_FAMILY = 'STANDARD_M'
      STORAGE_SIZE_GB = 100;
```

If you plan to decrease the storage size of your instance, please note that we currently allow the resize to be greater than or equal to 1.4x
the current disk usage to reduce alerting and immediate resizing up.

#### Postgres major version upgrades

Snowflake Postgres allows you to schedule your major version upgrades through the Dashboard. To make this change, you’ll use the same process
as for an instance resize.

> **Tip:**
>
> Upgrading your instance to a new major version requires maintenance. See [Snowflake Postgres Maintenance](postgres-maintenance.md) for general information about maintenance.

To initiate a major version upgrade, you must use a role that has been granted the OWNERSHIP or OPERATE privilege on the instance.

> **Note:**
>
> You can only upgrade to a newer major version. You can’t downgrade to a previous major version.
>
> You can combine a major version upgrade with an instance resize by selecting a new instance size,
> storage size, or both along with the new version number.

SnowsightSQL

1. In the navigation menu, select Postgres.
2. Select your Snowflake Postgres instance.
3. In the Manage menu at the top right, select Modify.
4. If a newer version is available, you will be able to select it from the Postgres version dropdown menu.
5. Select the Save button to confirm the change.

You can initiate a major version upgrade with the ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE command, by setting the POSTGRES_VERSION parameter to the desired
version.

```sqlsyntax
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE [IF EXISTS] <name>
  SET POSTGRES_VERSION = { 16 | 17 }
```

`POSTGRES_VERSION = { 16 | 17 }`
:   The desired Postgres version to upgrade to.

**Example: Upgrade an existing instance to PostgreSQL 17**

```sqlexample
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE my_instance
  SET POSTGRES_VERSION = 17;
```

**Example: Combine a major version upgrade with an increase in storage size**

```sqlexample
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE my_instance
  SET POSTGRES_VERSION = 17
      STORAGE_SIZE_GB = 100;
```

Postgres major version upgrades work differently than other instance management operations. Once you initiate the process, Snowflake Postgres
will execute the following steps:

1. Create a “hidden” (not visible to users) replica of your current instance.
2. Migrate existing data from the source instance to the hidden replica (duration is relative to data size).
3. When your maintenance window arrives:

   * Lock the source instance to prevent writes.
   * Upgrade the hidden replica (duration depends on the *number of objects* in your database, not data size).
4. Fail over to the newly upgraded instance once the upgrade is complete.

**Important Notes**:

* Major Version changes can affect application compatibility. We recommend testing your application against the new PostgreSQL version
  before upgrading.
* Read Replicas are automatically upgraded when performing a major version upgrade, but only once its primary is upgraded and a fresh
  backup is taken. Until then, replicas will remain available but in a stale state.
* If you have no maintenance window set, and have not specified a run time, the upgrade will commence as soon as the new instance is
  populated and ready.
* This operation creates a service interruption that should last no longer than a few minutes.
* If an upgrade fails, your instance will automatically revert back to the original instance.

### Enable High Availability

When High Availability (HA) is enabled, your instance includes a standby host that replaces the primary if your primary
becomes unavailable. You can read more about this in [Snowflake Postgres High Availability](high-availability.md).

### Create replica

You can create a replica of your instance from the dashboard. A replica is a read-only copy of the source instance that is kept in sync
with the source instance. Find about more about creating and using replicas in [Snowflake Postgres Read Replicas](postgres-create-replica.md).

### Instance suspend and resume

Suspending an instance deactivates the virtual machine that it’s running on while keeping its disk image in storage so that the instance can be resumed.
Normal billing for the instance is suspended, but storage costs will continue to accrue. The existing 10 days’ worth of backups are also retained.

If there were operations that were pending restart to be applied, they will be applied when the instance is resumed.

To suspend or resume a Snowflake Postgres instance, you must use a role that has been granted the OWNERSHIP or OPERATE privilege on the instance.

SnowsightSQL

Snowflake Postgres allows you to suspend your instance from the dashboard.

1. In the navigation menu, select Postgres.
2. Select your instance.
3. In the Manage menu at the top right, select Suspend.
4. Click the Suspend button to confirm the action.

To suspend a Snowflake Postgres instance, run the [ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-postgres-instance.md) command with the SUSPEND option. For example:

> ```sqlexample
> ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE instance_that_definitely_exists SUSPEND;
> ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE IF EXISTS instance_that_might_exist SUSPEND;
> ```
>
> * These operations are asynchronous. You can use the DESCRIBE POSTGRES INSTANCE command to track the status of these operations.
>
> **Example: Suspend a Snowflake Postgres instance named my_instance**
>
> ```sqlexample
> ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE my_instance SUSPEND;
> ```

You can resume a suspended instance at any time. The time it takes to resume an instance depends on the instance and the size of the dataset.
When you resume an instance, normal billing and backups will also recommence.

SnowsightSQL

1. In the navigation menu, select Postgres.
2. Select your instance.
3. In the Manage menu at the top right, select Resume.
4. Click the Resume button to confirm the action.

To resume a Snowflake Postgres instance, run ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE … RESUME:

> ```sqlsyntax
> ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE [ IF EXISTS ] <name> RESUME
> ```
>
> These operations are asynchronous. The DESCRIBE command may be used to track the status of these operations.
>
> **Example: Resume a Snowflake Postgres instance named my_instance**
>
> ```sqlexample
> ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE my_instance RESUME;
> ```

### Restarting services

You can restart either PostgreSQL or the underlying server that runs your Postgres instance if needed. This type of instance management
operation restarts the server in-place, without creating a replica or performing a fail-over. Read more about restarting services in
[Snowflake Postgres Maintenance](postgres-maintenance.md).

### Regenerate credentials

Regenerating credentials will return a new connection string for your database instance, replacing the existing credentials. Read more about
this topic in [Snowflake Postgres Roles](postgres-roles.md).

## Custom configuration parameters

You can make changes to many of Postgres’s own server settings for your Snowflake Postgres instances. You can see the list of available
configuration parameters in [Snowflake Postgres Server Settings](postgres-server-settings.md).

To change the Postgres settings on a Snowflake Postgres instance, you must use a role that has been granted the OWNERSHIP or OPERATE privilege on that instance.

To make a change:

SnowsightSQL

1. In the navigation menu, select Postgres
2. Select your instance
3. On the right side of the page select the edit icon next to Custom parameters
4. Choose configuration parameters from the list, or use the search box to find specific parameters.
5. Enter the new value for the configuration parameter.
6. When you’ve finished add new values for parameters, click Continue to review, and then click Submit to confirm the changes.

To specify changes to the [Postgres settings](postgres-server-settings.md) for the instance,
run the [ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-postgres-instance.md) command with the SET POSTGRES_SETTINGS option.

With the POSTGRES_SETTINGS option, you specify a JSON-formatted string with the following structure:

```none
'{"component:name" = "value", ...}'
```

Changes to some of the Postgres settings may require an instance restart to take effect. These changes will not take effect
unless you specify APPLY IMMEDIATELY in the ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE statement. For the list of settings that require a restart,
consult the table in [Postgres settings](postgres-server-settings.md).

**Example: Set the work_mem configuration parameter to 128MB for a Snowflake Postgres instance named my_instance**

```sqlexample
ALTER POSTGRES INSTANCE my_instance SET POSTGRES_SETTINGS = ( 'work_mem' = '128MB' );
```

## Instance states

Any instance management operation, whether it’s creating a new instance or modifying an existing
one, takes some time to complete. The exact duration depends on many factors, including your
data and schema sizes, and how busy your instance is. An instance’s state gives
you insight into the progress of an ongoing operation. It is shown in the dashboard, or you can
check it by running the `DESCRIBE POSTGRES INSTANCE` command.

Possible instance states are listed below. During an instance modification operation, the
replacement instance goes through all of the states listed in the first table. A new instance
being created goes through some but not all of the states listed. The following table lists
some additional states you might see during normal operations.

**States seen during create, modify, and fork:**

| State | What’s happening | Typical duration | Next state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Creating** | A new underlying server is being created | 1-2 minutes | Restoring |
| **Restoring** | Latest base backup is being restored to the server | Variable | Starting |
| **Starting** | Postgres is being started on the instance and WAL that accumulated during base backup is being applied | Variable | Replaying |
| **Replaying** | Accumulated WAL since last base backup is being replayed | Variable | Finalizing |
| **Finalizing** | Instance configuration is being finalized and the server is being made available | 1-2 minutes | Ready |
| **Ready** | New instance matches source instance and is ready for the operation to proceed. If scheduled for an upcoming maintenance window, the instance is kept `Ready` until that time. If scheduled for now, the operation proceeds once it reaches `Ready`. Running instances normally show the `Ready` state. | N/A | N/A |

**Other instance states that you might see on the platform:**

| State | What’s happening | Typical duration | Next state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Restarting** | Underlying server is being restarted | 1-2 minutes | Ready |
| **Resuming** | A new server is being built and a suspended instance is being resumed | 3-5 minutes | Ready |
| **Suspending** | Instance is being suspended | 3-5 minutes | Suspended |
| **Suspended** | Instance is currently suspended | Until resumed | Resuming |
