# Openflow Connector for MySQL: Set up incremental replication without snapshots

> **Note:**
>
> This connector is subject to the [Snowflake Connector Terms](https://www.snowflake.com/legal/snowflake-connector-terms/).

The Openflow Connector for MySQL connector can be configured to immediately start replicating incremental changes for newly added tables,
bypassing snapshots. Incremental load is useful when reinstalling the connector over previously replicated data
and to continue replication without snapshotting every table again.

Incremental replication can be enabled in a new instance of the connector, or in an existing one.

To enable incremental replication in a new instance of the connector perform the following tasks:

1. Setup the connector as described in [Set up the Openflow Connector for MySQL](setup.md).
2. In the `MySQL Ingestion Parameters` context, set the `Ingestion Type` parameter to `incremental`.

## Enable incremental replication without snapshots

To enable incremental replication on an existing connector:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../../../../ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. In the navigation menu, select Ingestion » Openflow.
3. In the Openflow pane select the Runtimes tab.
4. Select the runtime containing the connector.
5. Select the connector.
6. In the `Ingestion Parameters` context, specify `Ingestion Type` = `incremental`.
7. Add new replication tables. These tables immediately switch to their incremental load.

> **Note:**
>
> To return to replicating tables with the snapshot load, change Ingestion Type from `incremental` to `full`.

### Usage notes

* Changing the value of Ingestion Type does not impact any tables that have begun replicating data.
  Tables currently in the snapshot phase continue until the snapshot load is complete.
* While Ingestion Type is set to `incremental`, new tables added to the list of replicated tables bypass the snapshot phase.
  This includes new tables added to the source database that match the `Included Table Regex` parameter.
  Ensure that the ingestion type is set to `incremental` to bypass the snapshot phase.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > Connectors should only remain in `incremental` mode as long as required as it bypasses snapshots.
  > Once customer needs for incremental updates have been satisfied the connector should be returned to `full` mode.
* For tables that bypass snapshot load, the connector creates a destination table in Snowflake,
  by executing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, only if no destination table already exists.
  Tables going through the snapshot require that no destination table exist.
