# Automatic Clustering

Automatic Clustering is the Snowflake service that seamlessly and continually manages all reclustering, as needed, of clustered tables.

Note that, after a clustered table is defined, reclustering does not necessarily start immediately. Snowflake only reclusters a clustered table if it will benefit from the
operation.

> **Note:**
>
> If manual reclustering is still available in your account, Automatic Clustering might not be enabled yet for your account. For more details, see [Manual Reclustering — Deprecated](tables-clustering-manual.md).

## Benefits of Automatic Clustering

### Ease-of-maintenance

Automatic Clustering eliminates the need for performing any of the following tasks:

* Monitoring the state of clustered tables.

  Instead, as DML is performed on these tables, Snowflake monitors and evaluates the tables to determine whether they would benefit from reclustering, and automatically
  reclusters them, as needed.
* Designating warehouses in your account to use for reclustering.

  Snowflake performs automatic reclustering in the background, and you do not need to specify a warehouse to use.

All you need to do is define a clustering key for each table (if appropriate) and Snowflake manages all future maintenance.

### Full control

You can suspend and resume Automatic Clustering for a clustered table at any time using ALTER TABLE … SUSPEND / RESUME RECLUSTER. While Automatic Clustering is suspended
for a table, the table is never automatically reclustered, regardless of its clustering state and, therefore, does not incur any related credit charges.

You can also drop the clustering key on a clustered table at any time, which prevents all future reclustering on the table.

### Non-blocking DML

Automatic Clustering is transparent and does not block DML statements issued against tables while they are being reclustered.

### Optimal efficiency

With Automatic Clustering, Snowflake internally manages the state of clustered tables, as well as the resources (servers, memory, etc.) used for all automated clustering
operations. This allows Snowflake to dynamically allocate resources as needed, resulting in the most efficient and effective reclustering.

Also, Automatic Clustering does not perform any unnecessary reclustering. Reclustering is triggered only if/when the table would benefit from the operation.

## Enabling Automatic Clustering for a table

In most cases, no tasks are required to enable Automatic Clustering for a table. You simply define a
[clustering key](tables-clustering-keys.md) for the table.

However, the rule does not apply to tables created by cloning ([CREATE TABLE … CLONE …](../sql-reference/sql/create-clone.md))
from a source table that has clustering keys. The new table starts with Automatic Clustering suspended – even if Automatic
Clustering for the source table is not suspended. (This is true whether the `CLONE` command cloned the table, the schema
containing the table, or the database containing the table.)

> Before you define a clustering key for a table, consider the following conditions, which may cause reclustering activity (and corresponding credit charges):
>
> * The table is not optimally-clustered. For more details, see [Micro-partitions & Data Clustering](tables-clustering-micropartitions.md).
> * The clustering key on the table has changed.
>
> As such, we recommend starting with one or two selected tables and assessing the impact of Automatic Clustering on these tables. Once you are comfortable/familiar with how
> Automatic Clustering performs reclustering, you can then define clustering keys for your other tables.

For information about choosing optimal clustering keys, see [Strategies for Selecting Clustering Keys](tables-clustering-keys.md).

To add clustering to a table, you must also have USAGE or OWNERSHIP privileges on the schema and database that
contain the table.

## Viewing the Automatic Clustering status for a table

You can use SQL to view whether Automatic Clustering is enabled for a table:

* [SHOW TABLES](../sql-reference/sql/show-tables.md) command.
* [TABLES](../sql-reference/info-schema/tables.md) view (in the [Snowflake Information Schema](../sql-reference/info-schema.md)).
* [TABLES](../sql-reference/account-usage/tables.md) view (in the [Account Usage](../sql-reference/account-usage.md) shared database).

The `AUTO_CLUSTERING_ON` column in the output displays the Automatic Clustering status for each table, which can be used to determine whether to suspend or resume Automatic
Clustering for a given table.

In addition, the `CLUSTER_BY` column (SHOW TABLES) or `CLUSTERING_KEY` column (TABLES view) displays the column(s) defined as the clustering key(s) for each table.

## Suspending Automatic Clustering for a table

To suspend Automatic Clustering for a table, use the [ALTER TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table.md) command with a `SUSPEND RECLUSTER` clause. For example:

> ```sqlexample
> ALTER TABLE t1 SUSPEND RECLUSTER;
>
> SHOW TABLES LIKE 't1';
>
> +---------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------+-------+---------+------------+------+-------+----------+----------------+----------------------+
> |           created_on            | name | database_name | schema_name | kind  | comment | cluster_by | rows | bytes |  owner   | retention_time | automatic_clustering |
> +---------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------+-------+---------+------------+------+-------+----------+----------------+----------------------+
> | Thu, 12 Apr 2018 13:29:01 -0700 | T1   | TESTDB        | MY_SCHEMA   | TABLE |         | LINEAR(C1) | 0    | 0     | SYSADMIN | 1              | OFF                  |
> +---------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------+-------+---------+------------+------+-------+----------+----------------+----------------------+
> ```

> **Note:**
>
> Changing the clustering key of a table resumes automatic clustering, which can result in credit consumption by serverless resources.
> Including the word LINEAR in the ALTER TABLE … CLUSTER BY statement is considered a change to the clustering key even if the column
> doesn’t change.

## Resuming Automatic Clustering for a table

To resume Automatic Clustering for a clustered table, use the [ALTER TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table.md) command with a `RESUME RECLUSTER` clause. For example:

> ```sqlexample
> ALTER TABLE t1 RESUME RECLUSTER;
>
> SHOW TABLES LIKE 't1';
>
> +---------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------+-------+---------+------------+------+-------+----------+----------------+----------------------+
> |           created_on            | name | database_name | schema_name | kind  | comment | cluster_by | rows | bytes |  owner   | retention_time | automatic_clustering |
> +---------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------+-------+---------+------------+------+-------+----------+----------------+----------------------+
> | Thu, 12 Apr 2018 13:29:01 -0700 | T1   | TESTDB        | MY_SCHEMA   | TABLE |         | LINEAR(C1) | 0    | 0     | SYSADMIN | 1              | ON                   |
> +---------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------+-------+---------+------------+------+-------+----------+----------------+----------------------+
> ```

> **Tip:**
>
> Before you resume Automatic Clustering on a clustered table, consider the following conditions, which may cause reclustering activity (and corresponding credit charges):
>
> * The table is not optimally-clustered (e.g. significant DML has been performed on the table since it was last reclustered).
> * The clustering key on the table has changed.

## Automatic Clustering costs

The cost of enabling Automatic Clustering can be broken down into compute costs and storage costs.

Compute costs
:   Snowflake uses [serverless compute resources](cost-understanding-compute.md) to cluster a table for the first time. It also uses compute resources to maintain that table in a well-clustered state as new data is added to the table. The more changes to a table, the higher the
    maintenance costs.

Storage Costs
:   Because Automatic Clustering reorganizes existing data rather than creating additional storage, in many cases there are no additional
    storage costs. However, reclustering can incur additional storage costs if it increases the size of
    [Fail-safe](data-failsafe.md) storage. For more information, see [Credit and Storage Impact of Reclustering](tables-clustering-keys.md).

### Credit usage and warehouses for Automatic Clustering

Automatic Clustering consumes Snowflake credits, but does not require you to provide a virtual warehouse. Instead, Snowflake internally
manages and achieves efficient resource utilization for reclustering the tables.

Your account is billed only for the actual credits consumed by automatic clustering operations on your clustered tables.

> **Important:**
>
> After enabling or resuming Automatic Clustering on a clustered table, if it has been a while since the table was reclustered, you may
> experience reclustering activity (and corresponding credit charges) as Snowflake brings the table to an optimally-clustered state. Once
> the table is optimally-clustered, the reclustering activity will drop off.
>
> Likewise, defining a clustering key on an existing table or changing the clustering key on a clustered table may trigger reclustering and
> credit charges.
>
> To prevent any unexpected credit charges, we recommend starting with one or two selected tables and observing the credit charges
> associated with keeping the tables well-clustered as DML is performed. This will help you establish a baseline for the number of credits
> consumed by reclustering activity.

### Estimating Automatic Clustering cost

You can call the [SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_COSTS](../sql-reference/functions/system_estimate_automatic_clustering_costs.md) function to help estimate the compute cost of
enabling Automatic Clustering for a table and maintaining the table in a well-clustered state. You can also call the function to help predict
the compute cost of changing the cluster key of a table.

> **Important:**
>
> The cost estimates returned by the SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_COSTS function are best efforts. The actual realized costs can vary by up to 100% (or, in rare cases, several times) from the estimated costs.

### Viewing Automatic Clustering cost

Automatic clustering consumes credits as it uses [serverless compute resources](cost-understanding-compute.md) for the
automated background maintenance of each clustered table, including initial clustering and reclustering as needed. To learn how many
credits per compute-hour are consumed by automatic clustering, refer to the “Serverless Feature Credit Table” in the
[Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

Users with the proper privileges can view the cost of automatic clustering using [Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs.md) or SQL:

> Snowsight:
> :   In the navigation menu, select Admin » Cost management.
>
> SQL:
> :   Query either of the following:
>
>     * [AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/automatic_clustering_history.md) table function (in the [Snowflake Information Schema](../sql-reference/info-schema.md)).
>     * [AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_HISTORY view](../sql-reference/account-usage/automatic_clustering_history.md) (in [Account Usage](../sql-reference/account-usage.md)).
>
>       The following queries can be executed against the AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_HISTORY view:
>
>       **Query: Automatic Clustering cost history (by day, by object)**
>
>       This query provides a list of tables with Automatic Clustering and the volume of credits consumed via the service over the last 30 days,
>       broken out by day. Any irregularities in the credit consumption or consistently high consumption are flags for additional investigation.
>
>       ```sqlexample
>       SELECT TO_DATE(start_time) AS date,
>         database_name,
>         schema_name,
>         table_name,
>         SUM(credits_used) AS credits_used
>       FROM snowflake.account_usage.automatic_clustering_history
>       WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(month,-1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
>       GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
>       ORDER BY 5 DESC;
>       ```
>
>       **Query: Automatic Clustering History & m-day average**
>
>       This query shows the average daily credits consumed by Automatic Clustering grouped by week over the last year. It can help identify
>       anomalies in daily averages over the year so you can investigate spikes or unexpected changes in consumption.
>
>       ```sqlexample
>       WITH credits_by_day AS (
>         SELECT TO_DATE(start_time) AS date,
>           SUM(credits_used) AS credits_used
>         FROM snowflake.account_usage.automatic_clustering_history
>         WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(year,-1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
>         GROUP BY 1
>         ORDER BY 2 DESC
>       )
>
>       SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week',date),
>             AVG(credits_used) AS avg_daily_credits
>       FROM credits_by_day
>       GROUP BY 1
>       ORDER BY 1;
>       ```
