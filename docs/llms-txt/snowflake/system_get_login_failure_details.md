# SYSTEM$GET_LOGIN_FAILURE_DETAILS

Returns a JSON object that represents an unsuccessful login attempt associated with External OAuth, SAML, or key pair authentication. The
JSON object contains the error associated with the failed login attempt.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
SYSTEM$GET_LOGIN_FAILURE_DETAILS('<uuid>')
```

## Arguments

`uuid`
:   A string representing a UUID. The UUID appears after the error message that is returned from a failed login event associated with External
    OAuth, SAML, or key pair authentication.

## Returns

Returns the following elements in a JSON object:

| Key | Data Type | Value Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clientIP | STRING | The IP address from where the failed login request originated. For example, `"10.211.55.1"`. |
| clientType | STRING | The client software reported by the client. For example, `"JDBC_DRIVER"`. This value is not verified. If the client does not report this value, then this value is `"OTHER"`. |
| clientVersion | STRING | The version of the client software reported by the client. For example, `"2.9.0"`. This value is not verified. If the client does not report this value, the this value is `null`. |
| username | STRING | The username associated with the failed login event. If the system cannot find the username, or the error occurred before the system found the username, then this value is `null`. |
| errorCode | STRING | The error associated with the failed login event. For a description of the error, refer to External OAuth errors, SAML errors, or JWT token errors. If the error is OVERFLOW_FAILURE_EVENTS_ELIDED, then the number of failed login attempts is too high. |
| timestamp | NUMBER | The date and time, in Unix timestamp format, when the failed login event occurred. |

## Usage notes

Only administrators that have a MONITOR privilege assigned to their role can use this function.

## Error descriptions

This section provides descriptions for errors returned by the SYSTEM$GET_LOGIN_FAILURE_DETAILS function.

### External OAuth errors

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_INVALID_SIGNATURE | Invalid signature algorithm or issue validating signature. |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_MISSING_ISSUER | Cannot extract issuer (an `iss` claim) from the access token. |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_INVALID_TYPE | Invalid type of access token. |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_INVALID_FORMAT | Malformed access token. |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_ISSUER_NOT_FOUND | Cannot find security integration associated with the issuer. |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED | Access token expired. |
| EXTERNAL_OAUTH_MISSING_AUDIENCE | Cannot extract audience (an `aud` claim) from the access token. |

| 390171 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_RECIPIENT_MISMATCH | The “Recipient” attribute does not match a valid destination URL. |
| 390172 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_NOTONORAFTER_VALIDATION | This typically indicates that the time in which the SAML assertion is valid has expired. |
| 390173 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_NOTBEFORE_VALIDATION | This typically indicates that the time in which the SAML assertion is valid has not yet come. |
| 390174 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_USERNAMES_MISMATCH | The login names do not match during re-authentication. |
| 390175 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_SESSIONID_MISSING | During re-authentication, we were unable to find a session corresponding to the user. |
| 390176 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_ACCOUNTS_MISMATCH | During re-authentication, the names of the accounts were found to not match. |
| 390177 | SAML_RESPONSE_INVALID_BAD_CERT | The x.509 certificate contained in the SAML response is either malformed or does not match the expected certificate. |

### JWT token errors

The following errors are associated with the JWT token used for [key pair authentication](../../user-guide/key-pair-auth.md).

| Error Code | Error | Description |

| 394305 | JWT_TOKEN_INVALID_ALGORITHM | The JWT token was not signed with the RS256 algorithm. |
| 394306 | JWT_TOKEN_INVALID_SIGNATURE | Snowflake could not verify the signature provided by the JWT token. It is possible that the JWT was signed with a private key that is not paired with the provided public key. It is also possible that the JWT signature is corrupt or has been modified. |

## Examples

The following example teaches you how to use the SYSTEM$GET_LOGIN_FAILURE_DETAILS function with a UUID from a failed login attempt
associated with External OAuth, SAML, or key pair authentication:

1. Find the UUID in the error message:

   > ```output
   > Invalid  OAuth access token. [0ce9eb56-821d-4ca9-a774-04ae89a0cf5a]
   > ```
>
2. Use the UUID as an argument to the SYSTEM$GET_LOGIN_FAILURE_DETAILS function, and extract the error using the [JSON_EXTRACT_PATH_TEXT](json_extract_path_text.md) function:

   > ```sqlexample
   > SELECT JSON_EXTRACT_PATH_TEXT(SYSTEM$GET_LOGIN_FAILURE_DETAILS('0ce9eb56-821d-4ca9-a774-04ae89a0cf5a'), 'errorCode');
   > ```
>
3. Find the error description in the External OAuth errors or SAML errors tables.
