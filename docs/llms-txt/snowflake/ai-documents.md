# Cortex AI Functions: Documents

Snowflake provides advanced AI-powered document intelligence capabilities as Cortex AI Functions. These functions help
you to process, parse, classify, and extract information from a wide variety of document types to power analytics,
automation, and intelligent applications, all using simple SQL. Document functions help you with the following tasks:

* **Parse documents** to convert unstructured text and layouts into structured, searchable, analyzable content.
* **Extract structured information** (entities, tables, or fields) from documents.
* **Classify document types** to drive downstream workflows and analytics.

Cortex document processing functions can be combined to build retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines,
intelligent search and chatbot systems, and large-scale document analytics. The following illustration shows how Cortex
document processing functions form a composable framework in which components can be mixed and matched to build
tailored solutions.

## Document functions

The core Cortex AI Functions for document processing are:

* [AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT](parse-document.md): Converts digital-native or scanned documents into rich text while
  preserving layout and context. Optionally extracts images from documents. Ideal for semantic search, RAG pipelines,
  and summarization workflows. Works well with document analysis that requires understanding the entire document
  content.
* [AI_EXTRACT](document-extraction.md): Provides high-quality structured extraction of information from
  documents. Understands text, tables, checkboxes, handwriting, and other visual elements. Specializes in extracting
  structured data based on a schema.
* [AI_COMPLETE](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_complete.md): The most general-purpose AI Function, AI_COMPLETE generates
  text completions based on a prompt you provide, and so can be used for a wide variety of tasks involving extracting or
  transforming text from documents. An advantage of AI_COMPLETE is the ability to choose a model.

The following text-processing AI Functions can be used to further analyze or transform text extracted from documents.

* [AI_SENTIMENT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_sentiment.md): Analyzes the sentiment of text content.
* [AI_TRANSLATE](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_translate.md): Translates text content between languages.
* [SUMMARIZE](../../sql-reference/functions/summarize-snowflake-cortex.md): Generates concise summaries of text content.

## Use cases

Cortex AI Functions for document processing are designed to be used together or individually to address a variety of use
cases, and are well-suited for these two use cases:

### Building RAG pipelines for chatbots and enterprise search services

Documents processed by AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT can be indexed by Cortex Search Services, which can act as retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) engines to improve language model responses to user queries. In this scenario, you use the Cortex
Search Service to find documents related to the query, then pass these documents to AI_COMPLETE as part of the prompt to
generate more contextually relevant responses.

### Building document processing pipelines for streamlining workflows and analytics

Cortex document processing AI Functions help you build intelligent, flexible, and scalable document processing pipelines
using modular components. Such a pipeline ingests documents in various formats and transforms them into actionable data,
allowing you to build workflows like these:

* Schema based extraction: Apply a natural language schema to extract entities – ranging from single entities to complex tabular data – from a set of documents
* Q&A against document: Ask questions about a document in natural language.
* Text and layout extraction: Capture document text (with or without layout) to extract entities, generate summaries, and perform analysis using other AI Functions.
* Classification: Determine the document type (e.g., “invoice,” “contract,” “report”) when ingesting data to route each
  type to an appropriate processing workflow.
* Build a model registry to share custom extraction and classification models: A model registry stores document
  extraction models fine-tuned for custom use cases specific to your organization. Reusing these models across teams
  saves time and effort.
