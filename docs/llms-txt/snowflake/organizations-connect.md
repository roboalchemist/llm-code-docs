# Connecting to your accounts

This topic provides the URL and [account identifier](admin-account-identifier.md) formats that you use to connect to the
Snowflake accounts in your organization.

> **Note:**
>
> If you are an organization administrator and want to delete old URLs for an account that has changed, see [Managing account URLs](organizations-manage-accounts-urls.md).

## Connecting to the Snowflake web interface

To connect to Snowsight using your web browser, see [Signing in to Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs.md).

## Connecting with a URL

Snowflake supports multiple URL formats when connecting to a Snowflake account without a browser. For example, an identity provider
might use a direct URL to communicate with Snowflake.

* The **account name** format uses the name of the account and its [organization](organizations.md) to identify the account.
  To find the name of your organization and account, see [Finding the organization and account name for an account](admin-account-identifier.md).
* The **connection name** format, which replaces the account name with the name of a connection, is required when using the
  [Client Redirect](client-redirect.md) feature. To find the name of your connection, execute the
  [SHOW CONNECTIONS](../sql-reference/sql/show-connections.md) command.
* The legacy **account locator** format is currently supported, but its use is discouraged.

### Standard account URLs

The standard URL format can be used in most cases where a Snowflake account URL is required, including:

> * SSO connections (except Okta)
> * SCIM base URL (except Okta)
> * OAuth connections with third-party identity providers (except Okta)
> * OAuth base URL for a Snowflake Authorization Server

The standard URL formats are:

> * Account name: `https://<orgname>-<account_name>.snowflakecomputing.com`
> * Connection name: `https://<orgname>-<connectionname>.snowflakecomputing.com`
> * Account locator (legacy): `https://<accountlocator>.<region>.<cloud>.snowflakecomputing.com`

### Private connectivity URLs

When connecting to Snowflake using private connectivity to the Snowflake service (e.g. AWS PrivateLink), the string `privatelink` must be
appended to the [account identifier](admin-account-identifier.md) in the Snowflake account URL.

> * Account Name: `https://<orgname>-<account_name>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`
> * Connection Name: `https://<orgname>-<connectionname>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`
> * Account Locator (legacy): `https://<account_locator>.<region>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`

Note that using private connectivity requires updating DNS records to include the private connectivity URL. For more information, see:

> * [AWS PrivateLink CNAME Records](admin-security-privatelink.md).
> * Azure Private Link DNS setup in the [configuration procedure](privatelink-azure.md).
> * Google Cloud Private Service Connect DNS setup in [Step 8](private-service-connect-google.md).

### Okta URLs

When using Okta for SSO, SCIM, or OAuth, you must use a special account name format if the account name contains an underscore. Because
Okta does not support underscores in URLs, the underscore in the account name must be converted to a hyphen.

> * Account name: `https://<orgname>-<account-name>.snowflakecomputing.com`
> * Connection name: Use the standard URL
> * Account locator (legacy): Use the standard URL

## Connecting from clients, connectors, and drivers

See [Configuring a client, driver, library, or third-party application to connect to Snowflake](gen-conn-config.md).

## Backwards compatibility

Using the legacy account locator in an account identifier or account URL is still supported, though discouraged.
