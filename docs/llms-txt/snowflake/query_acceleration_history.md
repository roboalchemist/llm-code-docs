# QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY

The QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY function is used for querying the [query acceleration service](../../user-guide/query-acceleration-service.md)
history within a specified date range. The information returned includes the credits used for the query acceleration service at the
warehouse level for a given time frame.

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY(
      [ DATE_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
      [ , DATE_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
      [ , WAREHOUSE_NAME => '<string>' ] )
```

## Parameters

All the arguments are optional.

`DATE_RANGE_START => constant_expr` , . `DATE_RANGE_END => constant_expr`
:   The date/time range to display the query acceleration history.

    For example, if you specify that the start date is 2019-05-03 and the end date 2019-05-05, you will get data for May 3, May 4, and May 5.
    (The endpoints are included.)

    * If neither a start date nor an end date is specified, the default will be the last 12 hours.
    * If an end date is not specified, but a start date is specified, then [CURRENT_DATE](current_date.md)
      at midnight is used as the end of the range.
    * If a start date is not specified, but an end date is specified, then the range starts 12 hours prior to the start
      of `DATE_RANGE_END`.

`WAREHOUSE_NAME => string`
:   Warehouse name. If specified, only shows the history for the specified warehouse.

    If a warehouse name is not specified, then the results will include history for each warehouse using the query acceleration service.

## Output

The function returns the following columns:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| START_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | Start of the specified time range in which the service was in use. |
| END_TIME | TIMESTAMP_LTZ | End of the specified time range in which the service was in use. |
| CREDITS_USED | NUMBER | Number of credits used by the service. |
| WAREHOUSE_NAME | TEXT | Name of the warehouse where usage occurred. |
| NUM_FILES_SCANNED | NUMBER | Number of files scanned by the service. |
| NUM_BYTES_SCANNED | NUMBER | Number of bytes scanned by the service. |

## Usage notes

* Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role or any role that has been explicitly granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege.
* When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the function name
  must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [Snowflake Information Schema](../info-schema.md).
