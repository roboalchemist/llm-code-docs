# Set up Openflow - Snowflake Deployment: Configure allowed domains for Openflow connectors

Openflow - Snowflake Deployments access external domain resources. Snowflake controls access to external domains
using [network rules](../../network-rules.md) and
[external access integrations](../../../developer-guide/external-network-access/creating-using-external-network-access.md)
to either grant or deny access to specific domains.

This topic describes the process of [creating a network rule](../../../sql-reference/sql/create-network-rule.md)
and [creating an external access integration](../../../sql-reference/sql/create-external-access-integration.md) to grant access to a specific domain.
In addition, the known domains used by Openflow connectors are provided.

Two possible workflows exist for managing access to external domains:

* Create a new network rule and external access integration: Create a new network rule that defines a list of allowed domain/port combinations
  and create a new external access integration using the newly created network rule.
* Alter an existing network rule: Alter an existing network rule
  to add a list of allowed domain/port combinations.

## Create a network rule granting access to one or more domains

To create a new network rule that grants access to one or more domain/port combinations,
execute an SQL statement similar to:

```sqlexample
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE NETWORK RULE MY_OPENFLOW_NETWORK_RULE
   TYPE = HOST_PORT
   MODE = EGRESS
   VALUE_LIST = ('<domain>', '<domain>');
```

For example, to allow Snowflake to access `googleads.googleapis.com`, execute the following.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE NETWORK RULE GOOGLEADS_OPENFLOW_NETWORK_RULE
   TYPE = HOST_PORT
   MODE = EGRESS
   VALUE_LIST = ('googleads.googleapis.com');
```

For more information, see [CREATE NETWORK RULE](../../../sql-reference/sql/create-network-rule.md).

After the network rule is created, a external access integration has to be created.

To create a new integration, execute an SQL statement similar to:

```sqlexample
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

CREATE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION MY_OPENFLOW_EAI
   ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (MY_OPENFLOW_NETWORK_RULE)
   ENABLED = TRUE
   COMMENT = 'External Access Integration for Openflow connectivity';
```

## Alter an existing network rule granting access to one or more domains

To alter an existing network rule to grant access to one or more domain/port combinations,
execute an SQL statement similar to:

```sqlexample
USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;

ALTER NETWORK RULE GOOGLEADS_OPENFLOW_NETWORK_RULE SET
   VALUE_LIST = ('<existing domain>', '<existing domain>', 'googleads.googleapis.com');
```

For more information, see [ALTER NETWORK RULE](../../../sql-reference/sql/alter-network-rule.md).

> **Note:**
>
> Use [SHOW NETWORK RULES](../../../sql-reference/sql/show-network-rules.md) to list the existing network rules. .
> Use [DESCRIBE NETWORK RULE](../../../sql-reference/sql/desc-network-rule.md) to describe the properties of a specific network rule.

If the altered network rule is already associated with an external access integration, it will be updated automatically.
If you do not have an external access integration for the altered network rule,
refer to the section above for instructions on creating a new integration.

## Next steps

1. Associate an external access integration with your runtime:

   1. Navigate to the Openflow canvas.
   2. Select the Runtimes tab.
   3. For the runtime which requires the new external access integration,
      click the  menu.
   4. Select External access integrations.
   5. Select all required external access integrations from the dropdown list.
      .
      Note you may select multiple external access integrations.
   6. Click Save.

      > **Note:**
      >
      > Restarting the runtime is not required and the changes are applied immediately.
2. Deploy a connector in a runtime, for a list of connectors available in Openflow, see [Openflow connectors](connectors/about-openflow-connectors.md).

## Domains used by Openflow connectors

The following domains are used by Openflow connectors and require network rules to be granted access.

### Amazon Ads

The following domains are used by the Amazon Ads connector.

* `advertising-api.amazon.com`
* `advertising-api-eu.amazon.com`
* `advertising-api-fe.amazon.com`
* `api.amazon.com`
* `api.amazon.co.uk`
* `api.amazon.co.jp`
* Report location.
  For example, `offline-report-storage-eu-west-1-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` is used to download reports.

The exact report URL location is not always known before creating a report.
Snowflake recommends allow listing all s3 regions:

> * `*.s3.eu-west-[1-3].amazonaws.com`
> * `*.s3.eu-central-[1-2].amazonaws.com`
> * `*.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com`
> * `*.s3.eu-south-[1-2].amazonaws.com`
> * `*.s3.il-central-1.amazonaws.com`

* For advertising-api-fe.amazon.com (Far East / APAC):

  * `*.s3.ap-northeast-[1-3].amazonaws.com`
  * `*.s3.ap-south-[1-2].amazonaws.com`
  * `*.s3.ap-southeast-[1-7].amazonaws.com`
  * `*.s3.ap-east-[1-2].amazonaws.com`
  * `*.s3.me-south-1.amazonaws.com`
  * `*.s3.me-central-1.amazonaws.com`
  * `*.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com`

The last domain is obtained from the report URL is returned after the report is ready to fetch.
This is an Amazon S3 bucket where the report is stored. Customers will need to specify their own AWS region.
for example, `us-east-1` or `eu-west-1` and a specific bucket. As it may be not possible to know the
exact region and bucket, Snowflake suggests using wildcards and listing all possible regions for a given location.
