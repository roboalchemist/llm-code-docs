# Private connectivity for Notebooks

This topic describes using AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or Google Private Service Connect when accessing Snowflake Notebooks. This feature
is available in both [Warehouse and Container Runtimes](notebooks.md) for AWS and Azure, and in Warehouse Runtime for Google.

## AWS PrivateLink prerequisites

To access Snowflake Notebooks with AWS PrivateLink:

1. Set up private connectivity for your [Snowflake account](../admin-security-privatelink.md).
2. Set up private connectivity for [Snowsight](../ui-snowsight-gs.md).

In addition, your account must already use Streamlit in Snowflake over AWS PrivateLink. Notebooks uses the Streamlit engine and widgets to execute and render
notebook cell outputs.

## Azure Private Link prerequisites

To access Snowflake Notebooks with Azure Private Link:

1. Set up private connectivity for your [Snowflake account](../privatelink-azure.md).
2. Set up private connectivity for [Snowsight](../ui-snowsight-gs.md).

In addition, your account must already use Streamlit in Snowflake over Azure Private Link. Notebooks relies on the Streamlit engine for execution and uses
Streamlit widgets to render cell outputs.

## Google Cloud Private Service Connect prerequisites

To access Snowflake Notebooks with Google Private Service Connect:

1. Set up private connectivity for your [Snowflake account](../private-service-connect-google.md).
2. Set up private connectivity for [Snowsight](../ui-snowsight-gs.md).

In addition, your account must already use Streamlit in Snowflake over Google Private Service Connect. Notebooks relies on the Streamlit engine for execution
and uses Streamlit widgets to render cell outputs.

## Configure access to Snowflake Notebooks

To determine the hostname:

* Call [SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG](../../sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_config.md) in your Snowflake account. Use the value returned for the `app-service-privatelink-url` key.
  This URL is used to route traffic to Snowflake-hosted app services, including Snowflake Notebooks, over AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or Google Private Service Connect.

> **Note:**
>
> You can set up a new VPC endpoint for Notebooks or create a DNS record to the same VPC endpoint of your Snowflake account, as shown in the following example:
>
> * Record name: `*.abcd.privatelink.snowflake.app`
> * Type: CNAME
> * Route traffic to: same VPC as your Snowflake traffic.

Hostname routing at an account level is currently not supported.

## Security considerations

Notebooks serve both HTTPS-encrypted traffic and WebSocket-encrypted traffic. The Notebooks browser client application is mounted in a third-party, cross-origin
iframe within Snowsight. This enables strict cross-site browser isolation control.

Snowflake Notebooks use a separate URL scheme for specific security requirements. Notebook URLs have their own top-level domain that does not share any elements
with Snowsight. Each notebook has a unique origin.

> **Note:**
>
> When using AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or Google Private Service Connect, you control the DNS resolution; no private connectivity
> DNS records are controlled by Snowflake.
