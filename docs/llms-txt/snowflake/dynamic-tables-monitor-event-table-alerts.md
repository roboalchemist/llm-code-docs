# Event table monitoring and alerts for dynamic tables

This topic discusses how to query an event table that provides information about your refresh status and how to set up alerts on new data in
an event table.

## Query an event table to monitor refreshes

When a dynamic table is refreshed, you can configure Snowflake to record an event that provides information about the status of the refresh
operation. The event is recorded in the [active event table](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up.md) associated with
the dynamic table.

For example, suppose that you have [associated an event table with a database](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up.md). When a
dynamic table in that database is refreshed, Snowflake records an event to that event table.

You can query the events logged in this active event table to monitor your dynamic table refreshes.

For example, to get the timestamp, dynamic table name, query ID, and error message for errors with dynamic tables in the database `my_db`,
do the following:

```sqlexample
SELECT
    timestamp,
    resource_attributes:"snow.executable.name"::VARCHAR AS dt_name,
    resource_attributes:"snow.query.id"::VARCHAR AS query_id,
    value:message::VARCHAR AS error
  FROM my_event_table
  WHERE
    resource_attributes:"snow.executable.type" = 'DYNAMIC_TABLE' AND
    resource_attributes:"snow.database.name" = 'MY_DB' AND
    value:state = 'FAILED'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

```output
+-------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIMESTAMP               | DT_NAME          | QUERY_ID                             | ERROR                                                                           |
|-------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-02-17 21:40:45.444 | MY_DYNAMIC_TABLE | 01ba7614-0107-e56c-0000-a995024f304a | SQL compilation error:                                                          |
|                         |                  |                                      | Failure during expansion of view 'MY_DYNAMIC_TABLE': SQL compilation error:     |
|                         |                  |                                      | Object 'MY_DB.MY_SCHEMA.MY_BASE_TABLE' does not exist or not authorized.        |
+-------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The following example retrieves all columns for upstream errors with dynamic tables in the schema `my_schema`:

```sqlexample
SELECT *
  FROM my_event_table
  WHERE
    resource_attributes:"snow.executable.type" = 'DYNAMIC_TABLE' AND
    resource_attributes:"snow.schema.name" = 'MY_SCHEMA' AND
    value:state = 'UPSTREAM_FAILURE'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

```output

For information about the role that you need to use to query the event table and the conditions that you can use to filter the results, see
Set up an alert on new data.

## Set up alerts on new data to monitor refreshes

As mentioned earlier, when a dynamic table is refreshed, an event is logged in the
event table to indicate whether the refresh succeeded or failed. You can set up an [alert on new data](alerts.md) to
monitor the event table. You can configure the alert to [send a notification](notifications/about-notifications.md) when a
refresh fails.

The next sections explain how to set up the event logging to capture the events, how to set up the alert, and how to interpret
the events recorded in the event table:

* Set the severity level of the events to capture
* Set up an alert on new data
* Information logged for dynamic table events

> **Note:**
>
> Logging events for dynamic tables incurs costs. See [Costs of telemetry data collection](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/logging-tracing-billing.md).

### Set the severity level of the events to capture

> **Note:**
>
> If you do not set the severity level, no events will be captured.

To set up dynamic table events to be recorded to the event table,
[set the severity level of events](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/telemetry-levels.md) that you want captured in the event
table. Events are captured at the following levels:

* `ERROR`: Refresh failure events.
* `WARN`: Failures to refresh upstream dynamic tables and refresh failure events.
* `INFO`: Successful refresh events, failures to refresh upstream dynamic tables, and refresh failure events.

To set the level, set the [LOG_LEVEL](../sql-reference/parameters.md) parameter for the account or object. You can set the level for:

* All objects in the account.
* All objects in a database or schema.
* A specific dynamic table.

For example:

* To capture ERROR-level events and messages for all objects in the account, execute
  [ALTER ACCOUNT SET LOG_LEVEL](../sql-reference/sql/alter-account.md):

  ```sqlexample
  ALTER ACCOUNT SET LOG_LEVEL = ERROR;
  ```

  Note that this level affects all types of objects in the account, including UDFs, stored procedures, dynamic tables, and tasks.
* To capture INFO-level events and messages for all objects in the database `my_db`, execute
  [ALTER DATABASE … SET LOG_LEVEL](../sql-reference/sql/alter-database.md):

  ```sqlexample
  ALTER DATABASE my_db SET LOG_LEVEL = INFO;
  ```

  Similar to the case of setting the level on the account, setting the level on the database affects all types of objects in the
  database, including UDFs, stored procedures, dynamic tables, and tasks.
* To capture WARN-level events for the dynamic table `my_dynamic_table`, execute
  [ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE … SET LOG_LEVEL](../sql-reference/sql/alter-dynamic-table.md):

  ```sqlexample
  ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE my_dynamic_table SET LOG_LEVEL = WARN;
  ```

### Set up an alert on new data

After you set the severity level for logging events, you can set up an alert on new data to monitor the event table for new events
that indicate a failure in a dynamic table refresh. An alert on new data is triggered when new rows in the event table are
inserted and meet the condition specified in the alert.

> **Note:**
>
> To create the alert on new data, you must use a role that has been granted the required privileges to query the event table.
>
> * If the alert condition queries the default event table ([SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up.md))
>   or the predefined view ([SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS_VIEW view](../sql-reference/telemetry/events_view.md)),
>   see [Roles for access to the default event table and EVENTS_VIEW](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up.md).
>
>   To manage access to the EVENTS_VIEW view, see [Manage access to the EVENTS_VIEW view](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up.md).
> * If the alert condition queries a custom event table, see [Access control privileges for event tables](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-operations.md).
>
>   To manage access to a custom event table, see [Managing access to event table data](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-operations.md).

In the alert condition, to query for dynamic table events, select rows where
`resource_attributes:"snow.executable.type" = 'DYNAMIC_TABLE'`. To narrow down the list of events, you can filter on the
following columns:

* To restrict the results to dynamic tables in a specific database, use `resource_attributes:"snow.database.name"`.
* To return events where the refresh failed due to an error with the dynamic table, use `value:state = 'FAILED'`.
* To return events where the refresh failed due to an error with an upstream dynamic table, use
  `value:state = 'UPSTREAM_FAILURE'`.

For information on the values logged for a dynamic table event, see
Information logged for dynamic table events.

> **Note:**
>
> The `timestamp` column in the event table stores values in UTC. If you use a scheduled alert with a timestamp filter
> (for example, `timestamp > DATEADD('minute', -5, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())`), convert the current timestamp to UTC to ensure
> accurate comparisons:
>
> ```sqlexample
> timestamp > DATEADD('minute', -5, CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()))
> ```

For example, the following statement creates an alert on new data that performs an action when refreshes fail for dynamic tables
in the database `my_db`. The example assumes that:

* Your active event table is the [default event table](../developer-guide/logging-tracing/event-table-setting-up.md) (SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS).
* You have [set up a webhook notification integration](notifications/webhook-notifications.md) for that Slack
  channel.

```sqlexample
CREATE ALERT my_alert_on_dt_refreshes
  IF( EXISTS(
    SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENT_TABLE
      WHERE resource_attributes:"snow.executable.type" = 'dynamic_table'
        AND resource_attributes:"snow.database.name" = 'my_db'
        AND record:"name" = 'refresh.status'
        AND record:"severity_text" = 'ERROR'
        AND value:"state" = 'FAILED'))
  THEN
    BEGIN
      LET result_str VARCHAR;
      (SELECT ARRAY_TO_STRING(ARRAY_AGG(name)::ARRAY, ',') INTO :result_str
         FROM (
           SELECT resource_attributes:"snow.executable.name"::VARCHAR name
             FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(SNOWFLAKE.ALERT.GET_CONDITION_QUERY_UUID()))
             LIMIT 10
         )
      );
      CALL SYSTEM$SEND_SNOWFLAKE_NOTIFICATION(
        SNOWFLAKE.NOTIFICATION.TEXT_PLAIN(:result_str),
        '{"my_slack_integration": {}}'
      );
    END;
```

### Information logged for dynamic table events

When a dynamic table refreshes, an event is logged to the event table. The following sections describe the event table row that
represents the event:

* Event table column values
* Key-value pairs in the resource_attributes column
* Key-value pairs in the record column

#### Event table column values

When a dynamic table refreshes, a row with the following values is inserted into the event table.
