# H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS

Returns an [array](../data-types-semistructured.md) of VARCHAR values of the hexadecimal IDs of
[H3](../data-types-geospatial.md) cells that have centroids contained by a Polygon
(specified by a [GEOGRAPHY](../data-types-geospatial.md) object).

See also:
:   H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS , [H3_COVERAGE_STRINGS](h3_coverage_strings.md)

## Syntax

```sqlsyntax
H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS( <geography_polygon> , <target_resolution> )
```

## Arguments

`geography_polygon`
:   A GEOGRAPHY object that represents a Polygon.

`target_resolution`
:   An INTEGER between 0 and 15 (inclusive) that specifies the H3 [resolution](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable) that you want to use for the returned H3 cells.

    Specifying any other INTEGER value results in an error.

## Returns

Returns an array of VARCHAR values for the hexadecimal IDs of the H3 cells that have centroids contained in the specified input
Polygon.

## Usage notes

* The function uses planar approximation, which treats points on the Earth’s surface as if they were connected by straight lines,
  rather than curved arcs. If you need a spherical approximation, use [H3_COVERAGE_STRINGS](h3_coverage_strings.md) instead.
* A cell is considered to be within the Polygon if its centroid is contained by the Polygon.

## Examples

The following example returns an ARRAY of VARCHAR values representing the hexadecimal IDs of H3 cells that have centroids
contained in the specified Polygon.

```sqlexample
SELECT H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS(
  TO_GEOGRAPHY(
    'POLYGON((-122.481889 37.826683,-122.479487 37.808548,-122.474150 37.808904,-122.476510 37.826935,-122.481889 37.826683))'),
  9) AS h3_cells_in_polygon;
```

```output
+----------------------+
| H3_CELLS_IN_POLYGON  |
|----------------------|
| [                    |
