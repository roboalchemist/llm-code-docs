# Create and manage offers

Providers can create both standard and private offers.

* Standard offers are displayed in the pricing section of a listing. With standard offers, providers can allow self-serve purchases or send consumers to their sales team using a Contact sales option.
* Private offers are only visible to targeted consumers. With private offers, providers can offer custom discounts and terms.

## Prerequisites

* A provider profile. For more information, see [Set up a provider profile](../../../../collaboration/provider-becoming.md).
* A published listing. For more information, see [Create a new listing](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/provider-listings-creating-publishing).
* An account that allows payment for listings. For more information, see [Set up Stripe to get paid for listings](../../../../collaboration/provider-becoming.md).

## Required privileges

* You must use the ACCOUNTADMIN role or a role that has been granted the provider privileges. For more information, see [Privileges required for working with listings](../../../../collaboration/provider-becoming.md).

## Working with offers

The Offers tab shows a list of both standard and private offers that are available for a listing. The table includes the following information about each offer:

The following details are available for Standard offers:

> * Offer name
> * Status (Draft, Active, Retired)
> * Type (Self-serve or Sales-led)
> * Last updated date
> * Display order

The following details are available for Private offers:

* Offer name
* Status (Draft, Active, Withdrawn, Expired)
* Expiration date
* Target consumer
* Pricing planTerms
* Last updated date

Each row in an Offers table includes an action button  that you can select to view additional options for managing the offer.

Standard offers provide the following actions:

* View details
* Edit offer
* Display order (not available for Retired or Draft offers)
* Retire offer (not available for Retired or Draft offers)

Private offers provide the following actions:

* Copy offer URL
* View details
* Edit offer (not available for Active offers)
* Withdraw offer (not available for Expired offers)

## Limitations

When providers include a discount in an offer, the discount isn’t automatically applied to the [SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT](../../../../sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event.md) charges.

1. To apply the discount, store the discounted price in your app.

   You can also run the [SHOW OFFERS](../../../../sql-reference/sql/show-offers.md) command to retrieve the discount amount that’s included in an offer.
2. After retrieving the discount, emit the final dollar amount in the [SYSTEM$CREATE_BILLING_EVENT](../../../../sql-reference/functions/system_create_billing_event.md) call.

   Do not send the undiscounted price.

For more information about creating billing events, see [Billable event examples](../../../../developer-guide/native-apps/adding-custom-event-billing.md).

      2. Specify the contract type:

         * Limited-time: This grants access for a fixed period of time, such as 30 days. Consumers can be charged upfront or in installments
         * Recurring (Subscription): This grants continuous access. Consumers are billed at the chosen frequency for the contract duration, and the subscription auto-renews until the consumer [cancels](consumers-manage-offers.md) the purchase.
         > **Note:**
         >
         > You can’t specify a contract type for usage-based pricing plans.
      > 1. Enter a contract duration to indicate the length of time that the offer is valid for.

## Create a one-time pricing offer

One-time pricing plans allow providers to create a private offer that isn’t tied to a pricing plan. When you extend a one-time pricing offer to a consumer, the consumer is charged a single, upfront fee for access to the data product for a specified duration.

      3. Enter a contract duration to indicate the length of time that the offer is valid for.
      4. Specify payment options for the offer:

         * Require full payment upfront: The consumer pays the total contract value (TCV) at the start of the contract.
         * Accept installments: Allow the consumer to pay in equal monthly installments or specify custom installment amounts.

           If you select the Accept installments option, you can specify the number of installments and the installment amount.
      5. Specify the first invoice date.

         The first invoice date is the date when the consumer will be billed for the first time.
      6. Select whether to require a credit card to be on file.

   PUT file:///local/path/to/manifest.yaml @DB.SCHEMA.STAGE/listings/my_manifest
     SOURCE_COMPRESSION=NONE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE;
   ```
10. Create a listing that uses the manifest files uploaded to the stage.
