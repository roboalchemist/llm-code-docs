# Known limitations to Document AI

This topic describes known limitations to Document AI.

Document AI has the following limitations:

* Document AI supports processing documents in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, and Polish. The results for other languages might not be satisfactory.
* Document AI supports processing documents of specific formats and sizes.

  For more information, see [Prepare your documents for Document AI](preparing-documents.md).
* Document AI supports processing a maximum of 1000 documents in one query.
* Document AI does not support multiple users working on the same model build at the same time in Snowsight. For example,
  two users cannot upload documents or review answers within the same model build at the same time.
* Document AI does not support double quotes around identifiers for the database and schema.
* Document AI does not support altering a database or a schema where the model build is located.
* Document AI does not support [serverless tasks](../../tasks-intro.md).
* Document AI does not currently support renaming models.
* Document AI is available to accounts in AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud commercial regions, with some exceptions. For more information, see Document AI availability.
* The Document AI model returns answers that are up to 512 tokens long (about 320 words) per question.

  The model for table extraction returns answers that are up to 2048 tokens long.
* For internal stages, Document AI supports using server-side encryption only.
