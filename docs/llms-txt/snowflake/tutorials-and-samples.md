# Snowflake Data Clean Room tutorials, samples, and videos

## Tutorials

Here are tutorials to try out using Snowflake Data Clean Rooms when you’re just getting started:

* [Basic UI tutorial, single account](tutorials/cleanroom-web-app-single-account-tutorial.md): Demonstrates a
  simple overlap analysis and consumer activation, using a single Snowflake account. Single account testing supports most, but not all
  clean room features. To test the full functionality of a clean room, must use multiple Snowflake accounts.
* [Basic UI tutorial, two accounts](tutorials/cleanroom-web-app-tutorial.md): Demonstrates a simple overlap
  analysis and provider activation using two Snowflake accounts.
* [Basic API tutorial, single account](tutorials/cleanroom-api-tutorial-basic.md): Demonstrates using the API to
  create and run a custom template using a single Snowflake account.

## Sample notebooks and worksheets

Many of the use case topics include full running samples of Snowflake Data Clean Rooms as downloadable notebooks or worksheets. You
need a Snowflake account with the clean rooms API environment installed to run any of these samples, and you must be able to use the
SAMOOHA_APP_ROLE role.
