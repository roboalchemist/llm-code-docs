# Introduction to external tables

An *external table* is a Snowflake feature that you can use to query data stored in an [external stage](data-load-overview.md)
as if the data were inside a table in Snowflake. The external stage is not part of Snowflake, so Snowflake doesn’t store or manage the
stage. To harden your security posture, you can configure the external stage for [outbound private connectivity](private-connectivity-outbound.md)
to access the external table by using private connectivity.

External tables let you store (within Snowflake) certain file-level metadata, including filenames, version identifiers,
and related properties. External tables can access data stored in any format that the [COPY INTO <table>](../sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.md) command supports,
except XML.

External tables are read-only. You can’t perform data manipulation language (DML) operations on external tables.
However, you can use external tables for query and join operations. You can also create views against external tables.

Querying data in an external table might be slower than querying data that you store natively in a table within Snowflake. To improve query
performance, you can use a [materialized view](views-materialized.md) based on an external table.
For optimal query performance when you work with Parquet files, consider using [Apache Iceberg™ tables](tables-iceberg.md) instead.

> **Note:**
>
> If Snowflake encounters an error while scanning a file in cloud storage during a query operation,
> the file is skipped and scanning continues on the next file. A query can partially scan a file and return the rows scanned before the error
> was encountered.

## Planning the schema of an external table

The following sections describe the options available to you to plan your external tables.

### Schema on read

All external tables include the following columns:

VALUE:
:   A VARIANT type column that represents a single row in the external file.

METADATA$FILENAME:
:   A pseudocolumn that identifies the name of each staged data file that is included in the external table, including its path in the stage.

METADATA$FILE_ROW_NUMBER:
:   A pseudocolumn that shows the row number for each record in a staged data file.

To create external tables, you are only required to have some knowledge of the file format and record format of the source data files.
Knowing the schema of the data files isn’t required.

> **Note:**
>
> [SELECT](../sql-reference/sql/select.md) `*` always returns the VALUE column, in which all regular or semi-structured data is cast to variant rows.

### Virtual columns

If you’re familiar with the schema of the source data files, you can create additional virtual columns as expressions by using the VALUE
column and the METADATA$FILENAME or METADATA$FILE_ROW_NUMBER pseudocolumns. When the external data is scanned, the data types of any
specified fields or semi-structured data elements in the data file must match the data types of these additional columns in the external
table. This requirement enables strong type checking and schema validation over the external data.

### General file sizing recommendations

To optimize the number of parallel scanning operations when you query external tables, we recommend the following file or row group sizes
per format:

| Format | Recommended size range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parquet files | 256 - 512 MB |  |
| Parquet row groups | 16 - 256 MB | When Parquet files include multiple row groups, Snowflake can operate on each row group in a different server. For improved query performance, we recommend sizing Parquet files in the recommended range; or, if large file sizes are necessary, including multiple row groups in each file. |
| All other supported file formats | 16 - 256 MB |  |

For optimal performance when querying large data files, create and query
materialized views over external tables.

### Partitioned external tables

We strongly recommend partitioning your external tables, which requires that your underlying data is organized using logical paths that
include date, time, country, or similar dimensions in the path. Partitioning divides your external table data into multiple parts using
partition columns.

An external table definition can include multiple partition columns, which impose a multi-dimensional structure on the external data.
Partitions are stored in the external table metadata.

Partitioning improves query performance. Because the external data is partitioned into separate slices or parts, query
response time is faster when processing a small part of the data instead of scanning the entire data set.

Based on your individual use cases, you can do either of the following:

* Add new partitions automatically by refreshing an external table that defines an expression for each partition column.
* Add new partitions manually.

Partition columns are defined when an external table is created, using the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE … PARTITION BY syntax. After an external
table is created, the method by which partitions are added can’t be changed.

The following sections explain the different options for adding partitions in greater detail. For examples, see
[CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md).

#### Partitions added automatically

An external table creator defines partition columns in a new external table as expressions that parse the path or filename information
stored in the METADATA$FILENAME pseudocolumn. A partition consists of all data files that match the path or filename in the expression
for the partition column.

The following CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE syntax adds partitions automatically based on expressions:

```sqlsyntax
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE
  <table_name>
     ( <part_col_name> <col_type> AS <part_expr> )
     [ , ... ]
  [ PARTITION BY ( <part_col_name> [, <part_col_name> ... ] ) ]
  ..
```

Snowflake computes and adds partitions based on the defined partition column expressions when external table metadata is refreshed. By
default, the metadata is refreshed automatically when the object is created. In addition, the object owner can configure the metadata to
refresh automatically when new or updated data files are available in the external stage. The owner can alternatively refresh the metadata
manually by executing the ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … REFRESH command.

#### Partitions added manually

An external table creator determines the partition type of a new external table as *user-defined* and specifies only the data types of
partition columns. Use this option when you prefer to add and remove partitions selectively rather than add partitions automatically
for all new files in an external storage location that match an expression.

You generally choose this option to synchronize external tables with other metastores (for example, AWS Glue or Apache Hive).

The following CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE syntax manually adds partitions:

```sqlsyntax
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE
  <table_name>
     ( <part_col_name> <col_type> AS <part_expr> )
     [ , ... ]
  [ PARTITION BY ( <part_col_name> [, <part_col_name> ... ] ) ]
  PARTITION_TYPE = USER_SPECIFIED
  ..
```

Include the required `PARTITION_TYPE = USER_SPECIFIED` parameter.

The partition column definitions are expressions that parse the column metadata in the internal (hidden)
METADATA$EXTERNAL_TABLE_PARTITION column.

The object owner adds partitions to the external table metadata manually by running the ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … ADD PARTITION command:

```sqlsyntax
ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE <name> ADD PARTITION ( <part_col_name> = '<string>' [ , <part_col_name> = '<string>' ] ) LOCATION '<path>'
```

Automatically refreshing an external table with user-defined partitions isn’t supported. Attempting to manually refresh this type of
external table produces a user error.

### Delta Lake support

> **Note:**
>
> This feature is still supported but will be deprecated in a future release.
>
> Consider using an [Apache Iceberg™ table](tables-iceberg.md) instead. Iceberg tables
> use an [external volume](tables-iceberg.md)
> to connect to Delta table files in your cloud storage.
>
> For more information, see [Iceberg tables](tables-iceberg.md) and [CREATE ICEBERG TABLE (Delta files in object storage)](../sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-delta.md).
> You can also Migrate a Delta external table to Apache Iceberg™.

[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is a table format on your data lake that supports ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)
transactions among other features. All data in Delta Lake is stored in Apache Parquet format. You can create external tables that reference your
cloud storage locations enhanced with Delta Lake.

To create an external table that references a Delta Lake, set the `TABLE_FORMAT = DELTA` parameter in the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE
statement.

When you set this parameter, the external table scans for Delta Lake transaction log files in the `[ WITH ] LOCATION` location. Delta
log files have names like `_delta_log/00000000000000000000.json` or `_delta_log/00000000000000000010.checkpoint.parquet`.
When the metadata for an external table is refreshed, Snowflake parses the Delta Lake transaction logs and determines which Parquet files
are current. In the background, the refresh performs add and remove file operations to keep the external table metadata in sync.

For more information, including examples, see [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md).

> **Note:**
>
> * External tables that reference Delta Lake files don’t support deletion vectors.
> * Automated refreshes aren’t supported for this feature because
>   the ordering of event notifications triggered by Data Definition Language (DDL) operations in cloud storage isn’t guaranteed. To register any added or removed files,
>   periodically run an
>   [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … REFRESH](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md) statement.

#### Migrate a Delta external table to Apache Iceberg™

To migrate one or more external tables that reference a Delta Lake to [Apache Iceberg™ tables](tables-iceberg.md),
complete the following steps:

1. Use the [SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES](../sql-reference/sql/show-external-tables.md) command to retrieve the `location` (external stage and folder path)
   for the external table(s).

   For example, the following command returns information for external tables and filters on names like `my_delta_ext_table`:

   ```sqlexample
   SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES LIKE 'my_delta_ext_table';
   ```

2. [Create an external volume](tables-iceberg-configure-external-volume.md); specify the location that you retrieved in
   the previous step as the `STORAGE_BASE_URL`.

   To create a single external volume for multiple Delta tables under the same storage location,
   set the external volume’s active location (`STORAGE_BASE_URL`) as the common root directory.

   For example, consider the following locations for three Delta tables that branch from the same storage location:

   * `s3://my-bucket/delta-ext-table-1/`
   * `s3://my-bucket/delta-ext-table-2/`
   * `s3://my-bucket/delta-ext-table-3/`

   As shown in the following example, specify the bucket as the `STORAGE_BASE_URL` when you create the external volume. Later, you can specify the relative path
   to the table files (for example, `delta-ext-table-1/`) as the `BASE_LOCATION` when you create an Iceberg table:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL VOLUME delta_migration_ext_vol
   STORAGE_LOCATIONS = (
     (
       NAME = storage_location_1
       STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'S3'
       STORAGE_BASE_URL = 's3://my-bucket/'
       STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/my-storage-role' )
   );
   ```

3. [Create a catalog integration for Delta tables](tables-iceberg-configure-catalog-integration-object-storage.md).
4. Create an Iceberg table by using the [CREATE ICEBERG TABLE (Delta files in object storage)](../sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-delta.md) command.
   The `BASE_LOCATION` of the external volume must point to the existing external table location.

   The following example creates an Iceberg table based on external table files located in `s3://my-bucket/delta-ext-table-1/`, and
   references the external volume created previously. To determine the full storage location for the table, Snowflake appends the `BASE_LOCATION`
   to the `STORAGE_BASE_URL` of the external volume:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE ICEBERG TABLE my_delta_table_1
     BASE_LOCATION = 'delta-ext-table-1'
     EXTERNAL_VOLUME = 'delta_migration_ext_vol'
     CATALOG = 'delta_catalog_integration';
   ```

5. Drop the external table:

   ```sqlexample
   DROP EXTERNAL TABLE my_delta_ext_table_1;
   ```

### Add or drop columns

To alter an existing external table to add or remove columns, use the following ALTER TABLE syntax:

* Add columns: ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN.
* Remove columns: ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN.

> **Note:**
>
> The default VALUE column and METADATA$FILENAME and METADATA$FILE_ROW_NUMBER pseudocolumns can’t be dropped.

For more information, see the example in [ALTER TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-table.md).

### Protection of external tables

You can protect an external table by using a masking policy and a row access policy. For more information, see the following topics:

* [Masking policies and external tables](security-column-intro.md).
* [Row access policies and external tables](security-row-intro.md).

## Materialized views over external tables

In many cases, [materialized views](views-materialized.md) over external
tables can provide faster performance than equivalent queries over the underlying
external table. When you run a query frequently or your query is sufficiently complex, materialized views can be significantly faster.

Refresh the file-level metadata in any queried external tables so that your
materialized views reflect the current set of files in the referenced cloud storage
location.

You can refresh the metadata for an external table
automatically by using the event notification
service for your cloud storage service or by manually using
[ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … REFRESH](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md) statements.

## Automatically refreshing external table metadata

You can automatically refresh the metadata for an external table by using the event notification service for your cloud storage service.

The refresh operation synchronizes the metadata with the latest set of associated files in the external stage and path, that is:

> * New files in the path are added to the table metadata.
> * Changes to files in the path are updated in the table metadata.
> * Files no longer in the path are removed from the table metadata.

For more information, see [Refresh external tables automatically](tables-external-auto.md).

## Billing for external tables

Snowflake includes an overhead in your charges to manage event notifications for the automatic refreshing of external table metadata. This overhead increases in
relation to the number of files added in cloud storage for the external stages and paths specified for your external tables. This overhead
charge appears as Snowpipe charges in your billing statement because Snowpipe is used for event notifications for the automatic external
table refreshes. You can estimate this charge by querying the [PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/pipe_usage_history.md) function or examining the Account Usage [PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY view](../sql-reference/account-usage/pipe_usage_history.md).

In addition, Snowflake includes a small maintenance-overhead charge for manually refreshing the external table metadata (using ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE …
REFRESH). This overhead is charged in accordance with the standard [cloud services billing model](cost-understanding-compute.md),
like all similar activity in Snowflake. Manual refreshes of standard external tables are cloud services operations only; however, manual
refreshes of external tables enhanced with Delta Lake rely on user-managed compute resources (that is, a virtual warehouse).

Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role, or a role with the global MONITOR USAGE privilege, can query the
[AUTO_REFRESH_REGISTRATION_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/auto_refresh_registration_history.md) table function to retrieve the history of data files registered in the
metadata of specified objects and the credits that are billed for these operations.

## Overview of setup and load workflows

> **Note:**
>
> External tables don’t support storage versioning (S3 versioning, Object Versioning in Google Cloud Storage, or versioning for Azure Storage).

### Amazon S3 workflow

The following steps provide a high-level overview of the setup and load workflow for external tables that reference Amazon S3 stages. For complete instructions, see [Refresh external tables automatically for Amazon S3](tables-external-s3.md):

1. Create a named stage object (by using [CREATE STAGE](../sql-reference/sql/create-stage.md)) that references the external location (that is, S3 bucket) where your data files are staged.
2. Create an external table (by using [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md)) that references the named stage.
3. Manually refresh the external table metadata by using [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md) … REFRESH to synchronize the metadata with the current list of files in the stage path. This step also verifies the settings in your external table definition.
4. Configure an event notification for the S3 bucket. Snowflake relies on event notifications to continually refresh the external table metadata to maintain consistency with the staged files.
5. Manually refresh the external table metadata one more time by using ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … REFRESH to synchronize the metadata with any changes that occurred after Step 3. Thereafter, the S3 event notifications trigger the metadata refresh automatically.
6. Configure Snowflake access control privileges for any additional roles to grant them query access to the external table.

### Google Cloud Storage workflow

The following steps provide a high-level overview of the setup and load workflow for external tables that reference Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
stages:

1. Configure a Google Pub/Sub subscription for GCS events.
2. Create a notification integration in Snowflake. A notification integration is a Snowflake object that provides an interface between
   Snowflake and third-party cloud message queuing services such as Pub/Sub.
3. Create a named stage object (by using [CREATE STAGE](../sql-reference/sql/create-stage.md)) that references the external location (that is, GCS bucket) where
   your data files are staged.
4. Create an external table (by using [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md)) that references the named stage and integration.
5. Manually refresh the external table metadata one time by using [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md) … REFRESH to synchronize the
   metadata with any changes that occurred after Step 4. Thereafter, the Pub/Sub notifications trigger the metadata refresh automatically.
6. Configure Snowflake access control privileges for any additional roles to grant them query access to the external table.

### Microsoft Azure workflow

The following steps provide a high-level overview of the setup and load workflow for external tables that reference Azure stages. For complete instructions, see [Refresh external tables automatically for Azure Blob Storage](tables-external-azure.md):

1. Configure an Event Grid subscription for Azure Storage events.
2. Create a notification integration in Snowflake. A notification integration is a Snowflake object that provides an interface between Snowflake and third-party cloud message queuing services such as Microsoft Event Grid.
3. Create a named stage object (by using [CREATE STAGE](../sql-reference/sql/create-stage.md)) that references the external location (that is, Azure container) where your data files are staged.
4. Create an external table (by using [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md)) that references the named stage and integration.
5. Manually refresh the external table metadata one time by using [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md) … REFRESH to synchronize the metadata with any changes that occurred after Step 4. Thereafter, the Event Grid notifications trigger the metadata refresh automatically.
6. Configure Snowflake access control privileges for any additional roles to grant them query access to the external table.

## Querying external tables

[Query](../guides-overview-queries.md) external tables just as you would standard tables.

Snowflake omits query results for records that contain invalid UTF-8 data. After encountering invalid data,
Snowflake continues to scan the file without returning an error message.

To avoid missing records in your query results caused by invalid UTF-8 data, specify `REPLACE_INVALID_CHARACTERS = TRUE` for your
[file format](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md).
Doing so replaces any invalid UTF-8 characters with the Unicode replacement character (`�`) when you query the table.

For Parquet files, you can also set `BINARY_AS_TEXT = FALSE` for your file format so that Snowflake interprets the columns
with no defined logical data type as binary data instead of as UTF-8 text.

### Filtering records in Parquet files

To use row group statistics to prune data in Parquet files, you can include either partition columns, regular
columns, or both in a WHERE clause. The following limitations apply:

* The clause can’t include any VARIANT columns.
* The clause can only include one or more of the following [comparison operators](../sql-reference/operators-comparison.md):

  * =
  * >
  * <
* The clause can only include one or more [logical/Boolean operators](../sql-reference/operators-logical.md), as well as the
  [STARTSWITH](../sql-reference/functions/startswith.md) SQL function.

In addition, queries in the form `"value:<path>::<data type>"` (or the [GET](../sql-reference/functions/get.md)/
[GET_PATH , :](../sql-reference/functions/get_path.md) function equivalent) use the vectorized scanner. Queries in the form
`"value"` or simply `"value:<path>"` are processed by using the non-vectorized scanner. Convert all time-zone data to a standard
time zone by using the [CONVERT_TIMEZONE](../sql-reference/functions/convert_timezone.md) function for queries that use the vectorized scanner.

You might get better pruning results when files are sorted by a key included in a query filter, and if there are multiple row groups in the files, .

The following table shows similar query structures that show the behaviors in this section, where `et` is an external table and `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` are virtual columns:

| Optimized | Not optimized |
| --- | --- |
| `SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM et;` | `SELECT value:c1, c2, c3 FROM et;` |
| `SELECT c1, c2, c3  FROM et WHERE c1 = 'foo';`  `SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM et WHERE value:c1::string = 'foo';` | `SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM et WHERE value:c1 = 'foo';` |

### Persisted query results

Similar to tables, the query results for external tables [persist](querying-persisted-results.md) for 24 hours. Within this 24-hour period, the following operations invalidate and purge the query result cache for external tables:

* Any DDL operation that modifies the external table definition. This includes explicitly modifying the external table definition (by using ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE) or recreating the external table (by using [CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md)).
* Changes in the set of files in cloud storage that are registered in the external table metadata. Either automatic refresh operations by using the event notification service for the storage location or manual refresh operations (by using ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE … REFRESH) invalidate the result cache.

> **Note:**
>
> Changes in the referenced files in cloud storage don’t invalidate the query results cache in the following circumstances, which lead to outdated query results:
>
> * The automated refresh operation is turned off (that is, AUTO_REFRESH = FALSE) or isn’t configured correctly.
> * The external table metadata isn’t refreshed manually.

## Example: Remove older staged files from external table metadata

The following steps provide an example of how you can use an [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md) … REMOVE FILES statement to remove older staged files from the metadata in an external table . The stored procedure removes the files from the metadata based on their last modified date in the stage:

1. Create the stored procedure by using a [CREATE PROCEDURE](../sql-reference/sql/create-procedure.md) statement:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE or replace PROCEDURE remove_old_files(external_table_name varchar, num_days float)
     RETURNS varchar
     LANGUAGE javascript
     EXECUTE AS CALLER
     AS
     $$
     // 1. Get the relative path of the external table
     // 2. Find all files registered before the specified time period
     // 3. Remove the files

     var resultSet1 = snowflake.execute({ sqlText:
       `call exttable_bucket_relative_path('` + EXTERNAL_TABLE_NAME + `');`
     });
     resultSet1.next();
     var relPath = resultSet1.getColumnValue(1);

     var resultSet2 = snowflake.execute({ sqlText:
       `select file_name
        from table(information_schema.EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILES (
            TABLE_NAME => '` + EXTERNAL_TABLE_NAME +`'))
        where last_modified < dateadd(day, -` + NUM_DAYS + `, current_timestamp());`
     });

     var fileNames = [];
     while (resultSet2.next())
     {
       fileNames.push(resultSet2.getColumnValue(1).substring(relPath.length));
     }

     if (fileNames.length == 0)
     {
       return 'nothing to do';
     }

     var alterCommand = `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ` + EXTERNAL_TABLE_NAME + ` REMOVE FILES ('` + fileNames.join(`', '`) + `');`;

     var resultSet3 = snowflake.execute({ sqlText: alterCommand });

     var results = [];
     while (resultSet3.next())
     {
       results.push(resultSet3.getColumnValue(1) + ' -> ' + resultSet3.getColumnValue(2));
     }

     return results.length + ' files: \n' + results.join('\n');

     $$;

     CREATE or replace PROCEDURE exttable_bucket_relative_path(external_table_name varchar)
     RETURNS varchar
     LANGUAGE javascript
     EXECUTE AS CALLER
     AS
     $$
     var resultSet = snowflake.execute({ sqlText:
       `show external tables like '` + EXTERNAL_TABLE_NAME + `';`
     });

     resultSet.next();
     var location = resultSet.getColumnValue(10);

     var relPath = location.split('/').slice(3).join('/');
     return relPath.endsWith("/") ? relPath : relPath + "/";

     $$;
   ```

2. Call the stored procedure:

   ```sqlexample
   -- Remove all files from the exttable external table metadata:
   call remove_old_files('exttable', 0);

   -- Remove files staged longer than 90 days ago from the exttable external table metadata:
   call remove_old_files('exttable', 90);
   ```

   Alternatively, you can create a task by using [CREATE TASK](../sql-reference/sql/create-task.md) to call the stored procedure periodically to remove older files from the external table metadata.

## Apache Hive metastore integration

Snowflake supports integrating [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) metastores with Snowflake by using external tables. The Hive connector detects metastore events and transmits the events to Snowflake to keep the external tables synchronized with the Hive metastore. With this capability, users can manage their data in Hive while querying it from Snowflake.

For instructions, see [Integrate Apache Hive metastores with Snowflake](tables-external-hive.md).

## External table DDL

To support creating and managing external tables, Snowflake provides the following set of special DDL commands:

* [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.md)
* [ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/alter-external-table.md)
* [DROP EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/drop-external-table.md)
* [DESCRIBE EXTERNAL TABLE](../sql-reference/sql/desc-external-table.md)
* [SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES](../sql-reference/sql/show-external-tables.md)

## Required access privileges

Creating and managing external tables requires a role with a minimum of the following role permissions:

| Object | Privilege |
| --- | --- |
| Database | USAGE |
| Schema | USAGE, CREATE STAGE (if creating a new stage), CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE |
| Stage (if using an existing stage) | USAGE |

## Information Schema

The [Snowflake Information Schema](../sql-reference/info-schema.md) includes views and table functions you can query to retrieve information about your external tables and their staged data files.

### View

[EXTERNAL_TABLES view](../sql-reference/info-schema/external_tables.md)
:   Displays information for external tables in the specified (or current) database.

### Table functions

[AUTO_REFRESH_REGISTRATION_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/auto_refresh_registration_history.md)
:   Retrieve the history of data files that are registered in the metadata of specified objects and the credits billed for these operations.

[EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILES](../sql-reference/functions/external_table_files.md)
:   Retrieve information about the staged data files that are included in the metadata for a specified external table.

[EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILE_REGISTRATION_HISTORY](../sql-reference/functions/external_table_registration_history.md)
:   Retrieve information about the metadata history for an external table, including any errors found when refreshing the metadata.
