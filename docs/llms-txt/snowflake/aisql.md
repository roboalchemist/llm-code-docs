# Snowflake Cortex AI Functions (including LLM functions)

Use Cortex AI Functions in Snowflake to run unstructured analytics on text and images with industry-leading LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek.
AI Functions support use cases such as:

* Extracting entities to enrich metadata and streamline validation
* Aggregating insights across customer tickets
* Filtering and classifying content by natural language
* Sentiment and aspect-based analysis for service improvement
* Translating and localizing multilingual content
* Parsing documents for analytics and RAG pipelines

All models are fully hosted in Snowflake, ensuring performance, scalability, and governance while keeping your data secure and in place.

## Available functions

Snowflake Cortex features are provided as SQL functions and are also available in Python.
Cortex AI Functions can be grouped into the following categories:

* Cortex AI functions
* Helper functions

### Cortex AI functions

These task-specific functions are purpose-built managed functions that automate routine tasks, like simple summaries and
quick translations, that don’t require any customization.

* [AI_COMPLETE](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_complete.md): Generates a completion for a given text string or image using a selected LLM. Use this function for most generative AI tasks.

  * AI_COMPLETE is the updated version of [COMPLETE (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/complete-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [AI_CLASSIFY](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_classify.md): Classifies text or images into user-defined categories.

  * AI_CLASSIFY is the updated version of [CLASSIFY_TEXT (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/classify_text-snowflake-cortex.md) with support for multi-label and image classification.
* [AI_FILTER](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_filter.md): Returns True or False for a given text or image input, allowing you to filter results in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `JOIN ... ON` clauses.
* [AI_AGG](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_agg.md): Aggregates a text column and returns insights across multiple rows based on a user-defined prompt. This function isn’t subject to context window limitations.
* [AI_EMBED](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_embed.md): Generates an embedding vector for a text or image input, which can be used for similarity search, clustering, and classification tasks.

  * AI_EMBED is the updated version of [EMBED_TEXT_1024 (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/embed_text_1024-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [AI_EXTRACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_extract.md): Extracts information from an input string or file, for example, text, images, and documents. Supports multiple languages.

  * AI_EXTRACT is the updated version of [EXTRACT_ANSWER (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/extract_answer-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [AI_SENTIMENT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_sentiment.md): Extracts sentiment from text.

  * AI_SENTIMENT is the updated version of [SENTIMENT (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/sentiment-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [AI_SUMMARIZE_AGG](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_summarize_agg.md): Aggregates a text column and returns a summary across multiple rows. This function isn’t subject to context window limitations.
* [AI_SIMILARITY](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_similarity.md): Calculates the embedding similarity between two inputs.
* [AI_TRANSCRIBE](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_transcribe.md): Transcribes audio and video files stored in a stage, extracting text, timestamps, and speaker information.
* [AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_parse_document.md): Extracts text (using OCR mode) or text with layout information
  (using LAYOUT mode) from documents in an internal or external stage. Can also extract images found in a document.

  * AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT is the updated version of [PARSE_DOCUMENT (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/parse_document-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [AI_REDACT](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_redact.md): Redact personally identifiable information (PII) from text.
* [AI_TRANSLATE](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_translate.md): Translates text between supported languages.

  * AI_TRANSLATE is the updated version of [TRANSLATE (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/translate-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [SUMMARIZE (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/summarize-snowflake-cortex.md): Returns a summary of the text that you’ve specified.

### Helper functions

Helper functions are purpose-built managed functions that reduce cases of failures when running other Cortex AI Functions, for example by
getting the count of tokens in an input prompt to ensure the call doesn’t exceed a model limit.

* [TO_FILE](../../sql-reference/functions/to_file.md): Creates a reference to a file in an internal or external stage for use with
  AI_COMPLETE and other functions that accept files.
* [AI_COUNT_TOKENS](../../sql-reference/functions/ai_count_tokens.md): Given an input text, returns the token count based on the model or Cortex
  function specified.

  * AI_COUNT_TOKENS is the updated version of [COUNT_TOKENS (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/count_tokens-snowflake-cortex.md).
* [PROMPT](../../sql-reference/functions/prompt.md): Helps you build prompt objects for use with AI_COMPLETE and other functions.
* [TRY_COMPLETE (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)](../../sql-reference/functions/try_complete-snowflake-cortex.md): Works like the COMPLETE function, but returns NULL
  when the function could not execute instead of an error code.

### Cortex Guard

Cortex Guard is an option of the AI_COMPLETE (or SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE) function designed to filter possible unsafe and harmful responses from a
language model. Cortex Guard is currently built with Meta’s Llama Guard 3. Cortex Guard works by evaluating the responses of a language
model before that output is returned to the application. Once you activate Cortex Guard, language model responses which may be associated
with violent crimes, hate, sexual content, self-harm, and more are automatically filtered. See
[COMPLETE arguments](../../sql-reference/functions/complete-snowflake-cortex.md) for syntax and examples.

> **Note:**
>
> Usage of Cortex Guard incurs compute charges based on the number of input tokens processed,
> in addition to the charges for the AI_COMPLETE function.

## Performance considerations

Cortex AI Functions are optimized for throughput. We recommend using these functions to process numerous inputs such as text from large SQL tables. Batch processing is typically better suited for AI Functions. For more interactive use cases where latency is important, use the REST API. These are available for simple inference (Complete API), embedding (Embed API) and agentic applications (Agents API).

## Cortex LLM privileges

This section describes the privileges required for users to access Snowflake Cortex AI Functions. It covers how to control and grant access to these functions using roles and account-level privileges.

### USE AI FUNCTIONS on the account privilege

> **Important:**
>
> Your users need both the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege and the CORTEX_USER role to use all Snowflake Cortex AI Functions.

The USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege includes the privileges that allow your users to call Snowflake Cortex AI functions. By default, the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege is granted to the PUBLIC role. The PUBLIC role is automatically granted to all users and roles, allowing all users in your account to use the Snowflake Cortex AI functions. If you don’t want all your users to have this privilege, you can revoke access to the PUBLIC role and grant access to other roles.

This section explains how to do the following :

* Revoke the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege from the PUBLIC role
* Grant the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege to specific roles

> **Important:**
>
> You must use the ACCOUNTADMIN role to manage the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege.

To revoke the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege from the PUBLIC role, run the following command:

```sqlexample
REVOKE USE AI FUNCTIONS ON ACCOUNT
FROM ROLE PUBLIC;
```

> **Note:**
>
> Revoking the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege prevents your users from accessing most Snowflake Cortex AI Functions.
> Your users need **both** the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege and the CORTEX_USER role to use ALL Snowflake Cortex AI Functions. If a user has access to the CORTEX_USER role, but not the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege, they can still use the AI_AGG and AI_SUMMARIZE AGG functions.

After you’ve revoked the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege from the PUBLIC role, you can use the ACCOUNTADMIN role to grant it to other roles in your Snowflake account.

The following example:

1. Grants the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege to `cortex_user_role`.
2. Grants the `cortex_user_role` to `example_user`.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

CREATE ROLE cortex_user_role;

GRANT USE AI FUNCTIONS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE cortex_user_role;

GRANT ROLE cortex_user_role TO USER example_user;
```

You can grant access to Snowflake Cortex AI Functions through roles that are commonly used by specific groups of users. For example, if you’ve created an `analyst` role that is used as a default role by analysts in your organization, you can grant these users access to Snowflake Cortex AI Functions with a single [GRANT <privileges> … TO ROLE](../../sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.md) statement. For more information about granting privileges to commonly used roles, see [User roles](../admin-user-management.md).

```sqlexample
GRANT USE AI FUNCTIONS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE analyst;
```

> **Important:**
>
> Currently, USE AI FUNCTIONS does not apply to AI Function queries that are run inside Snowflake native applications. A query with AI Function calls runs successfully regardless of whether the role has USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege.

### Using AI Functions with Restricted Caller’s Rights

To use AI Functions with Restricted Caller’s Rights, you must grant the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege to both the session role and the service or application owner role.

For example, to use AI Functions inside a Snowflake Park Container Services (SPCS) service that runs with Restricted Caller’s Rights:

1. Grant the USE AI FUNCTIONS privilege to the role used in the SPCS session (for example, `CHATBOT_USER_ROLE`):

   ```sqlexample
   GRANT USE AI FUNCTIONS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE CHATBOT_USER_ROLE;
   ```

2. Grant the caller version of the privilege to the service owner role:

   ```sqlexample
   GRANT CALLER USE AI FUNCTIONS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE <service_owner_role>;
   ```

### CORTEX_USER database role

The CORTEX_USER database role in the SNOWFLAKE database includes the privileges that allow users to call Snowflake
Cortex AI Functions. By default, the CORTEX_USER role is granted to the PUBLIC role. The PUBLIC role is automatically granted
to all users and roles, so this allows all users in your account to use the Snowflake Cortex AI functions.

If you don’t want all users to have this privilege, you can revoke access to the PUBLIC role and grant access to other roles.
The SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER database role cannot be granted directly to a user. For more information, see
[Using SNOWFLAKE database roles](../../sql-reference/snowflake-db-roles.md).

To revoke the CORTEX_USER database role from the PUBLIC role, run the following commands using the ACCOUNTADMIN role:

```sqlexample
REVOKE DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER
  FROM ROLE PUBLIC;

REVOKE IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE
  FROM ROLE PUBLIC;
```

You can then selectively provide access to specific roles. A user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can grant this role to a custom role in
order to allow users to access Cortex AI functions. In the following example, use the ACCOUNTADMIN role and grant the user `some_user`
the CORTEX_USER database role via the account role `cortex_user_role`, which you create for this purpose.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

CREATE ROLE cortex_user_role;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE cortex_user_role;

GRANT ROLE cortex_user_role TO USER some_user;
```

You can also grant access to Snowflake Cortex AI functions through existing roles commonly used by specific groups of
users. (See [User roles](../admin-user-management.md).) For example, if you have created an `analyst` role that is used
as a default role by analysts in your organization, you can easily grant these users access to Snowflake Cortex AI
Functions with a single GRANT statement.

```sqlexample
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE analyst;
```

### CORTEX_EMBED_USER database role

The CORTEX_EMBED_USER database role in the SNOWFLAKE database includes the privileges that allow users to call the text
embedding functions AI_EMBED, EMBED_TEXT_768, and EMBED_TEXT_1024 and to create Cortex Search Services with managed
vector embeddings. CORTEX_EMBED_USER allows you to grant embedding privileges separately from other Cortex AI capabilities.

> **Note:**
>
> You can create Cortex Search Services with user-provided embeddings without the CORTEX_EMBED_USER role. In that
> case, you must generate the embeddings yourself, outside of Snowflake, and load them into a table.

Unlike the CORTEX_USER role, the CORTEX_EMBED_USER role is not granted to the PUBLIC role by default. You must
explicitly grant this role to roles that require embedding capabilities if you have revoked the CORTEx_USER role. The
CORTEX_EMBED_USER database role cannot be granted directly to users but must be granted to roles that users can assume.
The following example illustrates this process.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

CREATE ROLE cortex_embed_user_role;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_EMBED_USER TO ROLE cortex_embed_user_role;

GRANT ROLE cortex_embed_user_role TO USER some_user;
```

Alternatively, to give all users access to embedding capabilities, grant the CORTEX_EMBED_USER role to the PUBLIC role as follows.

```sqlexample
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_EMBED_USER TO ROLE PUBLIC;
```

### Using AI Functions in stored procedures with EXECUTE AS RESTRICTED CALLER

To use AI Functions inside stored procedures with `EXECUTE AS RESTRICTED CALLER`, grant the following privileges to the role that created the stored procedure:

```sqlexample
GRANT INHERITED CALLER USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE snowflake TO ROLE <role_that_created_the_stored_procedure>;
GRANT INHERITED CALLER USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN DATABASE snowflake TO ROLE <role_that_created_the_stored_procedure>;
GRANT CALLER USAGE ON DATABASE snowflake TO ROLE <role_that_created_the_stored_procedure>;
```

## Control model access

Snowflake Cortex provides two independent mechanisms to enforce access to models:

* Account-level allowlist parameter (simple, broad control)
* Role-based access control (RBAC) (fine-grained control)

You can use the account-level allowlist to control model access across your entire account, or you can use RBAC to control model access on a per-role basis.
For maximum flexibility, you can also use both mechanisms together, if you can accept additional management complexity.

### Account-level allowlist parameter

You can control model access across your entire account using the CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST parameter. Supported features respect the value of this parameter and prevent use of models that are not in the allowlist.

The CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST parameter can be set to `'All'`, `'None'`, or to a comma-separated list
of model names. This parameter can only be set at the account level, not at the user or session levels. Only the
ACCOUNTADMIN role can set the parameter using the [ALTER ACCOUNT](../../sql-reference/sql/alter-account.md) command.

Examples:

* To allow access to all models:

  ```sqlexample
  ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST = 'All';
  ```

* To allow access to the `mistral-large2` and `llama3.1-70b` models:

  ```sqlexample
  ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST = 'mistral-large2,llama3.1-70b';
  ```

* To prevent access to any model:

  ```sqlexample
  ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST = 'None';
  ```

Use RBAC, as described in the following section, to provide specific roles with access beyond what you’ve specified in the allowlist.

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

Although Cortex models are not themselves Snowflake objects, Snowflake lets you create model objects in the SNOWFLAKE.MODELS schema that *represent* the Cortex models. By applying RBAC to these objects, you can control access to models the same way you would any other Snowflake object. Supported features accept the identifiers of objects in SNOWFLAKE.MODELS wherever a model can be specified.

> **Tip:**
>
> To use RBAC exclusively, set CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST to `'None'`.

#### Refresh model objects and application roles

SNOWFLAKE.MODELS is not automatically populated with the objects that represent Cortex models. You must create these
objects when you first set up model RBAC, and refresh them when you want to apply RBAC to new models.

As ACCOUNTADMIN, run the SNOWFLAKE.MODELS.CORTEX_BASE_MODELS_REFRESH stored procedure to populate the SNOWFLAKE.MODELS
schema with objects representing currently available Cortex models, and to create application roles that correspond to
the models. The procedure also creates CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-ALL, a role that covers all models.

> **Tip:**
>
> You can safely call CORTEX_BASE_MODELS_REFRESH at any time; it will not create duplicate objects or roles.

```sqlexample
CALL SNOWFLAKE.MODELS.CORTEX_BASE_MODELS_REFRESH();
```

After refreshing the model objects, you can verify that the models appear in the SNOWFLAKE.MODELS schema as follows:

```sqlexample
SHOW MODELS IN SNOWFLAKE.MODELS;
```

The returned list of models resembles the following:

| created_on | name | model_type | database_name | schema_name | owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-04-22 09:35:38.558 -0700 | CLAUDE-3-5-SONNET | CORTEX_BASE | SNOWFLAKE | MODELS | SNOWFLAKE |
| 2025-04-22 09:36:16.793 -0700 | LLAMA3.1-405B | CORTEX_BASE | SNOWFLAKE | MODELS | SNOWFLAKE |
| 2025-04-22 09:37:18.692 -0700 | SNOWFLAKE-ARCTIC | CORTEX_BASE | SNOWFLAKE | MODELS | SNOWFLAKE |

To verify that you can see the application roles associated with these models, use the SHOW APPLICATION ROLES command, as in the following example:

```sqlexample
SHOW APPLICATION ROLES IN APPLICATION SNOWFLAKE;
```

The list of application roles resembles the following:

| created_on | name | owner | comment | owner_role_type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-04-22 09:35:38.558 -0700 | CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-ALL | SNOWFLAKE | MODELS | APPLICATION |
| 2025-04-22 09:36:16.793 -0700 | CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-LLAMA3.1-405B | SNOWFLAKE | MODELS | APPLICATION |
| 2025-04-22 09:37:18.692 -0700 | CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-SNOWFLAKE-ARCTIC | SNOWFLAKE | MODELS | APPLICATION |

#### Grant application roles to user roles

After you create the model objects and application roles, you can grant the application roles to specific user roles in your account.

* To grant a role access to a specific model:

  ```sqlexample
  GRANT APPLICATION ROLE SNOWFLAKE."CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-LLAMA3.1-70B" TO ROLE MY_ROLE;
  ```

* To grant a role access to all current and future models:

  ```sqlexample
  GRANT APPLICATION ROLE SNOWFLAKE."CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-ALL" TO ROLE MY_ROLE;
  ```

#### Use model objects with supported features

To use model objects with supported Cortex features, specify the identifier of the model object in SNOWFLAKE.MODELS as the model argument.
You can use a fully-qualified identifier, a partial identifier, or a simple model name that will be automatically resolved to SNOWFLAKE.MODELS.

* Using a fully-qualified identifier:

  ```sqlexample
  SELECT AI_COMPLETE('SNOWFLAKE.MODELS."LLAMA3.1-70B"', 'Hello');
  ```

* Using a partial identifier:

  ```sqlexample
  USE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE;
  USE SCHEMA MODELS;
  SELECT AI_COMPLETE('LLAMA3.1-70B', 'Hello');
  ```

* Using automatic lookup with a simple model name:

  ```sqlexample
  -- Automatically resolves to SNOWFLAKE.MODELS."LLAMA3.1-70B"
  SELECT AI_COMPLETE('llama3.1-70b', 'Hello');
  ```

#### Using RBAC on the account allowlist

A number of Cortex features accept a model name as a string argument, for example `AI_COMPLETE('model', 'prompt')`. When you provide a model name:

1. Cortex first attempts to locate a matching model object in SNOWFLAKE.MODELS. If you provide an unqualified name like `'x'`, it automatically looks for `SNOWFLAKE.MODELS."X"`.
2. If the model object is found, RBAC is applied to determine whether the user can use the model.
3. If no model object is found, the provided string is matched against the account-level allowlist.

The following example illustrates the use of allowlist and RBAC together. In this example, the allowlist is set to allow the `mistral-large2` model, and the user has access to the `LLAMA3.1-70B` model object through RBAC.

```sqlexample
-- set up access
USE SECONDARY ROLES NONE;
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST = 'MISTRAL-LARGE2';
CALL SNOWFLAKE.MODELS.CORTEX_BASE_MODELS_REFRESH();
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE SNOWFLAKE."CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-LLAMA3.1-70B" TO ROLE PUBLIC;

-- test access
USE ROLE PUBLIC;

-- this succeeds because mistral-large2 is in the allowlist
SELECT AI_COMPLETE('MISTRAL-LARGE2', 'Hello');

-- this succeeds because the role has access to the model object
SELECT AI_COMPLETE('SNOWFLAKE.MODELS."LLAMA3.1-70B"', 'Hello');

-- this fails because the first argument is
-- neither an identifier for an accessible model object
-- nor is it a model name in the allowlist
SELECT AI_COMPLETE('SNOWFLAKE-ARCTIC', 'Hello');
```

### Common pitfalls

* Access to a model (whether by allowlist or RBAC) does not always mean that it can be used. It may still be subject to
  cross-region, deprecation, or other availability constraints. These restrictions can result in error messages that
  seem similar to model access errors.
* Model access controls only govern the use of a model and not the use of a feature itself. A feature can have its own access
  controls. For example, access to `AI_COMPLETE` is governed by the `CORTEX_USER` database role and the USE AI FUNCTIONS account-level privilege. For more information, see
  Cortex LLM privileges.
* Not all features support model access controls. For more information about what a feature supports, see the supported features table.
* Secondary roles can obscure permissions. For example, if a user has ACCOUNTADMIN as a secondary role, all model objects may appear
  accessible. Disable secondary roles temporarily when verifying permissions.
* Qualified model object identifiers are quoted and therefore case-sensitive. For more information, see
  [QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE](../../sql-reference/parameters.md).

## Create stage for media files

Cortex AI Functions that process media files (documents, images, audio, or video) require the files to be stored on an
internal or external stage. The stage must use server-side encryption. If you want to be able to query the stage or
programmatically process all the files stored there, the stage must have a directory table.

The SQL below creates a suitable internal stage:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE input_stage
  DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = true )
  ENCRYPTION = ( TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE' );
```

To process files from external object storage (e.g., Amazon S3), create a storage integration, then create an external stage that uses the storage integration. To learn how to configure a Snowflake Storage Integration, see our detailed guides:

* [Amazon S3 storage integration](../data-load-s3-config-storage-integration.md)
* [Azure container integration](../data-load-azure-config.md)
* [Google Cloud Storage integration](../data-load-gcs-config.md)

Create an external stage that references the integration and points to your cloud storage container. This example points to an Amazon S3 bucket:

```sqlexample
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_aisql_media_files
  STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_s3_integration
  URL = 's3://my_bucket/prefix/'
  DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = TRUE )
  ENCRYPTION = ( TYPE = 'AWS_SSE_S3' );
```

With an internal or external stage created, and files stored there, you can use Cortex AI Functions to process media files
stored in the stage. For more information, see:

* [AI Functions – Images](ai-images.md)
* [AI Functions – Audio](ai-audio.md) (also video)
* [AI Functions – Document Parsing](parse-document.md)

> **Note:**
>
> AI Functions are currently incompatible with custom [network policies](../network-policies.md).

### Cortex AI Functions storage best practices

You may find the following best practices helpful when working with media files in stages with Cortex AI Functions:

* Establish a scheme for organizing media files in stages. For example, create a separate stage for each team or
  project, and store the different types of media files in subdirectories.
* Enable directory listings on stages to allow querying and programmatic access to its files.

  > **Tip:**
  >
  > To automatically refresh the directory table for the external stage when new or updated files are available, set
  > AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE when creating the stage.
* For external stages, use fine-grained policies on the cloud provider side (for example, AWS IAM policies)
  to restrict the storage integration’s access to only what is necessary.
* Always use encryption, such as AWS_SSE or SNOWFLAKE_SSE, to protect your data at rest.

## Cost considerations

Snowflake Cortex AI functions incur compute cost based on the number of tokens processed. Refer to the
[Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) for each function’s cost in credits per million tokens.

A token is the smallest unit of text processed by Snowflake Cortex AI functions. An industry convention for text is that a token is approximately equal to four
characters, although this can vary by model, as can token equivalence for media files.

* For functions that generate new text using provided text (AI_COMPLETE, AI_CLASSIFY, AI_FILTER, AI_AGG, AI_SUMMARIZE, and
  AI_TRANSLATE, and their previous versions in the SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX schema), both input and output tokens are billable.
* For Cortex Guard, only input tokens are counted. The number of input tokens is based on the number of tokens output from AI_COMPLETE (or COMPLETE).
  Cortex Guard usage is billed in addition to the cost of the AI_COMPLETE (or COMPLETE) function.
* For AI_SIMILARITY, AI_EMBED, and the SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EMBED_\* functions, only input tokens are counted.
* For EXTRACT_ANSWER, the number of billable tokens is the sum of the number of tokens in the `from_text` and
  `question` fields.
* AI_CLASSIFY, AI_FILTER, AI_AGG, AI_SENTIMENT, AI_SUMMARIZE_AGG, SUMMARIZE, TRANSLATE, AI_TRANSLATE, EXTRACT_ANSWER,
  ENTITY_SENTIMENT, and SENTIMENT add a prompt to the input text in order to generate the response. As a result, the
  billed token count is higher than the number of tokens in the text you provide.
* AI_CLASSIFY labels, descriptions, and examples are counted as input tokens for each record processed, not just once for each AI_CLASSIFY call.
* For AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT (or SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT), billing is based on the number of document pages processed.
* TRY_COMPLETE (SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX) does not incur costs for error handling. If the TRY_COMPLETE(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX) function returns NULL, no cost
  is incurred.
* For AI_EXTRACT, both input and output tokens are counted. The `responseFormat` argument is counted as input tokens.
  For document formats consisting of pages, the number of pages processed is counted as input tokens. Each page in a document is counted as 970 tokens.
* AI_COUNT_TOKENS incurs only compute cost to run the function. No additional token-based costs are incurred.

For models that support media files such as images or audio:

* Audio files are billed at 50 tokens per second of audio.
* The token equivalence of images is determined by the model used. For more information, see
  [AI Image cost considerations](ai-images.md).

Snowflake recommends executing queries that call a Snowflake Cortex AI Function with a smaller
warehouse (no larger than MEDIUM). Larger warehouses do not increase performance. The cost associated with keeping a warehouse active
continues to apply when executing a query that calls a Snowflake Cortex LLM Function. For general information on
compute costs, see [Understanding compute cost](../cost-understanding-compute.md).

### Warehouse sizing

Snowflake recommends using a warehouse size no larger than MEDIUM when calling Snowflake Cortex AI
Functions. Using a larger warehouse than necessary does not increase performance, but can result in unnecessary costs.
This recommendation may change in the future as we continue to evolve Cortex AI Functions.

### Track costs for AI services

To track credits used for AI Services including LLM Functions in your account, use the [METERING_HISTORY view](../../sql-reference/account-usage/metering_history.md):

```sqlexample
SELECT *
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_DAILY_HISTORY
  WHERE SERVICE_TYPE='AI_SERVICES';
```

### Track credit consumption for Cortex AI Functions

To view the credit and token consumption for each AI Function call, use the [CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY view](../../sql-reference/account-usage/cortex_functions_usage_history.md):

```sqlexample
SELECT *
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_USAGE_HISTORY;
```

You can also view the credit and token consumption for each query within your Snowflake account. Viewing the credit and token consumption for each query helps you identify queries that are consuming the most credits and tokens.

The following example query uses the [CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_QUERY_USAGE_HISTORY view](../../sql-reference/account-usage/cortex_functions_query_usage_history.md) to show the credit and token consumption for all of your queries within your account.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_QUERY_USAGE_HISTORY;
```

You can also use the same view to see the credit and token consumption for a specific query.

```sqlexample
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_QUERY_USAGE_HISTORY
WHERE query_id='<query-id>';
```

> **Note:**
>
> You can’t get granular usage information for requests made with the REST API.

The query usage history is grouped by the models used in the query. For example, if you ran:

```sqlexample
SELECT AI_COMPLETE('mistral-7b', 'Is a hot dog a sandwich'), AI_COMPLETE('mistral-large', 'Is a hot dog a sandwich');
```

The query usage history would show two rows, one for `mistral-7b` and one for `mistral-large`.

## Model restrictions

Models used by Snowflake Cortex have limitations on size as described in the table below. Sizes are given in tokens.
According to industry estimates, tokens generally represent about four characters of text, so the number of words corresponding to a token limit is
less than the number of tokens. Inputs exceeding the context window limit result in an error. Output that exceed the
context window limit is truncated.

The maximum size of the output that a model can produce is limited by the following:

* The model’s output token limit.
* The space available in the context window after the model consumes the input tokens.

For example, `claude-3-5-sonnet` has a context window of 200,000 tokens. If 100,000 tokens are used for the input, the model can generate up to 8,192 tokens. However, if 195,000 tokens are used as input, then the model can only generate up to 5,000 tokens for a total of 200,000 tokens.

> **Important:**
>
> In the AWS AP Southeast 2 (Sydney) region:
>
> * the context window for `llama3-8b` and `mistral-7b` is 4,096 tokens.
> * the context window for `llama3.1-8b` is 16,384 tokens.
> * the context window for the Snowflake managed model from the SUMMARIZE function is 4,096 tokens.
>
> In the AWS Europe West 1 (Ireland) region:
>
> * the context window for `llama3.1-8b` is 16,384 tokens.
> * the context window for `mistral-7b` is 4,096 tokens.

## Choosing a model

The Snowflake Cortex AI_COMPLETE function supports multiple models of varying capability, latency, and cost. These models
have been carefully chosen to align with common customer use cases. To achieve the best
performance per credit, choose a model that’s a good match for the content size and
complexity of your task. Here are brief overviews of the available models.

### Large models

If you’re not sure where to start, try the most capable models first to establish a baseline to evaluate other models.
`claude-3-7-sonnet` and `mistral-large2` are the most capable models offered by Snowflake Cortex,
and will give you a good idea what a state-of-the-art model can do.

* `Claude 3-7 Sonnet` is a leader in general reasoning and multimodal capabilities. It outperforms its predecessors in tasks that require reasoning across different domains and modalities. You can use its large output capacity to get more information from either structured or unstructured queries. Its reasoning capabilities and large context windows make it well-suited for agentic workflows.
* `deepseek-r1` is a foundation model trained using large-scale reinforcement-learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
  It can deliver high performance across math, code, and reasoning tasks.
  To access the model, set the [cross-region inference parameter](cross-region-inference.md) to `AWS_US`.
* `mistral-large2` is Mistral AI’s most advanced large language model with top-tier reasoning capabilities.
  Compared to `mistral-large`, it’s significantly more capable in code generation, mathematics, reasoning, and
  provides much stronger multilingual support. It’s ideal for complex tasks that require large reasoning capabilities
  or are highly specialized, such as synthetic text generation, code generation, and multilingual text analytics.
* `llama3.1-405b` is an open source model from the `llama3.1` model family from Meta with a large 128K context window.
  It excels in long document processing, multilingual support, synthetic data generation and model distillation.
* `snowflake-llama3.1-405b` is a model derived from the open source llama3.1 model. It uses the [SwiftKV optimizations](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/up-to-75-lower-inference-cost-llama-meta-llm/) developed by the Snowflake AI research team to deliver up to a 75% inference cost reduction. SwiftKV achieves higher throughput performance with minimal accuracy loss.

### Medium models

* `llama3.1-70b` is an open source model that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance ideal for chat applications,
  content creation, and enterprise applications. It is a highly performant, cost effective model that enables diverse use
  cases with a context window of 128K. `llama3-70b` is still supported and has a context window of 8K.
* `snowflake-llama3.3-70b` is a model derived from the open source llama3.3 model. It uses the [SwiftKV optimizations](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/up-to-75-lower-inference-cost-llama-meta-llm/) developed by the Snowflake AI research team to deliver up to a 75% inference cost reduction. SwiftKV achieves higher throughput performance with minimal accuracy loss.
* `snowflake-arctic` is Snowflake’s top-tier enterprise-focused LLM. Arctic excels at enterprise tasks such as SQL
  generation, coding and instruction following benchmarks.
* `mixtral-8x7b` is ideal for text generation, classification, and question answering. Mistral models are optimized
  for low latency with low memory requirements, which translates into higher throughput for enterprise use cases.

### Small models

* `llama3.1-8b` is ideal for tasks that require low to moderate reasoning. It’s a light-weight, ultra-fast model with a context window
  of 128K. `llama3-8b` provides a smaller context window and relatively lower accuracy.
* `mistral-7b` is ideal for your simplest summarization, structuration, and question answering tasks that need to be
  done quickly. It offers low latency and high throughput processing for multiple pages of text with its 32K context
  window.

The following table provides information on how popular models perform on various benchmarks,
including the models offered by Snowflake Cortex AI_COMPLETE as well as a few other popular models.

## Using Snowflake Cortex AI Functions with Python

### Call Cortex AI Functions in Snowpark Python

You can use Snowflake Cortex AI Functions in the Snowpark Python API. These functions include the following. Note that the functions in Snowpark Python have names in Pythonic “snake_case”
format, with words separated by underscores and all letters in lowercase.

* [ai_agg](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.functions.ai_agg)
* [ai_classify](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.functions.ai_classify)
* [ai_complete](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.functions.ai_complete)
* [ai_filter](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.functions.ai_filter)
* [ai_similarity](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.functions.ai_similarity)
* [ai_summarize_agg](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/api/snowflake.snowpark.functions.ai_summarize_agg)

#### `ai_agg` example

The `ai_agg` function aggregates a column of text using natural language instructions in a similar manner to how you would ask an analyst to summarize or extract findings from grouped or ungrouped data.

The following example summarizes customer reviews for each product using the `ai_agg` function. The function takes a column of text and a natural language instruction to summarize the reviews.

```python
from snowflake.snowpark.functions import ai_agg, col

df = session.create_dataframe([
    [1, "Excellent product!"],
    [1, "Great battery life."],
    [1, "A bit expensive but worth it."],
    [2, "Terrible customer service."],
    [2, "Won’t buy again."],
], schema=["product_id", "review"])

# Summarize reviews per product
summary_df = df.group_by("product_id").agg(
    ai_agg(col("review"), "Summarize the customer reviews in one sentence.")
)
summary_df.show()
```

> **Note:**
>
> Use task descriptions that are detailed and centered on the use case. For example, “Summarize the customer feedback for an investor report”.

#### Classify text with `ai_classify`

The `ai_classify` function takes a string or image and classifies it into the categories that you define.

The following example classifies travel reviews into categories such as “travel” and “cooking”. The function takes a column of text and a list of categories to classify the text into.

```python
from snowflake.snowpark.functions import ai_classify, col

df = session.create_dataframe([
    ["I dream of backpacking across South America."],
    ["I made the best pasta yesterday."],
], schema=["sentence"])

df = df.select(
    "sentence",
    ai_classify(col("sentence"), ["travel", "cooking"]).alias("classification")
)
df.show()
```

> **Note:**
>
> You can provide up to 500 categories. You can classify both text and images.

#### Filter rows with `ai_filter`

The `ai_filter` function evaluates a natural language condition and returns `True` or `False`. You can use it to filter or tag rows.

```python
from snowflake.snowpark.functions import ai_filter, prompt, col

df = session.create_dataframe(["Canada", "Germany", "Japan"], schema=["country"])

filtered_df = df.select(
    "country",
    ai_filter(prompt("Is {0} in Asia?", col("country"))).alias("is_in_asia")
)
filtered_df.show()
```

> **Note:**
>
> You can filter on both strings and files. For dynamic prompts, use the `prompt` function.
> For more information, see
> [Snowpark Python reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/snowpark/index).

### Call Cortex AI Functions in Snowflake ML

[Snowflake ML](../../developer-guide/snowflake-ml/overview.md) contains the older AI Functions, those with names that don’t
begin with “AI”. These functions are supported in version 1.1.2 and later of Snowflake ML. The names are rendered in Pythonic
“snake_case” format, with words separated by underscores and all letters in lowercase.

If you run your Python script outside of Snowflake, you must create a Snowpark session to use these functions. See
[Connecting to Snowflake](../../developer-guide/snowflake-ml/snowpark-ml.md) for instructions.

#### Process single values

The following Python example illustrates calling Snowflake Cortex AI functions on single values:

```python
from snowflake.cortex import complete, extract_answer, sentiment, summarize, translate

text = """
    The Snowflake company was co-founded by Thierry Cruanes, Marcin Zukowski,
    and Benoit Dageville in 2012 and is headquartered in Bozeman, Montana.
"""

print(complete("llama3.1-8b", "how do snowflakes get their unique patterns?"))
print(extract_answer(text, "When was snowflake founded?"))
print(sentiment("I really enjoyed this restaurant. Fantastic service!"))
print(summarize(text))
print(translate(text, "en", "fr"))
```

#### Pass hyperparameter options

You can pass options that affect the model’s hyperparameters when using the `complete` function. The following
Python example illustrates modifying the maximum number of output tokens that the model can generate:

```python
from snowflake.cortex import complete, CompleteOptions

model_options1 = CompleteOptions(
    {'max_tokens':30}
)

print(complete("llama3.1-8b", "how do snowflakes get their unique patterns?", options=model_options1))
```

#### Call functions on table columns

You can call an AI function on a table column, as shown below. This example requires a session object (stored in
`session`) and a table `articles` containing a text column `abstract_text`, and creates a new column
`abstract_summary` containing a summary of the abstract.

```python
from snowflake.cortex import summarize
from snowflake.snowpark.functions import col

article_df = session.table("articles")
article_df = article_df.withColumn(
    "abstract_summary",
    summarize(col("abstract_text"))
)
article_df.collect()
```

> **Note:**
>
> The advanced chat-style (multi-message) form of COMPLETE is not currently supported in Snowflake ML Python.

## Using Snowflake Cortex AI functions with Snowflake CLI

Snowflake Cortex AI Functions are available in [Snowflake CLI](../../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index.md) version 2.4.0
and later. See [Introducing Snowflake CLI](../../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/introduction/introduction.md) for more information about using Snowflake CLI.
The functions are the old-style functions, those with names that don’t begin with “AI”.

The following examples illustrate using the `snow cortex` commands on single values. The `-c` parameter specifies which connection to use.

> **Note:**
>
> The advanced chat-style (multi-message) form of COMPLETE is not currently supported in Snowflake CLI.

```snowcli
snow cortex complete "Is 5 more than 4? Please answer using one word without a period." -c "snowhouse"
```

```snowcli
snow cortex extract-answer "what is snowflake?" "snowflake is a company" -c "snowhouse"
```

```snowcli
snow cortex sentiment "Mary had a little Lamb" -c "snowhouse"
```

```snowcli
snow cortex summarize "John has a car. John's car is blue. John's car is old and John is thinking about buying a new car. There are a lot of cars to choose from and John cannot sleep because it's an important decision for John."
```

```snowcli
snow cortex translate herb --to pl
```

You can also use files that contain the text you want to use for the commands. For this example, assume that the file `about_cortex.txt` contains the following content:

```output
Snowflake Cortex gives you instant access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs) trained by researchers at companies like Anthropic, Mistral, Reka, Meta, and Google, including Snowflake Arctic, an open enterprise-grade model developed by Snowflake.

Since these LLMs are fully hosted and managed by Snowflake, using them requires no setup. Your data stays within Snowflake, giving you the performance, scalability, and governance you expect.

Snowflake Cortex features are provided as SQL functions and are also available in Python. The available functions are summarized below.

COMPLETE: Given a prompt, returns a response that completes the prompt. This function accepts either a single prompt or a conversation with multiple prompts and responses.
EMBED_TEXT_768: Given a piece of text, returns a vector embedding that represents that text.
EXTRACT_ANSWER: Given a question and unstructured data, returns the answer to the question if it can be found in the data.
SENTIMENT: Returns a sentiment score, from -1 to 1, representing the detected positive or negative sentiment of the given text.
SUMMARIZE: Returns a summary of the given text.
TRANSLATE: Translates given text from any supported language to any other.
```

You can then execute the `snow cortex summarize` command by passing in the filename using the `--file` parameter, as shown:

```snowcli
snow cortex summarize --file about_cortex.txt
```

```output
Snowflake Cortex offers instant access to industry-leading language models, including Snowflake Arctic, with SQL functions for completing prompts (COMPLETE), text embedding (EMBED_TEXT_768), extracting answers (EXTRACT_ANSWER), sentiment analysis (SENTIMENT), summarizing text (SUMMARIZE), and translating text (TRANSLATE).
```

For more information about these commands, see [snow cortex commands](../../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/command-reference/cortex-commands/overview.md).
