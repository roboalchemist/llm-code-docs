# Workload identity federation

This document is for the following audiences:

* Developers of in-house cloud services.
* Administrators who manage integrations with internal and external services.
* Developers of multi-tenant SaaS applications who want to issue
  [OpenID Connect (OIDC) Federation](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) ID tokens to individual workloads that are running
  on their platform so that each customer workload can authenticate to Snowflake as a dedicated user.

Workload identity federation (WIF) is a service-to-service authentication method that lets workloads, such as applications, services, or
containers, authenticate with Snowflake using their cloud provider’s native identity system, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) roles, Microsoft Entra ID, and
Google Cloud service accounts to get an attestation that Snowflake can use and validate.

WIF removes the need to manage and store long-lived credentials such as passwords, API keys, key pairs, and
programmatic access tokens for authenticating to Snowflake. WIF also reduces the complexity involved in getting
credentials, where other methods, such as [External OAuth](oauth-ext-overview.md) can require more effort to set up.
Applications, services, and containers that use Snowflake connectors automatically get short-lived credentials from their platform’s
identity provider (IdP) through each platform’s native mechanisms.

## Benefits

This section describes why you may want to use WIF for authentication:

* **Cost effective**: Using existing IdPs to manage service identities reduces the need for additional tools or licenses, which can be
  cost-effective.
* **Interoperability**: Popular cloud provider services, such as AWS IAM, Entra ID, and Google Cloud, support and
  encourage WIF as an authentication method for external workloads.
* **Convenient auditing and monitoring**:

  * Administrators can use existing cloud provider services, such as
    [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) and [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/fundamentals/overview), to log and monitor activity.
  * Snowflake administrators can query the LOGIN_HISTORY and CREDENTIALS views in the
    [ACCOUNT_USAGE schema](../sql-reference/account-usage.md) to monitor and audit services that use WIF.

## Workflow for implementing workload identity federation

You can use WIF to authenticate a variety of workloads using different IdPs, but the basic workflow, as shown in
the following steps, remains the same:

1. As a workload administrator, configure your service to use a native identity provider so that the provider can issue an *attestation* of
   your workload’s identity. This attestation is often, but not always, a JSON Web Token (JWT).
2. As a Snowflake administrator, create a Snowflake service user for your workload. You set the properties of this user to values found in
   the attestation sent by the provider. For example, a user property might specify the name of an IAM role or the issuer URL of the
   provider.
3. As a workload developer, configure your workload to use a Snowflake driver. Drivers send the
   attestation to Snowflake for verification.

To view end-to-end examples of this workflow for different types of workloads and IdPs, see Use cases.

## Access control requirements

To configure WIF for a Snowflake service user — that is, a user with their TYPE property set to `SERVICE` —
you must grant your activated roles one of the following privileges:

* OWNERSHIP on the service user.
* MODIFY PROGRAMMATIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS on the service user.

## Supported Snowflake drivers

A workload uses a Snowflake driver to send an attestation when it connects to Snowflake. The following drivers support workload identity
federation:

| Driver | Minimum version |
| --- | --- |
| [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Authenticator_values) | v1.16.0 |
| [JDBC](../developer-guide/jdbc/jdbc-configure.md) | v3.26.0 |
| [.NET](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/blob/master/doc/Connecting.md) | v4.8.0 |
| [Node.js](../developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver-authenticate.md) | v2.2.0 |
| [ODBC](../developer-guide/odbc/odbc-parameters.md) | v3.11.0 |
| [PHP PDO](https://github.com/snowflakedb/pdo_snowflake/blob/master/README.rst) | v3.6.0 |
| [Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect.md) | v3.17.0 |

## Minimizing the number of Snowflake identities

Creating a dedicated Snowflake user for every WIF workload can be challenging at scale. It’s often better to consolidate so that multiple workloads authenticate with a well-defined, limited number of Snowflake service users. This approach reduces identity sprawl in Snowflake, simplifies user lifecycle management, and enables consistent access patterns without tightly coupling Snowflake users to individual workloads or infrastructure.

### Create a single user for multiple workloads

Some cloud providers allow the identity that is attached to a workload to impersonate another identity. For example, suppose a workload on
Google Cloud is attached to service account `A`. You can use
[service account impersonation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation) so that service account `A`
authenticates as service account `B`. That is, service account `A` impersonates service account `B` so that the workload can
authenticate to Snowflake as user `B`.

Impersonation is especially useful in an environment that has many workloads because creating a one-to-one mapping between each workload
and a Snowflake service user is operationally expensive and difficult to manage. By allowing multiple workloads to impersonate a shared
Snowflake identity, teams can centralize Snowflake access behind a small set of service users while enforcing access controls through the
cloud provider’s IAM.

**Prerequisite**

To use impersonation so that multiple workloads authenticate with a single Snowflake identity, the workload must be on Google Cloud or AWS.
Currently, Microsoft Azure doesn’t support impersonation.

**Workflow**

1. As the workload administrator, configure the workloads so that their attached identities impersonate another identity.
2. As the Snowflake administrator, create a service user that corresponds to the cloud provider identity that is authenticating to
   Snowflake. For example, if workloads are using service account `D` to authenticate, create a service user and set its SUBJECT parameter
   to the unique identifier of service account `D`.
3. As the workload developer, use a connection parameter of the driver to define the
   identity chain for the workloads that use impersonation. The parameter is set to a list of strings, where each string is a cloud
   provider identity (for example, a service account ID).

   The driver follows the identity chain defined in the list in order to obtain the token that is needed to authorize the next cloud
   provider identity. Each identity in the chain needs permissions to impersonate the next identity only. The final identity in the list
   obtains the Snowflake connection token that is used to connect to Snowflake.

   To obtain the syntax of the connection parameter for your driver, see the driver documentation.

**Example**

Suppose a Google Cloud workload is attached to service account `A` but impersonates service account `B`, which then
impersonates service account `D`. To set up the Python driver so that the workload authenticates with WIF using the identity of service
account `D`, define the connection parameter as follows:

```python
workload_identity_impersonation_path=['service_account_a@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com',
                                      'service_account_b@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com',
                                      'service_account_d@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com']
```

The Snowflake service user created for the workload should contain the identifier of the final identity in the identity chain. Given the
example above, create the service user with the following command:

```sqlexample
CREATE USER <username>
  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY = (
    TYPE = GCP
    SUBJECT = 'service_account_d@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
  )
  TYPE = SERVICE
  DEFAULT_ROLE = PUBLIC;
```

### Create a single user for multiple GitHub or GitLab environments

If you’re using GitHub actions or GitLab projects, you can use the tool’s OIDC Provider to use WIF to authenticate to Snowflake. By default,
the OIDC token for each GitHub action or GitLab project might have a different subject in the `sub` claim, which would require you to
have multiple Snowflake service users, one for each subject.

However, GitHub and GitLab let you customize the `sub` claim of its OIDC tokens. This lets you configure your tool so that the subject
of OIDC tokens is the same for all of your environments. When you create a Snowflake service user, you specify the subject of the OIDC
tokens it will be receiving from GitHub or GitLab. Because the subject in the tokens will always be the same (that is, the custom value),
you only need one service user for all of your environments.

To learn more about customizing the `sub` claim of a GitHub or GitLab OIDC token, see the following resources:

* **GitHub**: To customize the subject claim for an organization or repository, see the
  [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/oidc#customizing-the-subject-claims-for-an-organization-or-repository).
* **GitLab**: To use the Project API to customize the `sub` claim of the GitLab OIDC token, see the
  [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/projects/). Currently, the claim is customized with the
  `ci_id_token_sub_claim_components` attribute.

After you’ve defined a custom `sub` claim that is the same for all of your GitHub or GitLab environments, configure the SUBJECT
parameter of your Snowflake service user to match the custom `sub` claim.

## Hardening your security posture

You can use an [authentication policy](authentication-policies.md) to control which Snowflake service users can authenticate
with WIF. You can also create and set the authentication policy so that a workload can authenticate only if it uses
a specified identity provider, or an account within that provider.

For example, the following authentication policy allows a workload to authenticate only if it uses Microsoft Entra ID as its provider and the
issuer of the attestation is a Microsoft Entra ID tenant with tenant ID `https://login.microsoftonline.com/9ebd1ec9-9a78-4429-8f53-5cf870a812d1/v2.0`:

> ```sqlexample
> CREATE AUTHENTICATION POLICY workload_policy
>   WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POLICY=(
>     ALLOWED_PROVIDERS = (AZURE)
>     ALLOWED_AZURE_ISSUERS = (
>       'https://login.microsoftonline.com/9ebd1ec9-9a78-4429-8f53-5cf870a812d1/v2.0')
>   );
> ```

For more information about the `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POLICY` parameter, see [CREATE AUTHENTICATION POLICY](../sql-reference/sql/create-authentication-policy.md).

For more information about setting an authentication policy so it is enforced, see [Setting an authentication policy on an account or user](authentication-policies.md).

## Use cases

The following use cases are examples of implementing WIF for a workload:

### Authenticate using AWS IAM roles and a Snowflake Python driver

Complete the following tasks to use WIF to authenticate to Snowflake from your AWS service:

#### Configure AWS

To configure your AWS service to use AWS IAM as its identity provider, attach an IAM role. For more information, see the AWS documentation
that corresponds to your workload.

* For Amazon EC2, see [Attach an IAM role to an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/attach-iam-role.html).
* For AWS Lambda, see [Defining Lambda function permissions with an execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html).

#### Configure Snowflake

To configure Snowflake, create a Snowflake service user — that is, a user of type `SERVICE` — that uses WIF
to authenticate with Snowflake.

> **Before you begin:**
>
> To successfully configure Snowflake, you must have the Amazon Resource Identifier (ARN) that uniquely identifies the AWS user or
> role associated with the instance authenticating to Snowflake. To obtain the ARN of a IAM role, complete the following steps:
>
> 1. Sign in to the AWS Console, and then navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
> 2. In the left-hand navigation, select Roles.
> 3. Select the name of the role that you attached to your AWS instance.
> 4. In the Summary section, find the ARN, and then select the Copy icon.
>
> Snowflake accepts the following forms of [IAM identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html):
>
> > * `arn:aws:iam::account:user/user_name_with_path`
> > * `arn:aws:iam::account:role/role_name_with_path`
> > * `arn:aws:sts::account:assumed-role/role_name/role_session_name`

       SUBJECT = 'system:serviceaccount:<service_account_namespace>:<service_account_name>'
     )
     TYPE = SERVICE;
   ```

   Where `ISSUER` and `SUBJECT` are the values that you obtained before starting these steps.

#### Configure your workload to use a Snowflake driver

> **Note:**
>
> You can configure your workload to use any Snowflake driver that supports WIF. For the complete list, see
> Supported Snowflake drivers.

If your workload needs a Python driver, complete the following steps:

1. [Install the Snowflake Connector for Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install.md).
2. In your Python application code, add the following source code:

   ```python
   conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
     account='<snowflake_account>',
     authenticator='WORKLOAD_IDENTITY',
     workload_identity_provider='OIDC',
     token_file_path='<service_account_token_path>'
   )
   ```

   Where `service_account_token_path` is the one you created in the Configure AKS step.
   Based on the YAML example in that step, the token path would be `/var/run/secrets/tokens/snowflake-token`.
3. Run your Python application. It authenticates to Snowflake using WIF.

### Authenticate using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer from Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Complete the steps in each section listed below to use WIF to authenticate to Snowflake from Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

* Configure GKE
* Configure Snowflake
* Configure your workload to use a Snowflake driver

#### Configure GKE

1. Configure GKE to issue ID tokens that are compatible with Snowflake.

   1. [Configure your pod deployment YAML to include a projected ServiceAccount token volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#launch-a-pod-using-service-account-token-projection).
   2. Configure the ID tokens to contain an audience claim with `snowflakecomputing.com`.

      The following is an example of a YAML configuration with the proper audience:

      ```yaml
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - image: nginx
          name: nginx
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
            name: snowflake-token
        serviceAccountName: build-robot
        volumes:
        - name: snowflake-token
          projected:
            sources:
            - serviceAccountToken:
                path: snowflake-token
                expirationSeconds: 7200
                audience: snowflakecomputing.com
      ```

#### Configure Snowflake

To configure Snowflake, create a Snowflake service user — that is, a user of type `SERVICE` — that uses WIF
to authenticate with Snowflake.

> **Before you begin:**
>
> To successfully configure Snowflake, you need the following information:
>
> * The Google Cloud project ID, region of the cluster, and cluster name. You use this information to construct the OIDC issuer.
> * The namespace and name of the Kubernetes service account. You use this information to construct the subject of the ID token issued by
>   the OIDC provider.

**To create a service user for your workload:**

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. To open the list of worksheets, in the navigation menu, select Projects » Worksheets.
3. To open a new SQL worksheet, select +.
4. To create a service user that uses WIF to authenticate with Snowflake, run a
   [CREATE USER](../sql-reference/sql/create-user.md) statement in the worksheet:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE USER my_gke_service
     WORKLOAD_IDENTITY = (
       TYPE = OIDC
       ISSUER = 'https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/<project_id>/locations/<region>/clusters/<cluster_name>'
       SUBJECT = 'system:serviceaccount:<service_account_namespace>:<service_account_name>'
     )
     TYPE = SERVICE;
   ```

   Where `ISSUER` and `SUBJECT` are the values that you obtained before starting these steps.

#### Configure your workload to use a Snowflake driver

> **Note:**
>
> You can configure your workload to use any Snowflake driver that supports WIF. For the complete list, see
> Supported Snowflake drivers.

If your workload needs a Python driver, complete the following steps:

1. [Install the Snowflake Connector for Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install.md).
2. In your Python application code, add the following source code:

   ```python
   conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
     account='<snowflake_account>',
     authenticator='WORKLOAD_IDENTITY',
     workload_identity_provider='OIDC',
     token_file_path='<service_account_token_path>'
   )
   ```

   Where `service_account_token_path` is the one you created in the Configure GKE step.
   Based on the YAML example in that step, the token path would be `/var/run/secrets/tokens/snowflake-token`.
3. Run your Python application. It authenticates to Snowflake using WIF.

### Authenticate using a custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider

Complete the steps in each section listed below to use WIF to authenticate to Snowflake from a custom OIDC Provider:

* Configure your OIDC Provider
* Configure Snowflake
* Configure your workload to use a Snowflake driver

#### Configure your OIDC Provider

1. Ensure that your OIDC Provider supports the [OpenID Configuration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig)
   as specified within the Discovery specification. Both the configuration and the configuration’s `jwks_uri` endpoint must be publicly accessible.
2. Configure your OpenID Provider to issue ID tokens with an audience claim that is set to `snowflakecomputing.com` or a non-empty custom list.
   If you define a non-empty custom list, you need to specify it when you create a service user in Snowflake.

#### Configure Snowflake

To configure Snowflake, create a Snowflake service user — that is, a user of type `SERVICE` — that uses WIF
to authenticate with Snowflake.

> **Before you begin:**
>
> To successfully configure Snowflake, you need the following information:
>
> * The issuer URL of your OIDC Provider.
> * The subject claim associated with your workload.
>
> You can obtain both of these values by parsing out the `iss` and `sub` claims from an issued ID token for your workload. For example,
> if you have access to a Unix-like environment with `jq`, `cat`, and `echo`, you can save your ID token to a file and run the
> following commands.
>
> ```bash
> ID_TOKEN_PATH=<id_token_path>
>
> JWS_PAYLOAD=$(cat $ID_TOKEN_PATH | jq -R 'split(".") | .[1] | gsub("-";"+") | gsub("_";"/") | @base64d | fromjson')
> echo "ISSUER = '$(echo $JWS_PAYLOAD | jq -r .iss)'"
> echo "SUBJECT = '$(echo $JWS_PAYLOAD | jq -r .sub)'"
> ```
>
> To learn how to obtain an ID token, see the documentation for your OIDC provider.

**To create a service user for your workload:**

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. To open the list of worksheets, in the navigation menu, select Projects » Worksheets.
3. To open a new SQL worksheet, select +.
4. To create a service user that uses WIF to authenticate with Snowflake, run a
   [CREATE USER](../sql-reference/sql/create-user.md) statement in the worksheet:

   ```sqlexample
   CREATE USER my_custom_service
     WORKLOAD_IDENTITY = (
       TYPE = OIDC
       ISSUER = '<issuer>'
       SUBJECT = '<subject>'
       OIDC_AUDIENCE_LIST = ('<custom_audience>')
     )
     TYPE = SERVICE;
   ```

   Where:

   * `ISSUER` and `SUBJECT` are the values that you obtained before starting these steps.
   * `OIDC_AUDIENCE_LIST` is a non-empty superset of the ID token’s audience claim set in Configure your OIDC Provider.
     You don’t have to specify `OIDC_AUDIENCE_LIST` if the ID token’s audience claim is `snowflakecomputing.com`.

#### Configure your workload to use a Snowflake driver

> **Note:**
>
> You can configure your workload to use any Snowflake driver that supports WIF. For the complete list, see
> Supported Snowflake drivers.

If your workload needs a Python driver, complete the following steps:

1. [Install the Snowflake Connector for Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install.md).
2. In your Python application code, add the following source code:

   ```python
   conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
     account='<snowflake_account>',
     authenticator='WORKLOAD_IDENTITY',
     workload_identity_provider='OIDC',
     token='<id_token>'
   )
   ```

   Where `id_token` is an unexpired ID token received from your OIDC Provider for your workload. To learn how to obtain
   this token, see the documentation for your OIDC provider.
3. Run your Python application. It authenticates to Snowflake using WIF.

## View service user settings

Run the [SHOW USER WORKLOAD IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION METHODS](../sql-reference/sql/show-user-workload-identity-authentication-methods.md) command to view the values of the WORKLOAD_IDENTITY
parameter for the service user. For example, to view the WIF settings that the service user `my_custom_service`
uses to authenticate to Snowflake, run the following command:

```sqlexample
SHOW USER WORKLOAD IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION METHODS FOR USER my_custom_service;
```

## Limitations and considerations

* Azure workloads can’t be located in Azure sovereign clouds, such as Azure China and Azure US Gov. This limitation isn’t related to the
  Snowflake region of your account.
