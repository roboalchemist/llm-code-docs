# Using the Trust Center

This topic describes how to monitor Trust Center costs, and manage scanners, findings, and security risks by using the Trust Center
Snowsight interface.

## Monitoring cost

The Trust Center incurs [serverless compute cost](../cost-understanding-compute.md) when it scans your Snowflake environment for
security vulnerabilities.

You can use cost-related views in the ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE schemas to track the costs associated with the Trust Center. When
querying these views, filter on the `service_type` column to find `TRUST_CENTER` values.

| View | Schema | `service_type` | Roles with required privileges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [METERING_HISTORY](../../sql-reference/account-usage/metering_history.md) | ACCOUNT_USAGE | TRUST_CENTER | *ACCOUNTADMIN role* USAGE_VIEWER database role |
| [METERING_DAILY_HISTORY](../../sql-reference/account-usage/metering_daily_history.md) | ACCOUNT_USAGE | TRUST_CENTER | *ACCOUNTADMIN role* USAGE_VIEWER database role |
| [METERING_DAILY_HISTORY](../../sql-reference/organization-usage/metering_daily_history.md) | ORGANIZATION_USAGE | TRUST_CENTER | *ORGADMIN role* ORGANIZATION_USAGE_VIEWER database role |
| [USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY](../../sql-reference/organization-usage/usage_in_currency_daily.md) | ORGANIZATION_USAGE | TRUST_CENTER | *ORGADMIN role* ORGANIZATION_BILLING_VIEWER database role |

**Example:** View the total cost that the Trust Center incurred between December 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024.

```sqlexample
SELECT
   SUM(credits_used) AS total_credits
FROM snowflake.account_usage.metering_history
WHERE
   service_type = 'TRUST_CENTER' AND
   start_time >= '2024-12-01' AND
   end_time <= '2024-12-31';
```

**Example:** View the daily cost that the Trust Center incurred after December 1, 2024.

```sqlexample
SELECT
   usage_date AS date,
   credits_used AS credits
FROM snowflake.account_usage.metering_daily_history
WHERE
   service_type = 'TRUST_CENTER' AND
   date > '2024-12-01';
```

For information about how many credits are charged per Compute-Hour for the operation of the Trust Center, see Table 5 in the
[Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf).

## Use the Trust Center Snowsight interface

This preview introduces several changes to the Trust Center. The Trust Center Snowsight interface now has the following tabs:

* Overview - Displays a high-level summary of Trust Center findings for your account. Select the View option in each section of
  Overview to see more detailed information about a specific aspect of your account’s security posture.
* Violations - This tab was previously named the Findings tab. It shows violations, suggests remediation actions for them, and
  provides detailed information about them. For information about using this tab, go to the Violations tab, and then follow the instructions
  in Manage the violation findings lifecycle and Manage security risks.
* Detections - This tab shows the detections found by the scanners and provides information about them. For information about using
  this tab, see View Trust Center detection findings.
* Manage scanners - Now contains the Scanner packages tab. You can use it to view and manage scanner packages and individual
  scanners. The event-driven scanners added in this preview show Event driven in the SCHEDULE column. For information
  about using this tab, go to the Manage scanners tab, and then follow the instructions in Manage scanner packages
  and Managing scanners.
* Manage scanners - Now contains the Extensions tab. You can create Trust Center extensions by using the Snowflake Native App
  Framework. For more information, see, [Using Trust Center extensions](trust-center-extensions.md).

### Change the status of a violation finding

> **Attention:**
>
> Marking a violation as `Resolved` is a way to triage the open violation so you can focus on the ones most important for your environment.
> Resolving a violation also ceases the periodic email notifications for that violation. Scanners still run as scheduled irrespective of the
> violation status: `Open` or `Resolved`. The scanner continues to run and detect violations if the configuration remains unchanged.

All new security violations are raised with an `Open` status. You can resolve a violation for multiple reasons, such as not being applicable
to your account, being deferred for a future date, being in progress already, or another reason.

You can change the status of a violation for any reason, such as not being applicable to your account, deferred for a future date, being in
progress already, or another reason. To change the status of a violation, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](../ui-snowsight-gs.md).
2. Switch to a role with the `SNOWFLAKE.TRUST_CENTER_ADMIN` application role granted to it.

   For more information about granting this role, see [Required roles](overview.md).
