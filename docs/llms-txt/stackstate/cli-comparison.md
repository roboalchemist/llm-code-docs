# Comparison between CLIs

## Overview

StackState has a new CLI! The new CLI has many advantages and a few notable differences.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**From StackState v5.0, the old `sts` CLI is called `stac`. The old CLI is now deprecated.**

The new `sts` CLI replaces the `stac` CLI. It's advised to install the new `sts` CLI and upgrade any installed instance of the old `sts` CLI to `stac`. For details see:

* [Which version of the `sts` CLI am I running?](#which-version-of-the-cli-am-i-running)
* [Install the new `sts` CLI and upgrade the old `sts` CLI to `stac`](https://archivedocs.stackstate.com/5.1/setup/cli-sts#install-the-new-sts-cli)
* [Comparison between the CLIs](https://archivedocs.stackstate.com/5.1/setup/cli/cli-comparison)
  {% endhint %}

## Why a new CLI?

The new `sts` CLI has been built for a reason. Here are the major advantages of switching:

* Easy installation and configuration for all Operating Systems
* Native macOS support
* Faster releases - the CLI is versioned independently of the StackState product
* Backwards as well as forwards compatible with StackState versions
* Machine-readable output for every command
* Many UX improvements, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion and progress bars.
* SaaS support

## Notable Differences between the CLIs

* Unlike `stac`, the new `sts` CLI won't have commands for sending data to StackState. For these purposes, you can use either the StackState Agent or the StackState Receiver API.
* Some commands have been renamed to fall more in line with how we think of StackState today. For example, the old command `stac graph` is now called `sts settings`.
* The new `sts` CLI only works with StackState v5.0 or later.

The `sts` CLI is:

* 🎉 The new CLI!
* Works with StackState v5.0 or later.
* Contains all of the latest commands - see the [CLI command overview](#cli-command-overview).

➡️ [Install the new `sts` CLI](https://archivedocs.stackstate.com/5.1/setup/cli/cli-sts)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI: stac (deprecated)" %}
The `stac` CLI is:

* The old CLI.
* Works with StackState v5.1 or earlier.
* ⚠️ Doesn't include the newest commands - see the [CLI command overview](#cli-command-overview).
* Deprecated since StackState v5.1 and will no longer be actively maintained.

## Which version of the CLI am I running?

There are now two versions of the StackState CLI and the old version of the CLI has been renamed:

* The new CLI is called `sts` - note that this name was used by the old CLI in previous releases of StackState.
* The old CLI has been renamed to `stac`, this allows you to have the old CLI and new CLI installed on the same machine.

You can check which version of the `sts` CLI you are running with the following command:

```
$ sts version

# new `sts` CLI - example output:
VERSION | BUILD DATE           | COMMIT
1.0.0   | 2022-06-24T12:26:50Z | 6553352125d31a46c4790068e36c8eca32ace7fd


# old `sts` CLI - example output:
usage: cli.py [-h] [-v] [-i [INSTANCE]] [-c [CLIENT]]


# no `sts` CLI installed - example output:
command not found: sts


```

If you aren't running the new `sts` CLI yet, we recommend that you:

1. [Upgrade the old `sts` CLI to `stac`](https://archivedocs.stackstate.com/5.1/setup/cli/cli-stac).
2. [Install the new `sts` CLI](https://archivedocs.stackstate.com/5.1/setup/cli/cli-sts).

## CLI command overview

The new `sts` CLI replaces the old `stac` CLI, however, not all commands are available in both of the CLIs. An overview of the commands available in each CLI can be found in the table below.
