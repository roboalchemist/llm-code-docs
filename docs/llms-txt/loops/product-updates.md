# Product updates

> Our updated, definitive guide for sending product updates.

## Introduction

A product update should be sent once a month with updates about what you shipped recently. This typically includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

Things to keep in mind:

* Brevity is key. Users don't want to read a novel.
* If you send valuable content, users will come to expect (and open) it.
* It's okay to send multiple emails in a month if that's your shipping cadence.

1. [Create a new email Campaign](/creating-emails/editor)
2. Add your logo at the top of the email, [save it as a component](/creating-emails/components) if you haven't already.
3. Add a simple subject line, like "The latest updates from Loops"
4. Add a simple intro paragraph, with a link to the full changelog, potentially socials and a highlight of the most important changes along with a call to action to read the full email.
5. Try to limit the number of updates to 2-3, and make sure they are relevant to the content. It's better to have a single or a couple impactful, relevant updates than a long list of updates that are not relevant to the user.
6. In the footer, add a link to the full changelog, socials, and a link to unsubscribe.
7. [Send the email!](/sending-first-email)

<Warning>
  Be careful not to overwhelm your users with too many updates. Focus on the
  most impactful changes.
</Warning>

## Choosing your audience

### For new senders

If you're just starting out, send to all users and maintain a steady cadence over time.

### For established senders

If you have an existing list but haven't sent product updates before:

* Send to active users who have engaged with your product in the last 30 days
* Include users who have created an account in the last 30 days
* If the audience size is less than 5,000 users, send to all users
