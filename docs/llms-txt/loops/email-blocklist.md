# Email blocklist

> Stop certain email addresses or domains from being added to your audience.

You can stop certain emails from being added to your audience by using Loops' Email Blocklist feature.

Go to [Settings -> Account](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=account) and click **Add pattern**.

In the input, enter an email pattern to block.

For example, you can input `*@example.com` to block all email addresses ending with `@example.com`, or `*@*.edu` to block all `.edu` email addresses.

To block individual email address, simply insert the full address like `blockthisuser@domain.com`.

The blocklist feature works across all methods that allow signups to your audience: manually adding in Loops, CSV uploads, forms, the API and all integrations.
