# Deliverability optimization

> How we monitor sends to increase the deliverability of your emails.

During the email sending process, you may see a notification indicating that your email is being monitored for deliverability. This is a proactive measure to ensure that your emails are being delivered to the inbox. A combination of factors are taken into account that may affect deliverability, such as:

* Queuing of emails for delivery
* Email content analysis
* Email sending patterns
* Email sending volume
* Client reputation and email sending history indicators
* Much more!

We have guardrails in place to protect our user's email deliverability (along with yours) and if you see this message, you're seeing one of those guardrails in action.

Emails will be monitored on send to ensure they're hitting the inbox. If you have any questions, contact us via any existing channel or send an email to [support@loops.so](mailto:support@loops.so)
