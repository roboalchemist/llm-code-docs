# Integrations

> Connect Loops to external platforms to automatically add contacts to your audience.

We have a range of integrations with other platforms, which allow syncing of data between services you use.

For example, you can add users from thousands of apps through [Segment](/integrations/segment) or [Zapier](/integrations/zapier), or use forms on platforms like [Framer](/integrations/framer) or [Webflow](/integrations/webflow) to let contacts sign up to your mailing list.

[Go to the Integrations page](/integrations) to view the full list.
