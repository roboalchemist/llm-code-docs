Learn about our free plan.

**The Loops Free Plan is available to everyone who stores under 1,000 contacts in Loops.**

A contact is an email address that you send marketing emails to. Transactional recipients do not count as contacts (unless they are also sent marketing emails).

You can send up to 4,000 emails every 30 days on the free plan. This total includes both marketing and transactional emails.

After you've exceeded the 1,000 contact limit, you will be prompted to upgrade to a paid plan. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time by clicking **Start subscription** at the top of your [Billing page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=billing).

On the free plan, light branding will be placed at the bottom of your emails.

### Key benefits of the Free Plan

* **Start free**: Store up to 1,000 contacts and send up to 4,000 emails every 30 days.
* **Full functionality**: Access all features, including marketing and transactional emails, without restrictions.
* **Easy upgrade**: Seamlessly transition to a paid plan when your contact list grows.

# Notifications
Source: https://loops.so/docs/account/notifications

Learn how to receive notifications about new Loops contacts in external tools.

You will receive a notification when a contact is added to your audience through the API, integrations or form submission. You will not receive notifications for manually added users via CSV or other methods.

You can manage your notifications in the [Notifications](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=notifications) page.

## Email notifications

By default, you will receive an email notification from Loopsbot when a contact is added to your audience. You can disable this notification by toggling the **Notifications enabled** switch in the [Notifications section](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=notifications) of your Settings. If you'd like to receive email notifications again, you can toggle the switch back on. This setting is individual to your user account, and won't propagate to the rest of your team.

## Slack notifications

You can receive notifications in Slack for new contacts. Please note, this is a global setting and will apply to all additional seats in your account.

### Set up Slack notifications

1. Go to [Settings -> Notifications](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=notifications).
2. Click the link to be redirected to Slack for authorization.
3. Select the channel you want to add the bot to.

<Tip>
  The bot must be invited to private channels before they become visible in the dropdown.
</Tip>

4. Send a test message to verify the integration works.

That's it! All new contacts added to your audience will now send a notification to the selected Slack channel.

### Other options

Here are a few other ways to get Slack notifications for new contacts:

1. Install an email add-on to send individual emails from [Gmail](https://slack.com/apps/AEFLFJR9Q-slack-for-gmail) or [Outlook](https://slack.com/apps/AFS3736H3-slack-for-outlook) to channels or DMs (free).
2. Create a forwarding address to send individual emails to your DM with Slackbot (free).

The existing [team member features](/account/team-members) allow you to invite and remove users to and from individual teams.

<Info>
  Free users can be in maximum 3 teams. As soon as a user joins a paid team, they can be added to unlimited teams.
</Info>

## Create a new team

If you want to create a new team, click on the team switcher in the top left of your Loops account, then select **+ New team**.

This will create a new team and ask you to set up a new sending domain.

## Connect existing accounts

If you have existing accounts that you want to merge under one email address, there are a few steps to complete.

In this example **Team A** is the main account you want to log in with, and **Team B** is the account you want to connect.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Team A">
    Make sure you're signed in to the Loops account you want to be your only account (Team A).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in to Team B">
    **In a different browser** (or incognito window) log in to Team B (the account you want to connect) and invite your selected Team A email address from the [Team settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=team).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept the invite">
    An invitation email will be sent to your Team A email address. Since you are already logged in to Team A, you can ignore the email.

    Refresh the Team settings page and you will see an invite alert appear in the bottom right corner. Click **Accept**.

        <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c24f47b25589a75373fa001352f8f31c" alt="Invitation popover" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1080" height="1080" data-path="images/invite.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=2c11b1a8d23ff6e03be2e77a9ba74511 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=35d53feca844eb4eccb4647dcf00060a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=ef5164f92cb32ebd49eb5d0ff40b61cd 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=57f095c730bc55a1063b7679dd437f6f 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=d13ee159ecb5878a941d7d07e41011ee 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/invite.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=cbad2d8d385c84675872561346e5cc57 2500w" />

    Accepting the invite will automatically switch you to the Team A account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign team ownership (optional)">
    If you want to become the [owner](/account/team-members#owner-role) of Team B (giving you full permissions), go back to Team B in the other browser window and refresh the Team page. Give the **Owner** role to your Team A email address by clicking the `•••` menu button.

    Becoming owner is not required but is necessary if you are the only user in the team.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign out of Team B">
    You can sign out of Team B (or close your incognito window), because you can now access it through your Team A account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove the old email address">
    If you want, you can safely remove the previous email address you used to sign in to Team B from the [Team settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=team).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Invite members to teams

If you want your team members to access multiple teams, simply invite the same email address to different teams. Once they accept the invitation, they will be able to switch between the teams they have access to.

## Billing within teams

Billing is handled individually per team. When you switch between teams you will be able to handle billing separately for each.


# CSV Upload

2. Hover on **CSV** and click **Upload CSV**. Download the [example formatted CSV](https://app.loops.so/loops_sample.csv) to get an idea of the columns we use. By default, we recommend using at least `Email`, `First Name`, `Last Name`, `User Group` and `Source` columns.

   <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=f68da4c81e81193b87d77ab41ffc9d4e" alt="" data-og-width="1520" width="1520" data-og-height="1247" height="1247" data-path="images/import-users.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=041fa2852c0355cfe0c18576f35304f6 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=82154329482626b7436b8c222c738638 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=869f983532cb6f1f79ce14601d5f28ff 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=9bc74f602357362086a1a91646fe94ef 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=81850b75bfb304519f6cfac51ddeb764 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/import-users.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=be9406c2e596c03ab7caa57d112e72a9 2500w" />

3. After uploading the CSV you'll have a chance to review any duplicates or missing information before finishing.

4. When the upload is finished, all the uploaded contacts can be viewed in the Audience page. That's it! 🎊

## Update contacts via CSV

You can also upload a CSV file to update your existing contacts in bulk.

You can either download a CSV from your Audience page in Loops, edit the data and re-upload it, or start with a new CSV file and just include the contacts and columns you want to update.

When updating contacts, Loops will first look for a matching contact using the value in the `User ID` column, then the `Email` column.

If a contact is found, Loops will update the contact using the data provided in the CSV file. If a contact is not found with either `User ID` or `Email` values, a new contact will be created using the data provided.

Note: If a contact is found using `User ID` and its email address does not match the provided `Email` value, the contact will not be updated and an error will be recorded.

## Trigger loops via CSV

You can use CSV uploads as a way to trigger loops on a group of new or existing contacts.

If you want to trigger loops for existing contacts, download a CSV from your [Audience page](https://app.loops.so/audience) then re-upload the file. Only include the contacts you want to trigger loops for in the CSV file.

After uploading the CSV, on the Review page select the **Trigger Loops** option. This will trigger all applicable loops you have set up with **Contact created** and **Contact updated** triggers.

If you select to add contacts to mailing lists on this same page as well as toggle **Trigger loops** ON, you will also trigger **Contact added to list** loops.

## Important notes

* All contacts uploaded will be automatically marked as subscribed. If you want to mark imported contacts as unsubscribed add a "Subscribed" column into your CSV file and use `false` as the column value.
* The importer does not re-subscribe contacts who are marked as unsubscribed in your Audience.
* The default `Source` value for each uploaded contact will be "CSV Upload". You can change this by adding a `Source` column to your CSV file and specifying a custom value.
* Cells that are empty in the CSV file will not overwrite existing data in Loops. If you want to clear a field, you will need to provide a value of `null` in the CSV file (4 characters, all lowercase).


# Integrations
Source: https://loops.so/docs/add-users/integrations

Connect Loops to external platforms to automatically add contacts to your audience.

We have a range of integrations with other platforms, which allow syncing of data between services you use.

For example, you can add users from thousands of apps through [Segment](/integrations/segment) or [Zapier](/integrations/zapier), or use forms on platforms like [Framer](/integrations/framer) or [Webflow](/integrations/webflow) to let contacts sign up to your mailing list.

[Go to the Integrations page](/integrations) to view the full list.


# API
Source: https://loops.so/docs/add-users/loops-api

Loops provides a REST API to manage your contacts.

With [the Loops API](/api-reference), you can easily manage contacts directly from your application or service.

For example, creating a new contact is as easy as sending a `POST` request to `https://app.loops.so/api/v1/contacts/create`.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "adam@loops.so",
  "firstName": "Adam",
  "lastName": "Kaczmarek",
  "favoriteColor": "blue",
  "userGroup": "Founders",
  "source": "Signup form Service"
}
```

We also offer endpoints for finding, updating and deleting contacts (plus some other features like sending transactional email and sending events).

# API Introduction
Source: https://loops.so/docs/api-reference/intro

The Loops REST API lets you manage your contacts, send events and send transactional email.

## Authentication

<Warning>
  Your Loops API key should never be used client side or exposed to your end
  users.
</Warning>

Start here if you want to use the Loops API to add contacts to your Loops audience,
update their attributes, and send events to Loops.

<Accordion title="Authentication Steps">
  To get started, you'll need an API key. Go to [Settings -> API](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops and click **Generate key**.

  We suggest using a different API key for different purposes. You can revoke an API key at any time with the trash icon.

  When making an API call, add an Authorization header and set the API key as a Bearer token:
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=89b339ef97fd1f1d54a11f4be52e4455" alt="" data-og-width="1430" width="1430" data-og-height="148" height="148" data-path="images/authentication-3.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=a4f4efcb2cdfd86e2f39aad94cdf7bc5 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=6155aa3b71bec86a48953724232d8e61 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=5c99f5e829f1f6559d88782cf7577f1e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=d2aa615e26a41c59db4e1c33dbc31b4f 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=c49732b9252db0f9c3adbfb52e6a45e6 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/authentication-3.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=869f9e89e53b74b5ba62b247150b0219 2500w" />

  You can test your API key by making a `GET` request to

  ```
  https://app.loops.so/api/v1/api-key
  ```

  If successful, you will receive the following response:

  ```
  {
    "success": true
  }
  ```

  Here's an example Curl request (replace `d2d561f5ff80136f69b4b5a31b9fb3c9` with your own API key):

  ```bash  theme={"dark"}
  curl https://app.loops.so/api/v1/api-key -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer d2d561f5ff80136f69b4b5a31b9fb3c9"
  ```
</Accordion>

## Rate Limiting

To ensure the quality of service for all users, our API is rate limited. This means there's a limit to the number of requests your application can make to our API in a certain time frame. The baseline rate limit is **10 requests per second per team**.

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting Details">
  To see your current usage, we provide the following response headers in every API response:

  * `x-ratelimit-limit`: The maximum number of requests you can make per second.
  * `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.

  Here is an example of a successful response with rate limit headers:

    <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e5a91eaa1ae89d9938439b0ec9fa2c19" alt="" data-og-width="705" width="705" data-og-height="175" height="175" data-path="images/api-successful-response.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=371214bda7bf4ade93c48f4072887a1d 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=89ff68bbe88ebe1fc9f147975f8d79bd 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=92e92c82b68049494273b9697b4d0b1a 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=c7fa4c8255de81dab213bb6a333e6efc 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=92ef6994e652c11130b307be1a6a7eeb 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-successful-response.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=10bb665f9ae21cfd02b9066030b2bb96 2500w" />

  If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a response with HTTP status `429 Too Many Requests`. Here is an example of a failed response with rate limit headers:

    <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=9008b344cb25eab08a74e1df468b72e4" alt="" data-og-width="699" width="699" data-og-height="171" height="171" data-path="images/api-rate-limited.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=5091956297ec524b2c4ec40d749b6f74 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=b88a91db05eb2c57cc891534b9203b2e 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=2278b37b7db0ffa4bac98319d5267aa5 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=3c5d8e9e42c0c6ac1b063cf6b1f7e9ba 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=accbbe22ad4f2d7b0114713bcb8c63f9 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/api-rate-limited.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=6c336e2e909b0fc1b2c4544bee821561 2500w" />

  It's important to handle these 429 responses in your application. We recommend implementing retries with an exponential backoff strategy.

  If your use case requires a higher limit, please [contact us](mailto:help@loops.so) and we'll be happy to discuss your needs.
</Accordion>

## Debugging

Sometimes things go wrong. Here are some tips to help you debug your API requests.

<Accordion title="Debugging Steps">
  If you are having trouble with the API, we recommend using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test your requests.

  ### Handling CORS errors

  The Loops API does not support cross-origin requests made from client-side JavaScript. To avoid CORS errors, make sure to issue your requests from a server-side application.

  ### Dealing with `401 Unauthorized` "Invalid API key" errors

  Make sure you have generated an API key from [Settings -> API](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and that you are including it in your requests.

  Your API key should be included in the "Authorization" header of your request, following the format `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

  ### Handling rate limiting (`429` Responses)

  The Loops API allows a maximum of 10 requests per second per team. If you receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response, this means you have exceeded this limit.

  The `x-ratelimit-limit` and `x-ratelimit-remaining` headers in the response can provide information about your current rate limit usage.

  ### Handling other `400`-level Responses

  `400`-level responses typically indicate that there was a problem with the request. The response body will contain more information about what went wrong, so be sure to check it for details.

  Check on your request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and ensure that you are using the correct one for the endpoint you are trying to access.

  ### "Some body key or value is longer than allowable"

  If you receive this error, it means that a value in the request body is too long. We support a maximum of 500 characters for each value, including the opening and closing quotes. Please reduce the length of the values in your request and try again.

  ***

  If you have followed these steps and are still experiencing issues, don't hesitate to [reach out to the Loops team](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=support) for further assistance.

# Send event
Source: https://loops.so/docs/api-reference/send-event

POST /v1/events/send
Send events to trigger emails in Loops.

## Request

### Body

<Note>
  Provide either an `email` or `userId` value or both to identify the contact.\
  If both are provided, the system will look for a contact with either a
  matching `email` or `userId` value. If a contact is found for one of the
  values (e.g. `email`), the other value (e.g. `userId`) will be updated. If a
  contact is not found, a new contact will be created using both `email` and
  `userId` values.
</Note>

<ParamField body="email" type="string">
  The contact's email address.\
  **Required if `userId` is not provided.**
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="userId" type="string">
  The contact's unique user ID. This must already have been added to your
  contact in Loops.\
  **Required if `email` is not provided.**
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="eventName" type="string" required>
  The name of the event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="eventProperties" type="object">
  An object containing event property data for the event. Values can be of type
  `string`, `number`, `boolean` or `date`. [Read more](/events/properties)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="mailingLists" type="object">
  Manage the contact's mailing list subscriptions.\
  Include key-value pairs of mailing list IDs and a `boolean` denoting if the contact
  should be added (`true`) or removed (`false`) from the list. [Read
  more](/contacts/mailing-lists#add-contacts-to-lists-with-the-api)

  ```json  theme={"dark"}
  {
    "mailingLists": {
      "cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix": true,
      "cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r": false
    }
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

### Contact properties

You can also include default and custom [contact properties](/contacts/properties) in your request body, which will update the contact in Loops. These should be added as top-level attributes in the request.

Contact properties can be of type `string`, `number`, `boolean` or `date` ([see allowed date formats](/contacts/properties#dates)).

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "hello@gmail.com",
  "eventName": "signup",
  "firstName": "Bob", /* Contact property */
  "plan": "pro" /* Custom contact property */
}
```

<Note>
  There are a few [reserved names](/contacts/properties#reserved-names) that you cannot use for custom properties.
</Note>

<Tip>
  To empty or reset the value of a contact property, send a `null` value.
</Tip>

### Headers

<ParamField header="Idempotency-Key" type="string">
  Optionally send an idempotency key to avoid duplicate requests.\
  The value should be a string of up to 100 characters and should be unique for each request. We recommend using V4 UUIDs or some other method with enough guaranteed entropy to avoid collisions during a 24 hour window.\
  The endpoint will return a `409 Conflict` response if the idempotency key has been used in the previous 24 hours.
</ParamField>

## Response

### Success

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required />

### Error

If you send an idempotency key which has already been used in the previous 24 hours, a `409 Conflict` response will be returned.

All other errors will be `400 Bad Request`.

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required />

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  An error message describing the problem with the request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>
  ```json Response theme={"dark"}
  {
    "success": true
  }
  ```

  ```json Error response theme={"dark"}
  {
    "success": false,
    "message": "An error message."
  }

<Info>
  To set dynamic Subject, From, Reply to, CC, BCC email header fields, add data
  variables to those fields in the editor, then include data for each variable
  in the API request. Read our [transactional email
  guide](/transactional#data-variables-in-email-headers) for more details.
</Info>

### Headers

<ParamField header="Idempotency-Key" type="string">
  Optionally send an idempotency key to avoid duplicate requests. The value
  should be a string of up to 100 characters and should be unique for each
  request. We recommend using V4 UUIDs or some other method with enough
  guaranteed entropy to avoid collisions during a 24 hour window. The endpoint
  will return a `409 Conflict` response if the idempotency key has been used in
  the previous 24 hours.
</ParamField>

## Response

### Success

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required />

### Error

If the transactional email is not found, a `404 Not Found` will be returned.

If you send an idempotency key which has already been used in the previous 24 hours, a `409 Conflict` response will be returned.

All other errors will be `400 Bad Request`.

# Update contact
Source: https://loops.so/docs/api-reference/update-contact

PUT /v1/contacts/update
Update or create a contact.

Update an existing contact by sending a request containing contact properties.

This endpoint will create a contact if a matching contact does not already exist in your audience.

<Tip>
  If you want to update a contact's email address, the contact will first need a
  `userId` value. You can then make a request containing the `userId` field
  along with an updated email address.
</Tip>

## Request

### Body

<Note>
  Provide either `email` or `userId` to identify the contact you want to update.\
  If both are provided, the system will look for a contact with either a
  matching `email` or `userId` value. If a contact is found for one of the
  values (e.g. `email`), the other value (e.g. `userId`) will be updated. If a
  contact is not found, a new contact will be created using both `email` and
  `userId` values.
</Note>

<ParamField body="email" type="string">
  The contact's email address. If there is no contact with this email, one will
  be created.\
  **Required if `userId` is not provided.**
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="userId" type="string">
  A unique user ID (for example, from an external application). [Read
  more](/contacts/properties#user-id)
  **Required if `email` is not provided.**
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="firstName" type="string">
  The contact's first name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="lastName" type="string">
  The contact's last name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string">
  A custom source value to replace the default "API". [Read
  more](/contacts/properties#source)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="subscribed" type="boolean">
  Whether the contact will receive campaign and loops emails. [Read
  more](/contacts/properties#subscribed).

  <Warning>
    If you send `subscribed: true` in your update calls, contacts who have
    previously unsubscribed will be re-subscribed. We recommend leaving this
    field out of your requests unless you specifically want to unsubscribe or
    re-subscribe a contact.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="userGroup" type="string">
  You can use groups to segment users when sending emails. Currently, a contact
  can only be in one user group. [Read more](/contacts/properties#user-group)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="mailingLists" type="object">
  Manage mailing list subscriptions.\
  Include key-value pairs of mailing list IDs and a `boolean` denoting if the contact should be added (`true`) or removed (`false`) from the list. [Read
  more](/contacts/mailing-lists#add-contacts-to-lists-with-the-api)

  ```json  theme={"dark"}
  "mailingLists": {
    "cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix": true,
    "cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r": false
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

### Custom properties

You can also include [custom contact properties](/contacts/properties) in your request body. These should be added as top-level attributes in the request.

Custom properties can be of type `string`, `number`, `boolean` or `date` ([see allowed date formats](/contacts/properties#dates)).

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "hello@gmail.com",
  "plan": "pro" /* Custom property */,
  "favoriteColor": "Blue" /* Custom property */
}
```

<Note>
  There are a few [reserved names](/contacts/properties#reserved-names) that you
  cannot use for custom properties.
</Note>

<Tip>
  To empty or reset the value of a contact property, send a `null` value.
</Tip>

## Response

### Success

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required />

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the contact.
</ResponseField>

### Error

Errors will be `400 Bad Request`.

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required />

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  An error message describing the problem with the request.
</ResponseField>

# Double opt-in
Source: https://loops.so/docs/contacts/double-opt-in

Require and manage subscription confirmations for new contacts.

Double opt-in requires new contacts to confirm their subscription before you can send them marketing emails. This improves list quality and deliverability.

## Good to know

This feature only applies to [marketing sends](/types-of-emails) (campaigns and loops). Transactional emails are never restricted by double opt-in.

Double opt-in is currently only enabled on [Form endpoints](/forms/simple-form). API endpoints like [Create contact](/api-reference/create-contact) and [Update contact](/api-reference/update-contact) are not yet gated. Coverage will expand to these endpoints soon.

## The double opt-in flow

When double opt-in is enabled:

1. Contact submits a form and receives a confirmation email with a link to a branded confirmation page.
2. The confirmation page displays **Confirm subscription** and **No thanks** buttons.
3. Contacts appear in your audience as "Pending" in the **Double opt-in** column.
4. Contact confirms or rejects the subscription:
   1. If they click **Confirm subscription**, they're subscribed to your audience and any selected mailing lists. This also triggers any applicable loops.
   2. If they click **No thanks**, they remain in your audience but are marked as [unsubscribed](/contacts/properties#subscribed).\
      They can request a new confirmation email from the same page if they clicked **No thanks** by accident.
      <Tip>
        Unsubscribed contacts do not count towards [your plan's
        limits](https://loops.so/pricing).
      </Tip>
   3. If they don't respond, the contact continues to appear as "Pending".

## Enable double opt-in

To enable double opt-in, go to [Settings -> Sending](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=sending) and scroll to the **Double opt-in** section. Turn the **Double opt-in** setting on.

This creates a special transactional email that is used to confirm the subscription, which you can customize in the [Transactional](https://app.loops.so/transactional) page in the Loops dashboard.

To disable double opt-in, turn the **Double opt-in** setting off.

## Customize the confirmation email

The opt-in email is a special [transactional email](/transactional) that is created automatically when you first turn on double opt-in in your account.

You are free to customize the email as you like but it has specific requirements:

* Keep the email short, clearly branded, and focused on the confirmation action.
* Include the required data variable `optInUrl` (added automatically when the email is created).
* Other data variables are not allowed.

Click **Edit Draft** to [edit the email](/transactional#editing-the-email). Make sure to click **Publish** after editing to make your changes live.

## Manually re-send a confirmation email

You can re-send a confirmation email to a contact from their profile page. This is only available for contacts who are currently "Pending".

On a contact's profile page, click the `•••` menu icon and choose **Request opt-in**.

## Webhooks and the API

When double opt-in is enabled, contact webhooks don't fire until the contact is confirmed. Specifically:

* The [`contact.created` event](/webhooks#event-types) will only be sent for contacts created via forms once the contact has confirmed their subscription.
* Other contact-related webhooks (such as `contact.mailingList.subscribed`) will also only fire after confirmation.
* Contacts remain in a "Pending" state in your audience until they confirm, and no webhook events are triggered during this pending state.

You can read a contact's opt-in status from the API by looking at the `optInStatus` field in the [Find contact](/api-reference/find-contact) endpoint.


# Email blocklist
Source: https://loops.so/docs/contacts/email-blocklist

Stop certain email addresses or domains from being added to your audience.

You can stop certain emails from being added to your audience by using Loops' Email Blocklist feature.

Go to [Settings -> Account](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=account) and click **Add pattern**.

In the input, enter an email pattern to block.

For example, you can input `*@example.com` to block all email addresses ending with `@example.com`, or `*@*.edu` to block all `.edu` email addresses.

To block individual email address, simply insert the full address like `blockthisuser@domain.com`.

The blocklist feature works across all methods that allow signups to your audience: manually adding in Loops, CSV uploads, forms, the API and all integrations.


# Export contacts
Source: https://loops.so/docs/contacts/export-contacts

Download CSVs of your contact data.

At any point you can download a CSV file of your audience. This can be your whole audience, or a specific subset of contacts defined by [filters or segments](/contacts/filters-segments).

## Export your audience

To download a CSV of your audience, click the `•••` menu icon in the top right of the filter box and select **Download**.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=11374661b03b8ff52ae98a1a72aa79a8" alt="Exporting your audience" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1448" height="1448" data-path="images/download-csv.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=7cf9ada4e37542b95815029cde284b9e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=827459535d50a21272afb1f825cc9588 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=40f3b0eec857222ad0298cb5a85ee218 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=d38bad1e52d9a400f52dd7f6d5c55413 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=0bfe03a7be2785d55d9f7e9011406b4b 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/download-csv.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=4ce1a1f4f9d94c645716e64754483122 2500w" />

The CSV file will contain columns for each property of your contacts, including [default properties](/contacts/properties#default-contact-properties) plus any [custom properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) you've added.

## Using filters and segments

If you want to only export a particular list of contacts or subset of your audience, you can use filters and segments.

Some example exports you can create:

* contacts who have opened a specific campaign
* contacts who were not sent one of your campaigns
* contacts who have clicked a link one of your loop emails
* contacts who subscribed after a certain date
* contacts who have a certain domain name in their email address

You can also combine filters to create more complex exports.

Here's an example of a filter you can use to export all contacts who have opened a specific campaign:

If you want to save your filters for the future, you can create a [segment](/contacts/filters-segments#audience-segments) by clicking **Save segment**.

# Filters and Segments
Source: https://loops.so/docs/contacts/filters-segments

How to send emails to specific groups of contacts and save segments for future use.

After you have added contacts to your audience in Loops, you may want to send loops or campaigns to certain groups of contacts.

You can do this with filters and segments.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=4ff9eaae776b3d5d8a49a953aedd5e1b" alt="Loop" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1707" height="1707" data-path="images/audience-filters.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=2309e179afa826d5c41fa027b1d45101 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=bfce6453ebbe7eb235ab25a7353a1b12 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=0e32297b27c04d45bc6c1b0fc031672e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=3d314aac4d25f61ac6ff7426b3d1ec96 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=faefd8b757e4bfb7874e87d90233a6a8 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/audience-filters.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=d80b5583ca66f7cf88673b754cffb5ba 2500w" />

## Audience filters

When sending [campaigns](/types-of-emails#campaigns) or emails inside [loops](/loop-builder), you can send to specific groups of contacts in your audience.

Choosing these contacts is done using filters, which are based on two sets of data:

* [contact properties](/contacts/properties) (either default properties or custom properties you've added to your audience)
* **contact activity** from your campaigns and loops (sends, opens and clicks)

For example, you can use filters to build segments like:

* contacts with a specific domain in their email address
* contacts who were added via a specific source
* contacts who were sent a specific campaign
* contacts who didn't open a specific email within one of your loops

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=3e4819c4c59bf6ed2683fbab78bb41d0" alt="Audience filter form" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1358" height="1358" data-path="images/filter-form.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=612c8368ce8575a127945e10fe746cf0 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=5ba36b5c33cbe1f46bb44fc63bbc8bdd 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=eb866cc910fd2a2b35f856fb137ad19f 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=484f9a3d9e4359ac5011af5ec914b2a2 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=ddd49870c175f1bf116f3752af2958b6 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/filter-form.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=4e7929f817280ccf4384575628d37faa 2500w" />

You can add multiple filters at once, and you can also choose to apply *all filters* ("All of these are true") or *any filter* ("Any of these are true").

Audience filters are automatically updated as contact properties are changed. This means that your emails will only send to contacts that match the filter at the time the email is sent.

## Audience segments

Segments are just filters that are saved in your Loops account for the future. This makes them easily re-usable between different loops and campaigns.

<Tip>
  You can create segments while sending campaigns or loops, or directly on the [Audience page](https://app.loops.so/audience).
</Tip>

To create a segment, first filter the audience table and then click **Save segment**.

You will be prompted to add a name for your segment, then click **Finish**.

Your new segment will then be available in a dropdown whenever you filter your audience for campaigns or loops.

Just like filters, segments are automatically updated when contact data is changed, meaning emails always send to the correct contacts at time the email is sent.


# List management
Source: https://loops.so/docs/contacts/mailing-lists

Organise contacts and offer a subscriber preference center with mailing lists.

Mailing lists are useful when you want to organise contacts in more public groups and when you want contacts to be able to opt in and out of specific lists.

Using Lists will automatically generate a branded Preference Center for contacts in your audience, allowing them to easily manage their subscription preferences.

Lists can be public or private and contacts can belong to many, one, or no lists.

For organising contacts for your own use, we suggest using [filters and segments](/contacts/filters-segments) instead.

<Tip>
  Lists are an optional feature. You can use Loops without lists but if you'd
  like finer-grained control over your contacts and the types of communication
  they receive, lists are available on any plan tier.
</Tip>

## List types

Each list you create can be **Public** or **Private**.

By default lists are private, meaning they are only shown to their subscribed contacts (non-subscribers won't be able to see or subscribe to private lists in the Preference Center).

If you want to allow general opt-in to a list, you can set the list visibility to `Public`. Public lists will be shown to all contacts in the Preference Center.

You can also sign up new subscribers to public lists with [Forms](/forms).

<Note>
  Both private and public lists are visible within your Loops admin and can be
  used for filtering contacts when sending campaigns and loops.
</Note>

## Preference Center

The Preference Center allows your contacts to manage their own subscription preferences.

A link to the contact-specific Preference Center is automatically added to each marketing email sent from Loops. You can link to the Preference Center in MJML emails by using the `{unsubscribe_link}` [dynamic tag](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#dynamic-tag-syntax).

You can upload a company icon to brand your Preference Center. This option is shown just below your mailing lists in the [Lists settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=lists).

<Tip>
  You can brand your unsubscribe page with a company icon even if you do not use
  the lists features.
</Tip>

Within the Preference Center, contacts will see:

* your company icon (if uploaded)
* the names and descriptions of all public lists
* the names and descriptions of all private lists they are subscribed to
* the option to unsubscribe from each list they are subscribed to

## Email footers

When sending campaigns and loops emails to specific lists, the [email footer](/creating-emails/editor#footer-content) will include the name of the list the email was sent to. This is useful for contacts to see which list the email was sent to, as well as unsubscribe from a certain list.

### Upload a CSV to a list

If you want to import contacts to a list in bulk you can use our [CSV importer](/add-users/csv-upload).

In the final stage of the form you can select a list, which will add all contacts (new or existing) in the CSV file to that list.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=55ae51a5859674615f2f6ba81f3fb40d" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1059" height="1059" data-path="images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=a1b8e984c1a785edb32b477ca35d7487 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=12ed8d7706956426c1fbc766823741f9 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=345a813d2943c0f825300b79d0a578a6 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=72d74ccb6869fa7b57f291e7ccae2dfd 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=8cfbba1c39838f635a25de76213bbaf5 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/csv-upload.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=6a92dc326c32ab7245570f17ad391df0 2500w" />

### Add contacts to lists with the API

Utilizing the [Loops API](/api-reference) you can programmatically add and remove contacts to and from Lists.

When [creating a contact](/api-reference/create-contact), [updating a contact](/api-reference/update-contact), or [sending an event](/api-reference/send-event) with the API, you can include a `mailingLists` object in the payload.

This `mailingLists` object is a key-value pair of list IDs and a subscription status. The subscription status can be `true` or `false`.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "loopy-loop@example.com",
  "mailingLists": {
    "cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix": true,
    "cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r": false
  }
}
```

In this example, the contact would be subscribed to `cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix` and unsubscribed from `cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r`.

Mailing list IDs can be found [in the app](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=lists) (click the ID to add it to your clipboard) or by using the [API](/api-reference/list-mailing-lists).

### Add contacts to lists with forms

If you use a [form](/forms/simple-form) on your website you can subscribe contacts to specific lists.

When exporting HTML from the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms) in Loops, choose a list from the **Settings** tab.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=eeb0bd57ca9ec2627db111c6c9becf13" alt="Select a list from the form settings" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1118" height="1118" data-path="images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=1b374aa83397f8b06896fd10b82c8bd5 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=9a2001cd9c103a9c7f4552b2a55f0578 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=a5dff6cc70281a41bbd2ba567edb0408 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=ee956ffaea247fb28316bbff530f2b04 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=25f67dd16bd1078bafa9041f80309ff7 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/mailing-lists/form-settings.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=1590b82d032ef3b144faa9af3ff1007d 2500w" />

<Note>
  Adding contacts to a list via a form only works with public lists. The option
  to select a list will only appear in the form settings if you have at least
  one public list.
</Note>

If you already have a form in place or are using a [custom form](/forms/custom-form) you can add a `mailingLists` parameter to the form body with the value a comma-separated list of mailing list IDs.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html HTML example {3} theme={"dark"}
  <form>
    <input type="email" name="email" required />
    <input type="hidden" name="mailingLists" value="cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix,cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r" />
  </form>
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript example {4} theme={"dark"}
  fetch(formEndpointUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    body:
      "mailingLists=cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix,cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r" +
      "&email=" + encodeURIComponent(emailInput.value),
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
  });
  ```

# Contact properties
Source: https://loops.so/docs/contacts/properties

How to add, edit and delete contact properties.

## Default contact properties

These are the default properties for every contact on Loops. They cannot be deleted.

| Contact Property | Example                                 | Email Tag\*   | API Name\*\* |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Email            | *[hi@example.co](mailto:hi@example.co)* | `{email}`     | `email`      |
| First Name       | *Chris*                                 | `{firstName}` | `firstName`  |
| Last Name        | *Frantz*                                | `{lastName}`  | `lastName`   |
| Notes            | *Favorite color is blue.*               | `{notes}`     | N/A          |
| Source           | *API*                                   | `{source}`    | `source`     |
| Subscribed       | `true`                                  | N/A           | `subscribed` |
| User Group       | *Investors*                             | `{userGroup}` | `userGroup`  |
| User Id          | *ask523236*                             | `{userId}`    | `userId`     |

\* Used to [add personalization to emails](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#dynamic-tag-syntax).\
\*\* Used in [API requests](/api-reference).

### Source

"Source" describes where the contact originated from.

By default, this value will be "Form" for contacts added [via a form](/forms/simple-form), or "API" for contacts added [via the API](/api-reference). You can specifiy custom "Source" values when adding contacts via forms and the API.

### Subscribed

The "Subscribed" value determines whether a contact is able to receive **loops and campaigns**. Unsubscribed contacts *will continue to receive all transactional emails*.

Contacts can unsubscribe from your emails using an [Unsubscribe link](/creating-emails/editor#footer-content) automatically added to your campaigns and loops.

Some important notes:

* We do not charge for unsubscribed contacts.
* We suggest you keep unsubscribed contacts in your audience. If you delete and then re-add them in the future somehow, they may end up being "subscribed" even though they have been unsubscribed.
* You cannot re-subscribe contacts via a [CSV upload](/add-users/csv-upload) or from the Audience page in Loops. You can re-subscribe contacts [with the API](/api-reference/update-contact) and with some of [our integrations](/integrations#manage-contacts).

#### Using `subscribed` in API requests

When you include a `subscribed` value in your API requests, you will manually change the contact's subscribed status. For example, if you send `subscribed: true` when updating a contact, previously unsubscribed contacts will be re-subscribed.

<Tip>
  We recommend leaving `subscribed` out of your API requests unless you specifically want to unsubscribe or re-subscribe a contact. All new contacts are subscribed by default (`subscribed: true`).
</Tip>

### User Group

"User Group" is a useful optional property that you can use to segment contacts. It is a free text field that allows you to easily divide contacts into groups like "Users", "VIPs", "Investors" or "Customers".

Contacts can currently only have one user group value.

### User Id

"User Id" is a unique external ID you can assign to each contact in your audience. For example, this could be a customer ID from your store or a user ID from your SaaS.

This field is optional but is very useful if you are working with our API. For example, you need a user ID to be able to [change a contact's email address](/api-reference/update-contact).

### Mailing lists

Read about [how to use mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists) in Loops.

## Custom contact properties

Custom contact properties are additional fields that you can create to store information about contacts.

### Types of property

Custom contact properties can be one of four different types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Date (see below)

You can specify a property type when creating new properties in Loops.

#### Dates

When sending dates with the [API](/api-reference) or via one of our [integrations](/integrations), you can use either a Unix timestamp (*in milliseconds*) or an [ECMA-262 date-time string](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-date-time-string-format).

Timestamps must be in milliseconds and can be sent as either an integer or string.

* `1705486871000` (if the Unix timestamp is `1705486871`)

Supported date formats are shown below. These must be sent as a string. Adding a time offset at the end (e.g. `+02:00` or `-07:00`) is optional (if omitted, the date will default to UTC).

* `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sss`
* `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
* `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`
* `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.sss`
* `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
* `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
* `YYYY-MM-DD`

### Reserved names

Note that Loops does not allow the creation of properties with the following reserved names:

* `id`
* `listId`
* `softDeleteAt`
* `teamId`
* `updatedAt`

### Add a property

One way to create custom contact properties is to go to [your Audience](https://app.loops.so/audience) and click on any of the column headers, then select **Add property**.

A third way is to go your [API Settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page, scroll down to the Contact properties section and click **Add property**.

In each of these cases, you'll see a form asking you for a property name and type.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=7d7f6415ba25b44524450e9dd534a867" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1418" height="1418" data-path="images/add-property-form.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=246b4218146462032b2b9aebf655e28e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=a14032af7c442bcd6949b95b00be8318 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e7877cc7c2cc80cfac2cb2aabdca78c8 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=fad9f62cb34ac9ab0ce493115fd4c533 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e68ef39d22b421a15ffe661c82f91c9f 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-property-form.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=f07d15294f78937209b7040e1dcb0907 2500w" />

It's also possible to [create contact properties with the API](/api-reference/create-contact-property).

```json  theme={"dark"}
POST https://app.loops.so/api/v1/contacts/properties

{
  "name": "myCustomProperty",
  "type": "string"
}
```

### Deleting contact properties

You can delete properties on the Audience page by clicking on column headers.

You can also delete properties from your [API Settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page by clicking the trashcan icons.

It is not possible to delete default contact properties.

<Warning>
  Once a contact property is deleted, all associated data will also be deleted and cannot be recovered. It's important to be sure that you won't need the information stored in a property before deleting it.
</Warning>

#### Property in use warning

If you receive a “Property in use” warning modal while deleting a contact property, there are a few things you can check before you're able to delete the property.

* If the listed email is a Campaign:
  * Check if the property is in use as [dynamic content](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails) inside the email editor
  * Ensure this property is not being actively used in the Audience filter
* If the listed email inside a Loop:
  * Make sure a draft or running Loop is not using it as part of the Audience filter or as a Trigger

# Components
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/components

Create re-usable elements for your emails.

Components are re-usable elements for emails. They help you create frequently-repeated sections of emails once, which you can then easily drop into new emails.

Changes made to components can be synced to all other instances. You can also choose to make local edits to a single component instance without updating others.

Components can be created from and added to all emails created in Loops (campaign, loops and transactional emails). They also work in both Plain and Styled emails.

## Example components

Some useful examples of components are logos and social icons. These elements are typically the same across multiple emails; using components will make sure they are the same everywhere.

Most of the time you will want your logo to have the same alignment, spacing and size in your emails. Similarly, you will want the same set of social icons readily available to drop into every new email you create.

## Create a component

To create a component, click on an element in your email and then the **Create component** icon in the editor panel.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=fa864e9f3b22b0ae1f10b0d67c86c85e" alt="Create a component" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1271" height="1271" data-path="images/create-component.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=f46e0208bbe2aed077f86f7dc6897e20 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=3a8f53b488533fd5d1c4ff719a15568c 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=5406493fa42788d6c82d68d1f5e4f577 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=d2503e72a205a16b89eece105c830703 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=20f2961dd507cfc5ebd02a638648132a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-component.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=4f4e13d4a2dfce26af98d7373e972ee3 2500w" />

A modal will appear where you can name your component. Use a descriptive name so you can easily find your component in the future.

Click **Create**. You will see your new component appear in the Components list on the left of the editor.

<Tip>
  All components you create are available in all of your emails, i.e. a component created in a campaign email is also available to insert into transactional emails.
</Tip>

## Insert a component

Click on **Components** at the top of the left-hand panel to reveal your components list, then simply click on a component to insert it.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=69921ec0e7ac3682e2d7442f285f137e" alt="Add a component" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1307" height="1307" data-path="images/insert-component.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=d9485949e3ddc6cc336ce20cc3a442ea 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=d6a9ece1087bb7a747db584c9ded8c11 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=8528d91bb64ac8dc2406b67a2f75fee3 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=937c58257419319afcfbfbe68c6da0d2 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=82ccf77c88c400b91d4723d9b522cde5 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/insert-component.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=3f0de737cd8a091fca4892cb0858cec8 2500w" />

If you want to change the location of a component in your email, you can drag and drop it within the editor just like other blocks, by using the six dot menu icon.

If you already have a component in your email, clicking **Duplicate** in the **Block styles** editor panel will add a copy of that component into the email, including any local edits made.

## Edit a component

<Tip>
  You can tell if an element in your email is a component by looking for a purple outline around the block in the editor.
</Tip>

To edit a component, edit its content as you would any other part of your email.

This will create local edits to that single instance; these edits are not synced to other components in use elsewhere. This means you can make tweaks and changes to a single instance of a component without updating all other instances.

If a component has local edits, you will notice the **Push changes** and **Reset changes** icons are now active.

# Duplicating emails
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/duplicating-emails

Re-use basic elements of an email or create email templates.

Duplicating emails is a great way to save time crafting similar emails.

You can easily create emails that share many of the same elements (investor updates, product updates, waitlist invites, etc).

## Campaigns and transactional emails

To duplicate an email:

1. Go into **Campaigns** or **Transactional**.
2. Click the `•••` menu icon and select **Duplicate**.
3. Edit the new email's subject line, preview text and content as needed.

## Loops

With loops, you can duplicate a full Loop (which may contain many emails) using the method above (click a `•••` menu icon within the **Loops** list page).

However, you may also duplicate emails within a Loop by clicking the **Copy existing email** button after creating a new email node. This will let you copy and insert any email from any of your existing Loops, including the currently opened Loop.

# Adding content
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/editor

Learn how to edit emails in the Loops email editor.

## The editor

We have built a powerful editor for creating emails. Create any email with our flexible design tools, and write distraction free with Writing mode.

Here are a few of the editor's stand-out features:

* Customizable custom themes to keep your designs consistent
* Writing mode, distraction-free editing which hides the editor interface
* Auto-saves as you type
* Mobile-friendly so you can write and design emails on any device
* Support for images, buttons, social icons, dividers and columns
* The same interface for marketing and transactional emails
* Personalize emails with contact and event properties
* Helpful keyboard and Markdown shortcuts for adding content and formatting text

<Tip>
  If you would rather upload emails into Loops, you can [import
  MJML](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email) instead of using the editor.
</Tip>

## Formatting text

Once you have written content in your email, you will see formatting options appear in the right-hand panel. These options will change depending on the element you have selected in the email.

## Adding elements

Emails can be more than just text. You can add the following elements to your emails:

* images
* buttons
* dividers
* social icons

<Note>
  You can also use [keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) and [Markdown](#markdown-formatting) to add certain elements to your email.
</Note>

### Images

As well as adding from the toolbar or the `+` icon, you can drag or paste images into the editor.

Add a link to an image by selecting the element and then clicking the `+` button in the **Link** editor panel on the right.

#### Dynamic images

You can also insert images hosted outside of Loops into your emails.

First, add a placeholder image to your email (which you can use to specify the location and size of the image) and then click `+` in the **Dynamic source** section in the right-hand panel.

<Warning>
  Keep in mind that any images you insert must be publicly accessible and the
  URL must end with a supported image file extension for email (like `.jpg` or
  `.png`). Additionally, these images should be hosted for a period of time that
  is relevant to the email's lifecycle as they will not be stored in Loops.
</Warning>

Paste in an image URL or add create dynamic URLs by clicking the icon on the right.

For example, you could insert an `imageUrl` data variable in a transactional email, or use an `avatarUrl` custom contact property in a campaign.

You can also create dynamic URLs by combining text and dynamic content inside the image source field.

<Note>
  The placeholder image in the editor will not update when you add a dynamic
  source. In order to test dynamic images, you can send [preview
  emails](/sending-first-email#preview-your-email).
</Note>

<Tip>
  Note that, just as with other dynamic content, if the contact or event
  property used for your dynamic image is missing, the email will not be sent.
</Tip>

### Videos

Video is not widely supported in email clients, making it hard to embed videos in emails.

We suggest adding a still image from the video into your email—with a play button overlayed on top if you want—and then add a link to the image pointing to your hosted video.

You can also use GIFs to add a video-like effect to your email. Just make sure that the GIF's file size is small enough to load quickly.

### Links

You can add links to text, images and buttons. First, select the text or element and click the `+` icon in the **Link** editor panel (or use `⌘+K`).

Enter your URL into the field then hit Enter. Helpfully, you can omit the `https://` protocol as it is automatically added to each link.

#### Dynamic links

You can create dynamic links using contact and event properties or data variables.

When editing a link, click the icon—which will be different depending on the type of email you are creating—on the right of the input, then add the dynamic content you want to use.

#### Link tracking

By default marketing emails (campaigns and loops) have opens and link tracking enabled. This can be disabled for all emails in [Settings -> Tracking](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=tracking).

<Note>
  Links and opens in transactional emails are never tracked in order to improve
  deliverability.

You have options for icon size, gap and color (black, grey or white). You can add more icons by clicking the `+` icon in the editor panel.

To rearrange icons, you can drag them around in the editor or in the Links list in the editor panel.

You can also change padding, alignment and more using the **Block styles**.

### Columns

Columns allow you to arrange content side by side, creating dynamic layouts for your emails. You can use columns to place elements like images, text, buttons, and more next to each other.

<Note>
  Currently, we support a maximum of two columns. Nesting columns within columns
  is not yet supported.
</Note>

#### Adding columns

You can add columns to your email in several ways:

1. **Using the `/` slash menu in the editor**: Type `/` to open the slash menu then start typing "columns" or click on the **Columns** option.
2. **Using the editor toolbar**: Click on the columns icon to insert a column layout.
3. **Dragging two blocks together**: Click and hold the block settings icon (six dots) to the left of a block. Drag the block next to another one until you see a vertical gray line on the right, which indicates a new column will be created.

**Stacking columns on mobile**

When emails are viewed on a mobile device (when there is less horizontal space available) you can choose if your columns should stack vertically for better readability or stay as columns.

In the **Block styles** editor panel you'll find the option to stack columns vertically on mobile (when the viewport is 479px or smaller).

**Adding and moving content**

You can drag elements like text blocks, images, and buttons in and out of your columns.

To do this, hold down the `⌘` key (Mac) or `Ctrl` key (Windows) while hovering over the element you want to move. Then click and drag the block settings icon (six dots) to move the block to its new position.

#### Tips

* **No nested columns**: Keep in mind that nesting columns within columns is not supported. If you need a complex layout, consider adjusting your design to fit within the two-column limit.
* **Consistent styling**: Use the block settings to ensure that padding and alignment are consistent across your columns for a polished look.

## Markdown support

The editor has full support for Markdown, allowing you to write and format content quickly using familiar syntax.

### Markdown formatting

You can use Markdown to add content to your emails. For example, you can add a heading by typing `#` followed by a space.

It's also possible to format text with Markdown, like adding bold text using `**`, or inserting links using `[text](url)`.

Add different content blocks using the Markdown formatting below followed by a space.

| Syntax     | Action              |
| :--------- | :------------------ |
| `#`        | Add a heading 1     |
| `##`       | Add a heading 2     |
| `###`      | Add a heading 3     |
| `>`        | Add a quote         |
| `1.`       | Add a numbered list |
| `-` or `*` | Add a bulleted list |

You can format text with the following shortcuts:

| Syntax                      | Action              |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `**text**` or `__text__`    | Bold text           |
| `*text*` or `_text_`        | Italicize text      |
| `~~text~~`                  | Strike through text |
| `[Loops](https://loops.so)` | Add a link          |

### Pasting markdown

The editor supports pasting Markdown content, making it seamless to bring content from other platforms. Paste Markdown with `⌘+Shift+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows) and it will be converted into native editor blocks.

### Custom markdown tags

When pasting markdown, you can use custom Loops tags to add buttons and columns directly in your content:

**Columns**

```html  theme={"dark"}
<loops-columns>
  <loops-column-item>
    ### Column 1 heading
    Column *1* text
  </loops-column-item>
  <loops-column-item>
    ### Column 2 heading
    Column *2* text
  </loops-column-item>
</loops-columns>
```

**Buttons**

```html  theme={"dark"}
<loops-button href="https://loops.so">Subscribe</loops-button>
```

These custom tags can be mixed with regular markdown formatting.

## Reordering content

If you hover over a block in your email, you'll see a drag-and-drop icon appear on the left. You can drag this icon to re-order elements in your email.

Unsubscribe links help prevent your messages from being marked as spam and ensure that your messages are willingly being received by an engaged audience, helping your deliverability.

The unsubscribe link leads to a [Preference Center](/contacts/mailing-lists#preference-center), where your contacts can manage their own subscriptions.

You can edit your company address from [Settings -> Domain](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=domain).

If your email was sent to a [mailing list](/contacts/mailing-lists), the footer will also [include the name of the list](/contacts/mailing-lists#email-footers) the email was sent to.

Sending emails protected by Guardian

Guardian checks your emails in real time and flags issues *before* you hit send. It catches misconfigured or missing elements in campaigns, loops, and transactional emails so you ship with confidence.

## Guardian checks

### Misplaced variables

Occasionally, content will be copied between email types (campaign \<> loops \<> transactional) and certain types of dynamic content may not be supported. Instead of stripping the variables or blocking the paste, Guardian flags the errors so you can make sure the content is adjusted and formatted properly for the email type.

## Save states

We transparently poll for the last saved checkpoint and keep you updated. This is especially helpful in poor network conditions such as hotspots on the go or on a plane. If local changes fall out of sync we'll let you know.

## Missing button links

If you add a button, we assume you would like a link (href) attached. Now we'll flag that for you to block any accidental sends.

## Missing fallback variables

When using contact and event properties in campaigns and loops, emails will not be sent if the values are missing from the contact or event.

For example, if you have inserted "Hello `First Name`" in your email, and the contact doesn't have a first name value, the loop or campaign email will not be sent. In some cases, that can be desired behavior but we've found most of the time a fallback should be added. We've added it as a warning and now Guardian will alert you when there are missing fallbacks and emails will send as expected.

# Personalizing emails
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/personalizing-emails

Add context and personalization to emails.

Every email you send from Loops can contain dynamic content connected to the contact you're sending to or the event that triggered the email.

A common example of using dynamic content is to personalize an email greeting by using a contact's first name, or by including a customer's plan details in a subscription reminder.

## Types of dynamic content

The three [email types](/types-of-emails) in Loops have different dynamic content available to them:

* **Campaign emails** can contain **contact properties**.
* **Emails within Loops** can contain **contact properties** and **event properties**.
* **Transactional emails** can contain **data variables**.

The three types of dynamic content are:

* **Contact properties** are pieces of data related to each [contact](/contacts/properties) in your audience. There are a set of default properties like name and source, but you can also add any number of custom contact properties. If you sync contact data to Loops with the API, an integration or with CSV uploads, you can include that data in your email.
* **Event properties** are pieces of data that can be sent along with every [event](/events) (which are used to trigger loop emails) via integrations or API calls.
* **Data variables** are pieces of data included in [transactional emails](/transactional), which are populated in the API call. You can utilize [optional data variables](/transactional#optional-data-variables) to make your transactional emails more dynamic.

## Add dynamic content to emails

<Warning>
  If you want to add dynamic content to a [custom MJML
  email](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email), check the [Dynamic tag
  syntax](#dynamic-tag-syntax) section below.
</Warning>

To add dynamic content to your emails, type "\{" anywhere in the editor or click the `{}` dynamic content icon in the email editor toolbar. Using either of these options will open the dynamic content menu, a filterable list of all available properties you can insert.

Depending on whether you're editing a campaign, loop or transactional email, the menu shows different content based on your email type (explained above).

To use the dynamic content menu

1. Type `{` or hit the `{}` icon in any editor field
2. Continue typing to filter results: `{fir` shows "firstName"
3. Use `↑/↓` to navigate, `Enter` to select, `Escape` to close

When the email is sent, the dynamic content will be replaced with actual values from the contact, event or data variable.

Once you've selected something from the menu in a campaign or loop email, you will be prompted to enter a fallback value. This ensures emails still send even when data is missing.

<Tip>
  If you send an email and the dynamic content is missing a value, the email
  will not be sent. Make sure to add fallback values to avoid missed sends.
  [Read more below](#fallback-values).
</Tip>

## Fallback values

Fallback values are important for campaign and loop emails. If a contact doesn't have a value for a property, or an event property is missing, the email won't send.

When you insert a contact or event property using the dynamic content menu, you'll be prompted to enter a fallback. This default text ensures your email still sends even when data is missing.

Common fallback examples:

| Example                    | Fallback     | Result                  |
| :------------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------- |
| Hey `{firstName}`          | there        | Hey there               |
| Welcome to `{companyName}` | your company | Welcome to your company |

This keeps your emails feeling personalized even when specific data isn't available.

Your fallback is saved and will auto-fill if you insert the same property again.

You can edit the fallback value later on from the editor panel.

## Data variables in transactional emails

In transactional emails, dynamic tags work slightly differently: you can create new data variables in your email as you type.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=88c2687bfef5c47a5aee0a27a5a15e97" alt="Creating a new data variable with the dynamic content menu" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1217" height="1217" data-path="images/brace-menu-variables.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=58ac79702032bb4f41e97b6dce0b9fd1 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=2a8e2868c31996f9fc364103f611c12e 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=d200cf3d7528ee3c75e3e1177ff238be 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=d30a28c50dbefd5d8810e7187a217ac7 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=46e4115ba3039aac4035bdc7b9fe6e4b 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY/images/brace-menu-variables.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=EgyPhKkeXp9wCnWY&q=85&s=987497422bbb9687b0d6a70367e266a4 2500w" />

1. Type `{orderTotal` (using a new name that doesn't exist).
2. Select **Create "orderTotal"** from the menu or press `Enter`.
3. The variable is created and you can edit it from the editor panel (change the name or change to an [optional variable](/transactional#optional-data-variables)).

## Dynamic tag syntax

As well as using the dynamic content menu, you can write dynamic content "tags" directly in the email body. This is especially useful when [uploading custom emails](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email).

These tags are the only way to add dynamic content in [custom MJML emails](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email).

### Contact properties

If you have a custom contact property named `teamName` that you want to add to a campaign, you can write it surrounded by curly brackets in the email:

```
{teamName}
```

When the email is sent, the `teamName` value for each contact will be added to the email.

For a list of all of your contact properties, visit the [API Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page. The **API Name** is the name you use within the brackets in your email, for example `{firstName}`, `{lastName}`, `{email}`, etc.

### Event properties

To add dynamic data to emails within loops using event properties, the tag requires an `EVENT_PROPERTY:` prefix:

```
{EVENT_PROPERTY:firstName}
```

### Data variables

To add data variables in transactional emails, the tag requires a `DATA_VARIABLE:` prefix:

```
{DATA_VARIABLE:firstName}
```

<Tip>
  It is important to use the right names in your tags, for example contact
  property names from [API settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and
  event property names from the [Events
  settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) page. If you have any
  questions about how to format your tags, reach out to us!

# Sending settings
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/sending-settings



You can set sending settings on every email you send.

There are a set of fields above the email editor, including **From** and **Reply** addresses, **Subject**, **Preview**, **CC** and **BCC**.

Click the `>` button to reveal all of the fields.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=92dabc26cb1afd834bcf0e5033310865" alt="Email sending settings" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="795" height="795" data-path="images/more-button.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=80882dcf7b0f26e5da4f0b6d9682412d 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=4711e285743e997f2c6d786dc04d3a08 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=8d1ac591b346ed4f2600144d3ec31e02 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=0462910b30873af3f58dd618c708eaee 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=fc77d4f2c30e0e5e9e000cebc4d1a6bb 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/more-button.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=3e06c8905876e067e18b171623f46e69 2500w" />

## Subject and Preview

These two fields let you specify the text that is shown in email lists in email clients.

The **Subject** field should be short and concise. We recommend using a subject line of less than 50 characters and 10 words. This helps to get your point across while also keeping within cut-offs for different email clients.

The **Preview** field can be used as a sub-title or introduction to your email. It is typically displayed next to or below your subject in email clients.

Note that some email clients do not display previews or offer settings for users to hide previews.

If you do not add a preview to your email, sometimes the beginning of your email content will be displayed instead.

## Name, From and Reply

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=9babb7ae9066f476c0293c6d3ce861b9" alt="Sending settings" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1086" height="1086" data-path="images/sending-setting-data.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=050df60e3b31f561d23b0bf837e761fb 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=cf6ee5add9ca173467defcb2a6d42b15 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=a7cefb2898698d37e2a38207a225ba6e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=46556bf1dcf17deb1eecab47639c5b1e 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=128b9429c59b9d2775f0beda82355ce2 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW/images/sending-setting-data.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Ghb_kmuDWgpv_ZFW&q=85&s=9638eb8ba32676da9aeabd514dc9b23b 2500w" />

These fields are used to populate the **From** and **Reply** fields in email clients. They are information fields, helping recipients know who sent the email.

**Name** should be the sender name (person or entity) and the **From** field is used to make up the sending address (it is combined with your sending domain).

The **Reply** field is optional but can be used to specify an email address that you want replies sent to. When a recipient clicks "Reply" in their email client, this email address will be inserted into the **To** field auomatically.

If **Reply** is left blank, replies will be sent to the **From** address instead.

<Note>
  When you create a new email, we automatically inherit the most recently used email address in the **From** field to save you time.
</Note>

## CC and BCC

For transactional emails and loops, you have the option to add a single CC and BCC address, which will send duplicates of each email to the addresses you specify.

Make sure to first enable this option in your [Tracking settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=tracking) to enable these fields in the email editor.

You can then add a CC or BCC to loops and transactional emails in your account from the sending settings.

## Dynamic content

You can include [dynamic variables](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails) in every sending settings field, which lets you personalize them for each recipient. This works for all of your campaigns, loops and transactional emails.

Just click the contact property icon (campaigns), event property icon (loops) or data variable icon (transactional emails) that appears when you hover over each field.

### Loop example

In a loop email, you can use [event properties](/events/properties) to add dynamic content to fields.

For example, you could insert a `productName` property into the **Subject** field:

> Thank you for your purchase of `productName`!

Then when sending the event to trigger the loop, include `productName`:

```json {8} theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "chris@loops.so",
  "eventName": "creditWarning",
  "eventProperties": {
    "creditsPurchased": 1000,
    "creditsUsed": 903,
    "accountName": "Loops",
    "productName": "Pro plan"
  }
}
```

### Transactional email example

In a transactional email, an example would be a `replyTo` variable added into the **Reply** field, which would let you set a specific reply email address for every email.

To send this data over the API, add a `replyTo` attribute to your transactional payload:

```json {7} theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clfq6dinn000yl70fgwwyp82l",
  "email": "favorite@example.com",
  "dataVariables": {
    "name": "Chris",
    "passwordResetLink": "https://example.com/reset-password",
    "replyTo": "chris@loops.so"
  }
}
```

## Styled vs Plain emails

Loops offers two different email styling options, Styled and Plain.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=c2f8549f8d0ec12dfad37d4e384d9627" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1049" height="1049" data-path="images/styled-plain.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=e6a697923f6e08330d02490dfbebbffc 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=5f1049a3bbcaf6c3c62bb3bf85b9ceca 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=c6534cd5825b8244f2418a3624f1606e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=ebcec428e75adfe137d5d98f8950881b 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=55c0e27c23c368b600c57a2c34beaf0a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/styled-plain.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=db5c00cb3800978dab45a421b7b5bf3b 2500w" />

By default new emails are created as **Styled** emails in the editor. This option offers a range of design options that can be used to design the base theme for your email, like text and background colors, padding and borders.

A Styled email layout is a responsive central column with a maximum width of 600 pixels.

When using Styled emails you can also create **Themes**, which unlock more editing options like fonts, plus the ability to set consitent, re-usable formatting across multiple elements in your email.

**Plain** emails are full-width emails with no base design options (though you can always format individual content using the editor panel. Plain emails better mimic emails sent from clients like Gmail and Apple Mail.

## Style panel

Both Plain and Styled emails will show an editor side panel with formatting options for elements in your email.

This includes all text, headings, links, buttons and dividers in your email, as well as design options for the main email body (padding, background and border).

The editor panel changes depending on the currently selected element in your email. For example, if you click on a button, the button formatting options are shown.

There are helpful "Reset to default" icons if you ever want to return styling back to the defaults.

### Language selector

We've included a helpful language selector in the style panel. Using this will tell email clients which language your emails are written in. (It will not translate your emails.)

<Note>
  You can [translate emails inside Loops](/creating-emails/translating-emails-with-ai).
</Note>

This increases the accessibility of your emails, plus some email clients may use this language information to auto-translate email content or offer translation options.

The language selector does not have a default value. We recommend selecting the correct language for each of your emails.

If you send campaigns and loops in different languages, we recommend using a [custom contact property](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) to store language information for each contact. Then, when it comes to sending emails, create emails in different languages (using the language switcher to specify the language), and [filter your audience](/contacts/filters-segments#audience-filters) for each email to match the language stored for each contact.

For transactional emails, create a new email in each required language. You will need to store language information for each recipient in your application and map transactional IDs to their respective language groups.

## Themes

Themes let you create repeatable styles that can be easily applied to new emails.

Once applied, a theme can be tweaked on each email and changes will also be synced back to the main style set. This makes the same change happen on any other email that the theme is applied to.

<Note>
  Themes are not available on Plain mode emails.

### Create a theme

To create a theme, click the `+` plus icon in the **Theme** editor panel.

Give your theme a name and click the `✓` check icon or press Enter. This will create a theme based on the current styling options selected in the style panel and apply it to the current email.

### Edit a theme

To edit a theme, first open an email with it applied, or apply it to an email. Then click **Edit** to open the theme editor panel.

When individual styles are changed, you'll notice they are highlighted in purple, which denotes styles that have deviated from the main theme.

A purple **Update** button also appears. Clicking this button updates the theme and also *applies the changes to all emails that have the theme applied*. This makes it really easy to change styles across many emails at once.

### Make one-off changes to a theme

You are free to make one-off custom design changes to an individual email. If you avoid clicking the **Update** button shown above, changes will not be synced to all other emails using the theme.

Any subsequent updates made to the underlying theme will be synced to your email but your individual style changes made directly on the email will override any synced changes.

### Reset to a theme's defaults

After making design changes to an email with a theme applied, you can get back to the theme's defaults by using the `⤺` reset icons.

You can reset styles for each of the **Email styles**, **Text**, **Button** and **Divider** sections individually.

Or if you want to reset all current edits, hover over the **Editing theme** panel at the top and click the reset button there.

This will re-apply the theme's original design to your email and remove *all* current overrides.

### Remove a theme from an email

To remove a theme from an email click on the `–` minus icon in the **Theme** editor panel.

This will revert back to any styles directly applied to the email before the theme was applied.

Give your new theme a new name then click the `✓` check icon or press Enter to save.

This will create a new theme using the current styles and apply it to your email.

### Delete a theme

To delete a theme from your account, make sure the theme is applied to the email you have open and then click the `•••` menu icon and select **Delete**.

To make sure there are no unintended design changes to emails in your account, the settings from the deleted theme will get applied individually to each email it was active on.

However, please note that any overrides made to the theme in the affected emails will still be retained even after the style is deleted.


# Translating emails
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/translating-emails-with-ai

Loops provides an automated way to translate your emails

<Note>
  Translation is a Beta feature. Please contact the team [via
  email](mailto:support@loops.so) or live chat for access.
</Note>

Translation inside of Loops is a simple, single-click method of translating emails from one language to another entirely inside of the platform.

1. Create a branch, ensuring it contains at least one email to be translated.
2. Click the **language icon** above the branch and choose the **output** language you would like to translate the branch into.
3. The branch will be duplciated in its entirety, including all emails, filters, and timers then the emails within that branch will begin translation.
4. While translating, the emails will display a `Pending` label.
5. When the translation is complete, the emails will display a `Complete` label on the node.

# Uploading a custom email
Source: https://loops.so/docs/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email

Use Loops with Emailify, Email Love or MJML.

<Tip>
  While we do support importing MJML, we recommend using our editor to create
  your emails. It's the easiest way to create beautiful emails that work across
  all email clients.
</Tip>

## Overview

We allow uploading of custom-coded emails created using a markup language called MJML.

You can upload custom MJML for [all three types of emails](/types-of-emails) in Loops (campaigns, loop emails and transactional emails).

When uploading custom email, make sure the email is in a `.zip` file with the following folder structure:

```bash yourEmail.zip theme={"dark"}
index.mjml
img
	|_img1.png
	|_img1.png
```

<Info>
  Important: Please make sure the MJML file is titled `index.mjml`
</Info>

**MJML**

MJML is a markup language that helps you create responsive emails. It's an established framework that helps you create beautiful emails that work across all email clients. You can read more about it at [mjml.io](https://mjml.io/)

**Figma** (via the Emailify and Email Love plugins)

Sometimes you just want that special touch to an email that only Figma can give you. We get it! That's why we support plugins [Emailify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/910671699871076601/emailify-html-email-builder) and [Email Love](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1387891288648822744/email-love-html-email-builder), which help you create beautiful emails in Figma then export into Loops.

## MJML

If you have your MJML ready, there is one step you need to complete before you can upload it into Loops...

### Add an unsubscribe URL

In your email code, you have to insert an unsubscribe link. This keeps you compliant with email sending restrictions.

All you need to do is add a `{unsubscribe_link}` tag into your MJML. When the email is sent, we will insert a contact-specific URL into this tag, which the contact can click to unsubscribe.

```HTML  theme={"dark"}
<a href="{unsubscribe_link}">Unsubscribe</a>
```

### Add dynamic content

You may want to add dynamic content (for example, a contact property or event property) into your email. You can do this using dynamic content tags.

When the email is sent, Loops will replace this tag with the actual value.

<Note>
  Remember to use camelCase format when typing your event property tags.
</Note>

For example, adding a first name [contact property](/contacts/properties) (in campaigns and loops) can be added like this:

```
Hello {firstName},
```

In loops triggered by events you can add [event properties](/events/properties) with an `EVENT_PROPERTY:` prefix:

```
Hello {EVENT_PROPERTY:firstName},
```

In transactional emails you can add [data variables](transactional/guide#add-data-variables) with a `DATA_VARIABLES:` prefix:

```
Hello {DATA_VARIABLE:firstName},
```

## Emailify

Using Emailify, you can create well-designed emails inside Figma, then easily export them ready for Loops.

Download the free [Emailify plugin for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/910671699871076601/emailify-html-email-builder) and launch it.

### Add blocks to your email

To build your email you can drag and drop pre-made blocks provided by Emailify.

Once added you can customize each block.

<Note>
  Loops will automatically host all of your email images so they
  can be reliably displayed to your audience. This feature results in an odd
  quirk that you should be aware of:

  Any text in your email that matches the path to one of your images will be replaced with the new path provided by loops.

  **For example:** `img/myImage.jpg` will be replaced with something like: `https://something.com/lkjn98s08hbAF/img/lkwekHBlhk78kasj.jpg`

  For most situations this won't be an issue, only text that exactly matches the path to one of your images will be replaced.
</Note>

### Add dynamic content

You may want to add dynamic content (for example, a contact property) into your email. You can do this using dynamic content tags.

For example, adding a first name value can be added like this:

```
Hello {firstName},
```

In loops you can add event properties with an `EVENT_PROPERTY:` prefix:

```
Hello {EVENT_PROPERTY:firstName},
```

In transactional emails you can add data variables with a `DATA_VARIABLES:` prefix:

```
Hello {DATA_VARIABLE:firstName},
```

### Add the Loops footer

While creating your email, you need to include an unsubscribe link.

To do this manually, add a link with the URL `{unsubscribe_link}`.

Alternatively, Emailify contains a pre-made Loops footer. Click **Footer**, scroll down until you see the Loops logo and click.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=0e295a14d08a7c79e30ef63ceb36c504" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="2058" height="2058" data-path="images/emailify-footer.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=184cfb0fba21f41685745c483e78a892 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=92c10b09342e0bb87646170fbc359e35 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=ff1d1366bb8f951fb900d9b5503fc44e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=3ee6ff2f035af8d21535d0e8644ae2b4 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=3956592914e1b53137b3ce23e84648ea 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emailify-footer.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=e4be71579544bf93f515a5bbc6f536c4 2500w" />

You are then free to edit the text and design of the footer (just leave the link URL value as-is).

### Export your email

When you're ready to export, click on **Export HTML** in the top right.

Then in the dropdown select **Loops**, which will generate Loops-friendly MJML.

You can add a Subject and Preview text in this step, too.

## Email Love

Email Love is a Figma Plugin that enables you to design and export responsive and accessible HTML emails directly from Figma. Email Love includes an “Export for Loops” option that downloads an MJML file that can easily be imported into Loops.

[Download the Email Love Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1387891288648822744/email-love-html-email-builder)

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=57bf6dd89db504017428ca31c89c50ff" alt="Email Love Figma plugin" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1382" height="1382" data-path="images/emaillove-plugin.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=4cf8af4b53e7f1f009b17a55bc98328e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=52051706405a88fa939a6a680b11c9da 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=7c8fa7e7198c70933d841ff6d92664f0 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=b1a340c3b180fa20d13c59fe51b8f7c4 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=72fc0995de17b58298d550f261b2c9c6 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-plugin.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=1d4dbcb95267e889fba2b95117725e97 2500w" />

To run the plugin, click the **Actions** menu in the Figma toolbar, then under the **Plugins & Widgets** tab select **Email Love -> HTML Email Builder**.

### Add components to your email

You can now start designing your email template using Email Love’s pre-built components.

Select the frame you created in the previous section (where you want components to be added). From the plugin pane select one of the component types and then the component you want to add.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=f2af817c92a63c6360d214dfcce130a4" alt="Adding components" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1836" height="1836" data-path="images/emaillove-components.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=ef5ef4f682563698ad17554e3cebabc1 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=d05bc7e9f3bd458d5e7487f931351c9a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=b04edd85513541e08e4d47febd037603 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=1d18e53dee44dac57d69f9e49444f1b0 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=13547f746c9bd3bc28468a6ea0925f9f 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/emaillove-components.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=bfc8a86c300667254a3917510223ac1c 2500w" />

### Customize components

You can customize every component you add to your design. Each component features layers and frames that replicate the structure of MJML. For example, selecting **mj-section** in a header component enables you to update the background color and selecting **mj-image** in the header enables you to update the logo.

Go through each component and update the text, images, and styles as you wish.

### Add an unsubscribe link

For campaign and loops emails you need to include an unsubscribe link in your email.

If you add a **Footer** component Email Love will automatically add a Loops unsubscribe link at the time of export.

Alternatively you can code an unsubscribe link manually by adding a link element with the URL `{unsubscribe_link}`.

```HTML  theme={"dark"}
<a href="{unsubscribe_link}">Unsubscribe</a>
```

### Add dynamic content

You may want to add dynamic content (for example, a contact property) into your email. You can do this using dynamic content tags.

For example, adding a first name value can be added like this:

```
Hello {firstName},
```

In loops you can add event properties with an `EVENT_PROPERTY:` prefix:

```
Hello {EVENT_PROPERTY:firstName},
```

In transactional emails you can add data variables with a `DATA_VARIABLES:` prefix:

```
Hello {DATA_VARIABLE:firstName},
```

[Read more about dynamic content tags](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#dynamic-tag-syntax)

### Export for Loops

When your email is finished, click on the frame you want to export. Click **Export** and select "Loops" from the **Export** dropdown. Then click **Export to Loops** to generate a ZIP containing MJML and any included images, which you can then upload into Loops.

## Upload into Loops

Once you have MJML with an unsubscribe link included, you can upload it into Loops.

Click the **Code** styling option in the editor panel. This will reveal the file picker, where you can upload your ZIP file.

# Add a sending avatar
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/adding-a-sending-avatar

Set up your email sending avatar through third-party platforms like Gmail and Outlook.

Adding an avatar to your emails can improve open rates and brand recall.

## Basic setup

1. Login to the Google Workspace account linked to your Loops sending domain
2. Click the Google logo in the top right corner
3. Click "Add a Profile Picture"
4. Save

<Tip>
  For full coverage, add a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com) icon to the email
  address.
</Tip>

## Advanced setup

### Adding a sending avatar on a secondary domain

To send email from a secondary domain (e.g., mail.loops.so) with a sending avatar:

1. Log into your Google Admin console with an administrator account
2. Go to "Manage domains" in the dropdown menu
3. Click "Add a domain" and enter the domain name
4. Select "User alias domain" (recommended) or "secondary domain"  as appropriate:
   1. **User alias domain** (recommended) – add notifications.example.com as an alias domain. This automatically assigns each primary user ([john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com), [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com)) a corresponding @ [notifications.example.com](http://notifications.example.com) address without requiring additional seats, and their profile pictures (avatars) will carry over.\
      \
      The User alias domain approach is generally simpler and avoids managing duplicate user accounts.
   2. **Secondary domain** – creates a separate user set, meaning you’ll need to create either a full account or alias for each sender under  [notifications.example.com](http://notifications.example.com) and upload their profile picture individually.\
      \
      After setup and assigning avatars to each alias in Google, please allow a few minutes for Gmail to update, and your avatars should display consistently.
5. Continue and start verification

Once verified, the secondary domain will use the same sending avatar as the primary domain.

At the end of the day, whoever you are sending from in Loops needs to be a user in G Suite. For example, if you are sending from a `notifications@mail.example.com`, you need a user with that name in G Suite. It can be an alias or secondary domain, as long as that user exists with a profile pic.

Note that avatars are only visible within the same email client. To display your avatar across all clients, create accounts and upload avatars in each one's settings.

Alternatively, consider using BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification), a new email standard for displaying authenticated logos. BIMI requires some setup and legal work but provides an added layer of trust.


# Sending emails to Apple “Hide my email” addresses
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/apple-hide-my-email



Apple has recently begun offering their iCloud+ users more and more privacy options when it comes to how they move and appear on the internet.

What does this mean for email? It turns out… quite a bit.

When it comes to email deliverability, [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/set-up-hide-my-email-mm9d9012c9e8/icloud) provides Apple users the opportunity to create unique, random email addresses that forward to their actual email address. This allows them to keep their real email address hidden from online services and email marketers (likely, you).

This can pose challenges for businesses and marketers that hope to track user engagement or maintain an updated and engaged email list.

## Sending emails to customers using Hide My Email

Sending emails to customers that are using Apple’s Hide My Email feature can result in both hard or soft bounces — meaning your email will not be delivered.

If you’re using [Loops](https://loops.so/) as your ESP (email service provider) to send your marketing and transactional emails, an additional step is needed to ensure these members of your audience remain in the loop (pun intended).

It’s simple.

You will need to register your sending domain with Apple through these quick steps.

1. Login to the Apple Developer Console

2. Click **Services** under the category labeled Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles

You'll want to register the SPF domain that we provide for you in-app as well as the usual domain.

For example: `envelope.yourdomain.com` (envelope is the part we are generating for you) and `yourdomain.com`.

That’s it! Goodbye bounces and hello inbox.

## What if I don’t do this?

If you don’t register your sending domain with Apple prior to sending emails it may very likely result in a bounce, meaning that your email will not be delivered to the intended recipient.

If you are using Loops and notice bounces to these email addresses in your email metrics please follow the above steps to register your domain.

Once your domain is registered, reach out to us and we can manually remove the emails from our block list.


# Insights from Google Postmaster
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/gaining-insights

Gmail doesn't report spam reports to Loops, so setting up Google Postmaster is key to getting an idea of your deliverability performance in Gmail.

Google Postmaster is a free tool that provides users with in-depth data and analytics to help them understand how their emails are performing in Gmail.

This tool provides senders with data on various metrics such as spam rate, domain reputation, email authentication, and delivery errors. By analyzing these metrics, you can identify the issues that may be causing your emails to be marked as spam or not delivered.

You can signup for Google Postmaster here: [https://gmail.com/postmaster/](https://gmail.com/postmaster/)


# Improve your inbox placement
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/improving-inbox-placement

If your emails are not landing in the inbox folder you expect, here are some tips to improve your inbox placement.

Your email deliverability is an ever-evolving metric that can be influenced by a variety of factors.

It's composed of, but not limited to, a combination of the following:

* sending IP
* your domain
* your content
* email clients' history of those
* the content of your current message
* blocklists
* sending frequency
* TLD (Top Level Domain)

Follow these steps to resolve any issues you may be experiencing with your email deliverability. When these steps are followed, we typically see a significant improvement in inbox placement.

## 1. Confirm Domain Record Setup

Ensure your domain records are properly set up is a huge piece of the puzzle. Utilize [Bounce Doctor](https://bounce.doctor) to verify your domain settings if you are not a Loops user. If you already use Loops, you can just visit the [Domain Records](https://app.loops.so/sending-domain) page to see if your records are set up correctly.

## 2. Recent Domain Record Changes

Following on the previous point, if you've added or updated domain records within the last 24 hours, wait for changes to propagate. This is especially important if you've just set up your domain for email sending.

## 3. Don't Send Cold Emails

Avoid sending cold emails from your primary domain or a subdomain linked to it. Use a separate domain dedicated to sales efforts. Any cold emails at all can have a negative impact on your deliverabilty. Talk to your sales team. Please do not send cold emails with Loops.

## 4. Historical Use of Primary Domain for Cold Email

If you have previously used your primary domain for cold emailing, you may need a new domain for sending emails, especially if your domain reputation has had issues in the past. It's not impossible to fix your domain reputation, but it can be a long process. If you're a startup, a fresh domain might be the right choice.

## 5. Send a Welcome Email

[Implement a welcome email with a Loop](/loop-builder) to welcome new users as soon as they join. When a user signs up, they expect a welcome email, so intent is clear and engagement is high. Keeping a steady cadence of emails to all new users will help balance out larger email sends to your entire user base. This is especially important if you're a new sender.

## 6. Content of Emails

Review the content of your emails and refrain from sending emails about crypto, giveaways, financial products or a regulated industry which are typically flagged by email clients. If you need to send these types of emails, review the content and ensure it's compliant with email client policies.

## 7. Use of Popular Top-Level Domains (TLDs)

Consider sending email from a domain with a popular top-level domain (TLD) such as .com or .org. These TLDs are less likely to be flagged as spam by email clients. A few less common TLD's like .io, .ai and .so seem to be fine as well. However brand new TLD's as well as specificially .xyz and .info are often flagged as spam.

## 8. Send Content Your Users Want

Ensure your email content is desirable and relevant to your audience. Focus on valuable updates such as product information rather than unsolicited giveaways or promotions. Would you want to read the email if it came from a service you use? If not, consider changing the content.

## 9. User Consent

Only send emails to users who have explicitly opted in to receive communication from you. Do not email without explicit consent.

## 10. Google Postmaster Tools

Set up [Google Postmaster Tools](/deliverability/gaining-insights) to gain insights into your email performance and identify potential issues.

## 11. Incorrectly Flagged

Occasionally, when setting up emails from a new domain that matches your workspace domain, you may run into issues where Gmail or another email client incorrectly flags the message as spam or phishing.

You can usually confirm this is the case by sending the same email to a different address—for example, a personal account or one on another domain. If the email is delivered normally there, the issue is with how the client is classifying messages from the new domain.

If this happens, simply mark the message as “Not spam” or “Not phishing” in Gmail. The issue should resolve itself shortly.

This behavior is not caused by Loops, it’s a built-in protection mechanism that email clients use when learning to trust a new domain.

## Additional Checks: Blocklists and IP Reputation

If you've checked all the above and are still having issues, you may want to check if your IP address is on a blocklist. You can use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx) to check if your IP address is on a blocklist. Please note that blocklists change frequently and usually resolve themselves within a few days.

# Maintaining a clean list
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/maintaining-a-clean-list

A clean list is a happy list. Here’s how to keep your list clean and your emails deliverable.

One of the pillars of good email deliverability is **list hygiene**. Keeping your list clean and up-to-date is a the first step to ensure that your emails are being delivered to the right people.

Most of the emails on your list will likely be legitimate emails, but if you have an in-demand service, users may create temporary email addresses or attempt other methods to gain access to your service and evade limitations you set.

Temporary or fake email addresses are often used once and then abandoned, and can cause your emails to bounce. If you send to too many of these addresses, your deliverability will suffer as the invalid ones will bounce and the valid (but fake) ones will mark your emails as spam.

A few things you can do to keep your list clean:

### 1. Protect the inputs

The easiest way to limit pain is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Start with cutting off the source of the problem by protecting the inputs (your signup forms).

* Use a captcha
* Enable Cloudflare’s bot protection on your site
* Use form validation to ensure that the email address is valid
* Block disposable email addresses
* Use a double opt-in

### 2. Use a service that handles deliverability best practices for you

* Loops automatically handles bounces, unsubscribes, and spam complaints for you
* Just use Loops

### 3. Look for warning signs

* If your open rates are low, it’s likely that you’re sending to a lot of invalid addresses or sending content your subscribers
* If your open rates are high but then drop off, it could be a sign that your emails are being marked as spam or that poor list hygiene is causing your emails to bounce


# Migrating domains
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/migrating-domains

Switching to a new sending domain

You may need to switch sending domains if you rebrand your company, want to send from a new domain for the first time, or are migrating to Loops from another provider.

Keep the following in mind:

1. **DNS records matter**

   If DNS records for your domain are removed, email sending will stop, just as it would with any other provider.
2. **Avoid migrating if your reputation is good**

   If your sender reputation is already healthy, we generally recommend **not migrating**. The downtime and adjustment period can cause more harm than benefit.
3. **If you must migrate, choose the right timing**
   * For **transactional email**, migrate during your app’s off-peak hours.
   * For **marketing or product updates**, migrate between major sends.
4. **Get help if needed**

   If you have concerns, [reach out to our support team](mailto:support@loops.so) ahead of time. We’re happy to clarify best practices and help you plan a smooth migration.


# Deliverability optimization
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/optimization

How we monitor sends to increase the deliverability of your emails.

During the email sending process, you may see a notification indicating that your email is being monitored for deliverability. This is a proactive measure to ensure that your emails are being delivered to the inbox. A combination of factors are taken into account that may affect deliverability, such as:

* Queuing of emails for delivery
* Email content analysis
* Email sending patterns
* Email sending volume
* Client reputation and email sending history indicators
* Much more!

We have guardrails in place to protect our user's email deliverability (along with yours) and if you see this message, you're seeing one of those guardrails in action.

Emails will be monitored on send to ensure they're hitting the inbox. If you have any questions, contact us via any existing channel or send an email to [support@loops.so](mailto:support@loops.so)

# Sending from multiple domains
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/sending-from-multiple-domains

The pros and cons of sending from multiple domains and how to do so in Loops

Much of the information online about email best practices is outdated. Email is a very old industry, and while filtering technology has evolved, much of the guidance still referenced has not.

In our experience, sending from a **single domain** offers far more benefits than using multiple domains. Here’s why:

1. **Consistent sender history**

   The hardest part of email sending is building and maintaining a positive sender reputation. This requires steady, high-quality sending volume over time. Splitting traffic across multiple domains fragments this history, making it much harder to maintain consistency.
2. **Avoiding weak or “cold” domains**

   When a domain is only used occasionally, say, just for product updates, it lacks a sending history. As a result, when you suddenly send a large campaign from that domain, it is far more likely to land in spam. Using a single domain avoids this problem as sending history is shared and consistent.
3. **Modern filtering methods**

   In the past, spam filtering focused heavily on the sending domain or IP address. This made splitting domains a defensive strategy in case one was blocklisted.

   Today (2025 and beyond), most inbox filtering is powered by large language models (LLMs). These systems evaluate content quality and sender reputation over time, not just the domain name. That means if you consistently send high-quality content from one well-established domain, your deliverability will be far stronger than spreading efforts across many domains.

If you do want to separate different types of communication, such as product updates vs. newsletters, we recommend using our [**Mailing List**](/contacts/mailing-lists) feature. It allows subscribers to manage their preferences and opt into specific types of emails, all from a single domain. This avoids domain fragmentation while still giving your users choice.

If you truly need to send from multiple domains, you can create a separate team in Loops and switch between them easily. Just note that settings, audience records, and other data are not shared across teams.


# Subdomains vs root domains
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/sending-from-subdomain

Most email services (including Loops) prefer sending emails from subdomains (hey.company.com) over root domains (company.com).

Subdomains can often be easier to configure and can sometimes be more effective at preventing email from being marked as spam.

It is important to remember that emails sent from a subdomain will also appear in the “from” field of your emails, so make sure to use an address that is recognizable to your audience. We recommend sending from a subdomain like:

* hey.company.com
* mail.company.com
* updates.company.com

Whichever you choose, you can always update it later in your [Domain Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=domain).


# Building your sender reputation
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/sending-reputation

Understanding how to build your sender reputation.

This is a high-level guide, mostly based on our experience as the makers of Loops. We're going to touch on some industry terms and best practices, but ultimately we're focusing on how successful SaaS companies have built their sender reputation using Loops.

You might be reading this guide because you're trying to understand if migrating to Loops and changing your domain is a good idea, if you need to warm up your IP or domain, or if you're just curious about how it all works.

Your sender reputation, as defined by us, is a calculated value based on your domain and your sending IP. This calculation also considers factors like engagement rates, sending volume, and email content quality. We reference this throughout our documentation, and in our support chats, so it's important to understand how it works.

Email clients, such as Gmail, Outlook, and others, also judge sender reputation using largely opaque algorithms. Each factor, such as engagement rates and sending consistency, contributes to whether your email will be successfully delivered.

## Sending Domain

Your domain is the url (e.g., example.com) that you use to send emails. For example, [chris@loops.so](mailto:chris@loops.so) is my personal email address, but we send from [chris@mail.loops.so](mailto:chris@mail.loops.so). Using a subdomain like 'mail.loops.so' is part of our best practice and is also what we would refer to as your sending domain.

A key rule in email sending is that a domain with a strong sending history—consistent volume and high engagement—helps your sender reputation. Conversely, a domain with a weak history can harm it. This can be frustrating when trying to improve your reputation, but if your current sender reputation is good, there’s no need to change your domain.

Changing domains or IP addresses can lead to a reset of your sender reputation, requiring you to rebuild your score from scratch.

This process can be risky and time-consuming, often without significant benefit if your current sender reputation is strong. It’s generally advisable to stick with your existing domain and IP unless you're facing significant deliverability issues.

Other factors can also play a role:

* The volume of emails you send
* The type of content you send
* The users receiving your emails

Beyond that, factors like your subdomain, your domain's age, and even the TLD of the domain matter because they contribute to the perceived trustworthiness of your emails.

## Sending IP

Your IP reputation is largely based on its sending history. If you send from an IP that has a strong sending history, it will help your sender reputation. If you send from an IP that has a weak sending history, it will hurt your sender reputation. Additionally, factors like email frequency, volume, content quality, and recipient engagement play important roles.

If you change either your domain or IP, your sender reputation will need to be rebuilt, which requires following best practices and potentially reducing email volume until a strong reputation is established.

Keep in mind that your sender reputation is made up of both your domain and IP.

## Wrapping Up

Follow the best practices listed in our docs, send relevant content to engaged users, and maintain a consistent sending volume to keep your reputation strong.

If you're starting fresh, consider using a subdomain for sending emails and keep your sending volume conservative initially.

For any questions, just ping [chris@loops.so](mailto:chris@loops.so).

# Sending to large audiences
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/sending-to-large-audience

Tips for sending emails to a large group of new contacts.

Most users in this scenario face two key challenges:

* You have a large audience that you haven't contacted before or rarely have in the past.
* Your domain has little to no sending history.

As a result:

* Users are not expecting emails from you, as they haven't received any in the past.
* Email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) don't recognize you, so your sender reputation is nonexistent.

It’s **really important** to handle this well, so follow these steps or contact [chris@loops.so](mailto:chris@loops.so) with any questions.

### "Warming Up" Your List

We want to build your sender reputation **and** start emailing your best users at the same time. Thankfully, this is easier than it sounds.

The easiest way to do this is *not* by contacting your existing list but by contacting users that are just joining your platform for the first time. Why? Because in our experience, as individuals and as the makers of Loops, the most likely time a user will engage with your emails is when they first join your platform.

### Setting Up an Onboarding Loop

So how do we start emailing these new users?

Start by [setting up a Loop](/loop-builder#building-a-loop) that greets users as soon as they join your platform.

These users are the most active and are most likely to respond favorably, positively impacting your business and your sender reputation.

You should let this Loop run for a few days while your sender reputation is built up and you have a chance to understand how your users react to the type of emails you're sending.

Ideally, open rates will now be >40% at this point for the first email in your Loop.

### Engaging Your Most Active Users

After your onboarding Loop has run for a few days, you can begin to backfill your audience in Loops by importing a CSV of your existing users or by using our API.

While you can (and probably should) import all existing users at this point, we recommend contacting users that signed up over the last seven days prior to the start of the Loop we set up.

Depending on audience size, you could also import users from up to three months ago, but our goal here is to make sure we are contacting users that still engage with your platform.

Alternatively, instead of importing users by the creation date of their account, you can do it by their last login date if you have that information stored.

If you don't have the information stored, you could start now and import users in a week or two after you have an idea of who your most engaged users are.

### General Recommendation for Importing Contacts

A general recommendation would be to import any contacts who have logged in within the last 90 days and then also set up a Loop to welcome all new users going forward. Then you get transactional sending to any contacts in your audience free of charge as well.

### Expanding to Older Users

After your most engaged users have been contacted and your Loop has continued to send, you should have a good idea of how your users are responding to emails that you send them.

You can then begin to expand your audience and import some older users. We recommend sending in batches to limit any potential issues with the domain reputation.

If you notice your open rates dipping below average at any point, it’s a good indication that you’ve reached as far back into your audience as you’ll want to go. At that point, it’s a good idea to only contact users that were previously on your list if they reengage on your platform with a login.

### Wrapping Up

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully send emails to your user base without damaging your domain reputation. Remember to always monitor your open rates and engagement levels and adjust your email strategy accordingly.

For any questions, just ping [chris@loops.so](mailto:chris@loops.so).


# Sending transactional emails to group inboxes
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/transactional-group-inboxes

Learn how to ensure transactional emails can be delivered to your group inbox.

When sending [transactional emails](/transactional) to a group address, you may occasionally encounter issues with email delivery due to settings within your Google Workspace Admin. This guide explains how to handle these situations and prevent them in the future.

Group inboxes are intended as a catch-all email address that receives email and relays it on to many recipients. Transactional email however is intended as a one-to-one communication method and is generally not appropriate for group inboxes. As a result, group inboxes may have additional filtering in place, often by default, which impedes your ability to receive emails like 2FA, click to login and others.

These emails include transactional emails sent to your customers and users from Loops and other services, but also the emails sent by us when you log in.

Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and prevent these issues.

## Google Workspace

### Checking for blocked emails

If you're not receiving expected emails to a group inbox, check these locations:

#### Google Groups Pending Conversations

* Go to [groups.google.com](https://groups.google.com)
* Go to **Pending** conversations in the left sidebar.

## Other troubleshooting steps

If you're still having issues:

1. Verify the email is being sent successfully. For example, in Loops you can check the **Metrics** page of your transactional email to see if the email was sent, delivered and bounced.
2. Check if the email is being received by other group members.
3. Contact your workspace administrator for assistance with group settings.

# Email open rates
Source: https://loops.so/docs/deliverability/understanding-email-open-rates

Understand how open rates can be affected by clients and networks.

Have you ever sent out an email campaign and noticed that some of the recipients showed as "opened" nearly instantly upon sending, while others took a while or didn't show at all? This discrepancy can be confusing and make it difficult to interpret your email open rates accurately.

If your contacts are using Apple Mail or are behind corporate firewalls, it's likely that your open rates are being affected by email privacy measures. Here's what you need to know.

## Apple Mail

Apple Mail Privacy Protection: Apple Mail is a popular email client that is used by millions of people worldwide. In an effort to protect user privacy, Apple introduced Mail Privacy Protection with the release of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey. This feature blocks email tracking pixels, obscuring email open rates, and making it difficult to know exactly when an email has been opened.

If your recipient is using Apple Mail to access their Gmail or other email provider's inbox, then their email will be proxied through Apple's servers, which will affect your open rates.

## Corporate firewalls

Many companies use firewalls to protect their network and prevent unauthorized access to their data.

These firewalls can also affect email open rates by blocking or caching tracking pixels, which are used to track when an email is opened. If your recipient is behind a corporate firewall, then their email client may not be able to download the tracking pixel, which will affect your open rates. If they cache the pixel, it may show as opened immediately.

So, what can you do to get a better understanding of your email open rates? Here are a few tips:

1. **Use other metrics:** While open rates can be a useful metric for measuring the success of an email campaign, they're not the only metric you should be using. Click-through rates, conversion rates, and revenue generated are all important metrics that can give you a better understanding of how your email campaign is performing.
2. **Use a different tracking method:** If you want to track email opens more accurately, you can use a different tracking method that doesn't rely on tracking pixels. For example, you could use a unique link in your email that redirects to your website. By tracking the number of clicks on that link, you can get a better understanding of how many people opened your email.

Open rates are just one metric among many that you should be using to measure the success of your email campaign. By using other metrics, segmenting your audience, and using different tracking methods, you can get a more accurate picture of how your email campaign is performing.

# Events
Source: https://loops.so/docs/events

Events let you trigger emails when something happens in an external platform.

## About events

Events represent a payload of data that can be used to trigger emails. They can be sent to Loops with [the API](/api-reference/send-event) or via [an integration](/integrations).

Events are used to trigger emails in a [loop](/loop-builder) and can contain [personalized data](/events/properties) for each email.

## Creating events

Events can be created automatically or manually in several ways. As well as specifying a name, you can also create [event properties](/events/properties) with each of these methods.

### Automatically by sending an event

You can create an event by sending an event with a new event name.

For example, `creditWarning` here is a new event. This request will create a new event in your account.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "chris@loops.so",
  "eventName": "creditWarning",
  "eventProperties": {
    "creditsPurchased": 1000,
    "creditsUsed": 903,
    "accountName": "Loops"
  }
}
```

### Manually from the Events page

Navigate to the [Events page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) to create an event manually.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=55a0309aa89d89c79ecf5db6c131f191" alt="Add an event from Settings" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1476" height="1476" data-path="images/create-event-settings.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=1eec4d0d120fd3774ec956a782e2c0b6 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=d6f0a7c9febb2f94a0e0b65f96de63b5 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=414a8b97f85d925292f97911d9314dca 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=6ba2b04eb38d21224dc13ba2bb81c358 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=bcf4604034611240fe6c4fc41629e49d 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/create-event-settings.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=fabc0f196b96186c1442d995b4ef3a44 2500w" />

### Manually from an Event trigger node

When [building a loop](/loop-builder), use the **Event received** trigger node to create an event (see below).

## Specifying an event for a Loop

You can use events to trigger email sending within loops.

When creating or editing a loop, select **Event received** in the "Trigger Type" dropdown.

Type in the name of a new event or start typing the name of an existing event, then select from the dropdown.

## Sending events

Now you have events set up in your Loops account, you can start sending events using the API or integrations.

### Sending events with the API

Using the API, send events to the [Send event endpoint](/api-reference/send-event):

```
POST https://app.loops.so/api/v1/events/send
```

All that's required is an `email` or `userId` to identify the contact, plus the `eventName`.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "sam@loops.so",
  "eventName": "planUpgrade"
}
```

The `eventName` can either be an existing event in your account or a new event name.

If a contact is not found with the provided `email` or `userId`, a new contact will be created.

You can include [contact properties](/contacts/properties) in the request, which will be saved onto the contact. These contact properties can be used in emails to your contacts or for [filtering and segmenting your audience](/contacts/filters-segments).

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "sam@loops.so",
  "eventName": "planUpgrade",
  "firstName": "Sam",
  "favoriteColor": "red"
}
```

To provide your emails with event-specific data, include event properties in the request. [Read more about event properties](/events/properties)

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "sam@loops.so",
  "eventName": "planUpgrade",
  "firstName": "Sam",
  "favoriteColor": "red",
  "eventProperties": {
    "newPlan": "Pro",
    "oldPlan": "Basic",
    "planPrice": 29,
    "isLifetime": false,
    "updateDate": "2024-03-07T10:09:23Z"
  }
}
```

### Sending events via an integration

Many of [our integrations](/integrations#send-email) also support sending events, giving you options to send events without building with our API.

## Viewing and editing events

### Event patterns

In your Loops Settings the [Events page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) shows the list of your different events, including how many times they've been sent. Counts are updated hourly.

### Event logs

Below the list of events, you can see the event logs for your account. This includes events sent to us [via the API](/api-reference/send-event) and any of [our integrations](/integrations).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=dc40c403cbddcb5f6dceca8856589f96" alt="Event stream" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1355" height="1355" data-path="images/events-stream.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=3536fb01af10293f32c41f39d706ada3 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=274a0e51ebb0685e147a70f5a1308525 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=e10dccc2e32f04ba798fa1f18929a7d8 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=774d150e0f4005b006de66191a1c4837 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=edb805419f3916819fcaddae2c62c190 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/events-stream.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=1354f66e265d4e5a42dde16d7e10978d 2500w" />

You can sort your events either by email, period of time or event name. You can even also drill down to specific events using the filters.

To view a specific event's payload, click on the table row. Here you'll see the incoming event's information, including the original sent event properties and the properties that Loops accepted (based on your event configuration).

## Testing events

You can test events by sending to email addresses with `@example.com` and `@test.com` domains (for example `user1@example.com` and `user2@example.com`).

Events will fire as normal but emails will not be sent to `@example.com` or `@test.com` email addresses, making this a good way to test how events are working in your account without affecting your sending domain’s reputation.


# Event properties
Source: https://loops.so/docs/events/properties

Learn how to use event properties to personalize your emails.

You can include additional data for each event with event properties, which can be used to include personalized information in emails triggered by your events.

Once included in an event, event properties can be added to emails within your loops.

## Adding event properties

You can add event properties for your events from two places.

### Events page

Firstly, you can add them from the [Events page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events). Click on an event and then **+ Add event property**.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=cc649f686e0b1704ab13a7f376325b7b" alt="Adding an event property" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1476" height="1476" data-path="images/add-event-property.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=df5941a6cf3d0020f08c04ed582edfd8 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=72688ab0b7fc2157d7be6eef23939baa 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=1f993727a3d7cf486ca5f1deff4c6c1d 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=28e41530cd4f99cb1f10a0a39e2431e0 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=c707468f62d5d79fdbd4410f4506d6e7 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e0f181a1808d1cd0da6fe87d68a4f9fd 2500w" />

### Loop builder

Secondly, you add event properties from an **Event received** node in the loop builder by clicking on the **Edit event properties** button.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=87ba137c5cf36a6bbad1e57491154ec0" alt="Adding an event property in the loop builder" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1143" height="1143" data-path="images/add-event-property-loop.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=1373f1f2c80b3c0dc1ee7a2bf956cbf2 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=c73751a1935b94596878d5621d892495 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=7a90e9aae724c6f66846625251818f72 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e2ea77101fe51b4e0113c10d40e8d442 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=d47be76b10df14da0301946fdb644209 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/add-event-property-loop.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=dbfba91f72529b4a95bbde49148c610f 2500w" />

### Important information about event properties

* Event properties must have unique names within the same event.
* Empty spaces are trimmed from the beginning and end of property names.
* Event properties can be one of four types:
  * String
  * Number
  * Boolean
  * Date
* Date values can be either a Unix timestamp (*in milliseconds*) or an [ECMA-262 date-time string](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-date-time-string-format), similar to contact properties. [Read more](/contacts/properties#dates)

## Editing event properties

You can add, rename, delete, and change data types for event properties in the event editor popup (either from the [Events page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) or within the loop builder, as above).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=f33969bee2b8d531d23a8808ec7a99a3" alt="Editing an event" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1476" height="1476" data-path="images/edit-event.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=b56ee39e1ed626c98663e4969cd6fa68 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=ae5a6f4b4e174e4d872183d937a87832 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=42080bb6e1c8d29b0e4f4b1d2cdbb45a 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=7cec9ba050ed6d9acc5d6a48f3353252 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=77f2fbae5a92bdb52d974f34a9c7b0db 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/edit-event.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=33a30fd8d8a58a3a517dc93e42d2a154 2500w" />

## Sending event properties in an event

You can add event properties to your [Send event](/api-reference/send-event) API request using `eventProperties`:

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "sam@loops.so",
  "eventName": "planChange",
  "firstName": "Sam",
  "favoriteColor": "red",
  "eventProperties": {
    "newPlan": "Pro",
    "oldPlan": "Basic",
    "planPrice": 29,
    "isLifetime": false,
    "updateDate": "2024-03-07T10:09:23Z"
  }
}
```

Conversion attempts are made for mismatched types (e.g. if you send a string for a number property).

<Warning>
  New properties not previously defined for an existing event will not be
  available when sending emails. Make sure you add event properties in Loops
  before including them in your event requests. If you send a request with a new
  `eventName` we will create a new event in your account and include the
  properties listed in `eventProperties`.
</Warning>

## Using event properties in emails

Event properties you create become available in emails once Loops has received events containing them.

Click on the Event properties icon `⚡️` in the editor toolbar (only available in emails within your loops) and select the property you want to add.

# Custom form
Source: https://loops.so/docs/forms/custom-form

Integrate with Loops via a form endpoint, which will work with any type of custom form solution you have set up.

Our form endpoint lets you add new contacts to your audience from an HTML form or using JavaScript.

## Find the form endpoint

To submit data to Loops you will need to retrieve the form endpoint URL that's linked to your Loops account.

1. Go to the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms) in your Loops account.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Copy the URL shown in the **Form Endpoint** field.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c44978586df98ffbb59edc5208d5fc39" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1389" height="1389" data-path="images/form-endpoint.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=fa3193dddf8fc5f6fbb03097e90c28ee 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=97d23f7cf388dd355a93a3cdf4629320 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=48384da872ccdafe15fef4fa521a4748 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=badc4b16efe927447068e6e3610baab6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=81888b8b2c46441883d70dbc0f662b25 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c04bebe574485c7fef2c7ad5e4b573a8 2500w" />

## Create a form

In a form, add `input` elements for each of the contact properties you want to collect.

The following contact properties can be added to a new contact via a Loops form endpoint:

* Email `email`
* First name `firstName`
* Last name `lastName`
* User group `userGroup`
* Source `source` (default value is "Form" if omitted)
* Notes `notes`
* Mailing list subscriptions ([read more](/forms/custom-form#subscribe-to-mailing-lists))

<Note>
  The only contact property that can be updated on an existing contact via a form endpoint is `userGroup`.\
  Existing contacts can be added to new mailing lists via a form, but not unsubscribed.
</Note>

You can also use any [custom contact properties](/contacts/properties) from your [API settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in your form.

### Add contact properties

For each form field use the "API Name" value found from your [API settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) as the `name` attribute.

Here's a simple example form that collects name, email address and assigns a custom user group:

```HTML  theme={"dark"}
<form
  method="post"
  action="https://app.loops.so/api/newsletter-form/<YOUR_FORM_ID>"
>
  <input type="text" name="firstName" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" required>
  <input type="hidden" name="userGroup" value="Website signups">
  <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
```

### Subscribe to mailing lists

To add subscribers to mailing lists via a form endpoint, include a hidden field called `mailingLists`. You can use a single mailing list ID or to add subscribers to multiple lists, use a comma-separated list of mailing list IDs.

<Warning>
  Make sure that any mailing list you add to a form is
  [Public](/contacts/mailing-lists#list-types). You cannot subscribe contacts to
  private mailing lists from the form endpoint.
</Warning>

```HTML {6} theme={"dark"}
<form
  method="post"
  action="https://app.loops.so/api/newsletter-form/<YOUR_FORM_ID>"
>
  <input type="email" name="email" required>
  <input type="hidden" name="mailingLists" value="cly2xnjbn002z0mme68uog1wk, cly4xnjbn002x0mme28uog1wk">
  <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
```

<Tip>
  If you need a hand integrating with your custom form, just shoot [help@loops.so](mailto:help@loops.so)
  an email and we'll help you integrate with anything your specific setup ✌️
</Tip>

## Submit with JavaScript

We recommend submitting forms using JavaScript because the endpoint responds with JSON.

To do this, make a `POST` request to your form endpoint. Make sure to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and to submit the form body with encoded values.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Simple example theme={"dark"}
  function handleSubmit() {
    const formBody = `firstName=${encodeURIComponent(firstName)}&email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}&mailingLists=${encodeURIComponent(mailingListIds)}`;

    // Change this URL to your own endpoint URL
    fetch("https://app.loops.so/api/newsletter-form/<YOUR_FORM_ID>", {
      method: "POST",
      body: formBody,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      },
    });
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Detailed example theme={"dark"}
  function handleSubmit() {
    const formBody = `firstName=${encodeURIComponent(firstName)}&email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}&mailingLists=${encodeURIComponent(mailingListIds)}`;

    try {
      // Change this URL to your own endpoint URL
      const response = await fetch("https://app.loops.so/api/newsletter-form/<YOUR_FORM_ID>", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formBody,
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        },
      });

      if (response.status === 429) {
        // Handle rate limit error
        return {
          success: false,
          message: "Too many signups, please try again in a little while"
        };
      }

      // Returns `success=true` or `success=false`, plus an error message if false
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;

    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        message: "An error occurred. Please try again."
      };
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Responses from this form endpoint will be one of the following:

```json  theme={"dark"}
HTTP 200

{
  success: true
}
```

```json  theme={"dark"}
HTTP 400 or 500

{
  success: false,
  message: "A descriptive error message."
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Submissions to form endpoints are rate limited to a low number of requests per minute from each IP address. The endpoint will return a `HTTP 429` response if requests exceed the rate limit. You should try to handle these responses gracefully in your form as shown in the example above.


# Simple form
Source: https://loops.so/docs/forms/simple-form

Collect signups from any web page with a customizable form.

<Tip>
  Check out our specific documentation for adding forms to
  [Framer](/integrations/framer) and [Webflow](/integrations/webflow).
</Tip>

You may want to collect signups from your website directly into Loops.

## Generate the form

Easily generate an HTML or JSX form for collecting new signups for your mailing list from inside Loops.

Go to the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms) and customize your form.

Here you will see settings to manage features of your form:

* add contacts to [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists) (make sure your lists are marked as **Public** first)
* add a "User group" value to each contact
* change the layout
* edit the button color
* edit the success message

When you're happy with your form, copy the HTML into your website.

## Add more fields to the form

It's possible to add other fields to your form if you want to collect more than just email addresses.

The following contact properties can be added to a new contact via a Loops form endpoint:

* Email `email`
* First name `firstName`
* Last name `lastName`
* User group `userGroup`
* Source `source` (default value is "Form" if omitted)
* Notes `notes`
* Mailing list subscriptions ([read more](/forms/custom-form#subscribe-to-mailing-lists))

<Note>
  The only contact property that can be updated on an existing contact via a form endpoint is `userGroup`.\
  Existing contacts can be added to new mailing lists via a form, but not unsubscribed.
</Note>

When adding fields to a form, use the "API Name" value found from your [API settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) as the `name` attribute for each field. See the above list for examples.

For example, this code would collect a First Name and add the contact to a mailing list (using a hidden field input that doesn't appear in the web page):

```html  theme={"dark"}
<input type="text" name="firstName" />
<input type="hidden" name="mailingLists" value="cly2xnjbn002z0mme68uog1wk" />
```

If you want more flexibility when creating signup forms, [read about creating custom forms](/forms/custom-form).

## Troubleshooting

Submissions to form endpoints are rate limited to a low number of requests per minute from each IP address. If you see the message "Too many signups, please try again in a little while" when submitting a form, you have hit the rate limit. Please wait and try again.

Additionally, the form JavaScript does not allow duplicates of the same email address per pageload.


# Send emails from Bolt.new
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/bolt-emails

How to integrate Loops transactional emails into a Bolt application.

<Info>
  This guide is for Bolt but this kind of approach will work with many AI web
  builders, and also for different kinds of Loops integrations, like adding
  newsletter signup forms or sending events with the API instead of
  transactional emails.
</Info>

[Bolt](https://bolt.new) is an in-browser AI web development tool. This guide shows how you can integrate Loops into your Bolt project.

In this guide we will build a simple to-do application in Bolt, with a daily email digest sent with Loops. It uses Supabase for authentication and database.

Adding Loops sending to Bolt can be boiled down to four steps:

1. Prompt Bolt to add a Loops integration
2. Set up emails in Loops
3. Add your Loops credentials and IDs
4. Check the code for mistakes

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=7d3d535fcc138f3646aff6603dcfc9c7" alt="Bolt.new" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1632" height="1632" data-path="images/bolt-new.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=4f3b64d3340b4efee3bfdc611b9a2e1a 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=c5a53fd6fef63f20cf5a2a9fa2d92543 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=31ee5713ab0fdca60178b143854f2c21 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=f3dcad10532807f94df42fe90097d545 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=8795277f8135c7afe3300c5b26670ca2 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bolt-new.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=b1dcc1f4659c8418bea0efd3cd19b16f 2500w" />

## 1. Create the app with a prompt

I wrote a prompt to create the app. In this prompt I included information about using the Loops API.

In Bolt you can choose to add Loops to your original prompt or ask it to add Loops in a later prompt.

For example:

> I want to add daily reminder emails that should be sent at 6am every morning showing the new day's list of tasks. I will send these emails as transactional emails using the Loops API (loops.so)

Using this prompt, Bolt added code to my app that spoke to Loops and had everything ready for me to add my Loops credentials, including a Supabase [Edge Function](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions) that could be run on a cron job.

<Info>
  To improve the code that Bolt produces, you can upload our full LLM text
  [available here](https://loops.so/docs/llms-full.txt) and append it to the
  message.
</Info>

## 2. Create transactional email in Loops

Once you have the basics of the app working, you can move over to Loops to set up the digest email.

This will be a [transactional email](/transactional) (a 1:1 email for a single recipient), sent to each user every morning.

With Loops' transactional sending, you create the email body in the Loops editor and any dynamic content is added using [data variables](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails). Then, when it comes to sending the email via the API, you include the dynamic content in the API payload.

In Loops, you'll need to create a new transactional email and write your content. Bolt added two data variables `tasks` and `date` to the code, so in my example I added those data variables to the email.

## 3. Add Loops credentials

As part of the integration with Loops, you will need to add a Loops API key to your code. This tells Loops which account is sending data as well as making sure the correct apps have access to the correct data.

To do this, get an API key from your Loops [API Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings/?page=api) page.

For my example app I needed to add my Loops API key into the Edge Function's secrets in Supabase (**Edge functions -> Secrets**). I called mine `LOOPS_API_KEY` to match the name Bolt used in the code.

You will also need the ID of the transactional email so that the correct email is sent from your application.

In Loops, from the **Preview** page if your transactional email, copy the transactional ID and paste it into your app's code. This completes the Loops integration in the app.

## 4. Fix bugs

Now that the app is set up, it's time to see if things are working correctly.

For me, I discovered a few bugs. For example, the original Google sign in that Bolt had added didn't work so I asked Bolt to change to email and password authentication. Overall the app worked as I had prompted. I could sign up and create tasks and the delay feature worked great.

Next I wanted to make sure the email sending was working. Because this was tied up in an edge function that is to be called with a scheduled cron job, I needed to find a way to test it on demand. Luckily, Supabase offers a simple API call to trigger functions. This can be run in the **Terminal** tab in Bolt.

Initially, I was seeing errors in the terminal.

```
{"success":true,"sent":0,"failed":1}
```

I realised that Bolt had incorrectly guessed the Loops API endpoint URL. This is a good example of AI-generated code needing sanity checking. I changed the URL to the [correct one](/api-reference/send-transactional-email).

Supabase has great visibility of edge function invocations and error messages, which can help figure out when there's a problem.

After a few tries, I started seeing succesful invocations of the edge function, and email digests in my inbox!

Here you can see that the current date and the task I had scheduled for the same day have been passed into the email body, which was handled by the data variables in the API call to Loops.

That's the end of this guide. Make sure to check out the rest of the Loops API to see what is possible when integrating to a Bolt-powered application.

# Bubble API Connector
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/bubble-api-connector

Send data to Loops from Bubble using the API Connector plugin.

This guide helps you set up an API connection to Loops from your Bubble app.

In this example, we will create an integration that allows you to sync Bubble users to your Loops audience.

<Tip>
  We have created an [official plugin for Bubble](/integrations/bubble), which contains actions for all Loops API calls. However, it is limited to what it can do by how Bubble works.\
  THis tutorial helps if you need more control or flexibility over the data that is sent to Loops.
</Tip>

## Install the API Connector plugin

In Bubble, you need to first install the API Connector Plugin. This plugin is what makes the API calls to Loops.

Go to Plugins and click **+ Add plugins**.

Search for "API Connector" and click **Install**.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=d4a70a59229cbecae781e4f4823365db" alt="Search for API Connector" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1221" height="1221" data-path="images/bubble-search-plugin.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=5635521df2ba8fd1a2b2e7cbbd939551 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=e685702562ee0ca4e892cc54c58b808e 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=0ba4de412ccf2b4d33f4bdc0edd39f91 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=f9bcc274de5d55bcb70dc3a84c073b80 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=d7d414c9f1fbd75064ba49b36230943b 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/bubble-search-plugin.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=1d03d672644c86fad7bb265604ab486d 2500w" />

## Add a Loops API connection

Now you have the plugin installed, you can add an API connection.

Click **Add another API**. In the form that appears, enter "Loops" into the **API Name** field (Bubble uses this field to group API calls together in the interface).

Make sure the **Key name** value is "Authorization" (this is the default).

In the **Authentication** field, select "Private key in header".

In Loops, go to your [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and copy an API key (you can create a new key if you like).

Back in Bubble, in the **Key value** field, write the word `Bearer`, then a space character, then paste your API key, so it looks something like `Bearer YourApiKey`.

## Add an API call to sync users to Loops

Now you can create an API call using the connection you just created. Click **Add another call** at the bottom of the gray box.

In the **Name** field, write something like "Sync users".

In the **Use as** field, select "Action". The **Data type** field should be "JSON" (this is the default).

In the dropdown where it says "GET", select "POST", and in the subsequent field, paste the following endpoint URL:

```
https://app.loops.so/api/v1/contacts/update
```

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=895b5df6050341511c75b426647f3a66" alt="Add an API call" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="968" height="968" data-path="images/bubble-add-api-call.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=b7daf5c91e45b966e3c40bd532120de2 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=8a3d443aef16139f619bfdc1acc540ae 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=cd899cc25f36f22ce0db30ee13953011 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=c1e94de4eaa14fc78b1633b8061f5916 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=859524296512238892c83ba765a7540d 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-add-api-call.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=2cc0e75aaa2cce0400a56bfd2e43f5fd 2500w" />

Now all that's left is to set up the request body, which is the data that's sent to Loops. This will depend on what kind of data points you want to send.

In this example, we will add a [custom contact property](/contacts/properties) called "Plan name" (which we [already added in Loops](/contacts/properties#add-a-property)).

<Warning>
  Due to how Bubble handles empty values, make sure to only add properties to this request body that will always contain a value. Otherwise, Bubble will send `"null"` as the value instead of an empty value, which will mean, for example, your contact's first name will become `null`.
</Warning>

To make the request, we have to include an email address (which is required to create new contacts in Loops). Then we'll also add a "User ID" value (which will maintain a distinct connection between a user in Bubble to their contact record in Loops) plus the "Plan name" property. Due to the data in my example application, I know all three of these fields will always have a value.

In the **Body** field, paste this:

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "<Email>",
  "userId": "<User_ID>",
  "planName": "<Plan_name>"
}
```

If you then click anywhere outside the **Body** field, you'll see two sets of fields appear below it, one for each of the three custom variables (`Email`, `User_ID` and `Plan_name`) we added to the body data.

Uncheck the **Private** checkbox for each of these variables, otherwise they won't show up in the Bubble interface when you come to use this API call.

The final step is to initialize the call, which will show Bubble that the API call works.

To do this, enter some example values in each of the **Value** fields, then click **Initialize call** (this will send real data to Loops).

If it works, you'll see a success message and a confirmation of the returned values from Loops. Click **Save** to complete setting up the API call.

If the request is not successful, you should see a message telling you what went wrong.

<Info>When you're done, remember to delete the test data you just added in the **Value** fields.</Info>

## Add the action to your Workflow

The final step is using your API call inside your application.

To do this, go to **Workflows** in your Bubble account and create a workflow for when you want to send a user to Loops.

In this example, I want to sync users to Loops whenever they log in (they could also be synced after other events, like if their email address changes).

This will show a popover containing the fields you added in the previous step, allowing you to insert your data in Bubble into the API call.

Click into a field and then **Insert dynamic data**, then select the data you want to send to Loops. (In my example I searched for "Current User" and then selected `'s email`, `'s unique ID` and `'s plan` to fill out the three fields.)

Now when the selected event happens, Bubble will make an API call to Loops!

To verify everything is set up correctly, log in to your Bubble app (to trigger the event) and then check the [Audience page](https://app.loops.so/audience) in Loops to see if your user account appears.

## Other examples

There are lots of different ways you can use Bubble's API Connector to send data to Loops:

* Create a newsletter subscription form and send all submitted email addresses to Loops.
* Sync contacts whenever a user's email address is changed in Bubble.
* [Trigger an event](/events) in Loops for all new sign ups using the [Send event endpoint](/api-reference/send-event), to enter new users into a welcome email sequence.
* Periodically sync [contact properties](/contacts/properties) to Loops so you can send personalized emails.

# How to set up double opt-in with Loops
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/double-opt-in

A guide for creating a double opt-in flow with Loops using the API and transactional emails.

<Tip>
  Loops offers [native double opt-in](/contacts/double-opt-in). The following
  guide is for anyone who wants to roll their own.
</Tip>

Double opt-in is a process that requires a user to confirm their email address before they are added to a mailing list. This is useful to ensure that the email address is valid, and is an extra step to gain confirmation that the user wants to be subscribed. In some parts of the world, double opt-in is a best practice and in some countries, a legal requirement.

<Info>
  This guide requires writing code, a system for handling form submissions, and
  a way to store signups outside Loops before they are verified.
</Info>

## How it works

Double opt-in works by sending a verification email to the user's email address when they sign up for a mailing list. The user then confirms their subscription typically by clicking a link in the email or entering a code into a web page. Once the subscription is confirmed, the user can then be safely added to the mailing list.

## Setting up double opt-in in Loops

To create a double opt-in flow in Loops, we can use the API and transactional emails together. The actual sign-up form will need to be handled by your own application, then you can use the Loops API to send the verification email and then add the user to your audience once the email is confirmed.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Create a new transactional email in Loops.
2. Create a form in your application on your website.
3. When the form is submitted, send the transactional email to the user's email address, including a link to confirm their email address.
4. Build a page to handle the confirmation step.
5. When confirmed, add the contact to your audience in Loops.

Let's jump in.

## Create a transactional email

First, let's create a transactional email in Loops. Do this from the [Transactional](https://app.loops.so/transactional) page in the Loops dashboard or you can use a [ready-made template](https://app.loops.so/templates?templateId=clm1oho4b000008jn3exn2yew).

Create a new transactional email containing whatever content you like, and make sure to add a data variable for the confirmation URL, like `verificationUrl`. We will populate this with the unique code when sending the email.

You can add this a text into your email. Or add a link to text or a button by using the **Link** sidebar panel.

<Frame caption="To add a link to your button: Click the data variable icon (1), then click into the link field (2), then add the data variable name (3)">

    />
</Frame>

## Create a signup form

Next, we need to create a form from which people can sign up for the mailing list. This form should be placed on your own website and you'll need to handle the submission of the form to save the data from it.

The form needs at minimum a field for the user's email address but you can also add any other fields that you want to collect for each signup.

```HTML  theme={"dark"}
<form action="/signup" method="POST">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email address" />
  <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
```

<Note>
  For security and protection against bots and spam signups, you could add a
  CSRF token or use a honeypot field in the form.
</Note>

## Handling the form submission and sending the verification email

When the form is submitted, you need to create a unique one-time code and send the transactional email.

Let's first create and endpoint to handle the form submission. Note how we check the database for an existing code before creating a new one, to make sure it's unique every time. The code is then stored in the database so we can check against it when the user clicks the link in the email.

```JavaScript signup.ts theme={"dark"}
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import crypto from 'crypto';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
  }

  try {
    const { email } = req.body;

    if (!email) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' });
    }

    // Generate a unique verification code using UUID
    const code = crypto.randomUUID();

    // Store the email and verification code
    const signupToken = await prisma.signupToken.create({
      data: {
        email,
        code,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24 hours from now
      },
    });

    // TODO: Send the verification email

    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: 'Signup token created successfully',
      data: signupToken
    });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating signup token:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}
```

Now let's add code to send the verification email using the Loops API.

We first need to get the transactional email ID from the **Review** step of your transactional email, and the example payload.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=9fd1e158a1b13a56aaff14b84d1e7b39" alt="Transactional email ID and example payload" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="2100" height="2100" data-path="images/double-opt-in-payload.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=fa72230a6c91b6652a153bbf6f443afd 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=ba127e7a432f15ccda7fd0e8626f6fe2 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=31c04fac6b633a71f35cf8b0727516a0 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=9cd95c49b4ebcee8880b4e46cc3cfd11 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=998bf22037163d92599c40e035b174d4 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/double-opt-in-payload.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=511e0f8d4e1efe7a981af5933bebab7e 2500w" />

Then we can use the Loops API or an SDK to send the email. Here's an example using the Loops [JavaScript SDK](/sdks/javascript). Note that you'll also need to add a Loops API key.

```javascript signup.ts {4,7,34-48} theme={"dark"}
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import crypto from "crypto";
import { LoopsClient, APIError } from "loops";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const loops = new LoopsClient(process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY);

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  if (req.method !== "POST") {
    return res.status(405).json({ error: "Method not allowed" });
  }

  try {
    const { email } = req.body;

    if (!email) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Email is required" });
    }

    // Generate a unique verification code using UUID
    const code = crypto.randomUUID();

    // Store the email and verification code
    const signupToken = await prisma.signupToken.create({
      data: {
        email,
        code,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24 hours from now
      },
    });

    // Send the verification email
    try {
      await loops.sendTransactionalEmail({
        transactionalId: "<your_email_id>",
        email: email,
        dataVariables: {
          verificationUrl: `https://yourdomain.com/verify?code=${code}&email=${email}`,
        },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof APIError) {
        // API error, details will be in the error.json.message property
      } else {
        // Non API error
      }
    }

    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Signup token created successfully",
      data: signupToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating signup token:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });
  }
}
```

## Build the verification page

The final step is to build a page to handle the confirmation step. This page will be used to verify the email address and add the contact to the audience.

Here's an example of an endpoint, which could be called from the verification page, to check the email address and code from the verification URL.

We use the [`updateContact()` method](/sdks/javascript#updatecontact) from the SDK to add the contact to the audience. This will create the contact if they don't exist yet.

```JavaScript verify.ts theme={"dark"}
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { LoopsClient, APIError } from "loops";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const loops = new LoopsClient(process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY);

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
  }

  try {
    const { code, email } = req.body;

    if (!code || !email) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Verification code and email are required' });
    }

    // Find the token in the database
    const token = await prisma.signupToken.findUnique({
      where: { code, email },
    });

    // Check if token exists
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Invalid verification code' });
    }

    // Check if token has expired
    if (token.expiresAt < new Date()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Verification code has expired' });
    }

    // Add the contact to Loops
    // Instead of using createContact(), updateContact() will
    //  create the contact if they don't exist yet, and won't
    //  return an error if the contact already exists
    try {
      await loops.updateContact(token.email);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof APIError) {
        // API error, details will be in the error.json.message property
        return res.status(500).json({ error: error.json.message });
      } else {
        // Non API error
        return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
      }
    }

    // Delete the used token
    await prisma.signupToken.delete({
      where: { id: token.id },
    });

    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: 'Email verified successfully',
      email: token.email
    });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error verifying email:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}
```

The call to Loops to add the contact is the most basic option, with just the email address. You can also add other properties to the contact, such as their name or add the contact to a specific [mailing list](/contacts/mailing-lists).

To add contacts to specific mailing lists, modify the call to include the `mailingLists` property:

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
await loops.updateContact(
  token.email,
  {},
  {
    "<your_mailing_list_id>": true,
  }
);
```

# Dark mode support in emails
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/email-dark-mode

Understanding dark mode support in email clients and best practices for consistent rendering.

It can be difficult to ensure consistent email rendering in both light and dark modes across different email clients. Dark mode is now a default setting for many email clients (on both desktop and mobile devices) and it's important to ensure your emails look good in both modes.

Email clients handle dark mode quite differently, making it challenging to maintain consistent branding and design. Some clients automatically invert colors, while others respect dark mode preferences through CSS media queries.

This guide explores the current state of dark mode support and provides practical solutions for maintaining brand consistency.

<Tip>
  While we don't currently support a dark mode version when creating emails in our editor, we automatically enable dark mode support in email clients that can handle it. Note that this doesn't include image handling, as dark mode support for images varies significantly across different email clients.
</Tip>

## Best practices

Ultimately, after experimenting with a number of techniques, the following combination of techniques can enhance consistency across clients while respecting dark mode preferences:

1. **Logo color**: use either grey or a colorful brand color that works on both light/dark backgrounds
2. **Image stroke**: apply a stroke to the logo that matches the light-mode email background
3. **Dark mode optimization**: Progressively enhance clients that support `prefers-color-scheme` with a specific dark mode logo

### Logo color

When designing logos for emails, try to use a color that works well in both light and dark modes. Consider using grey or brand colors that maintain visibility in dark mode.

Try to avoid dark or black logos that might disappear in dark mode. Make sure to test your emails in dark mode in different email clients to ensure the logo is visible.

Some email clients (like Gmail on Android 14) automatically invert small images under \~50px if they detect poor contrast in dark mode. This behavior varies across clients and versions, so it's crucial to test your specific logo in different clients.

### Image stroke

For logos that need to maintain their original colors, consider adding a stroke in the colour of your light mode background. This stays invisible in light mode, but becomes visible in dark mode and highlights the logo.

Using thicker strokes usually improves visibility when scaled down. And ideally the change is made to the image itself rather than using a CSS filter.

Limitations to this technique:

* May not meet your brand or design guidelines
* You may need to make kerning or spacing changes for optimal appearance
* Stroke thickness might be limited by your logo's design
* Image scaling can affect stroke appearance and visibility

### CSS

While [support](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-at-media-prefers-color-scheme/) for the `prefers-color-scheme` media query is limited—with Gmail being the main barrier for mass adoption—you can still optimize for dark mode.

<Warning>
  Loops does not currently support custom CSS in our editor. You can still use this technique by adding the CSS to [imported MJML templates](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email).
</Warning>

With this technique you can use different image assets for dark mode in supported clients and have more control over text colors.

Apple Mail has the best dark mode support so it makes sense to test there first. Just make sure to also view your emails in Gmail and Outlook to ensure the dark mode is working as expected.

Here's a very basic example of how to use this technique:

```html  theme={"dark"}
<style>
body {
  color: #000;
  background-color: #fff;
}
.light-logo {
  display: block;
}
.dark-logo {
  display: none;
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    color: #fff;
    background-color: #000;
  }
  .light-logo {
    display: none;
  }
  .dark-logo {
    display: block;
  }
}
</style>

# Set up a welcome email sequence for new Ghost members
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/ghost-email-sequence

Send automated email sequences to new Ghost subscribers using Zapier and Loops.

This guide helps you set up email sequences that get sent to all new subscribers to your Ghost site.

With Loops, you can set up sophisticated sequences called "[loops](/loop-builder)", allowing you to send a range of welcome emails to your members over a period of time.

Using [Zapier](https://zapier.com), we can automatically add every new member who signs up on your Ghost site to your Loops audience.

## Set up the Zapier Trigger

The first step is to connect your Ghost site to Loops using Zapier.

Sign up to Zapier and create a new Zap using Ghost's **Member Created** Trigger.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=a4065f83654edae063dbf52907024c92" alt="Add Ghost trigger" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1221" height="1221" data-path="images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=b756111e90a94d24fda212530c3c6145 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=71802b8c498076c69b3006ee2d62a7c8 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=71a70a491d255ba90077f3246d2bd520 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=479d9fd9b7329823c78a2af6d1f80711 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=f5bc879ca09959a0a29f715502cb069c 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-ghost-trigger.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=a829236ce86db983c76ea68eb5da07e2 2500w" />

This creates an automation that will trigger every time a new member is created in Ghost. Zapier will then send the contact's information over to Loops.

Now connect Ghost from the Trigger by clicking **Account** then **Sign in** and then pasting in your Ghost API key and API URL. To find these, go to Settings in your Ghost admin, search for "Integrations" and click on **Zapier**.

## Set up the Zapier Action

Next you need to link up Loops as the Action. Click the **Action** node, search for Loops and select the **Send Event** option in the Event dropdown.

Click **Continue**, then **Sign in** and paste in your Loops API key (which you can find from your [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api)).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=57d92c4753c574e79e46bb270d02386c" alt="Sign in to Loops" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1164" height="1164" data-path="images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=4629ee6674e5fe86dddec4cf02b9d893 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=98685da373144a21943bd707f9a8e4fa 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=4a7188fb83a430c35a7201a62b862b2d 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=e01eca081bfc93d6573aa9d0e79451bd 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=2837614807c1e00506a74ad1b4ba6b2b 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/zapier-sign-in-loops.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=31b3c4a2e996f630003494bc21edf2a3 2500w" />

<Tip>
  Instead of using an event for the loop trigger, you could also choose to send the loop to every new contact created in your audience.\
  We choose the event trigger in this example as you may add other contacts to your audience from other sources than Ghost.
</Tip>

Now click **Continue** to move to the **Action** tab. This is where you can configure which Ghost data is sent to Loops.

As you click each field, you can select the different Ghost-provided data.

In **Email**, select the Email field. In **User ID**, select the ID field.

In the **Event Name** field, write something like `newMember`. This is the name we'll use in Loops to trigger the email sequence. You can use any name, but make it descriptive. You'll need this name in the next step inside Loops.

If you want to include contact-related information in your emails you can use [event properties](/events/properties). To do this, add more Ghost data in the **Event Properties** field. For example, if you want to include the user's name, subscribed status, member status or your newsletter's name, you can add these properties here. Click the `+` button to add new properties each time.

Click **Continue** to see an overview of the event and its data that you'll send to Loops. Here you can test the action works by clicking **Test Step**. This will send actual data to Loops, which you will see in the Event Log section on the [Events page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events).

When you're happy everything is set up properly, click **Publish**.

<Tip>
  If you ever change the event properties sent from Zapier, you need to update the event data in Loops to match. You can do this from [Settings -> Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events). Click on the event and edit the listed properties. [More info](/events/properties#editing-event-properties)
</Tip>

## Create an email sequence

Now that the connections are set up, you can create the email sequence "loop" in Loops.

Go to Loops and click on **Loops** in the sidebar.

Click **New**, which will create a new loop and show the [loop builder](/loop-builder).

Select the **Event is fired** trigger option.

Click on the **Event received** trigger in the loop builder and enter the name you entered in Zapier in the previous step (in this example, `newMember`).

You can edit the **Timer** node if you want to add a delay between the event being received by Loops and the email being sent to your Ghost members.

You can also add a filter to the audience for this loop, if you want to limit sending to a certain sub-group of your members. If you want the loop to send to all new Ghost members, just leave it as "All contacts".

Lastly, click the **Send email** node and then **Create email**. You'll see the [email editor](/creating-emails/editor) open, where you can create your email.

If you opted to send event properties from Zapier, you can add them to your email by clicking the `⚡️` button above the editor (1) and then configuring in the **Event Property** editor panel (2).

# Why we don't support HTML emails
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/html-emails

Understanding why Loops doesn't support HTML email content and the benefits of our approach.

This guide explains why Loops doesn't support HTML email content in your requests, and how this approach benefits your team in the long run. We'll cover the common questions we receive and explain our philosophy on email management.

## The multi-provider problem

In our experience working with hundreds of software companies, we've noticed a pattern: by the Series B stage, most companies are using 3-6 different email sending providers. This fragmentation happens because different teams have different needs:

* Growth teams need advanced automation tools
* Marketing teams focus on promotional content
* Product teams send surveys and feature-specific emails
* Sales teams need targeted outreach
* Customer success teams handle support emails
* Engineering teams want simple, maintainable solutions

Each department gets its own tool, requiring coordination between design, marketing, legal, and engineering to keep everything working together.

**We believe there's a better way.**

## Why we don't support HTML content

We intentionally don't support HTML content in your requests because we don't believe emails belong in your codebase. Here's why:

### Branding management

When you need to update your brand colors, footer copy, or logo, you shouldn't need to:

1. Open a pull request
2. Update code
3. Deploy changes
4. Test across all email types

In Loops, these changes are a single click away and apply instantly across all your emails, whether they're transactional, marketing, or product updates. Even better, non-technical team members can make these changes without involving engineering.

### Email client compatibility

Email clients are notoriously inconsistent in how they render HTML. We maintain daily updates to our email rendering system to handle things like:

* New email client versions
* Dark mode changes
* Mobile rendering quirks
* Legacy client support

By handling this complexity for you, we ensure your emails look great everywhere, from the latest iPhone to that ancient Outlook version your biggest client refuses to update.

### Long-term support

Email clients evolve slowly but constantly. Keeping up with that is literally our full-time job. By taking HTML out of your codebase, we're basically giving you a free email-compatibility team that monitors email client changes, updates, tests across all major clients, and handles edge cases.

### Security and deliverability

When major email providers like Gmail and Yahoo update their guidelines, we catch changes early and update our system proactively, ensuring your emails remain compliant and maintain high deliverability rates.

### Team collaboration

Keeping your emails out of your codebase means any member of your team can make changes without engineering involvement.

It's also possible to preview new content or designs without affecting live emails, and make changes instantly without deployment.

## Summary

You probably have better things to do than manage email templates. Our approach means:

* Your team can update emails without engineering
* Changes are instant and safe
* Emails look great everywhere
* You maintain consistent branding
* We handle all the technical complexity

# How to set up customer lifecycle emails in Loops
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/lifecycle-emails

How to send onboarding, dunning and churn emails to your customers with Loops.

For SaaS companies, there are a few important events in a customer lifecycle that email can help with.

* **Acquisition emails** are emails sent after a user signs up for a waitlist, platform or newsletter.
* **Onboarding emails** help brand new users get familiar with—and get the most out of—your product.
* **Retention emails** keep your users engaged long-term.
* **Re-engagement emails** attempt to get users active again if they haven't used your platform recently.
* **Dunning emails** help reduce churn by prompting the user to re-activate a subscription or fix payment issues.
* **Re-activation emails** attempt to bring users back after a cancelation.

With Loops, you can easily set up "loops" (email workflows) plus our API (or an integration) to help with each of these use cases.

## How it works

To get this set up in Loops, the idea is to create a [loop](/loop-builder) for each of the types of email you want to send. So there would be a loop for activation emails and a loop for dunning emails and so on.

A loop is like an email sequence containing emails, time delays, audience filters and an initial trigger.

We will use a [custom contact property](/contacts/properties) called `subscriptionStatus` to enter users into each of the loops at different times in their subscriptions.

This property is used as the [loop trigger](/loop-builder/loop-triggers); if the property is ever changed—using [an integration](/integrations) or the [Loops API](/api-reference)—we trigger a loop, which will send emails to the contact.

## Add a contact property

First, let's add the contact property to the audience in Loops.

Go to your [Audience page](https://app.loops.so/audience). Click on a table header to show the dropdown then select **Add property**.

Enter "Subscription status" into the **Name** field and make sure **String** is selected in the "Type" field. (You'll notice that the "stored name" of your property is `subscriptionStatus`. This is the name we'll use in the API and integrations).

Click **Add Property** when you're done. Your new property was added to the far right of the Audience table.

## Update contacts

Now you can click on contacts and update the value manually one-by-one, or use the API or an integration to update contacts programmatically.

To update contacts in bulk you can download your Audience as a CSV, update values and [re-upload the file](/add-users/csv-upload).

## Create loops

The next step is to create the loops, one for each type of email. Repeat the following step for each of the different subscription statuses you want to send emails for.

Go to the [Loops page](https://app.loops.so/loops) in your account and click **New**.

Select the **Contact update** option, which will create a new loop using that trigger.

You will enter the [loop builder](/loop-builder). Click on the **Contact updated** node to set up the loop trigger.

### Set up the trigger

1. Select the "Subscription Status" property from the **When** dropdown.
2. The **Changes from** dropdown should have "Any value" selected.
3. Netx you need to specify wheat value Loops should look out for to enter users into the loop.
   For example, for onboarding emails, you can choose "is empty" from the **To** dropdown. For re-activation emails select "Equals" from the **To** dropdown and enter a relevant value like "Canceled".
4. **Trigger time** should be set to "Every time"; this will make sure users are entered into the loop every time that the Subscription Status value matches.

### Create emails

Now create the email(s) you want to send from each loop.

You can add as many emails as you like into each loop, separated with timers. If you want to send emails to certain groups of contacts, you can use Audience filters in your loop.

We have a range of [email templates](https://app.loops.so/templates) available, which you can use as a base for all of your subscription emails.

If you want to use cohesive branding in your emails, make use of [themes](/creating-emails/editor#themes) in the editor.

## Update the Subscription status value

The final step is to make sure that your contacts have the correct "Subscription status" value assigned to them in Loops.

This will make sure they are in the correct loops at the correct moment within their subscription.

Using the API you can make a simple `PUT` call to the [Update contact endpoint](/api-reference/update-contact), with a request containing the contact's email address and subscription status.

(You can also add more contact properties in this call if you want to add more data to the contact in Loops.)

<Note>
  Using the Update contact endpoint will either create or update a contact in
  Loops using the provided email address.
</Note>

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "email": "canceleduser@gmail.com",
  "subscriptionStatus": "Canceled"
}
```

Many of [our integrations](/integrations) allow syncing of contact data. Just make sure you create or update contacts and include the current `subscriptionStatus` value.

Now you have set up different loops to trigger when the "Subscription status" value changes, your users will be automatically entered into each loop and receive the correct emails at the correct times during their subscription lifecycle.

## Example loops

Here are some example loops you can create along with a suggested trigger and loop contents.

### Onboarding

Sent to brand new users.

* **Trigger**: Contact added or Contact updated (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` is empty).
* **Audience filter**: Match the trigger (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` is empty).
* **Loop contents**: 1–5 welcome and onboarding emails over the first 30 days.

### New subscribers

Sent to users who just started paying.

* **Trigger**: Contact updated (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` changes to "Paying").
* **Audience filter**: Match the trigger (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` equals "Paying").
* **Loop contents**: 1–3 emails about paid-only features over the next 3 days.

### Dunning

Sent to customers who had a first failed payment.

* **Trigger**: Contact updated (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` changes to "Failed").
* **Audience filter**: Match the trigger (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` equals "Failed").
* **Loop contents**: 1–3 emails during your dunning period.

### Churn

Sent to customers who have just cancelled their payments.

* **Trigger**: Contact updated (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` changes to "Canceled")
* **Audience filter**: Match the trigger (e.g. `subscriptionStatus` equals "Canceled").
* **Loop contents**: 1 email saying goodbye and asking for feedback.


# Your first onboarding emails
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/onboarding-emails

Some best practices for building your sender reputation with onboarding emails.

We covered the basics of a Sender Reputation in [this guide](/deliverability/sending-reputation) and this guide will cover some best practices for building your sender reputation with onboarding emails.

If you're new to Loops, we recommend taking some specific steps to help warm up your sending reputation and to ensure your emails land in inboxes.

We want to start with an onboarding Loop and transactional emails before we send larger campaigns to a large list. When we send those larger campaigns, we want to first start with a small list and then slowly increase volume while monitoring the results.

## Onboarding welcome loop

The first step is to set up a welcome email sent to users after they sign up to your application or subscribe to your list. Recipients of these emails are expecting the email and are most likely to engage with it.

For example, new users who sign up could expect a welcome email from you, welcoming them to your platform and explaining some initial steps to get them started.

Here is an example of the email we at Loops send out to new users:

Users receive these emails because they expect them, so they are more likely to open and engage with them, building your sender reputation.

Get started by [creating loops](/loop-builder), which are email automations used to send emails after certain triggers, like a new contact joining your audience or after an event happens in your platform.

### Creating a welcome loop in Loops

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a loop">
    Go to your [Loops page](https://app.loops.so/loops) and click **New**, or select from one of our [ready-made templates](https://app.loops.so/templates).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the trigger">
    Set your trigger to **Contact added** if you want the loop to fire for every new contact. You can also set a filter to only send to contacts with a specific tag or property, or specifically target it to a specific list.

    Select **Event received** if you want to trigger the loop based on something happening in an external platform.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an email">
    Next, write your email by clicking on the **Send email** node.\
    Make sure to make your loop active by clicking **Start**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transactional emails

Transactional emails are by definition emails that are sent to users because of an action they took or need to take to use your platform. Since all emails from Loops send from a single domain and IP, we can also use these emails to build our sender reputation. We recommend starting with these essential transactional emails:

* Login verification emails
* Password reset emails
* Account confirmation emails

These types of emails have high engagement rates since users actively request them, which helps build your sender reputation.

## Targeted campaign

Once your welcome loop has been active and sending for 2 or 3 days, you should see an open rate of around 40% on the first email after the welcome email.

Now you can start to send a campaign to a small list of engaged users. Here are two recommended approaches:

1. Target recent signups using the `createdAt` property to find users added in the last 3 days
2. Target active users by syncing login data to track your most engaged users

For your first campaign content, we recommend:
✅ Product updates or new feature announcements
❌ Avoid generic newsletters, giveaways or promotional content

Important metrics to monitor:

* Campaign open rate should be above 30%
* Welcome loop open rate should stay above 40%
* If either drops below these thresholds, pause sending and re-evaluate

Loops helps to mitigate deliverability issues by sending campaign emails in batches, waiting to check open rates and then sending further emails in your list depending on the results. We take great care to make sure your emails have the highest deliverability as possible from our side.

### Sending a campaign to active users in Loops

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define and label &#x22;active&#x22; users">
    You can use the default `createdAt` contact property, or you can create custom [contact properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) and use the [API](/api-reference/update-contact) or an [integration](/integrations) to update contacts when an event happens in your account (e.g. a log in).

    For example, you could use the name `lastActive` and choose the "Date" field type. Then whenever the user does a major action in your application, update the contact with a new `lastActive` value:

    ```javascript  theme={"dark"}
    POST /v1/contacts/update
    {
      "userId": user.id,
      "lastActive": new Date().getTime() // timestamp in milliseconds
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the campaign to your segment">
    Once you have created your campaign in Loops, you need to specify the audience based on your chosen date field.

    In the "Audience" tab, choose "Last Active" (or "Created At"), then "After" and then pick the date three days ago from the date field.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Larger campaigns

Now you have warmed up your account, you can start to send out larger campaigns to more contacts.

You may want to import users from another email platform of your application's user database.

We still recommend to not send to everyone on your list. Try to identify segments in your user list (especially if it's in the thousands) that are most likely to open emails from you.

# Open rates are a vanity metric
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/open-rates

And why that’s okay.

When it comes to email marketing, there are countless metrics that you can track. Some of these metrics may be fun to track and look great on paper (your computer screen) but unfortunately don’t actually lead to improved business results.

These are vanity metrics.

While you might think that vanity metrics help paint a picture of success or improvements to unknowing stakeholders, they are ultimately a distraction.

Facebook likes, Twitter followers, blog pageviews… these are all vanity metrics because they don’t materially impact the success of your business in a tangible way.

But so are email open rates.

Yes, you read that right. The main metric you’ve been tracking (and sharing) to gauge the success or failure of your email marketing campaigns is (mostly) just for show.

## What is an email open rate?

An email open rate is the number of unique opens your email campaign receives. Calculating open rate is simple:

Number of unique email opens / Number of delivered emails x 100 = Open Rate

Delivered emails are important here because hard bounced emails do not count towards this calculation.

<Info>
  Note: a hard bounced email is an email that cannot be delivered due to an unchanging and permanent reason. Unfortunately, there is nothing that you can do to reverse this to force your email through.
</Info>

Some common reasons for a hard bounce are recipient email address doesn’t actually exist, recipient mail server doesn’t exist, and invalid domain name. While a hard bounce will prevent your email from arriving in its intended inbox it is possible that a hard bounce could be caused by something as simple as your recipient having a typo in their email address.

To keep things simple, let’s assume you sent and delivered an email to 100 different users in your campaign. 23 of your users opened this email giving you an open rate of 23%.

23 / 100 = .23 x 100

Easy enough, right?

Up until recently, open rates were a universally loved way to gauge campaign performance.

So what changed?

## Your open rate is (now) a vanity metric

Apple changed — mostly. With a dominating [59.8% email client market share](https://www.litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-february-2022/), any change they make is a huge deal.

New privacy initiatives from many of the largest email clients are quietly removing email senders ability to successfully track open rates.

Apple is leading the charge with their new “Mail Privacy Protection” (first introduced in 2021 with iOS 15) that allows users to opt-in to having Apple pre-load their email upon receipt. By doing so, the email’s tracking pixel will immediately trigger.

<Info>
  Note: an email tracking pixel is a 1px by 1px square image that is inserted into an email and is transparent in color and invisible to the recipient. These tracking pixels are what allow marketers to measure open rate, click rate, traffic sources and more.
</Info>

This change artificially inflates open rates as delivered emails will now automatically show as opened whether they truly have or have not been opened by the intended recipient.

These changes to email open tracking are completely out of the sender’s control.

And to top it all off, these changes affect not only users receiving emails on the Apple Mail app itself but also those who use an Apple client in any way (r[egardless of email server](https://www.litmus.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection-for-marketers/)). This means that using GMail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc. on iOS 15 may also contribute to your now-inflated open rate.

What was once a key metric to track and share with key stakeholders should now be viewed with a bit more skepticism.

## What’s next?

It is highly unlikely that these recent privacy changes will be reversed anytime soon (ever).

So what can you do about it?

The answer may surprise you.

We suggest continuing to run your campaigns as you have been.

<Info>
  Continue to send consistent emails (both in frequency and content), create intriguing and accurate subject lines and body content, segment your list so that only the most relevant audience is receiving your emails, and pay close attention to your unsubscribe rate.
</Info>

However, now you should put a greater emphasis on tracking specific product goals in relation to your email campaigns. Have actionable metrics in mind – metrics around business goals such as generating free trials, converting trials to paid, increased usage of your app or inviting team members.

And actually, this should have been the goal all along.

High open rates don’t necessarily lead to increased sales or profits for your business, the end result of those opens is what really makes the difference.

Now that your focus has transitioned to more tangible KPI’s that lead to specific product goals being met it will be much easier to accurately measure the success of your email marketing campaigns.

Looking back on it, maybe your email open rate becoming a vanity metric overnight will ultimately be a blessing in disguise.

Take this as an opportunity to refocus your attention on the KPI’s that ultimately matter for your business. High open rates may have been impressive in the past but now it’s time to craft and measure your email campaigns against the things that truly move the needle.


# Product updates
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/product-updates

Our updated, definitive guide for sending product updates.

## Introduction

A product update should be sent once a month with updates about what you shipped recently. This typically includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

Things to keep in mind:

* Brevity is key. Users don't want to read a novel.
* If you send valuable content, users will come to expect (and open) it.
* It's okay to send multiple emails in a month if that's your shipping cadence.

1. [Create a new email Campaign](/creating-emails/editor)
2. Add your logo at the top of the email, [save it as a component](/creating-emails/components) if you haven't already.
3. Add a simple subject line, like "The latest updates from Loops"
4. Add a simple intro paragraph, with a link to the full changelog, potentially socials and a highlight of the most important changes along with a call to action to read the full email.
5. Try to limit the number of updates to 2-3, and make sure they are relevant to the content. It's better to have a single or a couple impactful, relevant updates than a long list of updates that are not relevant to the user.
6. In the footer, add a link to the full changelog, socials, and a link to unsubscribe.
7. [Send the email!](/sending-first-email)

<Warning>
  Be careful not to overwhelm your users with too many updates. Focus on the
  most impactful changes.
</Warning>

## Choosing your audience

### For new senders

If you're just starting out, send to all users and maintain a steady cadence over time.

### For established senders

If you have an existing list but haven't sent product updates before:

* Send to active users who have engaged with your product in the last 30 days
* Include users who have created an account in the last 30 days
* If the audience size is less than 5,000 users, send to all users

# Retrigger a Loop
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/retroactively-trigger-loop

Backfill contacts into a loop.

<Warning>
  This is a temporary workaround while we build native backfill. The current
  flow is clunky and will get much better. Please still let us know you want
  native backfill so we can prioritize it.
</Warning>

### When to use this

* You have an existing loop that should have run for some contacts but didn’t.
* You’re comfortable exporting and re-importing a contact list.

### What you’ll do (high level)

1. Duplicate the original loop.
2. Create a one-off contact property (e.g., `backfill_welcome_sep2025`).
3. Change the duplicate loop’s trigger to “Contact updated” based on that property.
4. Start the duplicated loop.
5. Export the intended audience.
6. Add the property to the CSV for those contacts.
7. Re-import the CSV to update contacts and trigger the loop.

***

### Step-by-step

1. Duplicate the loop

* Open the loop you want to retroactively trigger.
* Use Duplicate to create a copy. Rename it clearly (e.g., “Welcome Backfill (Sep 2025)”).

2. Create a one-off contact property

* Add a new contact property to use exclusively for this backfill. Example:
  * Boolean: `backfill_welcome_sep2025` (true/false)
* Use a name that avoids collisions with any existing logic.

3. Change the duplicate loop’s trigger

* Set Trigger to “Contact updated”.
* Set the criteria to:
  * was any
  * is equal to `true`

<Tip>
  For one-off backfills, set Trigger frequency to <strong>One time</strong> so a
  contact only enters once.
</Tip>

4. Start the duplicated loop.

5. Export the intended audience from the original loop

* From the main audience table, [export the contacts](/contacts/export-contacts) who should be backfilled.

6. Prepare the CSV for re-import

* Open the CSV and add a new column with the property key you created.
* Populate that column with `true` for every row you want to trigger.
* Ensure the CSV still includes the primary identifier (either `email` or `userId`).

7. Re-import to update contacts and trigger

* Import the CSV.
* Confirm the column mapping so your backfill property maps 1:1 to the new contact property.
* Set the CSV to trigger loops (see [trigger loops via CSV](/add-users/csv-upload#trigger-loops-via-csv)).
* Start the import.

Your backfilled loop will begin triggering immediately.

<Warning>
  After the backfill completes, consider removing or resetting the temporary
  contact property to avoid accidental future triggers.
</Warning>


# How to create a scheduled email with Loops
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/scheduled-digest-email

How to send a daily, weekly or monthly email with a summary of what's happened in your app.

This email type may also be referred to as a "rollup" email or a "summary" email. The idea is to send a single email that summarizes what's happened in your app over a period of time.

These kinds of digest emails are a great way to keep your users engaged with your app.

The best way to do it today is a Loop with an [event trigger](/loop-builder/loop-triggers) set to fire “every time” with an event payload containing the updated property you’d like to send.

Then at the end of the day, week or month you can trigger a digest email with a summary of the events that happened.

## Create the loop and event

Go to the [Loops](https://app.loops.so/loops) page and create a new loop.

Choose the **Event is fired** trigger. You will enter the loop editor.

Click on the **Event received** node and type the name of your event. You can re-use an existing event or create a new one from this input.

For example, you can use a name like `sendDigest` and then click **+ Create new event**.

Next, click on the **Edit event properties** button to add [properties](/events/properties) to your event. Properties are extra pieces of data that you can attach to each event. This data is then made available in every email you send.

In the event editor overlay, click **+ Add event property** and add any properties you want to include in your digest email.

Make sure the "Trigger frequency" dropdown in the **Event received** node has **One time** selected, as we only want to email each user once per event.

## Create your email

The next step is to create the email you send to each contact.

Click on the **Send email** node and then **Create email**. This will open the email editor, where you can [create your email](/creating-emails/editor).

When you want to add the event properties you created in the previous step, click the `⚡️` button above the editor (1) and then configure in the **Event Property** editor panel (2).

In the right-hand panel, you will see a list allowing you to insert available event properties [into your email](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails).

Make sure to [add fallback values](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#fallback-values) for every property; if an event doesn't have a value for a property in your email, the email will not send. Fallback values make sure that emails are sent to every contact.

When you've finished creating your email, click **Start** in the top right. This will make your loop active and you can start triggering it by sending events.

## Trigger events

To send events to Loops you can use an [integration](/integrations), an [SDK](/sdks) or [our API](/api-reference).

With the API, it's just a case of making a request to the [Send event endpoint](/api-reference/send-event) containing the contact's details, the event name and your event properties.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "eventName": "sendDigest",
  "email": "user1@gmail.com",
  "eventProperties": {
    ...
  }
}
```

# How to resend a campaign to new subscribers
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/send-again

A quick guide for sending a campaign to subscribers who signed up since you sent it out.

If you're regularly adding new subscribers via [a form](/forms), [integration](/integrations) or [the API](/api-reference), it's likely that you will want to send a campaign to new contacts who signed up after you sent it initially.

In Loops, you can do this in two easy steps: duplicating the campaign and filtering the audience.

## Duplicate the campaign

The first step is to duplicate the campaign so that you can send it out again.

To do this, go to the Campaigns page and click on the `•••` menu icon, then select **Duplicate**.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=38745151d363c2cd549662db20728712" alt="Duplicating emails" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1064" height="1064" data-path="images/duplicating-emails.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=3908144ca2804f4d7b3d34b68a65b63e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=53b41e192386b3deed8e5b2bcfcc9a23 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=78d1f9a5aa155cc395988f35f44dd1da 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=cbfa9b2411286bb80d8b4abd7dc52e43 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=00fe12a0e222240bcec575fa97d7d4ec 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ/images/duplicating-emails.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I7MiNuGd9K5dwTEQ&q=85&s=352f9c0bbe10b71d59af1f78e8512370 2500w" />

## Send to your new contacts

When you're ready to send the email, it's important that it only gets sent to contacts that haven't been sent it already.

To do this, on the **Audience** page of the sending flow, select "Not Sent" from the first dropdown and then the *original* campaign from the third dropdown.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=11fd278b3b64477c05a48d835ee76e38" alt="Filter audience by sent campaign" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1326" height="1326" data-path="images/campaign-filter-resend.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=66f727f6f42baeac5e1ec1034728ca8f 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=c1d1036710d7ace1a72896b1c2374c4b 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=8b75c83a25c44ae96753e0135c271d57 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=cf5cd2dde5d047947a89766ce28697c3 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=890be3f95967b166a72c25d436f05c99 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/campaign-filter-resend.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=c340f3a444070015f41947d0e1632a7c 2500w" />

This will update the total contacts and the table below, which will show contacts that were not sent the original campaign.

Check that everything looks OK and continue sending the email.


# What is BIMI?
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/what-is-bimi

And why does it matter?

As an email marketer, ensuring that your emails actually get seen and read is priority #1. Adding an avatar to your emails can increase your open rates by up to 21%. The familiarity and trust that this little avatar brings has a great impact on your email campaigns.

Outside of manually adding your brand’s logo as an avatar to each individual email client, there may actually be another way to ensure your emails have the same visual aid with additional layer of trust built in.

How? BIMI.

## What is BIMI?

BIMI, or Brand Indicators for Message Identification is a relatively new email standard that allows you to add your brand’s logo to your authenticated emails.

Adopting BIMI will allow your brand’s logo to appear next to your emails in your recipient’s inbox without manually needing to add and maintain it on a provider by provider level. As long as the email client supports BIMI, your logo will appear.

## Which email providers support BIMI?

A growing number of email provider’s are currently supporting BIMI with many more currently considering it. The current list of supported providers are:

* Gmail
* Google Workspace
* Apple Mail ([macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, and iPadOS 16, or later](https://developer.apple.com/support/bimi/))
* AOL
* Netscape
* Fastmail
* Yahoo (Yahoo Japan is not currently supported but is under considering for future adoption)
* Pobox

Here is the full breakdown of who does and doesn’t support BIMI as of right now:

## How does BIMI actually work?

Setting up BIMI will take a bit more work than simply uploading your brand’s logo and hitting save.

Technically speaking, BIMI is a text file that lives on your sending servers and works hand in hand with DKIM, SPF, and DMARC protocols.

At a broad level, after you send an email, your recipient’s email provider will look up your BIMI text file and attempt to verify the legitimacy of it. Once verified, your BIMI text file points the email provider to where they can find your logo and they will then attach it to your email.

To start, the sender (you) will need to ensure that you are DMARC compliant. DMARC (domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, & Conformance) is an [email authentication policy and reporting protocol](https://bimigroup.org/faqs-for-senders-esps/) that defends against unauthorized use of domains.

Basically, DMARC helps protect your brand by detecting emails that aren’t coming from your domain – preventing spoofing and phishing attempts.

The email provider will also run through the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) protocols to ensure that the sender’s email address was sent from the correct domain.

Next, you will need to create the logo that will actually be used. The current recommendation is a [square SVG file](https://bimigroup.org/creating-bimi-svg-logo-files/).

The naming convention of this file should be:

`https://yourservername.com/logo.svg`

Next is an optional but recommended step. To fully embrace BIMI, your brand should acquire a VMC, or a Verified Mark Certificate. This will help validate the true ownership of the logo being used. More on this in the section below.

Finally, you will need to create a TXT record for BIMI in your DNS records. This record will contain a URL to your logo for the email provider to grab and display.

The full implementation guide from BIMI can be located [here](https://bimigroup.org/implementation-guide/).

## How much does BIMI cost?

Along with taking some technical chops to get BIMI fully set up, it’s also not free.

Getting the Verified Mark Certificate mentioned above currently [costs \$1,500](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/verified-mark-certificates).

On top of this cost, to qualify for the certificate your brand logo also needs to be a registered trademark, which will also come with additional costs and possible legal fees.

## Checking your BIMI record

Now that you’ve gone through the work of setting up your BIMI records, it’s time to confirm that everything is working as expected.

The BIMI group provides a [BIMI inspector](https://bimigroup.org/bimi-generator/) where you can enter your domain to ensure everything is set.

## Implement BIMI, build trust

As you can see, fully embracing BIMI is a lengthy and potentially expensive process that may test your patience.

However, leaning into this new email standard positions your brand to gain your reader’s trust while limiting the manual labor and upkeep on your end to ensure that your brand’s logo is always at the forefront of their inboxes.

As the inbox becomes a more and more competitive landscape with each passing day, anything that you can do to stand out should be done.

BIMI just might give your brand the edge it needs to capture those sought after eyeballs.


# What is DNS?
Source: https://loops.so/docs/guides/what-is-dns

A Beginner's Guide

Have you ever wondered how the internet seems to know precisely where to go when you type a website's name into your browser's address bar? How does your computer know to show you the right page when you type in "[www.loops.so](http://www.loops.so)"? The answer to these questions lies in the Domain Name System or DNS.

DNS is an essential part of the Internet's inner workings, serving as the Internet's equivalent of your iPhone’s address book. But what exactly is DNS, and why is it so important?

To understand DNS, we first need to understand how the Internet works. Let’s dive in!

## What is DNS?

Every device connected to the Internet, including computers, phones, and servers, has a unique IP address.

An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. For example, an IP address might look like this: "192.168.0.1".

However, humans generally find it much easier to remember names rather than strings of numbers. This is where the **Domain Name System (DNS)** comes in. The DNS translates the domain names that we humans easily understand and remember into the IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network!

For instance, when you type in "[www.loops.so](http://www.loops.so)" into your web browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server asking for the IP address associated with that domain name.

The DNS server responds with the IP address, and your computer then sends a request to that IP address to fetch and display the website.

The process of converting domain names into IP addresses is known as **DNS resolution**, and it usually takes only milliseconds. DNS servers are strategically located around the world and work together to ensure that these requests are processed quickly and accurately.

## Why is DNS important

Now, why is DNS crucial? Firstly, it makes the internet user-friendly.

Without DNS, we would have to memorize complex IP addresses for each website we wanted to visit. Secondly, it ensures the smooth operation of the internet. Every time you send an email, browse a website, or use an app, DNS is working behind the scenes to route your request to the right destination.

And if that wasn’t enough, DNS also provides a level of security. DNS servers can filter and block access to certain websites that might be harmful or inappropriate, providing an essential layer of protection for internet users. It helps you verify the authenticity of a sender via email as we’ll cover in the next section.

## DNS and email

DNS is vital for the functioning of email.

### Sending email

When you send an email, your email client needs to know where to send it.

Let's say you're sending an email to [someone@gmail.com](mailto:someone@gmail.com).

The client doesn't inherently know where "gmail.com" is, just like your web browser wouldn't know where to go if you entered that into the address bar. DNS steps in to resolve "gmail.com" into an IP address that represents the actual server your email needs to reach.

### Routing email to the right location

DNS is used for email routing, particularly through a type of DNS record called the MX (Mail Exchanger) record.

An MX record is a type of record that specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a recipient's domain.

A priority value (a number like 10 is typical) is used to prioritize mail delivery if multiple mail servers are available. Without the MX records, your email wouldn't know which server to go to.

### Security

Most importantly, DNS plays a critical role in email security.

For instance, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) are two methods used to prevent email spoofing, a technique used in phishing and spam campaigns where the sender masquerades as another by forging the header data.

SPF and DKIM utilize DNS to hold text records that a recipient's server can check to verify the sender's identity.

In essence, DNS is a cornerstone for email operations and security. It helps your email find its way to the correct server, ensures the recipient's server can accept the mail, and provides mechanisms to verify the sender's identity to combat fraudulent activities. Without DNS, our email system would be far less reliable and secure.

## Send better email with Loops

In summary, the Domain Name System, or DNS, is a critical component of both the internet and email as a whole, transforming the web from a complicated network of numeric addresses into an accessible and secure environment for users worldwide.

It's the silent hero that allows us to navigate the digital world with ease, translating memorable website names into computer-friendly IP addresses.

So, the next time you browse the internet or send that time-sensitive email, take a moment to appreciate the extraordinary system that makes it all possible: **DNS**.

# Auth0
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/auth0

Send Auth0 authentication emails with Loops.

Set up an SMTP connection to send all of your Auth0 emails with Loops.

There are two big benefits to using Loops for sending your Auth0 emails:

<Steps>
  <Step title="More control over design">
    You can use [Loops' design editor](/creating-emails/editor) to create (and
    then easily edit) beautiful transactional emails instead of having to code
    them with HTML.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Better visibility of sent emails">
    You get full visibility on which emails are being sent, when, and to whom in
    your Loops account. Auth0 doesn't offer this view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up Loops SMTP in Auth0

Go to **Branding -> Email Provider** in your Auth0 dashboard.

Scroll down and click on **SMTP Provider**.

In the SMTP Provider Settings section below, enter a value into the "From" field. This value will *always be overwritten by the values set in your Loops templates* from the next step, so it can be anything.

In the **SMTP Provider Settings** section enter the following data:

| Field       | Value                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Host        | `smtp.loops.so`                                                                            |
| Port number | `587`                                                                                      |
| Username    | `loops`                                                                                    |
| Password    | An API key copied from your [API settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops |

<Info>
  The **Send Test Email** button here will not work due to how the Loops SMTP
  system works. You can test your connection in a later step.
</Info>

## Create Transactional emails in Loops

Next, create new transactional emails for the emails you are sending from Auth0. Go to **Branding -> Email Templates** to view the full list.

In Loops, go to the [Transactional page](https://app.loops.so/transactional) and click **New**. Alternatively, you can select one of our many ready-made templates from the [Templates page](https://app.loops.so/templates).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=a9a8f86342faca1e1e856db175308419" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1328" height="1328" data-path="images/auth0-template.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=9096514b285c31ccc0e07ba4b520445e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=5b54782f56de12e259741a1731679b7a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=0ec243c92b6ac95ec772674d57978fb4 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=513decde06d290b3dae9536f491af5ef 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=da714792b13ed1a557252b9d54a2295a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-template.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=d55b0723adaf7fef99d2bcf25c41ad10 2500w" />

You can then use [the Loops editor](/creating-emails/editor) to create nicely-designed templates or make them as simple as you like.

You can even create [themes](/creating-emails/styles#themes) to apply consistent design and branding to all of your emails.

For each Loops template you create, you need to [add data variables](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#add-dynamic-content-to-emails), which allow data from Auth0 to be inserted into each email.

You can check the list of [Common variables](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/email/email-templates#common-variables) supported in each email from the Auth0 documentation.

Once you're done creating the email and adding the data variables, click **Next**. On the next page, click the **Show payload** button to view the API payload for your template. You will need this for the next step.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=63c92241cd4776a87d320451d3099eef" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1454" height="1454" data-path="images/auth0-payload.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=d9afa972a55760d973ce1e62286a8ee9 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=2f9cd94bfa8d0e9c1bcb5766b9516e56 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e3f0acef8a871c0932f1f1489a6a6755 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e4a586a2503fe8264368a8f3448a0feb 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=34c7b8870b03aacfdcc1a0b726d19571 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-payload.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=e779a2265456a050f24d3d875060e811 2500w" />

Make sure to also publish your email! It won't send unless it's published.

## Configure email templates in Auth0

The final step is to make sure your emails in Auth0 are configured to send the correct data to Loops.

<Warning>
  Make sure you set up at least the **Verification Email (using Link)** or
  **Verification Email (using code)** templates in Auth0. Enable other emails
  based on your user flows.
</Warning>

Loops SMTP integrations work a bit differently than most. Instead of sending a text or HTML email body, you set them up to send API-like data.

In Auth0, go to **Branding -> Email Templates**, then edit each template to contain the payload as shown in the previous step (you can click the clipboard icon in Loops to copy the full payload).

<Tip>
  Make sure that each template you want to use in Auth0 has the **Status** field
  enabled.
</Tip>

If you are using Passwordless authentication, add your Loops payload into the **Body** field at **Authentication -> Passwordless -> Email**.

Once pasted into the **Message** body, you need to add the Auth0 message variables into the payload. You can do this using double curly brackets like `{{ url }}`.

Here is an example "Verification Email (using Link)" email template. This payload was copied from the template's Publish page in Loops, then the `{{ user.email }}` and `{{ url }}` Auth0 variables were added.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clvmzp39u035tl50pw7wrl0ri",
  "email": "{{ user.email }}",
  "dataVariables": {
    "productName": "{{ application.name }}",
    "url": "{{ url }}"
  }
}
```

If you want to add each Auth0 user to your Loops audience so you can send marketing email to them, add the `addToAudience` flag to your template as below. This will create a contact in Loops using the `{{ user.email }}` value.

```json {4} theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clvmzp39u035tl50pw7wrl0ri",
  "email": "{{ user.email }}",
  "addToAudience": true,
  "dataVariables": {
    "productName": "{{ application.name }}",
    "url": "{{ url }}"
  }
}
```

Here's how the template looks in the Auth0 editor:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=a8493d476ff113be14647e077db93c60" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1407" height="1407" data-path="images/auth0-email.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=5d8d3ff219cd9dc72bd8d21e5ebb56f2 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=29f4d36b22c660868002d040ae624c7b 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=cd0fd028ef6fc23b6f71ed214d828f67 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=d017395fb87350e0f63c5e752eb0f867 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=ede8afa9fd3fd7336a01abdc004d6544 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/auth0-email.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=b743650316fe100eef7201889be04263 2500w" />

To test that everything works, click the **Try** button beneath the editor. Insert your email address in the modal that appears, then click **Try** to send the email.

You will also be able to see activity for your email sends in **Monitoring -> Logs**.

The best way to view your Auth0 email history is in Loops. Go to your [Transactional](https://app.loops.so/transactional) page then click on one of your emails. Click on **Metrics** in the left menu to view a page containing a table showing all sends and some statistics.

## Important notes

* The subject in Auth0 templates is always overwritten by the subject added to the corresponding template in Loops.
* The sender email configured in your Auth0 SMTP settings is always overwritten by the "From" address added to your templates in Loops.
* Any enabled Auth0 template not set up with the correct API-like payload will fail to send.


# Auth.js
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/authjs

Send Auth.js magic link emails with Loops.

Use Loops to send your [Auth.js Magic Link](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email) emails.

<Info>
  You must configure a [database
  adaptor](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/database) to use Magic Link
  authentication in Auth.js.
</Info>

There are two big benefits to using Loops for sending your Auth.js emails:

<Steps>
  <Step title="More control over design">
    You can use [Loops' design editor](/creating-emails/editor) to create (and
    then easily edit) beautiful transactional emails instead of having to code
    them with HTML.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Better visibility of sent emails">
    You get full visibility on which emails are being sent, when, and to whom in
    your Loops account. Auth.js doesn't offer this out of the box.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a transactional email

In Loops, create a new transactional email, which will be sent to your users when they attempt to log in.

Here is where you define your email's subject and sending details like From address and Reply to address. (Click the `>` button to reveal all the sending options.)

Then you can create your email in the editor. We recommend creating a stylish but basic email for magic links, to help with deliverability. Use the [style panel](/creating-emails/styles#style-panel) to customize the design.

To add the Auth.js magic link in your email, add a [data variable](/transactional#add-data-variables) named `url`. When the email is sent, each user's magic link will be inserted wherever you add the variable.

You can add data variables as URLs to text, buttons and images. In this example, we're adding the `url` data variable into the button's link field.

<Warning>
  Make sure that your variable is named `url`, which is the variable name
  Auth.js uses when sending authentication emails.
</Warning>

When you're done make sure to Save and Publish your email. Unpublished emails will not be sent.

## Set up Loops in your Auth.js Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Environment variables">
    To use the Loops provider in Auth.js, you'll need to add two environment variables to your project.

    The first is an API key. You can generate or copy one from [Settings -> API](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api).

    The second is the ID of your transactional email. Go to the email in Loops and click on to the **Publish** page. Here you will find the **Transactional ID**.

        <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=553cf454d657a3049b9566e2851d1b0b" alt="Publish page with details" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1682" height="1682" data-path="images/next.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=60b1e92d098c794c93b8cfb01310586c 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=c8f8c7d1c2918340532861bb8bd52c4c 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=e9569fd50c07b058708c7447fcf4cacf 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=695b04041f9dfe709a25a3ad36345426 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=ea4ba40f8634d64c2905b0cc375c0c43 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/next.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=2083f0ff2fc32596387a81dcf6e07f17 2500w" />

    Add both values to your environment, for example in an `.env` file:

    ```
    AUTH_LOOPS_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
    AUTH_LOOPS_TRANSACTIONAL_ID=<TRANSACTIONAL_ID>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Loops provider">
    The final step is to configure your project to send emails with the built-in Loops provider.

    ```javascript auth.js theme={"dark"}
    import NextAuth from "next-auth"
    import Loops from "next-auth/providers/loops"

    export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
      adapter: ..., // database adapter of your choosing
      providers: [
        Loops({
          apiKey: process.env.AUTH_LOOPS_API_KEY,
          transactionalId: process.env.AUTH_LOOPS_TRANSACTIONAL_ID,
        }),
      ],
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it!

Don't forget, your email details (subject, from address etc) and content can all be managed from Loops.

You also get access to [transactional email logs](/transactional#metrics) giving you an eye on your sending history.


# Auto BCC
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/auto-bcc

Import emails and contacts to your CRM by adding a BCC address to your marketing emails.

<Tip>
  Our Auto BCC feature works with campaigns and loops, but is not offered on transactional emails.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  By adding a BCC email address in your settings, your emails will be BCCd to this address.
  Do not use a personal email address, only one generated by your CRM.
</Warning>

## Overview

Auto BCC is a feature that imports emails and contacts into your CRM platform. This works by adding a BCC email address to all outgoing campaigns and loops emails sent from Loops.

You can add a BCC email address in your [Tracking settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=tracking).

Be aware that BCCing might not be enough by itself. Some platforms may require you to add the sender email address to an allowlist or for the sender to be a user on your account.

## Syncing with Salesforce

You can record all outgoing email and add contacts into Salesforce using a pre-generated Email to Salesforce address.

[Find your BCC email address](https://support.cloudhq.net/where-do-i-find-my-bcc-address-in-salesforce/) and paste it into the **BCC email address** field in Loops.

[Read how Email to Salesforce works](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.email_my_email_2_sfdc.htm\&type=5)

## Syncing with HubSpot

You can log all outgoing emails and add new contacts to HubSpot using your pre-generated BCC address.

[Find your BCC email address](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/connected-email/log-email-in-your-crm-with-the-bcc-or-forwarding-address#use-the-bcc-address) and paste it into the **BCC email address** field in Loops.

<Tip>
  Make sure to read the "Requirements to log emails to the CRM using the BCC address" section on the page above to make sure the sync works correctly.
</Tip>

## Syncing with Attio

Using Attio's [Email forwarding](https://attio.com/help/reference/email-calendar/email-forwarding) feature, you can sync outgoing emails to your Attio account.

[Find your forwarding email address](https://attio.com/help/reference/email-calendar/email-forwarding#finding-your-inbound-email-address) and paste it into the **BCC email address** field in Loops.

<Tip>
  Your Attio log in email has to match the sending email in Loops. For example, if your sending domain is `mail.mydomain.com` and the ["From" address](/sending-first-email#sending-settings) for your email is `bob@mail.mydomain.com`, your Attio account email has to be `bob@mail.mydomain.com` for this integration to work.
</Tip>

## Syncing with other CRMs

Most CRMs have a feature that lets you import email and contacts. Look for a BCC email address and add it to your Loops settings.


# Bubble
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/bubble

Integrate the Loops API into your Bubble app with our plugin.

<Info>
  Our Bubble plugin lets you:

  * Add, find, update and delete contacts
  * Send events to trigger loops
  * Send transactional email
</Info>

<Tip>
  Our Bubble plugin is unfortunately limited to what it can do because of how
  Bubble works. If you want more flexibility—for example, syncing more contact
  data to Loops—check out our [tutorial for using Bubble's API
  Connector](/guides/bubble-api-connector).
</Tip>

## Install the plugin

Go to the [Loops plugin](https://bubble.io/plugin/loops-1704117562175x705056703666192400) and select your app from the "Install in an application..." dropdown.

## Set up the plugin

To use the plugin you will need to add a Loops API key into Bubble.

First, go to your [Loops API settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and copy an API key. You may need to create a key first.

Then go to the the Plugins page in Bubble, select the Loops plugin and paste your API key into the "API key" field, prepended with the word "Bearer" and a space.

## Using the plugin actions

To use the plugin actions in a workflow, select "Plugins" in the menu and you will see the options show up (prefaced with "Loops - ").

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=58ebbff82c1eb4c24039222709a842c8" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1889" height="1889" data-path="images/bubble-action.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=ae0d00d8c76ca940d61d420dbdf6e274 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=8dc29447318fd1f728f4dda5c5b2ba1b 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=f10232d427436b9f5cbee4df65979372 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=10b33ff3aeb5bb7a70687d9c8d73d8bc 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=bee4c75745f8046f5f6080986786ab44 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-action.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=fcc4c79a0c0346c0d6cf3bea7c059438 2500w" />

Here's a simple example of using the Bubble plugin to add all new users to your Loops audience.

After your sign up action, add a new "Loops - Create a contact" action.

In the form, add your user email into the "Email" field and user ID into the "User ID" field.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=5672216926ae06edd874fa375dd7a9d0" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1529" height="1529" data-path="images/bubble-form.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=4a471bbd0b476b9596d931b858832b3e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=09239df293d8386bcec8b26ff15f9c36 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=a84b13e3cc0154cb8abf049953bc70c4 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=57f23466474a19c1e123b8bea69fe3c2 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=41d576916d18570317f59e0c271179a0 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S/images/bubble-form.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Vqx-auiVy74YQr9S&q=85&s=7de2a22fc10b7f2a5fa1ecebfe712651 2500w" />

And that's it!

## Actions

The plugin contains actions that replicate what's possible with the [Loops API](/api-reference).

### Create a contact

The **Create a contact** action will create new contacts in Loops using the email address and user ID that you send from Bubble.

If you want to "create or update" users, use the [Update a contact](#update-a-contact) action instead.

You need to provide both email and user ID values, otherwise the underlying API request from Bubble will fail.

The **Create a contact with name** action lets you also send a first and last name to Loops.

[API documentation](/api-reference/create-contact)

### Find a contact

The **Find contact by email** action will find a Loops contact based on the provided email address. This can be used to see if one of your user already exists in your Loops audience.

Similarly the **Find contact by user ID** action will find a contact by their ID.

[API documentation](/api-reference/find-contact)

### Update a contact

This action will update the email address of a Loops contact who has the provided user ID.

This action can also be used to "update or create" contacts. If a contact doesn't already exist with the provided email or user ID, a contact will be created.

The **Update a contact with name** action lets you also send a first and last name to Loops.

[API documentation](/api-reference/update-contact)

### Delete a contact

The actions **Delete a contact by email** and **Delete a contact bu user ID** will delete a contact from Loops.

This is useful for when a user closes their account in your application and therefore you no longer want to email them from Loops.

[API documentation](/api-reference/delete-contact)

### Send an event

The send event actions can be used to [trigger Loops](/loop-builder) from your application. For example, you may have a welcome loop which sends an email drip campaign to new users.

For the Send an event action, you need to provide an "Event name" value and the user's ID or email address.

### Send transactional email

Transactional emails are one-time emails like password resets sent by apps to users based on an action.

To send transactional emails, you will first need to [create the email in Loops](/transactional#compose-your-email).

Once you have written the email and added data variables, you can click **Next** to see the example payload for the API.

Note the names of the `dataVariables` (which you added in the email) because you need these in Bubble.

Once you create the action in Bubble, you will see the three fields in the form.

Here is an example API payload for the Loops API:

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clomzp89u635xl30px7wrl0ri",
  "email": "name@email.com",
  "dataVariables": {
    "lastLoggedIn": "20240214T10:01:29Z",
    "plan": "Pro"
  }
}
```

To get the same effect in Bubble, we need to enter the following into the "Data variables" field:

`"lastLoggedIn": "20240214T10:01:29Z", "plan": "Pro"`

To add user data into this field, place your cursor and select **Insert dynamic data** (see image above).

1. Add a form to your site and select the **Custom** option.
2. Select **Send to URL** and paste in your form endpoint from the [Forms page in Loops](https://app.loops.so/forms).
   <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c44978586df98ffbb59edc5208d5fc39" alt="form endpoint" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1389" height="1389" data-path="images/form-endpoint.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=fa3193dddf8fc5f6fbb03097e90c28ee 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=97d23f7cf388dd355a93a3cdf4629320 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=48384da872ccdafe15fef4fa521a4748 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=badc4b16efe927447068e6e3610baab6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=81888b8b2c46441883d70dbc0f662b25 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c04bebe574485c7fef2c7ad5e4b573a8 2500w" />
3. Paste the form endpoint you copied from into the **URL** input in Carrd.
4. Change the **Method** to "AJAX" and the **Format** to "JSON".

<Tip>
  Our form submission endpoint has rate limiting, so you will see an error in testing if you
  submit more than once per minute or submit the same email twice.
</Tip>

### Customizing the form

In addition to collecting the email address, you can also collect any other contact property you want.

1. Follow Carrd's documentation to [add a new field to your form](https://carrd.co/docs/forms/setting-up-a-custom-form)
2. Determine your preference:
   * A hidden field that is set to a static value
   * A value that your user can set
3. Assign the field an "ID" matching the Loops API property name that you want to set. You can check the full list of your available properties from your [API Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page.

For example, if you want to set the User Group property, you would add a hidden field and set the ID to `userGroup`.

To add subscribers to specific [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists), add a field with an ID `mailingLists`. The **Value** can be a single mailing list ID or if you want to add subscribers to multiple lists, a comma-separated list of IDs.

<Warning>
  Mailing lists need to be marked **Public** in your [Lists settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=lists) in order for them to work in forms.
</Warning>

This generates a new webhook URL.

Make sure to change the **Send response as** option just below the URL to "JSON" to match the data format sent by Loops.

### Set up the webhook in Loops

Copy the URL and paste it into the **Endpoint URL** field on the [Webhooks](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=webhooks) settings page in Loops.

Activate `contact.created` events. This is the only event that makes sense to sync to Clay because it's only [event type](/webhooks#event-types) that contains a full contact record.

### Create a data mapping in Clay

Now, in order to create data mappings in Clay, you need to send some data from Loops. To do this we need to create a contact, which will trigger a webhook to be sent to Clay.

In your Loops [Audience page](https://app.loops.so/audience) you can create a new contact from the `+` button in the top right, or use the [API](/api-reference/create-contact) or an [integration](/integrations).

Once the contact is created, go back to Clay. You should see a webhook record in your table, and there should now be data shown in the **Setup mapping** section on the right.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=88280293428a0211087b17171fcf09aa" alt="Event received in Clay" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1290" height="1290" data-path="images/clay-event-received.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=d470197851246639172ef35b855ff43d 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=7b402ed413c3a2dd5a712dce0ba28145 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=5eb448052d19b5a20d58a9defc241c40 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=df74a707979f4cd783e94fb3d5bc7f32 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=b8f5a0260322a34b32fd951627bdb3bb 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clay-event-received.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=f8ae1e0925fc4a89d0e8c4eca00f70c6 2500w" />

Now you can map data from Loops to columns in Clay. Click on the cell in the **Webhook** column. On the right you can click on attributes and map them to columns. Expand the **Contact** object to view the full record from Loops.

Click on an attribute you want to sync and then **Add as column**. You have the option to map the data to a new or existing column.

Once you've mapped your desired data to Clay, future webhooks will automatically sync the same Loops data to your Clay table. You can test this by adding another contact to your Loops audience.

If you ever want to check or view the data coming into Clay, clicking on cells in the **Webhook** column will show the full request body for each request.

## Send Clay contacts to Loops

You can sync data to your Loops audience from Clay using a custom enrichment in your tables. This sends contact data to Loops whenever a row is created or updated (or on a manual schedule).

### Create a connection to the Loops API

Add an API connection to your table in Clay by selecting **Add enrichment** and searching for **HTTP API** as the data source.

In the **Account** section of the sidebar, click **+ Add account** or select an existing connection.

If you're adding a new connection, give the connection a name (e.g. "Loops") and then add the two API Request Headers listed below.

You'll need to generate or copy an API key from [Settings -> API](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops and replace `<api_key>` with the key.

| Key           | Value              |
| :------------ | :----------------- |
| Authorization | `Bearer <api_key>` |
| Content-Type  | `application/json` |

Click **Save** to create the connection.

<Tip>
  If you want to edit the connection in the future, you can do so from **Settings -> Connections** in Clay.
</Tip>

### Create an API request

We're going to set up an "update contact" API request, which will *create or update* contacts in Loops.

In the **Configure** section, select "PUT" from **Method** dropdown and enter the following URL into the **Endpoint** field:

```
https://app.loops.so/api/v1/contacts/update
```

In the **Body** field, you can build up the request, using data from your table. Type `/` to add columns, and make sure to wrap values in quotes to create valid JSON data for the API.

<Warning>
  You must include an `email` in the request body.
</Warning>

Data will be sent to Loops automatically when a row is created or updated when the **Auto-update** option is enabled. Toggle this off to only sync data manually.

<Tip>
  To edit the request in the future, click on the **HTTP API** column header and select **Edit column**.

### Test the setup

To test the connection and request you created, click **Save** and then **Save and run (x) rows in this view**.

If the sync succeeds, you'll see the cell populate with "200", which means a successful API request was made.

If there is an error sending data to Loops, you can click on the cell in the **HTTP API** column to see the error message returned by the API, including the reason for the failure.

## Send events from Clay

You can trigger [loops](/loop-builder) from inside Clay by [sending events](/events) with the Loops API.

### Create an event and a loop

An [event](/events) allows you to start a loop when something happens in an external platform (like Clay). Loops can contain emails, timers, and filters.

### Create an API request

To send an event with the API from Clay, we need to make a request containing our event data. If you've added event properties to your emails, we need to include those in the request.

Add a new enrichment to your table in Clay by selecting **Add enrichment** and searching for **HTTP API** as the data source. Then create or select an existing connection to the Loops API. Follow the [steps outlined above](#create-a-connection-to-the-loops-api).

In the **Configure** section of your HTTP API enrichment, select "POST" from **Method** dropdown and enter the following URL into the **Endpoint** field:

```
https://app.loops.so/api/v1/events/send
```

In the **Body** field, you can build up the request, using data from your table. Type `/` to add columns, and make sure to wrap values in quotes to create valid JSON data for the API.

<Warning>
  You must include an `eventName` and an `email`/`userId` in the request body. [Read more](/api-reference/send-event#body)
</Warning>

<Tip>
  You can also update contact information in Loops in the same request by including contact properties alongside `email` in the root of the request body. [More info](/api-reference/send-event#contact-properties)
</Tip>

Events will be sent to Loops automatically when a row is created or updated with the **Auto-update** option enabled. Toggle this off to only sync data manually.

You can use the **Only run if** option to only send events when a certain condition is met.

# Clerk
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/clerk

Sync contacts and send emails triggered by events in Clerk.

<Info>
  Our Clerk integration lets you:

  * Create and update contacts
  * Send events to trigger loops
</Info>

Our Clerk integration is built on top of our [Incoming webhooks](/integrations/incoming-webhooks) feature. This system lets you send webhooks from supported platforms directly to Loops so you can easily sync users and customers as well as send automated emails.

[Please read our guide about incoming webhooks](/integrations/incoming-webhooks)

With Clerk, you can keep your user data synced to Loops so you can send emails to your userbase.

## Supported events

We accept the following events:

* `user.created`
* `user.deleted`
* `user.updated`
* `waitlistEntry.created`
* `waitlistEntry.updated`

[Clerk webhook docs](https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/overview)

If you send other events, they will be ignored.

<Info>
  If you would like to see more events supported, please let us know by sending
  an email to [help@loops.so](mailto:help@loops.so). Please keep in mind only
  events that contain an email address are able to be processed.
</Info>

## Synced data

For `user.created` or `user.updated` events, we sync the following Clerk data to your Loops contacts:

* User ID
* Email address
* First name (optional)
* Last name (optional)

We use the IDs of Clerk users to match contacts in your Loops audience. If the user ID is not found in Loops, we will create a new contact.

The `user.deleted` event can be used to delete or unsubscribe your Clerk users from your Loops audience.

For `waitlistEntry.*` events, we sync:

* Email address

There is no user ID available for waitlist events. When a user graduates from your waitlist to being a user (i.e. you accept them and they complete their account), their user ID will be added to your contact in Loops.

## Create a webhook endpoint in Loops

[Follow the instructions here](/integrations/incoming-webhooks#create-webhook-endpoints-in-loops) to create a new webhook endpoint, which will allow you to send webhook events directly to Loops.

## Create a webhook in Clerk

Next, you need to set up webhooks in Clerk.

Inside a project in Clerk, go to **Configure -> Webhooks** and click **+ Add Endpoint**. Paste in the endpoint URL from Loops, then select the event(s) you want to send (see our [supported events](#supported-events) above).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=72ff9f5552ea8207c8abe68852d739e8" alt="Adding a webhook in Clerk" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="2658" height="2658" data-path="images/clerk-webhook.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=d65104dbf1b074eb8c6273a48c04b7c5 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=35990666e84175604f133e25fe654e24 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=6473574282eb19e5558337e0f4ce9f47 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=0ea75a829087873c35b5ee94084ee430 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=2e90c84722f530de3009df436a87dd3a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-webhook.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=4bc2fb2c94445556b774da56fa56606f 2500w" />

Click **Create** to finish.

The last step is to copy the signing secret into Loops. On the webhook page in Clerk, click the eye icon on the right to show the secret in the page. Copy the secret and paste it into the **Signing Secret** field in Loops.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=3bfcb09969cb7717a3b3190baacba8bc" alt="Reveal Clerk secret" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1076" height="1076" data-path="images/clerk-secret.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=229ec8daf9c2184a3a8a5b6f90198517 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=8f6b1fbb8b6fe37abb6f2f0c40920a4f 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=81c1cb1f573bd7f021fc48873dd505cf 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=e81396c537449f8846f774b62b4831a6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=6010b8de9653689d602d809f3eb2adca 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/K9TRANbphBauR0pJ/images/clerk-secret.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=K9TRANbphBauR0pJ&q=85&s=6bd7a20395dbec282dfd15136186b34a 2500w" />

Now you're all set up.

## Testing Clerk webhooks

Clerk offers a nice way to test webhooks. Click through to the webhook you created and then the **Testing** tab.

Select `user.created` or `user.updated` from the **Send event** dropdown, tweak the example data that's shown, then click **Send Example**.

This will send real data to your Loops account.

You can also test your webhook by creating and editing users in the **Users** page in Clerk, or by signing up in your application.

You can see all sent webhooks by going to **Webhooks**, clicking on the webhook and scrolling down to the **Message Attempts** section.

On Loops' end, you will see new contacts appear in your [Audience](https://app.loops.so/audience) page, and triggered events in the [Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) page.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can send data from Clerk to Loops to sync contacts and trigger useful emails to your customers.

### Syncing users to Loops

Create or update contacts in your Loops audience when a user is created or updated in Clerk.

1. Create a new Clerk webhook endpoint in Loops ([instructions](/integrations/incoming-webhooks#create-webhook-endpoints-in-loops)).
2. In Clerk, create a new webhook ([instructions above](#create-a-webhook-in-clerk)) for the `user.created` and `user.updated` events and paste in your endpoint's URL.
3. In Loops, make sure `user.created` and `user.updated` are toggled on on the Clerk settings page.

### Syncing waitlist signups to Loops

Create or update contacts in your Loops audience when someone joins your waitlist in Clerk.

1. Create a new Clerk webhook endpoint in Loops ([instructions](/integrations/incoming-webhooks#create-webhook-endpoints-in-loops)).
2. In Clerk, create a new webhook ([instructions above](#create-a-webhook-in-clerk)) for the `waitlistEntry.created` event and paste in your endpoint's URL.
3. In Loops, make sure `waitlistEntry.created` is toggled on on the Clerk settings page.
4. To keep track of waitlist users you can use the **Assign a user group** option. Enter something like "Waitlist" into field.

### Send an email to all new Clerk users

Send an email from Loops when a new user is created in Clerk.

1. Create a new loop in Loops using our **Onboarding drip** template.
2. For the loop trigger, select **Event received** and enter `newClerkUser` (or something similar).
3. Set up your Clerk webhook endpoint in Loops ([instructions](/integrations/incoming-webhooks#create-webhook-endpoints-in-loops)).
4. In Clerk, create a new webhook ([instructions above](#create-a-webhook-in-clerk)) for the `user.created` event and paste in your endpoint's URL.
5. In Loops, make sure `user.created` is toggled on, and select the event name you chose in Step 2 from the **Trigger an event** field.

### Enter all new Clerk users into an onboarding email sequence

Send an email from Loops when a new customer is created in Clerk.

1. Complete Steps 1–5 from "Send an email to all new Clerk users" above.
2. Add more emails and timers into the loop to complete your email sequence.

### Send an email to a deleted Clerk user

Send an email from Loops when a user is deleted in Clerk.

1. Create a new loop in Loops.
2. For the loop trigger, select **Event received** and enter `deletedClerkUser` (or something similar).
3. Set up your Clerk webhook endpoint in Loops ([instructions](/integrations/incoming-webhooks#create-webhook-endpoints-in-loops)).
4. In Clerk, create a new webhook ([instructions above](#create-a-webhook-in-clerk)) for the `user.deleted` event and paste in your endpoint's URL.
5. In Loops, make sure `user.deleted` is toggled on, and select the event name you chose in Step 2 from the **Trigger an event** field.
6. You can optionally delete or unsubscribe the user from your audience from the same settings. Note that both options will stop that contact from receiving future emails from Loops.


# Framer
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/framer

Enable signups from your Framer site using an in-built or custom Loops component.

Collect new subscribers from your Framer site. There are a few ways to set this up.

1. [Framer Form component](#framer-form-component)\
   This uses the native Form component in Framer and gives good flexibility for extra form fields.
2. [Framer Loops component](#framer-loops-component)\
   This simplest method. A simple drop-in form with an email address input.
3. [Custom component with code](#advanced-integration)\
   Ths most flexible but complex option, using custom code.

<Tip>
  Our form submission endpoint has rate limiting, so you will see an error in testing if you
  submit more than once per minute or submit the same email twice.
</Tip>

## Framer Form component

Use [Framer Forms](https://www.framer.com/features/forms/) to easily create a form on your site.

### Insert the Form Component

From **Insert -> Forms** drag the **Form builder** component into your page. This will add an example form.

### Edit the form fields

Edit the fields in the form to match the data you want to collect from new subscribers.

An email field is required. Make sure to toggle the **Required** option to **Yes** for your email field.

You need to edit the **Name** value of each field to match the [contact properties' "API name"](/contacts/properties) in Loops.

For example, the **Name** value must be "email" for the email address field.

You can add hidden fields to populate data like `mailingLists`, `userGroup` and `source` in Loops yet ensure they don't show up in the form.

You may have to click the `+` button to show the **Value** and **Hidden** options.

<Tip>
  To add subscribers to specific [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists), add a field with **Name** `mailingLists`. The **Value** can be a single mailing list ID or a comma-separated list of IDs.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Mailing lists need to be marked **Public** in your [Lists settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=lists) in order for them to work in forms.
</Warning>

### Configure the form

The final step is to set the endpoint to your Loops form URL.

1. Go to the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms) in your Loops account.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Copy the **Form Endpoint**.
   <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c44978586df98ffbb59edc5208d5fc39" alt="Form endpoint" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1389" height="1389" data-path="images/form-endpoint.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=fa3193dddf8fc5f6fbb03097e90c28ee 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=97d23f7cf388dd355a93a3cdf4629320 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=48384da872ccdafe15fef4fa521a4748 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=badc4b16efe927447068e6e3610baab6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=81888b8b2c46441883d70dbc0f662b25 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c04bebe574485c7fef2c7ad5e4b573a8 2500w" />
4. Back in Framer, select your form. In the **Send To** option, select "Webhook". Then paste the URL from Loops into the **API** field.
   <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=6cb4ce32e76b6d971829df8fde014bcc" alt="Framer form webhook" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1356" height="1356" data-path="images/framer-form-webhook.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=aebab791f507b1864df88db422af26dd 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=d80723ea22e99f7a0a9cced67b36b839 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=41c8335ec5f8a86ff4feaa390b77ed99 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=b5e6baf22f067ba99539c3cff3d518b1 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=0364b94da8f69ccd5cb7ca359e2db7a5 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/framer-form-webhook.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=8a5a448de5e0b97ade6da946491e9c69 2500w" />

Now your form is all set up and can start receiving new subscribers.

### Set up a confirmation message

By default a "Thank you" message is shown inside the form button when the form is submitted successfully.

You can opt to use a redirect instead. You can add a confirmation message on another web page and use the **Redirect** option in the form settings.

## Framer Loops component

Framer has a built-in Loops option for creating simple signup forms with an email address field.

### Insert the Loops Component

From **Insert -> Forms** drag the **Loops** component into your page. This will add an example form.

5. Framer offers two extra fields in the component:
   * **User Group** populates the contact's `userGroup` value in Loops.
   * **Mailing list** can be used to subscribe contacts to your [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists). Add here one or more mailing list IDs separated by commas.
     <Warning>
       Mailing lists need to be marked **Public** in your [Lists settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=lists) in order for them to work in forms.
     </Warning>

### Set up a confirmation message

Make sure to also set up a confirmation message by clicking on the **Success** dropdown.

You can choose to show a message in an overlay with the "Show Overlay" option or redirect the user to another web page with the "Open Link" option.

To add an overlay message, click on the **Overlays** section header in the right-hand panel, choose between "Relative" and "Fixed" and make sure the **Show On** selection is "Submit".

## Advanced integration

This option adds a custom component into your Framer site [using form code](/forms/custom-form) generated by Loops

### Generate the form code

1. Go to the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms) in your Loops account.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Select “JSX” from the **Generate Form Code** dropdown (1), then copy the code snippet (2).

# Incoming webhooks
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/incoming-webhooks

Send data to Loops from supported platforms using webhooks.

<Info>
  Incoming webhooks allow you to:

  * Create and update contacts
  * Send events to trigger loops
</Info>

This feature lets external platforms send webhook events directly to Loops, making it straightforward to create or update contacts in Loops automatically when changes happen in other platforms.

You can also trigger events when webhooks arrive in Loops so you can send automated email after something happens in your other accounts.

## How it works

First, you create webhook endpoints in your Loops account. These allow other platforms to send data automatically and directly to Loops.

You then create webhooks in the external platforms, which send event data to your Loops endpoint URLs.

Note: we only process webhook events listed below for each provider (and which contain an email address).

We return helpful messages in responses if there is an issue processing a webhook event. Check the webhook logs in your external platforms.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=3429f5d0095e3c10220f48c1773d5c03" alt="Incoming webhook configuration" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1541" height="1541" data-path="images/webhook-event-configuration.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=78bda7d204a6a232bc91f8afe8054267 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=6751d2e8fd127bcf70c633524960e819 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=2aca78ca1261640f30ff6a41323a9e35 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=8da7e40f142f1196eff6ec26babaf38a 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=e86a9d68ff7d05f56fc6398fdd33a04c 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0/images/webhook-event-configuration.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=zNnVRjXA37FUc8Z0&q=85&s=29b055af202615627f7da2ae9c4f0fd3 2500w" />

### Syncing contacts

The primary use case for incoming webhooks is to create and update contacts in your Loops audience. When data arrives in Loops, we grab the email address to create and update contacts in your Loops audience. To this end, we only support incoming events that contain an email address.

You can assign a user group value to each new contact, which allows you to create segments from webhook-created contacts.

Any new contact created via a webhook will have a source like "Stripe webhook" so you know where it originated from.

For events that reference record deletion, like Stripe's `customer.deleted` event, you can choose to unsubscribe or delete contacts in Loops.

### Subscribing to mailing lists

You can subscribe contacts to [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists) when they are created or updated via a webhook.

### Sending emails

Incoming webhooks can also trigger loops if you specify an event in the **Trigger an event** section. This can be useful to automatically send emails when something has happened in the external platform, for example a successful payment in Stripe or a new sign up in Clerk.

## Create webhook endpoints in Loops

To start sending webhook events to Loops, go to your chosen [integration's settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings) in Loops.

A webhook endpoint will be created for you. Copy the endpoint URL and paste it into your external platform.

You may need to copy-paste signing secrets between the platform and Loops for extra security (we will prompt you when this is necessary and give you the steps to do it).

In the endpoint form, you can select the events you want Loops to process, assign a user group, and send a Loops event (which can [trigger email sending in loops](/loop-builder#triggers)).

## Manage contacts

To sync contacts, choose either the "Create contact" or "Create or update contact" action.

You can map data between the two platforms in the automation form. In this example, the "Email" field contains the data from the "Email" column in Google Sheets.

## Send transactional email

To send transactional email from Integrately, select the "Send transactional email" action.

Map the email address you want to send to. Then add the ID of your transactional email from Loops (found on the "Publish" page of the transactional email editor).

Finally, add your email's data variables. You can easily map dynamic variables from the source app or add static text in the form.

# Make
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/make

Utilize our official Make integration to manage contacts and send email.

<Info>
  Our Make integration lets you:

  * Create, find, update and delete contacts
  * Send events to trigger loops
  * Send transactional email
</Info>

## Create a connection

Before you get started, head over to the API page and [create a new API key](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops. You'll need to copy the API key and paste it into Make.

To get started create a new scenario and select the "Loops" module.

## Send transactional email

There is a "Send transactional email" action you can use to send transactional emails. When setting up this action you can select an email from your Loops account, which will then display the required data variables in the form.

Alternatively you can use the "Make an API call" action.

Make sure that the URL is `/v1/transactional` rather than the full endpoint URL.

You can copy an email's example payload from its Publish page in Loops by clicking the **Show payload** button. Paste it into the "Body" field in Make and select the data you want to send to Loops.

## Triggers

The Make integration contains a trigger that lets you to listen for [Loops webhooks](/webhooks), allowing you to do things in Make based on activity in your Loops account.

All of Loops' webhook events are available as triggers in Make.

Add the **Watch Events** trigger to your Make scenario and use an existing or new Loops connection ([see above](#create-a-connection)).

You will be prompted to copy the webhook URL provided by Make and [paste it into your Loops webhook settings](/webhooks#set-up-webhooks).

Make sure to toggle on the **Immediately as data arrives** option in your scenario's bottom toolbar in Make so that the trigger fires every time a webhook event arrives.


# Novu
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/novu

Send Novu email notifications with Loops SMTP.

Set up an SMTP connection to send Novu notification emails with Loops.

## Set up Loops SMTP in Novu

Go to the [Integration Store settings](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/integrations) in Novu and create a new email provider.

Click **Connect Provider** and then **Custom SMTP**.

Give your provider a name like "Loops SMTP" in the **Name** field.

Then add the following details into each field:

| Field    | Value                                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User     | `loops`                                                                                    |
| Password | An API key copied from your [API settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops |
| Host     | `smtp.loops.so`                                                                            |
| Port     | `587`                                                                                      |

You also have to add values to the **From email address** and **Sender name** fields because Novu requires them. You can add any value here because Loops will overwrite these values when sending emails.

Click **Create Integration** to finish setup.

## Create Transactional emails in Loops

Next, create new transactional emails for the emails you are sending from Novu.

In Loops, go to the [Transactional page](https://app.loops.so/transactional) and click **New**. Alternatively, you can select one of our many ready-made templates from the [Templates page](https://app.loops.so/templates).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=9f7d2854940de43c02bf6720b9da6565" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1214" height="1214" data-path="images/novu-template.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=8d99a1f5006d9dba4c7128c7a41e099f 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=f79abe3974dbde7d132bdec6abacb3a1 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=12978dcbc68da1a057cf86d2dee92ab6 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=dcf181971fbc140e6479e1971d8bbddf 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=6bc6feba8c6a5fa5a2fbbf58213d3ba2 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-template.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=64021d2ce9f93935233f1318cdb0bcaf 2500w" />

You can then use [the Loops editor](/creating-emails/editor) to create nicely-designed templates or make them as simple as you like.

You can even create [themes](/creating-emails/styles#themes) to apply consistent design and branding to all of your emails.

For each Loops template you create, you can add [add data variables](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#add-dynamic-content-to-emails), which allow data from Novu to be inserted into each email.

Once you're done creating the email and adding the data variables, click **Next**. On the next page, click the **Show payload** button to view the API payload for your template. You will need this for the next step.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=fb4f3cb4526e1f3fcdde5a4db51b00aa" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1380" height="1380" data-path="images/novu-payload.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=8776b026bb3c8bd9d5a35b7e131d2e12 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=1a6f6574c3792c466415ee520cd23923 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=8c73cabc9ab05bac8d640da0f14dc594 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=ca438f68e9a9fef4be3e79da36e36ebf 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=e9b6823ff06e5840b7f2bdd39ba1e722 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-payload.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=f5450088c6f5590bffebd0e04ee954f9 2500w" />

Make sure to also publish your email! It won't send unless it's published.

## Configure email templates in Novu

The final setup step is to add email templates in Novu.

Loops SMTP integrations work a bit differently than most. Instead of sending a text or HTML email body, you set them up to send API-like data.

In Novu, go to **Workflows** and create a new workflow. Give it a descriptive name and click **Create workflow**.

You will enter the workflow UI. Add an **Email** node. In the email body paste the transactional payload from Loops from the previous step.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=34cf1bd578528dbfcbc945ed6a1fd522" alt="Novu template editor" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1448" height="1448" data-path="images/novu-email-1.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=b0e1e6d91d5f942534d24aa3cdd3c75b 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=af57809e49bdaa05b8625e380b40df98 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=f47f885f8b96b63a261dba3b77f4ec7b 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=0b160f6f9b3a0f53e6dbb053e66345e7 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=6bc4c149dcf0a569f8175becdb9f78e5 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-1.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=5c48c6d83578af13fce4bf52ad3061fd 2500w" />

Add a subject, but note that this will be overwritten by the subject you added to your Loops transactional email.

Next you need to add some Novu data into the template, namely the recipient's email and any data variables you added in Loops.

Here is an example **Confirm signup** email template. This payload was copied from the template's Publish page in Loops, then the `{{ subscriber.email }}` and `{{ payload.loginUrl }}` variables from Novu were added.

You can add any custom data to the `payload` object when triggering emails from Novu. We need to pass those same values to your Loops transactional email via the `dataVariables` data.

```json Email template in Novu theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "cm67vfcgs00pha22s3qevs7nr",
  "email": "{{ subscriber.email }}",
  "dataVariables": {
    "loginUrl": "{{ payload.loginUrl }}"
  }
}
```

If you want to add each Novu subscriber to your Loops audience so you can send marketing email to them, add the `addToAudience` flag to your template as below. This will create a contact in Loops using the `{{ subscriber.email }}` value.

```json Email template in Novu {4} theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "cm67vfcgs00pha22s3qevs7nr",
  "email": "{{ subscriber.email }}",
  "addToAudience": true,
  "dataVariables": {
    "loginUrl": "{{ payload.loginUrl }}"
  }
}
```

If you want to include [Novu subscriber attributes](https://docs.novu.co/concepts/subscribers#subscriber-attributes) to personalise your Loops email, you can add them into your Novu template just like the following example.

Make sure to add fallbacks for all non-required values and add the corresponding data variables (e.g. `firstName` here) into your Loops transactional email.

```json Email template in Novu {6} theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "cm67vfcgs00pha22s3qevs7nr",
  "email": "{{ subscriber.email }}",
  "dataVariables": {
    "loginUrl": "{{ payload.loginUrl }}",
    "firstName": "{{ subscriber.firstName | default: 'subscriber' }}"
  }
}
```

Here's how a template with variables added looks in the Novu editor:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=f0144ef1dce4107a8beb6f3b7fedbc9c" alt="Novu template editor" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1448" height="1448" data-path="images/novu-email-2.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=05ecb233fa73d2b69bfb64058a2918a8 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=c40b9e45a32b19e3ed384795a367d1b1 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=45c7f83d28b6d92ee0ef8896c1308cfe 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=1b51476d3b70506b0a5d48f1ac429ad7 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=5e010bd5a6e8c9089fcb4b3d9186f84e 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/novu-email-2.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=d1ea7943a92bccf86699c1219736f57a 2500w" />

Now you're all set up to start sending!

## Trigger emails with Novu

When it comes to triggering Novu notifications to subscribers, you can use the Novu [SDKs](https://docs.novu.co/sdks/overview) or [API](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/events/trigger-event).

In each call, you need to specify your workflow by its ID, add recipient data and also pass in any data variables for your Loops transactional email into the payload.

Using the same example from above, here's the trigger using Novu's Node SDK.

<Info>
  You can add a `to.email` value to send notifications to a specific email
  address.
</Info>

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
import { Novu } from "@novu/node";

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.trigger("<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: "67867a14722783d44d69fc5a",
  },
  payload: {
    loginUrl: "https://myapp.com/login/",
  },
});
```

Here's the same request using the API:

```json  theme={"dark"}
POST https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger

{
  "name": "<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",
  "to": {
    "subscriberId": "67867a14722783d44d69fc5a"
  },
  "payload": {
    "loginUrl": "https://myapp.com/login/"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  To view all sends of your transactional emails, click through to the email
  from the [Transactional](https://app.loops.so/transactional) page in Loops,
  where you'll find the Metrics page containing a table showing all sends and
  some statistics.
</Tip>

## Testing the integration

Novu offers a testing UI where you can try out your set up before going live.

Go to the **Workflows** page and click on your workflow, then select the **Trigger** tab.

Here you will be able to set different subscriber and payload data and send test email notifications. The SDK examples below also update, so you can easily create code for your application.

You can also see logs of all emails sent from the [Activity Feed](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/env/_/activity-feed) page in Novu.

Send events and contacts data to Loops from PostHog.

PostHog's Loops integration lets you send events from your project to Loops, as well as add users to your Loops audience.

<Info>
  PostHog's [data pipelines](https://posthog.com/cdp) add-on or a self-hosted version of PostHog is required for this integration to work.
</Info>

Here's how to set up a Loops destination in PostHog.

## Create a Loops destinations

In your PostHog dashboard go to **Date pipelines**, click **+ New destination** and search for "Loops".

You will see two options:

* Send events to Loops.so (use this to trigger [loops](/loop-builder))
* Update contacts in Loops.so (this will *create or update* contacts in your Loops audience)

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=2cf888fbc6283536ce181249800e028a" alt="Search for Loops in PostHog" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1098" height="1098" data-path="images/posthog-search.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=b9144fcf5ab7ca7f3f41c11db40030d5 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=80e88fecc5040e099f46071df52cfb74 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=b321eb83feb397b80a8f3836faded6df 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=2f89cb969df7eb0bdb77f1a0fe3280ef 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=78481cb8681aa470aabf5f0a7121e609 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-search.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=4f504e67b436be228355d393d7d29726 2500w" />

Choose the one you want and click **+ Create**.

## Add your API key

You need to add a Loops API to each destination so that PostHog can send data to your Loops account.

In Loops, go to [Settings -> API](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and generate or copy an API key.

Back in PostHog, paste the API key in the **Loops API Key** field.

## Customize the destination

There are a few options available to customize the data that is sent to Loops for both destination types. This helps make sure that you're sending the correct data for your events and contacts.

### Send events

In the **Send event to Loops.so** destination, you can filter which events are sent to Loops from the **Filters** section. The default is "Pageview" (which is sent with the event name "\$pageview" to Loops).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=64c419abae18051750d93f01fb174547" alt="Send events destination" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1875" height="1875" data-path="images/posthog-event-destination.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=f7d1c761bad2227e9710765118ac0124 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=a76e61b926ff9a27bea2fbd520743e2c 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=82cf1613f135dd9a8c8e51d056e8766b 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=081897557b46924fda194881c9fd1234 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=28e25c42afb8c4af36a38c2c3f63e65f 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-event-destination.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=a2f2d2cd2f00676e00265d3032cb92b2 2500w" />

By default `pathname` is sent with the event as an [event property](/events/properties), making it available in all emails triggered by the event.

If you want to add more event properties you can use the **Property mapping** option.

If you check the **Include all properties as attributes** option, all properties from the event will be sent to Loops.

### Update contacts

The **Update contacts in Loops.so** destination lets you sync users to Loops. If a matching contact doesn't already exist in Loops, one will be created.

In this destination you can filter which events are sent to Loops from the **Filters** section. The defaults are "Identify" and "Set person properties".

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=f33527bd8f9619387b111d8a73c66888" alt="Update contacts destination" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1991" height="1991" data-path="images/posthog-contact-destination.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=d9518f1ba86562e480e50c31e2de841e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=355a41813612dcf09c65a0172b069a5c 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=8b1492bcd56c157d9167e9501fe9db22 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=561876ab390d94ee4a8d0a1dc0bd5865 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=9462830e71ecfb8a2b48585ea7f6b800 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp/images/posthog-contact-destination.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=W7EWSDUW0GR-XWrp&q=85&s=b3a297ab13cb4fb579b3fdca0db7a355 2500w" />

By default `email`, `userId`, `firstName` and `lastName` are synced to Loops. To add more contact properties you can use the **Property mapping** option, which allows you to map specific person data to contact properties in Loops. You can see all available contact properties in your account from [Settings -> API](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api). Make sure to use the "API name" when mapping values in PostHog.

If you check the **Include all properties as attributes** option, all properties from the person record in PostHog will be added to contacts in Loops. This may create a lot of custom contac properties in Loops, so we suggest running a mock test (see below) first to see which data would be sent.

### Mailing lists

To add contacts to your Loops [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists), you need to make a quick code change to the destination.

Click **Edit source code** on your destination's page.

For the **updating contacts** destination, edit lines 6–9 and add a new `mailingLists` section. Here, add your mailing list ID(s) and `true` (to subscribe the contact) or `false` (to unsubscribe).

```javascript {4-6} theme={"dark"}
let payload := {
  'email': inputs.email,
  'userId': person.id,
  'mailingLists': {
    '<your_list_id>': true
  }
}
```

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Update contacts" href="/api-reference/update-contact" icon="user-pen">
    Read the API documentation for updating contacts in Loops.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For the send events destination, edit lines 6–11 and add a new `mailingLists` section. Here, add your mailing list ID(s) and `true` (to subscribe the contact) or `false` (to unsubscribe).

```javascript {6-8} theme={"dark"}
let payload := {
  'email': inputs.email,
  'userId': person.id,
  'eventName': event.event,
  'eventProperties': {},
  'mailingLists': {
    '<your_list_id>': true
  }
}
```

You can send real test events to Loops by clicking **Test function**. Check [Settings -> Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) and your [Audience](https://app.loops.so/audience) pages in Loops to see if data is coming across as you expect.

If you'd rather not send actual data to Loops during testing, select the **Mock out HTTP requests** option. This will show the expected request data (including all contact and event properties) rather than send a request to Loops.

Click **Continue** at the bottom of the page to finish the setup.

## Create or update a contact

To send contact data to Loops, use RudderStack's [`identify` call](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/).

Identify users with a unique user ID from your source. You can include contact properties in the traits object, like `firstName` and `lastName` in this example.

<Warning>
  For new contacts, make sure to include an email address, otherwise the call will fail. If the contact has already been sent to Loops with its user ID, you can omit the email address unless you want to update that value. In general, we recommend to always include an email address.
</Warning>

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
rudderanalytics.identify(userId, {
  email: "test@test.com",
  firstName: "Adrian",
  lastName: "Brown"
});
```

To manage [mailing list](/contacts/mailing-lists) subscriptions, add a `mailingLists` object to the traits object. The key is the ID of the mailing list and the value is a boolean indicating whether the contact should be subscribed or unsubscribed.

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
rudderanalytics.identify(userId, {
  email: "test@test.com",

## Send an event

You can trigger emails from RudderStack by triggering [events](/events) via [`track` calls](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/).

You should add and define your events in [Settings -> Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) including any expected [event properties](/events/properties).

The event name in your `track` call must match the name of the event in Loops. Data sent in the properties object will be sent as event properties to Loops, for use in your emails.

<Warning>
  Make sure to call `identify` before `track` so the event is associated with a specific contact.
</Warning>

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
rudderanalytics.track("newUser", {
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook"
});
```

## Testing

### In RudderStack

RudderStack includes features to help you test your integration.

First of all you can see all `identify` and `track` calls coming in from your sources. Click on a source and select the **Events tab**.

Select your data source, give the destination a name, and click **Create destination**.

Next, you’ll need an API key. You can generate a new one for Segment on the [Loops API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api).

Enter the API key on your Segment destination settings:

Enable the destination and click **Save Changes**. Note that no data will start flowing until you create specific mappings for Loops.

## Mappings

Segment action destinations require that you map specific fields from your source to your destination (in this case Loops). You can set this up by clicking into the **Mappings** tab and adding a new mapping. Currently we support updating contacts in Loops and sending events into Loops.

### Create or update contact

First, select which events to map. Typically for contact creation and updates, the most useful event to map will be "Identify".

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=62e7f1763ee87d83d5f3df9fb503b357" alt="Map contact properties" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="947" height="947" data-path="images/segment-select-events.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=8099e92d7a3a6be0eddbb74f5d3a66ae 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=6c12e0022338bd4ce26ae2812bb4f832 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=5b13fb1ac2c06f1108181429bdffe147 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=1a550744bb798c75d8ffdbe674e6be93 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=c483930d856b1063b3c5eb8bcca6f41b 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-select-events.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=e4281d081884efb1dee5599ab0ab8dbe 2500w" />

The next step is to load a sample event to help you map fields appropriately.

Contact properties are found in the `traits` object.

For this example, we’ll be using this test event:

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "messageId": "segment-test-message-gt3ds8",
  "timestamp": "2023-05-24T17:58:30.352Z",
  "type": "identify",
  "email": "adam@loops.so",
  "traits": {
    "firstName": "Adam",
    "favoriteColor": "blue",
    "favoriteNumber": 42
  },
  "userId": "test-user-a5h7xb"
}
```

<Warning>
  When sending a contact's details to Loops, you must include an Email and a User ID.
</Warning>

We've provided some defaults for the mappings, which will show up in the third step, but it is important you review them:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=deee73f5d70f77a3de8596f9120285e8" alt="Default contact mappings" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="2436" height="2436" data-path="images/segment-default-mapping.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=f654fdbf78b0a5907e53b4c530b3f242 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=3dec93e963c5f1f17c0438f533d592a2 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=ab5a2fea99d579c101d14333805eded6 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=91d6d37daa06f513963a5c9cf624f138 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=a64e0c5bd2717f58b2079a4a8e54ecce 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/segment-default-mapping.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=b9db81ba765cb844a3ba1edc8db63261 2500w" />

#### Custom contact properties

Segment does not provide an interface to provide the names and types for [custom contact properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) that you might be using with Loops. In our example, those fields are `favoriteColor` and `favoriteNumber`.

You can pass contact properties as a dictionary in the **Custom Contact Attributes** field.

<Warning>
  Ensure that the keys and values you provide match the schema you’ve created in your [Contact properties settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api).
</Warning>

Click **Edit Object** to specify the custom fields you want to send to Loops individually:

#### Subscribed

In most cases, you want to leave the **Subscribed** field as the default (deselected). Setting this to `true` will re-subscribe contacts who had previously unsubscribed, and setting it to `false` will unsubscribe contacts from receiving email. Leaving it deselected will default new users as subscribed to email and not update the email preference for existing contacts.

#### Mailing lists

To subscribe contacts to [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists) there are two options.

The first method is to manually edit the **Mailing Lists** data. This will allow you to enter list ID values that are the same for every contact.

Click the **Edit Object** option, then the **+ Add Mapping Field** button. In the **Select event variable** field enter "true" or "false" (to subscribe or unsubscribe) and in the **Enter key name** field enter your list ID(s).

You can add multiple lists by clicking on the **+ Add Mapping Field** button again. Make sure the data shown below the fields has the same structure as in the image below.

Another option is to add mailing list data to your Identify call, which will let you dd more dynamic data for each contact. You can test this by adding a `mailingLists` object to `traits` in your test event with list IDs as keys and `true` (to subscribe) or `false` (to unsubscribe) as values.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "messageId": "segment-test-message-gt3ds8",
  "timestamp": "2023-05-24T17:58:30.352Z",
  "type": "identify",
  "email": "adam@loops.so",
  "traits": {
    "firstName": "Adam",
    "favoriteColor": "blue",
    "favoriteNumber": 42,
    "mailingLists": {
      "cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix": true,
      "cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r": true,
    }
  },
  "userId": "test-user-a5h7xb"
}
```

Then you need to map the data. Click the **Select Object** option, then search for `traits.mailingLists` from the Event Variables options.

You can also send a test event to Loops to verify everything is working (this will send actual data to your Loops account). If it works, you will get a successful response:

Check your [Loops audience page](https://app.loops.so/audience) to ensure the contact was created or updated as intended.

<Warning>
  Sending another test event with the same User ID or Email will update the existing contact instead of creating a new contact.
</Warning>

### Send event

You can send events to trigger [loops](/loop-builder).

First, select which event(s) to map. Typically for sending an event, the most useful event to map will be "Track".

We recommend that you filter the events down to only ones that you plan on using within Loops using the **Event Name** filter:

Then after defining or loading a sample event in step 2, configure the mapping.

#### Required fields

The **User ID** field is required. If a contact already exists in your Loops audience, the **Contact Email** field is optional; if the contact does not exist in Loops you need to include an email address so that a contact can be created and an email can be sent (we recommend always including an email address).

#### Event properties

If you want to add [event properties](/events/properties), you can pass them as a dictionary to the **Event Properties** field. These properties can be included in emails triggered by your event.

You can choose to select the `properties` object to send all data from the track call. Or if you click **Edit Object** you can select individual properties. Make sure to enter the correct contact property name from Loops in the **Enter key name** field.

#### Contact properties

You can update contacts at the same time as sending an event with the **Contact Properties** field.

Click **Edit Object** and specify the properties and values you want to update on your contacts.

<Warning>
  Ensure that the keys and values you provide match the schema you’ve created in your [Contact properties settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api), otherwise some data may not be captured by Loops.
</Warning>

You can choose to add a contact's email address in the **Contact Email** field or in the **Contact Properties** object.

#### Testing

After configuring the mapping, you can send a test event at the bottom of the page (this will send actual data to your Loops account). You can preview the data that will be sent.

You can verify the event was received on your [Events page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) in Loops.

## Sending data to Segment

The following examples show how you can send data from your application to Segment for the two Loops actions.

The examples use Segment's [Analytics.js library](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/), but the premise is similar for other libraries.

### Create or update contact

For this action you should send a `identify()` event. Add contact properties (including any [custom properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties)) in the traits object:

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
analytics.identify("97980cfea0067", {
  email: "peter@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
  logins: 5
});
```

If you're mapping a `mailingLists` object from `traits` ([read more above](#mailing-lists)) add it like this:

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
analytics.identify("97980cfea0067", {
  email: "peter@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
  logins: 5,
  mailingLists: {
    "cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix": true,
    "cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r": true,
  }
});
```

### Send event

For this action send a `track()` event. Data sent in the properties object will be sent as [event properties](/events/properties) to Loops. Make sure that you have added these event properties in your [Events Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) in Loops before sending the event to Segment.

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
analytics.track("User Registered", {
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook",
  firstName: "Phil"
});
```

You can update a contact's properties when sending events (for example, `firstName`) by mapping values in your properties within the **Contact Properties** object ([see above](#contact-properties)).


# Stripe
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/stripe

Sync contacts and send emails triggered by events in Stripe.

<Info>
  Our Stripe integration lets you:

  * Create and update contacts
  * Send events to trigger loops
</Info>

Our Stripe integration is built on top of our [Incoming webhooks](/integrations/incoming-webhooks) feature. This system lets you send webhooks from supported platforms directly to Loops so you can easily sync users and customers as well as send automated emails.

[Please read our guide about incoming webhooks](/integrations/incoming-webhooks)

With Stripe, you can sync user data to Loops for customer and invoice-related events.

## Supported events

We accept the following events:

* `checkout.session.completed`
* `customer.created`
* `customer.deleted`
* `customer.updated`
* `invoice.paid`
* `invoice.payment_failed`
* `invoice.upcoming`

[Stripe webhook docs](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)

If you send other events, they will be ignored.

<Info>
  If you would like to see more events supported, please let us know by sending
  an email to [help@loops.so](mailto:help@loops.so). Please keep in mind only
  events that contain an email address are able to be processed.
</Info>

## Synced data

We sync the following Stripe data to your Loops contacts for every incoming event:

* Email address
* First and last name (optional)

We use the email addresses of Stripe customers to match contacts in your Loops audience. If the email address is not found in Loops, we will create a new contact.

The `customer.deleted` event can be used to delete or unsubscribe your Stripe customers from your Loops audience.

## Create a webhook endpoint in Loops

[Follow the instructions here](/integrations/incoming-webhooks#create-webhook-endpoints-in-loops) to create a new webhook endpoint, which will allow you to send webhook events directly to Loops.

## Create a webhook in Stripe

Next, you need to set up webhooks in Stripe.

Go to **Developers** and then **[Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)**.

Click **+ Add endpoint**. Paste in the endpoint URL from Loops, then select the event(s) you want to send (see our [supported events](#supported-events) above).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=13fe0fa4248ca24591b1d656c9bd87ac" alt="Adding a webhook in Stripe" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1635" height="1635" data-path="images/stripe-webhook.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=b9e84cff33a9480bd677928a5a350d4b 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=4e400d8367b9352c1f541906ac3a0cbd 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=85f33d713bb4656340d764ee2163c9c4 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=dbf3e2c20961ed65a5ad50892cc4a278 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=96fc2a897418cd28fb0a1e8bb72a7678 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/stripe-webhook.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=283dfa270ae0dea7d066bd295e2422ff 2500w" />

Click **Add endpoint** to finish.

The last step is to copy the signing secret into Loops. On the webhook page in Stripe, click **Reveal** to show the secret in the page. Copy the secret and paste it into the **Signing Secret** field in Loops.

Now you're all set up.

## Testing Stripe webhooks

You can test a `customer.*` webhook by creating a new customer in the [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page in Stripe.

You can also use the Stripe CLI tool to mimic events, by using the [`trigger` command](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/trigger).

You can see all sent webhooks by going to **Developers -> Webhooks** and then clicking on an endpoint.

On Loops' end, You will see new contacts appear in your [Audience](https://app.loops.so/audience) page, and triggered events in the [Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) page.

Click **Create webhook** to finish.

## Testing Supabase webhooks

You can test a user webhooks by creating, editing and deleting users from the [Authentication -> Users](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/users) page in Supabase, or by signing up in your application.

On Loops' end, you will see new contacts appear in your [Audience](https://app.loops.so/audience) page, and triggered events in the [Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) page.


# Webflow
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/webflow

Enable signups from your site using a native Webflow form.

<Warning>
  This integration requires a paid Webflow plan to allow embedding custom
  scripts into your site.
</Warning>

To allow sign ups to your audience from your Webflow site, you can utilise a native Webflow form plus some drop-in JavaScript.

## Add a custom form script to your Webflow site

<Tip>
  If you do not add the custom script in the correct place, the form may not
  work properly.
</Tip>

To submit data to Loops seamlessly from your Webflow site we provide some JavaScript, which can be added to your site.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Get the script" icon="file" href="https://gist.github.com/askkaz/44ba29cf1898c60e3eb03903e63e2cc4">
    Use this script in your Webflow page.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Where to add the script

* If you have a Loops form on every page of your site, add this code to the "Footer code" section in your Site settings ([read how in the Webflow docs](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags#custom-code-in-site-settings)).
* If you have a Loops form on only one page, add this code to the "Before \</body> tag" section in your Page setting ([read how in the Webflow docs](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags#before-the-\<-body>-tag)).

## Add a form to your page

Next you need to create a form in your Webflow page. Use the "Input" and "Button" elements.

When you add new fields, make sure the “Name” value in the field's settings panel matches the name of the field in Loops: `email`, `firstName`, etc. You can check the full list of your available properties from your [API Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page.

<Tip>
  Please make sure these contact properties already exist in your Loops account.
  You can add new contact properties in [API
  Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api), with a [CSV
  import](/add-users/csv-upload) or [using the API](/api-reference).

### How to add hidden fields

You may want to assign a property to all contacts that submit the form (for example, `source` or `userGroup`).

For this add an "Embed" component *inside your form* on the same level as your input and button elements.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=0947d420946a92c030c643808786b9c4" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1662" height="1662" data-path="images/webflow-hidden-field.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=e3352a43c05d22c3ec71a52f6e19a80b 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=a3ea14cf8bf4af0502bd403587f44f40 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=3a4853964f841ed5d57f1ea30750c1b4 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=c5cce2cf6da4831dc250988f0d94a17a 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=07589be3780944edb79ff3efd7c2db9a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/webflow-hidden-field.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=198ae135497ab6d291f0ddb5d8b5e00b 2500w" />

In this Embed element add a hidden text field that passes on the custom value to Loops (make sure the `name` values match the "API Name" values in your [API Settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api)).

```html  theme={"dark"}
<input type="hidden" name="mailingLists" value="cly2xnjbn002z0mme68uog1wk, cly4xnjbn002x0mme28uog1wk" />

<input type="hidden" name="source" value="Webflow" />

<input type="hidden" name="userGroup" value="Some User Group" />

<!-- This also works with other default contact properties... -->
<input type="hidden" name="firstName" value="Barbara" />

<!-- ... and custom contact properties -->
<input type="hidden" name="signupPageUrl" value="https://yourdomain/this-page-url" />
```

<Warning>
  Mailing lists need to be marked **Public** in your [Lists settings](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=lists) in order for them to work in forms.
</Warning>

Here's how it looks in the Webflow editor:

## Add your Loops form endpoint URL

The last step is to make sure your form submits data to Loops. You do this by adding a Loops form endpoint as the form's "Action" value.

1. Go to the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms) in your Loops account.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Copy the URL shown in the **Form Endpoint** field.
   <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c44978586df98ffbb59edc5208d5fc39" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1389" height="1389" data-path="images/form-endpoint.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=fa3193dddf8fc5f6fbb03097e90c28ee 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=97d23f7cf388dd355a93a3cdf4629320 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=48384da872ccdafe15fef4fa521a4748 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=badc4b16efe927447068e6e3610baab6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=81888b8b2c46441883d70dbc0f662b25 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/OG31ikb--92jQDlq/images/form-endpoint.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=OG31ikb--92jQDlq&q=85&s=c04bebe574485c7fef2c7ad5e4b573a8 2500w" />
4. In Webflow, click on your Form Block, go to the Settings panel and paste the URL into the **Action** field.

<Tip>
  Our form submission endpoint has rate limiting, so you will see an error in
  testing if you submit more than once per minute or submit the same email
  twice.

# Zapier
Source: https://loops.so/docs/integrations/zapier

Connect Loops to thousands of apps to manage contacts and send email.

<Info>
  Our Zapier integration lets you:

  * Create, find and update contacts
  * Send events to trigger loops
  * Send transactional email
  * Trigger Zaps based on activity in your Loops account
</Info>

Zapier lets you connect thousands of other platforms to Loops.

We have created Zapier Actions for managing contacts, sending events and sending transactional emails and Zapier Triggers based on contact updates and email sending.

## Creating a new Zap

To create a new Zap—for example, to connect Tally and Loops—you can either type out what you want to create.

Alternatively, click the **+ Create** button. Select Tally as the **Trigger** (using the "New Submission" event) and Loops as the **Action** (selecting "Add Contact" as the event). This would send new Tally submissions directly into Loops!

If you want to remove or edit your Zapier connections to Loops, go to [Apps -> Loops](https://zapier.com/app/connections/loops).

<Tip>
  You can create connections to multiple Loops accounts from a single Zapier account.
</Tip>

## Triggers

There are a number of Loops triggers available in Zapier:

* Contact created
* Contact unsubscribed
* Contact deleted
* Contact subscribed to mailing list
* Contact unsubscribed from mailing list
* Campaign email sent
* Loops email sent
* Transactional email sent

<Tip>
  The "Email sent" triggers will fire for every individual email sent. If you send a campaign to 1,000 contacts, it will be triggered 1,000 times.
</Tip>

Accompaning data is sent with each trigger. You can see the data available for each trigger by looking up the corresponding [webhook events](/webhooks).

You can use the `contactIdentity` object to identify the contact that triggered each event.

For example, the "Contact subscribed to mailing list" trigger will fire when a contact is subscribed to a mailing list and contains the following data:

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "eventName": "contact.mailingList.subscribed",
  "eventTime": 1734425918,
  "webhookSchemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "contactIdentity": {
    "id": "cm4ittmhq0011ow9h6fb460yw",
    "email": "test+1@loops.so",
    "userId": null
  },
  "mailingList": {
    "id": "cm4ittp2k000l12j3lgrzvlxt",
    "name": "test mailing list",
    "description": null,
    "isPublic": true
  }
}
```

## Actions

### Add a contact

This action adds new contacts to your Loops audience. If the email address already exists, it will return an error.

All default [contact properties](/contacts/properties) are available, plus [mailing lists](/contacts/mailing-lists) and any custom contact properties added to your Loops account.

Only the **Email** field is required. The **Source** field defaults to “Zapier” but you can update this to whatever value you like.

### Update a contact

<Tip>
  The "Update a contact" action will create a contact if a matching contact does not already exist, making it useful if you don't know in advance if a contact exists in Loops.
</Tip>

This action supports the same fields as "Add a contact".

Only the **Email** field is required.

Loops let you send emails based on something happening, like a contact property updating, a new contact being created or an external event happening in another platform.

## Getting Started

To start building your Loop, select a template or start from scratch.

Templates are added often and we're always open to taking suggestions!

## Building a loop

A Loop is an email sequence that can be triggered by different events, and containing emails, delay timers and branches.

You can add new nodes to your loop by hovering over an arrow between nodes and clicking the `+` button.

More complex loops can be built by [adding branches](/loop-builder/branching-loops).

## Mailing lists

You can make a loop send to a specific mailing list by using the dropdown in the top right of the loop builder.

By selecting lists from this dropdown you can make sure that only contacts from those lists are added to the loop.

<Note>
  When using the **Contact added to list** trigger, this option is removed and you can instead select the list from the trigger node.
</Note>

## Nodes

There are five types of nodes available in loops:

* Trigger
* Email
* Timer
* Audience filter
* Branch ([read more](/loop-builder/branching-loops))
* Experiment ([read more](/loop-builder/experiments))

### Triggers

The first node to add to a loop is the trigger. This is what will send new people into the loop.

There are four trigger options:

* **Contact added**: Triggered whenever a contact has been added to your audience.
  <Info>
    Only contacts who have been added via a [form](/forms/simple-form), the [API](/api-reference/intro) or an [integration](/integrations) will be added based on this trigger. Contacts added individually to the audience table will not be included. Contacts added or updated via CSV will only trigger if you select the [Trigger loops](/add-users/csv-upload#trigger-loops-via-csv) toggle during upload.
  </Info>
* **Contact updated:** Triggered whenever a contact property changes from one value to another. Can also conditionally trigger only if the previous property matches the inputted value.
* **Contact added to list:** Triggered whenever a contact is added to a certain [mailing list](/contacts/mailing-lists). You can select the list from the trigger node.
* **Event received**: Triggered when a certain [event](/events) is sent to Loops by the API or an integration. With this trigger you can start a loop based on interactions in your app. Common custom events are `signUp`, `canceled` and `activated`.

You can read more about triggers [here](/loop-builder/loop-triggers).

### Emails

You can add emails at any location inside your loop, giving you flexibility to send mail immediately after the trigger or after a delay. You can also send to specific contacts by adding an audience filter, or by branching your loops.

You can add unlimited emails to each loop.

To edit an email, click on the email node, then **Edit email**.

When a loop is active, you cannot edit the email. Click **Pause** to pause the loop and make changes to your email (and any other nodes). While paused, new contacts will be queued for up to 24 hours; they will enter your loop as soon as you save your email by clicking **Resume**.

You can copy emails from other loops by clicking the **Copy existing email** button after creating a new email node. This will bring up a dropdown of emails from other loops that you can insert into your loop.

A timer adds a fixed time period between two nodes in the loop.

For example, you could add a "3 day" timer after a "Contact added" trigger to send an email three days after a signup.

You can select the “Immediately” option to bypass the timer or any increment of time to extend the duration of the Loop.

You can add multiple timers to your loops, to add delays in different parts of your workflow.

### Audience filters

Audience filters let you create fine-tuned Loops to target specific contacts.

For example, you can check in with contacts that have not signed up as a paying user 3 days after signing up by setting the Custom Event to `signup` the Timer duration to 3 days and the audience filter to `paid` equals `false`.

There are two options for applying audience filters:

* **All following nodes**: this will apply the filter when contacts reach every following node. If a contact no longer matches the filter's audience when they reach a following node, they will be removed from the loop.
* **Next node only**: this will apply your filter before contacts reach the next node. This is a one-time filter and any changes to the contact's value after the filter will not be taken into account.

## Testing loops

You can test if a Loop works as expected by using email addresses with `@example.com` and `@test.com` domains (for example `user1@example.com` and `user2@example.com`).

First, add these as contact in your audience, then depending on how your Loops are set up, you can add and update properties, or send events to these email addresses to see how contacts move through your Loops.

Emails will not be sent to `@example.com` or `@test.com` email addresses so this is a good method to test emailing contacts without affecting your sending domain’s reputation.

You can also send test emails for each of the emails in a loop. Click on an email node and then the **Send a preview** airplane icon above the preview that appears.


# Branching Loops
Source: https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder/branching-loops

Branching loops allow you to send different emails based on a contact's properties within a single Loop.

A common use case for crafting a user journey is to send different emails based on whether a contact has completed an action or not.

For example, you may want to send a different email to free users versus paid users.

You can do this by adding a **Branch** node to your loop.

To create a branching loop, click the `+` icon where you want branching to be added and select the **Branch** node type.

Two audience filter nodes are automatically created for you. Edit the audience filter settings for each to send different contacts down each branch, based on their properties.

You can add as many branches as you like to your loop. Add more branches by clicking the `+ Branch` option that appears on hover just below the Branch node.

Each branch can contain emails, timers, audience filters, more branches, and experiments.

## Audience filters

Every branch is defined by an audience filter, which is always the first node in a branch. Filters determine which contacts follow each branch.

When a contact reaches a branch node, the audience filter nodes are evaluated left-to-right as defined in the loop builder. The contact will proceed to the first matching filter and the remaining filters are skipped. If the contact matches none of the filters, they exit the loop.

You can create the equivalent of a "default path" by making the right-most filter have empty conditions so that it matches any contact.

<Note>
  #### Upgrade notice

  Previously, a branch node would send contacts who matched multiple filters down multiple parallel branches.

  This behavior has been changed; now, in any new branches added to loops, contacts will only follow the first branch they match.

  Branches with the old behavior are marked in your loops. They will retain the old logic until you explicitly press the "Upgrade Branch Node" button shown in the Branch head node's options panel. For more information, see the [branch node upgrade documentation](/loop-builder/branch-node-upgrade).
</Note>

The audience filter nodes created after a branching node can be toggled between two settings:

* **All following nodes:** The audience filter will apply to *all nodes* downstream of the filter. If a contact stops matching the filter later down the branch, they will be removed from the loop.
* **Next node only:** The audience filter will only apply when contacts reach the next node in the branch. If a contact stops matching the filter later in the branch, they will remain in the loop.

## Deleting branches

To delete all branches, select the head Branch node and click the trash icon. This will remove all branches—including all nodes—following it.

If you want to delete a single branch, you can do so by deleting each node in the branch you want removed. When the final node is deleted, the branch will be removed.

# Experiments
Source: https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder/experiments

Learn how to use experiments to test different versions of your emails.

Experiments are a way to run split tests within loops. This lets you test different versions of your emails, allowing you to see which version performs best.

You can test things like subject lines, preheaders, and content, and specify the percentage of contacts who should be sent down each variant branch.

## Creating an experiment

To add an experiment, add a new node by clicking the `+` button in the loop builder and select **Experiment**. You can add an experiment to any loop.

You can add multiple experiments to a loop—even within other experiments if you want. Each experiment can contain any number of variants.

Each variant can contain emails, timers and audience filters.

## Variants and controls

Experiments are made up of variant and control branches.

* **Variant** branches contain the email(s) you are testing, which will be sent to a specific percentage of contacts that you define.
* The **Control** branch contains the email(s) that will be sent to all contacts not included in the experiment, and should be used as the baseline for the experiment. A control is optional; you can create an experiment without a control branch.

<Tip>
  An experiment node must be followed by at least one variant or control branch, otherwise you cannot start the loop.\
  Likewise, you must add at least one email within each control or variant branch before starting the loop.
</Tip>

## Sample size

You can specify the percentage of contacts who will be sent to control and variant branches by dragging the slider in Experiment nodes.

Every variant you add will receive an equal percentage of contacts within the experiment sample. For example, if you set the sample size to 60% and add three variants and a control, 20% of contacts will be sent to each variant branch (60% / 3) and 40% of contacts will be sent to the control branch.

You can change a variant to be the control by clicking on the variant node and toggling the **Use as control** option.

If you do not add a control branch, only your selected sample size will be sent through the experiment node. For example, if you have three variants and no control and select 60% for your sample size, 40% of contacts entering the loop will exit at the experiment node and not receive any emails.

## Editing experiments

Once you have started your loop you can edit the number of contacts passing through each variant and control by first [pausing the loop](/loop-builder/pausing-loops) from the top right of the loop builder.

Once you have paused the loop, you can change the sample size, edit your variants and controls, and update any content.

Click **Resume** to start the loop again.

<Info>
  When paused, email sending is stopped and contacts are queued behind their respective nodes as expected.\
  All contacts that were scheduled to receive an email during the pause will receive it once you resume the Loop.
</Info>

### Closing an experiment

After some time testing, you may want to close experiment branches, to send all future contacts down the your best-performing branch.

To do this while retaining the metrics for all branches, first change your best-performing branch to a control branch (click its **Use as control** toggle; see image above).

Then set the Experiment node sample size to 0%. This will change the Control size to 100%, sending all contacts down the new control branch.

## Results

Once your experiment is running and contacts have flowed through the loop, you can see the results by visiting the **Metrics** tab.

Here you can compare your variants and view metrics for sends, opens and clicks.


# Triggering Loops
Source: https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder/loop-triggers

Learn how to trigger a Loop to start sending emails.

## Loop triggers

A Loop trigger is an event, contact update or contact addition that starts a Loop. For example, if you create a Loop that sends a welcome email to new contacts, the trigger would be when a new contact is added to your audience.

## Different types of Loop triggers

There are currently four types of triggers that you can use to start a Loop: **Contact added**, **Contact updated**, **Contact added to list** and **Event received**.

### Contact added

The **Contact added** trigger will start a Loop when a contact is added to your audience. This trigger is useful for sending welcome emails to new contacts or sending a series of onboarding emails to new customers. This trigger works for contacts added via an integration, a form, or an API call. Contacts uploaded via CSV or added individually to the audience table will not be included. As long as the contact is added to your audience with an automatic method the Loop will start.

This trigger requires no additional setup. Once you create a Loop with this trigger, you can start adding contacts to your audience and contacts will enter the Loop.

### Contact updated

The **Contact updated** trigger will start a Loop when a contact is updated in your audience. This trigger is useful for sending emails to contacts based on their actions or behavior. For example, you can send a series of emails to contacts who change their subscription plan from free to paid or from paid to canceled.

You can also set the trigger to only start the Loop when a specific field is updated from a specific value to another specific value. For example, you can send a series of emails to contacts who change their subscription plan from free to paid but exclude contacts who have updated their subscription plan from paid to canceled.

### Contact added to list

The **Contact added to list** trigger will start a Loop when a contact is added to a [mailing list](/contacts/mailing-lists). It triggers every time a contact is added to a list (so if the contact is removed from a list and then re-added, it will trigger again).

<Warning>
  This trigger is tied directly to a contact's subscription to the selected mailing list. If the contact is removed from the mailing list, they will be removed from any connected loops when they reach the next node.
</Warning>

### Event received

The **Event received** trigger will start a Loop when a contact receives a specific matching event sent via API, Integrations or a form. This trigger is great for events like payment received, order placed, or a new message received. You can fire events with the [Events API](/api-reference/send-event) or an integration.

## Trigger frequency

You can choose to trigger a Loop just the first time a contact matches the trigger settings or every time the contact matches.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=8bb968a8827dec66291d8719da07d2ee" alt="Trigger frequency" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1434" height="1434" data-path="images/trigger-frequency.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=34de79e540158d313fa8ed36c516f6be 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=f307232862d8d23edd0d808688dfc341 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=75a131df9db194110b311ba78c740178 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=aa94f5611dd57651b4e773b801748517 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=59050a80c0dbe4895ce2fd10a973ae65 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l/images/trigger-frequency.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=1DdZd7QTRR4Srm-l&q=85&s=0679b0405b8792533e4af885e9d969ab 2500w" />

For example, if you want to send to a contact every time they update their subscription plan, you can choose to trigger the Loop every time the contact is updated (select "Every time").

However, if you want to send a welcome email to a contact just the first time they are added to your audience, you can choose to trigger the Loop once when the contact is added (select "One time").

## Changing the trigger type

You can change the trigger type at any time. For example, if you create a Loop with the Contact Added trigger, you can change it to the Contact Updated trigger at any time.

## Re-triggering loops

Sometimes you may want to re-trigger a loop for certain contacts, for example if you want to add an older contact to a new email sequence.

The easiest way to do this is to [download contacts in a CSV](/contacts/export-contacts) and re-upload them with the [CSV uploader](/add-users/csv-upload#trigger-loops-via-csv). Make sure to toggle "Trigger Loops" in the last upload step.


# Pausing Loops
Source: https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder/pausing-loops

Learn how to pause and stop a Loop to control the sending of emails.

## Pausing vs Stopping

Both pausing and stopping a Loop will prevent any emails from sending until you resume the Loop, but there are a few key differences.

<Tip>
  We generally recommend stopping emails based on in-app actions completed (e.g., “user upgraded,” “ticket closed,” “trial converted”) rather than on email replies as a reply (such as an out of office email) doesn't necessarily mean the action you emailed about has been taken.
</Tip>

### Pausing a Loop

When you pause a Loop, you can resume the Loop at any time.

During the pause, all contacts that were scheduled to receive an email will receive it once you resume the Loop. However, this assumes that these contacts still meet the necessary criteria to receive the email (e.g., they are subscribed and match any audience filters or other conditions you've set).

New contacts that match the Trigger conditions while the Loop is paused will enter the Loop but only within the first 24 hours. Contacts that qualify for the Trigger after the 24-hour mark will not enter the Loop.

<Tip>
  We will notify you via email once the 24-hour period has elapsed, reminding
  you that contacts will no longer queue to enter the Loop if you resume it.
</Tip>

The 24-hour limitation prevents contacts from entering a Loop that has been paused for an extended period and receiving irrelevant emails. For instance, if your Loop sends a welcome email to new contacts, you wouldn't want a contact to join the Loop three months after signing up and receive a welcome email.

### Stopping a Loop

Stopping a Loop will not queue any new contacts to enter the Loop. Any contacts that were queued to enter the Loop will not enter the Loop. That's the key difference between pausing and stopping a Loop.


# Quickstart
Source: https://loops.so/docs/quickstart

Welcome to Loops, the platform for SaaS email.

This is your guide to getting started with Loops. If you're new to setting up email for your SaaS company, this is the guide you should start with.

## What is Loops?

Loops is an email platform, that helps you send marketing and transactional emails from our app, API and integrations.

With Loops, you can track events and contact properties and then use that information to send emails to increase revenue, engagement or just generally improve your user's experience of your app.

**Let's get started ✨**

What we'll be covering...

1. [Set up your domain records](#1-set-up-your-domain-records)
2. [Import contacts](#2-import-contacts)
3. [Collect signups with a form](#3-collect-signups-with-a-form)
4. [Create your first email](#4-create-your-first-email)
5. [Send transactional email](#5-send-transactional-email)

## 1. Set up your domain records

The first step is to set up your domain, so you can send emails through Loops. You need to do this before you can send any emails.

We send from your domain so your emails appear as if they are coming from you.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=3f6707e1d720d43e2f6b321f795fa220" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1418" height="1418" data-path="images/set-up-domain.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=f0e7d42771f9e752c7348e6e0aa4368f 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=49b5fbc49a52b27388961637be9c019e 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=d44e4171e9bfd66f95c4b66ac52e2920 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=1629ff8c5e124f2a12129dab4dbc1534 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=52d49abe36641c9b608e18bec622ce59 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/set-up-domain.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=eb0a59150c18d9073e43b459eb6b89c0 2500w" />

We choose to send from a `mail.loops.so` subdomain but you can send from your root domain if you'd prefer.

To set up your domain in Loops, you need to add some MX, TXT and CNAME records to your domain's DNS settings so that we can verify that you own the domain you want to send emails from.

Once you've set up your domain records, you'll be able to start sending emails!

You can always send the records to a developer to help you integrate them. Read how to [add a member to your team](/account/team-members).

</CardGroup>

## 2. Import contacts

To send marketing and product emails to your contacts, you will need to import those contacts into Loops.

Note: this isn't required if you only plan to use transactional email, as those contacts can be emailed directly via the API.

If you have any existing contacts, i.e from a waitlist, your early access users, a database or your audience on a different platform, you can get started by importing them via CSV.

You can import contacts via [CSV upload](/add-users/csv-upload), [API](/api-reference) or through one of our [integrations](/integrations).

<Tip>
  The most popular path is to import a CSV of existing contacts, then going
  forward automatically add contacts using our API, a form or an integration.
</Tip>

### Contacts

Contacts are unique users in your Loop's audience. We use email and a unique identifier to distinguish contacts. The only required field a contact must have is an email.

### Contact properties

Contact properties are additional pieces of information you can associate with a contact. They can include things like name, location, job title, and more.

We provide [default properties](/contacts/properties#default-contact-properties) like name, user group and source, but you are free to add any number of [custom properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) to your contacts, too.

You can use contact properties to [segment your audience](/contacts/filters-segments) and send more targeted emails to specific groups.

For example, you could send a promotional email only to contacts with a certain job title or to those in a specific user group.

## 3. Collect signups with a form

Adding a form to your site is one (popular) way to automatically add new contacts to your Audience.

Even if you're adding contacts programmatically via API or integration, in most cases you'll also want to have an input form on your page to collect emails for newsletters or product updates.

To add a form to your site, head over to the [Forms page](https://app.loops.so/forms).

You will see a handful of customization options including the form style, placeholder text, success message, font, font color, button color, and more.

Make as many changes as you need to create a form that matches your brand.

When you have finished customizing your form, simply copy the HTML or JSX that is automatically generated and paste it into your site.

For more flexibility, you can create custom HTML forms that work with Loops. [Read our full guide about custom forms](/forms/custom-form) or check out our [form-based integrations](/integrations#manage-contacts).

## 4. Create your first email

To create your first email, first select the type of content you'll be sending. You can send email as a campaign, loop or transactional email. You can also choose to start with a [Template](https://app.loops.so/templates) instead of starting from scratch.

**Campaigns** are single marketing emails sent to a group (e.g. newsletters, product updates, announcements, investor updates), **Loops** are automated emails sent based on specific triggers or conditions (e.g. onboarding sequences) and **Transactional** emails are one-off emails sent to a single person (e.g. forgot password, two-factor authorization codes, receipts). [Read more](/types-of-emails)

In this example, we will build a product update (a campaign), which could be sent to your users if you're building a SaaS. They should be sent monthly or at a faster cadence depending on shipping speed and contain a high-level overview of what you shipped over the last 30 days.

To get started, click the **Create** button on the Home screen, followed by **Campaign**.

Then we’re going to personalize by adding [dynamic content](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails) and [style it](/creating-emails/editor) to match our brand.

<Tip>
  You can preview your email any time by hitting the paper airplane icon in the
  top right of the editor window.
</Tip>

Once you're finished with the email content, click **Next** in the top right to choose your audience.

Now we'll select the audience segment to whom we'll be sending the update.

Since we're sending a product update, we want to send it to our entire audience so we won't be adding any audience filters.

If you'd like to segment your audience, just click **Add filter**, which will open the filtering options.

The email is now scheduled to go out.

By the way, you can cancel the scheduled send at any time between the send time and now to update it, or you can just send it right away.

## 6. Set up an automated mail sequence

We suggest that new Loops users warm up their new sending domain with a welcome email sequence. A slow ramp up of emails sent to highly-engaged recipients will help prepare your domain for larger campaigns later on ([read more](/deliverability/sending-to-large-audience)).

You can create an onboarding or welcome sequence using what we call "loops".

A loop looks like this:

Go to the [Loops page](https://app.loops.so/loops) and click **New**.

We'll start with the "Introduce yourself" template. This will create a loop with a "Contact added" trigger (meaning every new contact will be added to the loop), with an already-written introduction email ready for you.

Edit the email and when you're ready to make it live, click **Start**.

You can use [branches](/loop-builder/branching-loops) to create more complex workflows, sending contacts down different branches depending on contact properties or even whether they've interacted with campaigns you've sent from Loops.

## 7. Send transactional email

You'll likely need to send a password reset, login or other automatic email that confirms a user action.

These non-promotional emails are considered **Transactional emails** and are the 1:1 emails that are sent to a single contact via API or integration.

They're included in all paid Loops plans, and also included within the 4,000 monthly sends available in the [Free plan](/account/free-plan).

To get started, click the **Create** button on the Home screen, followed by **Transactional**.

Next, it’s time to write and style your email.

We recommend following a similar style across all of your Transactional emails. You can do this by using [themes](/creating-emails/styles#themes).

Let’s create a Password Reset email together.

Add copy and styling, and then to add dynamic content click the **Insert data variables** icon and specify a data variable name.

These data variables will be populated with real content when you send the email using the API.

Click the **Next** button top right to view the data needed in your API call.

Hit **Publish** to finalize the email. Copy the payload details and the ID; you'll need these to send the email using the API.

Make an [API request](/api-reference/send-transactional-email) to the transactional endpoint (or use an [SDK](/sdks)).

```
POST https://app.loops.so/api/v1/transactional
```

You will need the payload copied from before. Make sure to include values for all of the data variables you added to the email.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clfq6dinn000yl70fgwwyp82l",
  "email": "favorite@example.com",
  "dataVariables": {
    "name": "Chris",
    "passwordResetLink": "https://example.com/reset-password"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  To test sending transactional emails you can use an API tool like
  [Postman](https://www.postman.com), [Httpie](https://httpie.io) or
  [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to make API requests.

# JavaScript SDK
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sdks/javascript

The official Loops SDK for JavaScript, with full TypeScript support.

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/loops?style=social\&label=Downloads)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loops)

## Installation

You can install the package [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loops):

```bash  theme={"dark"}
npm install loops
```

Minimum Node version required: 18.0.0.

You will need a Loops API key to use the package.

In your Loops account, go to the [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and click **Generate key**.

Copy this key and save it in your application code (for example as `LOOPS_API_KEY` in an `.env` file).

## Usage

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
import { LoopsClient, APIError } from "loops";

const loops = new LoopsClient(process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY);

try {
  const resp = await loops.createContact("email@provider.com");
  // resp.success and resp.id available when successful
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof APIError) {
    // JSON returned by the API is in error.json and the HTTP code is in error.statusCode
    // Error messages explaining the issue can be found in error.json.message
    console.log(error.json);
    console.log(error.statusCode);
  } else {
    // Non-API errors
  }
}
```

## Handling rate limits

If you import `RateLimitExceededError` you can check for rate limit issues with your requests.

You can access details about the rate limits from the `limit` and `remaining` attributes.

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
import { LoopsClient, APIError, RateLimitExceededError } from "loops";

const loops = new LoopsClient(process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY);

try {
  const resp = await loops.createContact("email@provider.com");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof RateLimitExceededError) {
    console.log(`Rate limit exceeded (${error.limit} per second)`);
    // Code here to re-try this request
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
  }
}
```

## Default contact properties

Each contact in Loops has a set of default properties. These will always be returned in API results.

* `id`
* `email`
* `firstName`
* `lastName`
* `source`
* `subscribed`
* `userGroup`
* `userId`
* `optInStatus`

## Custom contact properties

You can use custom contact properties in API calls. Please make sure to [add custom properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) in your Loops account before using them with the SDK.

## Methods

* [testApiKey()](#testapikey)
* [createContact()](#createcontact)
* [updateContact()](#updatecontact)
* [findContact()](#findcontact)
* [deleteContact()](#deletecontact)
* [createContactProperty()](#createcontactproperty)
* [getContactProperties()](#getcontactproperties)
* [getMailingLists()](#getmailinglists)
* [sendEvent()](#sendevent)
* [sendTransactionalEmail()](#sendtransactionalemail)
* [getTransactionalEmails()](#gettransactionalemails)

# Set up Loops in Next.js
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sdks/javascript/nextjs

How to send email from your Next.js project with Loops.

This guide shows how to add Loops to your Next.js project, so you can send transactional emails, manage contacts and trigger automated emails.

## Install the SDK

The first step is to install the Loops SDK. This is written in TypeScript so you can benefit from strict types when coding.

```bash  theme={"dark"}
npm i loops
```

You'll need an API key to use the SDK. Go to your [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops to generate and copy a key.

Save this value in your environment variables as something like `LOOPS_API_KEY`.

Then you can import the Loops SDK client like this:

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
import { LoopsClient } from "loops";

const loops = new LoopsClient(process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY);
```

<Tip>
  You can also use the [Loops API](/api-reference) directly in your app, without
  the SDK. [Read more](#using-the-api-instead)

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Server-side only

It is important that you only use the Loops API and SDK from server-side code. If you make calls directly in the browser, you risk exposing your API key, which would give other people read and write access to your Loops account data. Additionally, the Loops API does not support cross-origin requests made from client-side JavaScript.

If you want to make calls from the browser—for example, to collect newsletter subscriptions from a form—create proxy endpoints. To add a new contact, create an internal API endpoint and use the Loops API/SDK within it.

```typescript app/api/contacts/route.ts theme={"dark"}
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { LoopsClient } from "loops";

const loops = new LoopsClient(process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY as string);

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const res = await request.json();

  const email = res["email"];

  // Note: updateContact() will create or update a contact

  const resp: {
    success: boolean;
    id?: string;
    message?: string;
  } = await loops.updateContact(email);

  return NextResponse.json({ success: resp.success });
}
```

## Send transactional email

A big use case for using Loops in a Next.js project is to send transactional email to users. These emails are one-off emails, which help users with your product, for example password reset emails notification emails.

To create a transactional email, go to the Transactional page in Loops. Click **Create** or select a template.

Create the email in [the editor](/creating-emails/editor), which gives you rich formatting options and components.

To add dynamic content (like rest password URLs or user data) you can add [data variables](/transactional#add-data-variables) into the email from the toolbar.

Give each data variable a unique name. You can populate these variables from your code when sending the email via the SDK in the next step.

Make sure to Publish your transactional email when you're done.

Now your email is created you can start sending emails.

In your code, call `sendTransactionalEmail()` and include values for each of the data variables you added to your email.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript theme={"dark"}
  const dataVariables = {
    loginUrl: "https://myapp.com/login/",
  };

  const resp = await loops.sendTransactionalEmail({
  transactionalId: "transaction_email_id",
  email: "user@gmail.com",
  dataVariables
  });

  if (!resp.success) {
  // The sending failed
  } else {
  // The email was sent successfully
  }

  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={"dark"}
  const dataVariables: { loginUrl: string } = {
    loginUrl: "https://myapp.com/login/",
  };

  const resp: {
    success: boolean,
    path?: string,
    message?: string
  } | {
    success: false;
    error: {
      path: string;
      message: string;
    };
    transactionalId?: string;
  } = await loops.sendTransactionalEmail({
    transactionalId: "transaction_email_id",
    email: "user@gmail.com",
    dataVariables
  });

  if (!resp.success) {
    // The sending failed
  } else {
    // The email was sent successfully
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The response will contain a `success` boolean telling you if the email was sent successfully. If it was not, you'll also receive an error message.

## Sync users to Loops

Another main use case for teams using Loops is to keep their Loops audience updated when user data changes in their application.

To do this you can use the `updateContact()` method.

<Tip>
  `updateContact()` can be used as a shortcut "update or create" function. It
  will create new contacts if the provided email address and/or user ID are not
  found.
</Tip>

For example, you may store custom data in Loops like subscription plan level or user usage information that you include in emails. You can update contacts in Loops like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript theme={"dark"}
  const contactProperties = {
    userId: 826,
    planName: "Pro" /* Custom property */,
    usage: 172629 /* Custom property */,
  };

  const resp = await loops.updateContact("user@gmail.com", contactProperties);

  if (!resp.success) {
  // The call failed
  } else {
  // The contact was updated OK
  }

  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={"dark"}
  const contactProperties: Record<string, string | number> = {
    userId: 826,
    planName: "Pro" /* Custom property */,
    usage: 172629 /* Custom property */,
  };

  const resp: {
    success: boolean,
    id?: string,
    message?: string
  } = await loops.updateContact("user@gmail.com", contactProperties);

  if (!resp.success) {
    // The call failed
  } else {
    // The contact was updated OK
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The TypeScript example above shows how to properly type your `contactProperties` object and the expected response from the `updateContact` method.

<Tip>
  We recommend always populating the `userId` value for users, which should be
  their unique value in your platform. This allows you to change a contact's
  email address in the future, because they have a separate unique identifier in
  the system.
</Tip>

  <Card title="updateContact()" href="/sdks/javascript#updatecontact" icon="user">
    Read more in the SDK docs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Trigger loops with events

A third example of using the Loops SDK is to trigger [loops](/loop-builder). Loops are automated email workflows, which can send multiple emails to contacts.

You can trigger these emails using [events](/events), and you can send events to Loops using the SDK.

For example, you may have a loop that you send to new users after they have completed an onboarding flow in your app.

First, [create a new loop](https://app.loops.so/loops) using the "Event received" trigger. Add emails, timers and audience filters to your loop as you wish.

Then to trigger this email sequence, send an event to Loops. If your event name is `completedOnboarding`, your call would look like this...

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript theme={"dark"}
  const resp = await loops.sendEvent({
    email: "user@gmail.com",
    eventName: "completedOnboarding",
  });

  if (!resp.success) {
  // The event was not sent
  } else {
  // The event was sent OK
  }

  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={"dark"}
  const resp: {
    success: boolean,
    message?: string,
  } = await loops.sendEvent({
    email: "user@gmail.com",
    eventName: "completedOnboarding",
  });

  if (!resp.success) {
    // The event was not sent
  } else {
    // The event was sent OK
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CardGroup className="mt-8">
  <Card title="sendEvent()" href="/sdks/javascript#sendevent" icon="bolt">
    Read more in the SDK docs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using the API instead

If you prefer, you can use the [Loops API](/api-reference) directly instead of using the SDK.

<Warning>
  You should never call the API from your front-end code as this will expose
  your API key.
</Warning>

For example, you can send a transactional email like this:

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
const data = {
  email: "user@gmail.com",
  transactionalId: "abcdefg",
  dataVariables: {
    loginUrl: "https://myapp.com/login/?code=1234",
  },
};
return fetch("https://app.loops.so/api/v1/transactional", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.success) {
      // The sending failed
    } else {
      // The email was sent successfully
    }
  })
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

<Tip>
  On Vercel, each backend function gets its own lambda. Make sure you use
  `return` otherwise the lambda might be terminated before the promise is
  evaluated.

# Nuxt module
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sdks/nuxt

The official Loops Nuxt module.

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/nuxt-loops?style=social\&label=Downloads)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-loops)

This Nuxt module makes it easy to add the Loops [JavaScript SDK](/sdks/javascript) to your Nuxt project.

## Installation

You can install the package [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-loops):

```bash  theme={"dark"}
npm install nuxt-loops
```

You will need a Loops API key to use the module.

In your Loops account, go to the [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and click **Generate key**.

Copy this key and save it in your application code (for example as `LOOPS_API_KEY` in an `.env` file).

Then add `nuxt-loops` to your modules list and add a reference to your API key:

```js nuxt.config.ts theme={"dark"}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-loops'],
  loops: {
    apiKey: process.env.LOOPS_API_KEY
  }
});
```

## Usage

<Warning>
  The Loops API and SDK should only be used on the server side to protect your API key.
</Warning>

To use the module, import `loops` from the request context.

Then call one of the SDK methods. Read through the [JS SDK docs](/sdks/javascript#methods) for more details.

```javascript  theme={"dark"}
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { loops } = event.context;

  const response = await loops.updateContact("hello@gmail.com", {
    firstName: "Bri",
    lastName: "Chambers",
  })
});
```

## Version history

* `v1.0.0` (Sep 6, 2024) - Initial release.


# PHP SDK
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sdks/php

The official Loops PHP package.

[![Packagist Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/loops-so/loops?style=social)](https://packagist.org/packages/loops-so/loops)

## Introduction

This is the official PHP package for [Loops](https://loops.so), an email platform for modern software companies.

## Installation

Install the Loops package [using Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/loops-so/loops):

```bash  theme={"dark"}
composer require loops-so/loops
```

## Usage

You will need a Loops API key to use the package.

In your Loops account, go to the [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and click **Generate key**.

Copy this key and save it in your application code (for example, in an environment variable).

See the API documentation to learn more about [rate limiting](/api-reference#rate-limiting) and [error handling](/api-reference#debugging).

To use the package, first initialise the client with your API key, then you can call one of the methods.

API rate limits can be handled with the included `RateLimitExceededError` exception.

```php  theme={"dark"}
use Loops\LoopsClient;

$loops = new LoopsClient(env('LOOPS_API_KEY'));

// Test API key
$result = $loops->apiKey->test();

// Create a contact and catch errors
try {
    $result = $loops->contacts->create('user@example.com', [
      'firstName' => 'John'
    ]);
} catch (Loops\Exceptions\APIError $e) {
    // Handle API errors (400, 401, 403, etc)
    echo $e->getMessage();
    $returnedJson = $e->getJson(); // JSON returned by the API
    $statusCode = $e->getStatusCode(); // HTTP status code from the response
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle any other unexpected errors
    echo "Unexpected error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Handling rate limits

You can use the check for rate limit issues with your requests.

You can access details about the rate limits from the `getLimit` and `getRemaining` functions.

```php  theme={"dark"}
try {
    $result = $loops->contacts->create('user@example.com', [
      'firstName' => 'John'
    ]);
} catch (Loops\Exceptions\RateLimitExceededError $e) {
    // Handle rate limiting
    echo "Rate limit hit. Limit: " . $e->getLimit() . ", requests remaining: " . $e->getRemaining();
} catch (Loops\Exceptions\APIError $e) {
    // Handle API errors (400, 401, 403, etc)
    echo $e->getMessage();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle any other unexpected errors
    echo "Unexpected error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Default contact properties

Each contact in Loops has a set of default properties. These will always be returned in API results.

* `id`
* `email`
* `firstName`
* `lastName`
* `source`
* `subscribed`
* `userGroup`
* `userId`
* `optInStatus`

## Custom contact properties

You can use custom contact properties in API calls. Please make sure to [add custom properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) in your Loops account before using them with the SDK.

## Methods

* [apiKey->test()](#apikey->test)
* [contacts->create()](#contacts->create)
* [contacts->update()](#contacts->update)
* [contacts->find()](#contacts->find)
* [contacts->delete()](#contacts->delete)

#### Examples

```php  theme={"dark"}
$result = $loops->events->send(
  event_name: 'signup',
  email: 'hello@gmail.com'
);

$result = $loops->events->send(
  event_name: 'signup',
  email: 'hello@gmail.com',
  event_properties: [
    'username' => 'user1234',
    'signupDate' => '2024-03-21T10:09:23Z'
  ],
  mailing_lists: [
    'cm06f5v0e45nf0ml5754o9cix' => true,
    'cm16k73gq014h0mmj5b6jdi9r' => false
  ]
;

# In this case with both email and userId present, the system will look for a contact with either a
#  matching `email` or `user_id` value.
# If a contact is found for one of the values (e.g. `email`), the other value (e.g. `user_id`) will be updated.
# If a contact is not found, a new contact will be created using both `email` and `user_id` values.
# Any values added in `contact_properties` will also be updated on the contact.
$result = $loops->events->send(
  event_name: 'signup',
  email: 'hello@gmail.com',
  user_id: '1234567890',
  contact_properties: [
    'firstName' => 'Bob',
    'plan' => 'pro',
  }]
});

# Example with Idempotency-Key header
$result = $loops->events->send(
  event_name: 'signup',
  email: 'hello@gmail.com',
  headers: [
    'Idempotency-Key' => '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
  ]
);
```

#### Response

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "success": true
}
```

Error handling is done through the `APIError` class, which provides `getStatusCode()` and `getJson()` methods for retrieving the API's error response details. For implementation examples, see the [Usage section](#usage).

```json  theme={"dark"}
// HTTP 400 Bad Request
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "An error message here."
}
```

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at [github.com/Loops-so/loops-rb](https://github.com/Loops-so/loops-php). Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Loops-so/loops-php/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


# Ruby SDK
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sdks/ruby

The official Loops SDK for Ruby.

[![Gem Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/gem/dt/loops_sdk?style=social)](https://rubygems.org/gems/loops_sdk)

## Installation

Install the gem and add it to the application's Gemfile like this:

```bash  theme={"dark"}
bundle add loops_sdk
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, you can install the gem like this:

```bash  theme={"dark"}
gem install loops_sdk
```

## Usage

You will need a Loops API key to use the package.

In your Loops account, go to the [API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and click **Generate key**.

Copy this key and save it in your application code (for example, in an environment variable).

See the API documentation to learn more about [rate limiting](/api-reference#rate-limiting) and [error handling](/api-reference#debugging).

In an initializer, import and configure the SDK:

```ruby config/initializers/loops.rb theme={"dark"}
require "loops_sdk"

LoopsSdk.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = 'your_api_key'
end
```

Then you can call methods in your code:

```ruby  theme={"dark"}
begin
  response = LoopsSdk::Transactional.send(
    transactional_id: "closfz8ui02yq......",
    email: "dan@loops.so",
    data_variables: {
      loginUrl: "https://app.domain.com/login?code=1234567890"
    }
  )
  render json: response

rescue LoopsSdk::APIError => e
  # JSON returned by the API is in error.json and the HTTP code is in error.statusCode
  # Error messages explaining the issue can be found in error.json['message']
  Rails.logger.error("Loops API Error: #{e.json['message']} (Status: #{e.statusCode})")
end
```

## Handling rate limits

You can use the check for rate limit issues with your requests.

You can access details about the rate limits from the `limit` and `remaining` attributes.

```ruby  theme={"dark"}
begin

  response = LoopsSdk::Contacts.update(
    email: "dan@loops.so"
  )

  render json: response

rescue LoopsSdk::RateLimitError => e
  Rails.logger.error("Rate limit exceeded (#{e.limit} requests per second)")
  # Code here to re-try this request
rescue LoopsSdk::APIError => e
  # Handle other errors
end
```

## Default contact properties

Each contact in Loops has a set of default properties. These will always be returned in API results.

* `id`
* `email`
* `firstName`
* `lastName`
* `source`
* `subscribed`
* `userGroup`
* `userId`
* `optInStatus`

## Custom contact properties

You can use custom contact properties in API calls. Please make sure to [add custom properties](/contacts/properties#custom-contact-properties) in your Loops account before using them with the SDK.

## Methods

* [ApiKey.test()](#apikey-test)
* [Contacts.create()](#contacts-create)
* [Contacts.update()](#contacts-update)
* [Contacts.find()](#contacts-find)
* [Contacts.delete()](#contacts-delete)
* [ContactProperties.create()](#contactproperties-create)
* [ContactProperties.list()](#contactproperties-list)
* [MailingLists.list()](#mailinglists-list)
* [Events.send()](#events-send)

# Setting up your domain
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sending-domain

Steps for adding a sending domain to your account.

When you set up your account for the first time, you need to set up your domain records in order to start sending email. We'll be sending email on your behalf, so we need to verify that you own the domain you're sending from.

Here's how to set it up in just a few steps.

## Step 1: Add your sending domain

During the sign up flow, you are asked to specify your desired sending domain. You can enter any domain here that you can set up DNS records for, and if you choose a subdomain, it doesn't need to exist yet.

We [recommend using a subdomain for this](/deliverability/sending-from-subdomain), e.g. `mail.yourcompany.com`, rather than sending from your root domain `yourcompany.com`.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=488ba76f344c60b0c9b5dd6bd7c21ff3" alt="Adding a domain during sign up" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1967" height="1967" data-path="images/signup-domain.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=ec2a74c5ff0f86afeda25d375ab5c26d 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=51fd95cde921614cbe67fed194f36560 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=371346266dff06d4663f932c7467036b 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=ca82607d060c86ca0f15a121c8fa64bb 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=f17618833a8261e2d1dd8dc0d65dc221 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/signup-domain.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=4e49608a5096314ece1bbf4de301b588 2500w" />

If you have already signed up and want to edit your sending domain, you can do so from **Settings -> Domain**.

<Note>
  You do not need to create this subdomain with an A or CNAME record. Loops will
  provide all DNS records you need to set up.
</Note>

## Step 2: Set up your records

From the **Settings -> Domain** page, click **View records** (or [click this link](https://app.loops.so/sending-domain) to go directly).

On this page, you'll see a few things.

**Your records**

These are SPF, DKIM and MX records that need to be set up in your domain zone editor inside of your domain registrar like Namecheap, Google Domains, AWS, Godaddy or elsewhere.

Next to each record is a clipboard icon. You can use this to copy the records to your clipboard and easily paste them into your domain registrar.

**Your sending domain**

This is indicated below by “yourcompany.com”. This will have your domain listed. If you'd like to change domains, you can do so in the [account settings](https://app.loops.so/settings).

**A verify records button**

Once you have copied your records to your registrar, click this button to verify they have been set up correctly.

## Step 3: Add your domain records

Copy and paste the records one by one into your registrar.

You want to use the **Type** (indicated as TXT, CNAME and MX) in setting up your records, ***not*** the title of the record e.g. SPF, DKIM, MX.

<Tip>
  Loops' records for SPF are at envelope.sendingdomain.com, meaning they won't
  collide with any other SPF records you have set up. We specify a DMARC record
  so that you have one, but you can also just have a single DMARC at the root
  domain level.
</Tip>

    If you purchased a domain outside of Wix, you should use the ["Pointing" method](https://support.wix.com/en/article/connecting-a-domain-to-wix-using-the-pointing-method) for your domain, which will let you set up DNS records externally a domain registrar.

  Make sure you enter the “Priority” while setting up your MX record. In most

</Tip>

## Step 4: Verify your records are set up correctly

After you have copied and pasted your records into your domain registrar, click **Verify Records** at the bottom of the page to check your configuration is correct.

<Tip>
  Sometimes records can take up to an hour to propagate across all the servers.
  During that time you may see different records validate. This is totally
  normal, just check back later.
</Tip>

If the domain is set up correctly, you should see a page like the one below. If not, check back soon; sometimes records can take some time to propagate.

Notice the "Records present" in green next to each record section.

## Domain already in use

If you're getting a "domain already in use" error when trying to set up your domain, this typically means someone on your team has already registered an account with Loops using your domain.

Here are the steps you can take to resolve this:

  <Accordion title="Signing in with another account">
    Go to the [Loops login page](https://app.loops.so/) and request a login link using your email address.

# Sending your first email
Source: https://loops.so/docs/sending-first-email

A guide for creating and sending emails with Loops.

So you're ready to send your first email from Loops!

Let's go through some best practices and then see how creating an email works.

## Best practices

Here are some important things to know and bear in mind when sending email with Loops.

* We have a “low-html” editor, which means your emails send with a minimal amount of styles applied. We do this so your emails are highly readable and so they're more likely to not be placed in the spam folder or deprioritized in the inbox by your email provider.
* Try not to use sensational copy like “sale”, “discount” or exclamation points in your emails.
* It's also important to keep your emails short and to the point. Use an efficient subject line that encourages the reader to open the email and get to the point quickly in the body of the message.
* Use personalization when possible to make the message more engaging and relevant to the reader by [personalizing your emails](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails).

## Send your first email

First, choose which type of email you want to send: a campaign, a loop or a transactional email.

[Find out about the types of email](/types-of-emails) you can send from Loops.

To send your first email, simply choose a template or start an email from scratch.

## Sending settings

Along with the email subject, you can determine some of the sending settings, like the "From" sending address.

By clicking `>` you will reveal a [settings panel](/creating-emails/sending-settings), where you can specify the From email address (which is always tied to your sending domain), Reply to email and the Preview text (typically shown in email clients just beneath the Subject). For loops and transactional emails you can also specify a [CC and BCC address](/creating-emails/sending-settings#cc-and-bcc).

You can also test sending emails by using email addresses with `@example.com` and `@test.com` domains. This will not actually send emails but is a great way to test loops, schedule campaigns, or test transactional emails without affecting your sending domain's reputation.

## Set up your email sending for the first time

Now you're ready to send the email!

You are able to select which contacts to send to, then either send it now or schedule it for later.

Wondering what the next step is to get started implementing emails for your SaaS? Check out the [getting started guide](/quickstart).

# Send with SMTP
Source: https://loops.so/docs/smtp

Send Loops emails over SMTP.

You can send transactional emails over SMTP, meaning you can use Loops to power emails in platforms like Supabase and development tools and frameworks like Laravel, Rails, Django and Nodemailer.

## How it works

The Loops way of sending emails over SMTP is a bit different from other services.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create emails in Loops">
    First, you create transactional email templates in [the Loops editor](/creating-emails/editor) for the emails you want to send.

    Our rich editor helps you create beautiful, client-compatible *and* easy-to-update emails rather than hand-coding them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send emails from your application">
    Use these SMTP settings in your application:

    | Field       | Value                                                                                      |
    | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Host        | `smtp.loops.so`                                                                            |
    | Port number | `587`                                                                                      |
    | Username    | `loops`                                                                                    |
    | Password    | An API key copied from your [API settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops |

    Then, when it comes to sending emails, instead of the content of an email, you send an API-like request body like this:

    ```json  theme={"dark"}
    {
      "transactionalId": "clomzp89u035xl50px7wrl0ri",
      "email": "dan@loops.so",
      "dataVariables": {
        "confirmationUrl": "https://myapp.com/confirm/12345/"
      }
    }
    ```

    This content **needs to be converted to a string** and then sent as the email body.

    Loops takes the provided data and compiles an email using the template you specify in the `transactionalId` value plus the provided `dataVariables`, then sends the email to `email`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Every email sent using Loops' SMTP service requires a transactional email to be set up in your Loops account. Note the `transactionalId` value in the email payload.
</Warning>

# Django
Source: https://loops.so/docs/smtp/django

Send transactional emails from your Django project using Loops' SMTP service.

<Tip>
  As Loops' SMTP service requires sending an API-like email body rather than a full email, it's not recommended to use Loops as the default SMTP service for your app in your settings file.\
  Instead, use a custom `connection` for each email request that you want to send through Loops.
</Tip>

Sending email from Django with Loops' SMTP service is easy but there's one gotcha: the email body needs to be an [API-like payload](/smtp#how-it-works).

This may seem strange at first but it allows you to use Loops' WYSIWYG editor to craft your emails and keep email templating outside of your code repo.

We are using a custom `connection` for sending this email as typically only some emails in a project will be sent through Loops.

Add these settings to your project (e.g. in an `.env` file).

| Field       | Value                                                                                      |

| Port number | `587`                                                                                      |
| Username    | `loops`                                                                                    |
| Password    | An API key copied from your [API settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops |

<Warning>
  Every email sent from Django over Loops SMTP requires a transactional email to be set up in your Loops account. Note the `transactionalId` value in the email payload.

# Laravel

Send transactional emails from your Laravel project using Loops' SMTP service.

Transactional emails with Loops simplifies your code. With our WYSIWYG editor and API-like payloads, you can design and manage email templates outside of your codebase, ensuring cleaner code and easier template maintenance.

<Note>
  Unlike older SMTP services, Loops requires the body of emails sent via SMTP to
  be formatted as an [API-like payload](/smtp#how-it-works). This approach
  allows you to use Loops' [powerful email editor](/creating-emails/editor) to
  craft your emails and keep email templating outside of your application code.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Every email sent over Loops SMTP requires a transactional email to be set up
  in your Loops account. Note the `transactionalId` value in the email payload.
</Warning>

Here's how you can set up transactional emails with Loops SMTP in Laravel:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create emails in Loops">
    Create transactional emails in Loops using the [editor](/creating-emails/editor).

    Add [data variables](/transactional#add-data-variables) to your emails for any dynamic content you want to send from your Laravel application.

        <img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=d124653cd87536765f40e4de3102c15a" alt="Add a data variable" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1079" height="1079" data-path="images/terminal.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=1c1834773261e5a0c8be7a0e1b4191a5 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=5e9e0bae89a5aded6a9d7448926ff5a8 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=40030ce29b5df99adb0c950877a84baa 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=7712e06a02cfeedd04e43aef5024c6eb 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=cbcbd72414a41dc5717a61b867789fbe 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4/images/terminal.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=SqldyWKxvGS7UNL4&q=85&s=3a8450a5d3357e016e9b562574bd68fe 2500w" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add SMTP variables">
    To configure Loops SMTP in your Laravel project, add the following values to your `.env` file.

    <Tip>
      `MAIL_PASSWORD` should be an API key from your [API Settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page.
    </Tip>

    ```bash .env theme={"dark"}
    MAIL_MAILER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=smtp.loops.so
    MAIL_PORT=587
    MAIL_USERNAME=loops
    MAIL_PASSWORD=<API_KEY>
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send emails from Laravel">
    Now you can send emails from your application.

    If you haven't already, create a mailable class, for example `AuthEmail`:

    ```bash  theme={"dark"}
    php artisan make:mail AuthEmail
    ```

    Loops' SMTP system doesn't send full HTML emails directly. Instead, you should provide a structured API-like payload, which Loops will then use to render an HTML email.

    Create a view for your email, like below.

    You can copy an example payload from the **Publish** page of your transactional email in Loops.

    ```json resources/views/mail/auth-email-text.blade.php theme={"dark"}
    {
      "transactionalId": "clomzp89u635xl30px7wrl0ri",
      "email": "{{ $email }}", /* recipient */
      "dataVariables": {
        "loginUrl": "https://myapp.com/login?code={{ $auth_code }}"
      }
    }
    ```

    Then add a reference to your template in the `Content` definition using the `text` key.

    You also need to pass the values for the recipient email address and any data variables in your email. In this case we are using a `$user` property added to the constructor.

    ```php app/Mail/AuthEmail.php theme={"dark"}
    use App\Models\User;

    class AuthEmail extends Mailable
    {
      /**
       * Create a new message instance.
       */
      public function __construct(
          private User $user,
      ) {}

      /**
       * Get the message content definition.
       */
      public function content(): Content
      {
          return new Content(
              text: 'mail.auth-email-text',
              with: [
                'email' => $this->user->email,
                'auth_code' => $this->user->auth_code,
              ]
          );
      }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>You can omit the `view` option typically required for HTML emails in Laravel. Loops handles HTML rendering using the provided payload.</Tip>

    You can skip adding values to the `Envelope` because the "from" address and subject are all defined within Loops on your transactional email.

    Now you can send transactional emails.

    ```php  theme={"dark"}
    use \App\Mail\AuthEmail;

    Mail::to('anything.here@mail.com')->send(new AuthEmail($user));
    ```

    Note that the email address defined in `to()` will not be used for sending the email even though it's a required parameter. **You have to provide the recipient's email to the template itself**.

    You can read more about sending emails from Laravel [in their docs](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail#writing-mailables).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Action Mailer">
    To use Loops SMTP, configure Action Mailer using the following settings.

    <Tip>
      The `password` value should be an API key from your [API Settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) page.
    </Tip>

    ```ruby config/environments/production.rb theme={"dark"}
    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
      address:         'smtp.loops.so',
      port:            587,
      user_name:       'loops',
      password:        '<API_KEY>',
      authentication:  'plain',
      enable_starttls: true
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send emails from Rails">
    Now you can send emails from your application.

    Here's an example Mailer:

    ```ruby app/mailers/user_mailer.rb theme={"dark"}
    class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer

      def login_email
        @user = params[:user]
        # Note: the "to" address is required by Action Mailer
        #  but is overwritten by the email provided in the view
        #  (see below). Likewise, a subject is not required here
        #  because Loops will use the subject provided in the editor.
        mail(to: @user.email)
      end

    end
    ```

    Loops' SMTP system doesn't send full HTML emails directly. Instead, you should provide a structured API-like payload, which Loops will then use to render an HTML email.

    Create a text view for your email, like below.

    You can copy an example payload from the **Publish** page of your transactional email in Loops.

    ```json app/views/user_mailer/login_email.text.erb theme={"dark"}
    {
      "transactionalId": "clomzp89u635xl30px7wrl0ri",
      "email": "<%= @user.email %>", /* recipient */
      "dataVariables": {
        "loginUrl": "https://myapp.com/login?code=<%= @user.auth_code %>"
      }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>You do not need to provide an HTML view for your emails when using Loops SMTP (i.e.: `login_email.html.erb` is not required).</Tip>

# Supabase
Source: https://loops.so/docs/smtp/supabase

Configure your Supabase account to send authentication emails with Loops.

<Info>
  If you are looking to sync Supabase user data to Loops, you can use our
  [Supabase integration](/integrations/supabase).
</Info>

Set up an SMTP connection to send all of your Supabase emails with Loops.

There are two big benefits to using Loops for sending your Supabase emails:

<Steps>
  <Step title="More control over design">
    You can use [Loops' design editor](/creating-emails/editor) to create (and
    then easily edit) beautiful transactional emails instead of having to code
    them with HTML.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Better visibility of sent emails">
    You get full visibility on which emails are being sent, when, and to whom in
    your Loops account. Supabase doesn't offer this view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up Loops SMTP in Supabase

You can set up Loops SMTP in Supabase with just a few clicks.

Go to [Settings -> Supabase](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=supabase) and click **Connect Supabase** in the **SMTP** section.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=484de2928fcc3c690a519f95ddfc3f71" alt="Supabase SMTP settings" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1560" height="1560" data-path="images/supabase-smtp-setup.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=021a2d818300e31abb8546ec07813956 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=43e7adbec91910d666cff33712886021 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=ad95ff5be5fdbfdb7c95e921c9f8f161 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=6ac6d2d26fc8e02c593c2a244aed87bd 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=4c4ef1741b7768fb8d4c6f5a8d1d6b9c 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-smtp-setup.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=dc26008e6ad25c38cc43c1963d7ccba5 2500w" />

When prompted by Supabase, select your organization and authorize access.

Back in Loops, select your Supabase project and an API key (which is used as the SMTP password), then click **Set up SMTP**.

This will add Loops SMTP credentials to your Supabase project, so you can start sending emails. You can find these credentials in Supabase at [Authentication -> Emails -> SMTP Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/smtp).

For reference, the SMTP credentials are:

| Field       | Value                                                                               |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host        | `smtp.loops.so`                                                                     |
| Port number | `587`                                                                               |
| Username    | `loops`                                                                             |
| Password    | An API key from your [API settings](http://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) in Loops |

## Create Transactional emails in Loops

Next, create new transactional emails for the emails listed in Supabase ([Authentication -> Emails](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates)). You need to create both **Confirm signup** and **Magic Link** emails to be able to properly set up the integration.

* Confirm signup (required)
* Invite user
* Magic Link (required)
* Change Email Address
* Reset Password

Note that if a Supabase user has not previously confirmed their email, they will be sent a **Confirm signup** email when you request a **Magic Link** email.

To create new transactional emails, go to the [Transactional page](https://app.loops.so/transactional) in Loops and click **New**. Alternatively, you can select one of our many ready-made templates from the [Templates page](https://app.loops.so/templates).

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=4caabccc27e821cc8c63cf978b8492ef" alt="Supabase template in the editor" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1328" height="1328" data-path="images/supabase-template.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=4ed669d8b2844da4ce8f74dabedfe263 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=757933aa11d893b752e9450815fbe67a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=22a73ef458afb775daa1ab648ad01185 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=d25ba1e700cd057086daa7c61162897c 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=6d2b0327221b3ce252d501cc49152cf8 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-template.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=b878d4554046be8a153f2958a8e2506c 2500w" />

You can then use [the Loops editor](/creating-emails/editor) to create nicely-designed templates or make them as simple as you like.

You can even create [themes](/creating-emails/styles#themes) to apply consistent design and branding to all of your emails.

For each Loops template you create, you need to [add data variables](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#add-dynamic-content-to-emails), which allow data from Supabase to be inserted into each email.

For example, you could add a `confirmationUrl` data variable that you can map to the `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` value from Supabase.

You can also build URLs by including values like `{{ .SiteUrl }}` or add in a confirmation code using `{{ .Token }}`.

Once you're done creating the email and adding data variables, click **Review** in the left panel. Here you can see the API payload for your template. You will need this for the next step.

## Configure email templates in Supabase

The final step is to make sure your emails in Supabase are configured to send the correct data to Loops.

Loops SMTP integrations work a bit differently than most. Instead of sending a text or HTML email body, you set them up to send API-like data.

In Supabase, go to [Authentication -> Emails](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates), then edit each template to contain the payload as shown in the previous step (you can click the clipboard icon in Loops to copy the full payload).

Once pasted into the Message body, you need to add the Supabase message variables into the payload.

<Warning>
  Make sure you set up at least the **Confirm signup** and **Magic Link**
  templates in Supabase, otherwise emails will not be sent. Also, any variables
  added in the **Confirm signup** template need to also be available in **Magic
  link** email, because Supabase will send a **Confirm signup** email instead of
  a **Magic Link** email if a user hasn't confirmed their email address.
</Warning>

Here is an example **Confirm signup** email template. This payload was copied from the template's Publish page in Loops, then the `{{ .Email }}` and `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` Supabase variables were added.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clvmzp39u035tl50pw7wrl0ri",
  "email": "{{ .Email }}",
  "dataVariables": {
    "confirmationUrl": "{{ .ConfirmationURL }}"
  }
}
```

If you want to add each Supabase user to your Loops audience so you can send marketing email to them, add the `addToAudience` flag to your template as below. This will create a contact in Loops using the `{{ .Email }}` value.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clvmzp39u035tl50pw7wrl0ri",
  "email": "{{ .Email }}",
  "addToAudience": true,
  "dataVariables": {
    "confirmationUrl": "{{ .ConfirmationURL }}"
  }
}
```

Here's how the template looks in the Supabase editor:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=e0171a1e53acc8bb21987903a44e09a7" alt="Supabase editor" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1766" height="1766" data-path="images/supabase-email.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=a8634701978d07d6a667a6c4c7c36ba7 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=d3f20ce2d5b18c9ac700a2e875b35c84 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=ac9919f49e1b49f7d7e72657b0aebe08 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=dd55e0f13b8db146923e85916bcff95a 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=7e308b931fec3e01f734ba58c85e28d7 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2/images/supabase-email.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Z7viZoAUCPxaqCl2&q=85&s=3dfb3736b166b051dd564a9a53b1b339 2500w" />

With the integration now all set up, your Supabase authentication emails will be sent via Loops, giving you more visibility on your email sends and the great addition of being able to build beautiful and easy-to-update emails in the Loops editor.

<Tip>
  To view all sends of your transactional emails, click through to the email
  from the [Transactional](https://app.loops.so/transactional) page in Loops,
  where you'll find the Metrics page containing a table showing all sends and
  some statistics.
</Tip>

## Testing the integration

You can test your Loops integration by creating new users from [Authentication -> Users](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/users) page in Supabase.

Click **Add user** and select **Create new user**. Use an email address you have access to.

Then click on the new user in the list and click the **Send magic link** button. This will send the magic link email you set up in Supabase via Loops SMTP.

## Debugging

Supabase offers a detailed view of authentication logs where you can look for issues with your Loops integration.

Go to [Logs -> Auth](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/logs/auth-logs). To narrow down your search you can look for logs like "magiclink" or "invite".

## Important notes

* You need to add a template in Loops and set up the email in Supabase for at least the **Confirm signup** and **Magic Link** templates.
* The subject in Supabase templates is always overwritten by the subject added to the corresponding template in Loops.
* The sender name and sender email configured in your Supabase SMTP settings are always overwritten by the sender details added to your templates in Loops.
* Any Supabase email not set up with the correct API-like payload will fail to send.


# Transactional email

How to send transactional email with Loops.

Transactional emails are automated, API-triggered emails that are sent to individual contacts based on a specific action they have taken.

Examples include **confirmation emails**, **password reset emails**, and **purchase confirmations**.

<CardGroup columns="2">
  <Card title="Loops API - Send transactional email" icon="envelope" href="/api-reference/send-transactional-email">
    Read how to send transactional email with our API.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it works

Sending transactional email with Loops has two steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create transactional emails">
    First, create transactional emails in Loops using our [email
    editor](/creating-emails/editor). In your email you can add data variables,
    which let you insert custom data into each email you send.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send with the API">
    To send transactional emails you need to use the Loops API. All it takes is
    a simple call to our [Send transactional email
    endpoint](/api-reference/send-transactional-email). Your request needs to
    include the ID of the transactional email you created, the recipient's email
    address and any data variables needed for the email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compose your email

There are two ways to create emails in Loops: using our editor or import an MJML template.

### Use our editor

You can [create emails in the editor](/creating-emails/editor), letting you easily add formatting, images and buttons.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=6d4f8855f2bb71dbf528ab8da2c4aacb" alt="" data-og-width="2280" width="2280" data-og-height="1355" height="1355" data-path="images/transactional-example.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=9e8df0d409a4bf917d37a08295dc8455 280w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=15b343e6210f4aa163570a8709f68152 560w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=5bdb62280bb095794d570da750a13c0e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=c7a97149078a5e2ac87cbd3c41d270a2 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=60cebc6a82938cb12f70af9f60ecbd21 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/loops/4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg/images/transactional-example.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4h4NdelN1SeEp2xg&q=85&s=fcb440735577b734aaf52a2a68f1a9f5 2500w" />

You can add dynamic data into your emails by using data variables (like `name` in the example above). Read on for more information about data variables.

### Bring your own MJML

You can also [upload your own MJML code](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email) to use in the email. This is useful if you have a pre-existing template you want to use.

Like emails created in our editor, you can add data variables to MJML templates. To add a data variable called `passwordResetLink`, you can use it in your MJML like this:

```html  theme={"dark"}
<mj-text>{DATA_VARIABLE:passwordResetLink}</mj-text>
```

<Tip>
  Note the uppercase “DATA\_VARIABLE” and the colon before the variable name.
</Tip>

## Add data variables

Data variables let you insert dynamic values into every transactional email, to personalize them to each recipient. When it comes to sending the email, you specify the value of each data variable in the API call.

Let's say you have a password reset email that is sent once a user clicks a "Reset Password" button in your application.

For this we need to add two data variables to the email: `name` and `resetUrl`.

You can insert data variables into the text of the email in three ways:

* click the `{}` dynamic content button above the editor (see below)
* type variables directly into the editor, like `{planName}`
* use the `/` slash menu (select "Data variable" from the menu).

You can also add data variables as links (on text, images and buttons). To add the `resetUrl` as the button's link, click on the data variable icon (1), click the data variable (2) and then enter your data variable name into the **Variable name** field (3).

If you want to write the tags manually in your content or [in HTML emails](/creating-emails/uploading-custom-email), you can use our [dynamic tag syntax](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails#dynamic-tag-syntax). To add a reset URL you can write a tag like this:

```
{DATA_VARIABLE:resetUrl}
```

### Data variables in email headers

Data variables are also available in the email sending settings fields, like **From**, **Reply**, **CC**, **BCC** and **Subject**.

Click the `>` button to view all fields and then click the data variable icon. Use sensible names for your data variables, like `bccAddress` or `replyToAddress` so they are clear in your API call.

To send data to these fields, simply include the data variables in your API call as normal ([see below](#send-your-email)).

### Optional data variables

Data variables can be optional, by selecting "Optional" from the selector just below the data variable name.

If a data variable is optional, you can omit the key from the API request entirely, or include the key and send an empty string `""` (sending `null` will not work).

### Important information about data variables

* Make sure that when you [send a transactional email using the API](/api-reference/send-transactional-email) that you include *all non-optional data variables* in your request. If you do not include the correct set of data variables in your API call, the send will fail.
* Data variable names are case-sensitive (meaning `LastLoggedIn` and `lastLoggedIn` are different variables).
* Data variable names can only contain:
  * letters
  * numbers
  * underscores
  * dashes
* Data variable values sent over the API can be `string` or `number`.

## Review your email

On the next page, after clicking **Next**, you'll see the API Details section. This contains the data variables used in the email as well as a sample payload for reference. The “Transactional ID” lets you distinguish between different transactional emails when calling the API and is required.

## Publish the email

To enable sending the email, it needs to be published by clicking **Publish**.

## Send your email

In the example above, two Data Variables were used in the email and there is a transactional ID needed as part of our API call. Any data variables created in the email are required when making the API request.

Here's an example of the request for sending this email:

**Send a POST to this endpoint (make sure to authenticate)**

```
https://app.loops.so/api/v1/transactional
```

**Payload**

You can copy an email's example payload from its Publish page in Loops by clicking the **Show payload** button.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{
  "transactionalId": "clfq6dinn000yl70fgwwyp82l",
  "email": "favorite@example.com",
  "dataVariables": {
    "name": "Chris",
    "passwordResetLink": "https://example.com/reset-password",
    "bccAddress": "me@company.com"
  }
}
```

You can add contacts to your audience from this call by adding `"addToAudience": true` to your payload.

The previous published version of the email will remain, and will continue sending until you republish the email. This means you can make changes to transactional emails without disrupting ongoing email sending.

When you have a draft, we retain both versions and you can switch between your draft and the published version using the toggles in the top right.

To publish your changes, simply click **Republish** and click the confirmation. Your draft will seamlessly become the published version.

## Metrics

After emails are sent, details are shown in the email's Metrics page.

These include send time and if messages experienced any issues with delivery (bounces or spam complaints).

<Tip>
  Note that open and click tracking is disabled for transactional messages to
  improve deliverability for infrastructure-level communications.
</Tip>

## Testing transactional emails

You can test your transactional email integration by sending to email addresses with `@example.com` and `@test.com` domains (for example `user1@example.com` and `user2@example.com`).

Everything will work as normal (e.g. you will receive success responses from the API), but no emails will be sent to `@example.com` or `@test.com` email addresses, making this a good way to test transactional emails without affecting your sending domain’s reputation.

## Errors

### Links look like `x-webdoc://....`

This is a known issue with Apple Mail. Make sure that your links start with `https://` or `http://` and they should work fine.

### API (400-level error)

The first place to start is to check the body of the response. It will contain a JSON object with a `message` property that will give you more information about the error. Here are common reasons that the API might return with a 400-level error:

* Using the API without a [verified domain](/sending-domain).
* Trying to use the API for a transactional email without a published email message.
* Missing a required parameter: `transactionalId`, `email`, or `dataVariables`.
* Missing a data variable that is required by the email message.


# Attachments

How to send attachments with your transactional email.

<Note>
  Need to send attachments with your transactional email? Just [reach out to
  us](mailto:help@loops.so) and we can enable the feature on your account.
</Note>

## Sending attachments

Check out [the transactional API documentation](/api-reference/send-transactional-email) for a refresher on the transactional API email payload.

To attach a file to a transactional message, you'll need to add a `attachments` key to the standard transaction API email payload. The `attachments` key should be an array of objects, each with the following keys:

* `filename` - the name of the file
* `contentType` - the MIME type of the file
* `data` - the base64 encoded content of the file

Here's an example of a transactional email payload with [this ICS file](https://gist.github.com/phil-loops/c0cb5d84d502a3949651934252d306af) attached:

```json  theme={"dark"}

## Campaigns

A Campaign is the right type of email for a one-off send to your audience or a segment of your audience.

Marketing emails are a 1-to-many communication, meaning that the same exact email that you craft can (and probably will) be sent and read by a number of recipients or customers.

**Examples:**

* Newsletters
* Investor updates
* Product updates
* User feedback requests

**How to send a Campaign:**

1. Hit “Create” in the top right corner of your Loops dashboard.
2. Select “Campaign” in the popup module.
3. Enter the subject line, preview text, and content of the email.
4. Select your audience segment.
5. Schedule the email to send later or send it immediately.

## Loops

A Loop is an email that is triggered by an event, a contact being added to your audience, or a contact property update.

**Examples:**

* Welcome emails
* User onboarding sequences
* User check-ins

For more information on sending your first Loop, [visit this guide](/loop-builder).

## Transactional

A Transactional email is an automated message that is triggered by a specific contact action.

**Examples:**

* Password resets
* Purchase or upgrade confirmations
* Shipping information
* Account cancellation emails

For more information on sending your first Transactional messages, [read the transactional email guide](/transactional).

**Things to note:**

* Unlike campaigns and loops, transactional emails are not promotional in nature and as a result, they do not require unsubscribe information to be included in the email.
* Unlike campaigns and loops, we do not track opens or link clicks in transactional emails, to increase deliverability of your emails. This also means that `email.opened` and `email.clicked` [webhook events](/webhooks) are not available for transactional emails.
* Contacts behave slightly differently between transactional and marketing emails (campaigns and loops):
  * Your Audience only contains marketing contacts. If a new contact is sent a transactional email, they are not added to your Audience, unless you use the `addToAudience` flag when [sending the email](/api-reference/send-transactional-email).
  * Sending a transactional email to a new contact will not trigger the ["Contact added" loop trigger](/loop-builder#triggers).
  * The "Subscribed" [contact property](/contacts/properties#subscribed) does not affect transactional emails. Unsubscribed contacts will still receive all transactional emails they are sent.

# Webhooks
Source: https://loops.so/docs/webhooks

Receive event notifications with webhooks.

Webhooks send data to your website or application when certain events happen in your Loops account.

## Set up webhooks

Go to [Settings -> Webhooks](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=webhooks) and input the URL of your endpoint that will receive events.

You will be provided with a signing secret. You should save this in your project (for example in an environment variable) so you can verify requests when you receive them.

Currently you can only set up one webhook endpoint per Loops account.

Subscribe to the events you want to receive using the toggles. Click the group names to view all events in each.

<Tip>
  When toggling your endpoint on and off there may be a small delay before this
  setting is reflected on the server. For example, it may take a few seconds
  after toggling on your endpoint for requests to be dispatched.
</Tip>

## Rate limiting

Webhook events will be sent at a maximum rate of 10 per second. Any further events will be queued.

## Verify requests

Every event is signed so you can check that data sent to your endpoint is sent from Loops.

To verify webhooks, you need to create a signature of the received request and match that to the provided signature in the request's headers.

Here's an example verification function you could use in Next.js:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript utils.ts theme={"dark"}
  import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
  import crypto from 'crypto';

  interface WebhookVerificationError extends Error {
  code: 'MISSING_HEADERS' | 'MISSING_SECRET' | 'INVALID_SIGNATURE' | 'VERIFICATION_FAILED';
  }

  /\*\*

  - Verifies a webhook request from Loops
  - @param req The incoming Next.js request
  - @throws {WebhookVerificationError} If verification fails
  - @returns {Promise<boolean>} True if verification succeeds
    \*/
    async function verifyWebhook(req: NextRequest): Promise<boolean> {
    try {

        // Get the webhook-related headers directly from req.headers
        // Next.js automatically lowercases header names
        const eventId = req.headers.get('webhook-id');
        const timestamp = req.headers.get('webhook-timestamp');
        const webhookSignature = req.headers.get('webhook-signature');

        // Verify required headers are present
        if (!eventId || !timestamp || !webhookSignature) {
          const error = new Error('Missing required webhook header') as WebhookVerificationError;
          error.code = 'MISSING_HEADERS';
          throw error;
        }

        // Read raw body as buffer
        const readable = req.read();
        const buffer = Buffer.from(readable);
        const rawBodyText = buffer.toString();

        const signedContent = `${eventId}.${timestamp}.${rawBodyText}`;

        // Verify secret exists
        const secret = process.env.LOOPS_SIGNING_SECRET;
        if (!secret) {
          const error = new Error(
            'Missing LOOPS_SIGNING_SECRET environment variable'
          ) as WebhookVerificationError;
          error.code = 'MISSING_SECRET';
          throw error;
        }
        // Create a signature from the request data
        const secretBytes = Buffer.from(secret.split('_')[1], 'base64');
        const signature = crypto
          .createHmac('sha256', secretBytes)
          .update(signedContent)
          .digest('base64');

        // Check if the signature matches
        const signatureFound = webhookSignature
          .split(' ')
          .some((sig) => sig.includes(`,${signature}`));

        if (!signatureFound) {
          const error = new Error('Invalid signature') as WebhookVerificationError;
          error.code = 'INVALID_SIGNATURE';
          throw error;
        }

        return true;

    } catch (error) {
    if ((error as WebhookVerificationError).code) {
    throw error;
    }
    const wrappedError = new Error(
    `Webhook verification failed: ${(error as Error).message}`
    ) as WebhookVerificationError;
    wrappedError.code = 'VERIFICATION_FAILED';
    throw wrappedError;
    }
    }

  ```

  ```javascript webhook.ts theme={"dark"}
  import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
    },
  };

  export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
    if (req.method !== 'POST') {
      return res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });
    }

    try {
      await verifyWebhook(req);
      // Webhook is verified, process the event...
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Webhook processed successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Webhook error:', error);
      const status = {
        MISSING_HEADERS: 400,
        MISSING_SECRET: 500,
        INVALID_SIGNATURE: 401,
        VERIFICATION_FAILED: 400
      }[(error as WebhookVerificationError).code] || 500;

      return NextResponse.json(
        { message: error.message },
        { status }
      );
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing webhooks

From the Webhooks settings page you can send a test request to your endpoint. This allows you to test that your endpoint is working, and that your verification code is OK.

The event name sent during testing is `testing.testEvent`. You can [see the payload below](#testing-testevent).

## Viewing webhook history

Once Loops has started sending webhook events to your endpoint you will be able to see event history in the **Messages** section at the bottom of the Webhooks settings page.

Clicking on an event in the table will reveal the response from your endpoint, which is helpful if there have been any errors.

We retain 30 days of event history.

## Event data

Every webhook will contain the following data in the request body:

### `eventName`

The event type. See a [full list of events below](#event-types).

### `webhookSchemaVersion`

Will be `1.0.0` for all events.

### `eventTime`

Unix timestamp of the time the event occurred in Loops.

***

Depending on the context of the event, more data will also be included. Full examples are shown in the [Event types](#event-types) section below.

### `contact`

A full contact object containing a contact's properties.

Contains:

* `id`
* `email`
* `firstName` (nullable string)
* `lastName` (nullable string)
* `source`
* `subscribed` (boolean)
* `userGroup`
* `userId` (nullable string)
* `mailingLists` (object with mailing list IDs as keys and `true` as the value; these are the mailing lists the contact is subscribed to)
* `optInStatus` (nullable string, `"accepted"` or `null`)
  {" "}
  <Note>
    This will be `null` for contacts unless they are created via a form and
    [double opt-in](/contacts/double-opt-in) is enabled. `contact.created`
    events are only sent once contacts have confirmed their subscription, so
    this value will never be `"pending"` or `"rejected"`.
  </Note>
* plus any custom contact properties

This object is the same as the data returned in the [Find a contact](/api-reference/find-contact#response) API endpoint.

### `contactIdentity`

A contact's identifiers. To retrieve the full contact, use the [Find a contact](/api-reference/find-contact) API endpoint.

Contains:

* `id`
* `email`
* `userId` (nullable string)

### `email`

Details about an individual email send to a recipient:

* `id` - The unqiue ID of the email.
* `emailMessageId` - The ID of the sent version of the campaign/loop/transactional email.
* `subject` - The subject of the sent version of the campaign/loop/transactional email.

<Info>
  To get the ID of the campaign, loop or transactional email that relates to the
  Loops dashboard or API, look for a `campaignId`, `loopId`, or
  `transactionalId` in the payload.
</Info>

### `mailingList`

Details about a mailing list:

* `id`
* `name`
* `description` (nullable string)
* `isPublic` (boolean)

This object is the same as the data returned in the [List mailing lists](/api-reference/list-mailing-lists#response) API endpoint.

### `mailingLists`

A list of `mailingList` objects (see above), when an event relates to multiple mailing lists.

### `sourceType`

For `email.*` events, this specifies the type of email.

One of `campaign`, `loop` or `transactional`.

***

### Headers

Headers will include:

* `Webhook-Signature` - A list of request signatures, which can be used to [verify the request](#verify-requests).
* `Webhook-Id` - The unique ID of the event. You can use this to check if you have already saved or processed this specific event.
* `Webhook-Timestamp` - The timestamp of the request (seconds since epoch).

## Event types

### Contacts

#### contact.created

Sent when a new contact is created in your audience.

Contains a `contactIdentity` object plus a full `contact` object, which includes all of the new contact's properties.

<Tip>
  When [double opt-in](/contacts/double-opt-in) is enabled, contact webhooks
  don't fire until the contact is confirmed. The `contact.created` event will
  only be sent for contacts created via forms once the contact has confirmed
  their subscription. Other contact-related webhooks (such as
  `contact.mailingList.subscribed`) will also only fire after confirmation.
</Tip>

  "eventTime": 1734425918,
  "webhookSchemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "sourceType": "campaign",
  "campaignId": "cm4t1suns001uw6atri87v54s",

    "id": "cm4ittmhq0011ow9h6fb460yw",
    "email": "test+1@loops.so",
    "userId": null
  }
}
```

#### email.softBounced

Sent when an email soft bounces.

<Tip>
  Soft bounces are temporary email delivery failures, for example a connection
  timing out. Soft bounces are retried multiple times and some times the email
  is delivered.
</Tip>

Contains a `sourceType` and a related `campaignId` / `transactionalId` / `loopId` value, plus `contactIdentity` and `email` objects.

```json  theme={"dark"}
{

```

#### email.hardBounced

Sent when an email hard bounces.

<Tip>
  Hard bounces are persistent email delivery failures, for example a mailbox
  that doesn't exist. The email will not be delivered.
</Tip>

In Loops, a hard bounce results in a contact being unsubscribed from your audience so a `contact.unsubscribed` event will also be sent.

Contains a `sourceType` and a related `campaignId` / `transactionalId` / `loopId` value, plus `contactIdentity` and `email` objects.
