# Migrating domains

> Switching to a new sending domain

You may need to switch sending domains if you rebrand your company, want to send from a new domain for the first time, or are migrating to Loops from another provider.

Keep the following in mind:

1. **DNS records matter**

   If DNS records for your domain are removed, email sending will stop, just as it would with any other provider.
2. **Avoid migrating if your reputation is good**

   If your sender reputation is already healthy, we generally recommend **not migrating**. The downtime and adjustment period can cause more harm than benefit.
3. **If you must migrate, choose the right timing**
   * For **transactional email**, migrate during your app’s off-peak hours.
   * For **marketing or product updates**, migrate between major sends.
4. **Get help if needed**

   If you have concerns, [reach out to our support team](mailto:support@loops.so) ahead of time. We’re happy to clarify best practices and help you plan a smooth migration.
