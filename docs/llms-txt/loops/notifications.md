# Notifications

> Learn how to receive notifications about new Loops contacts in external tools.

You will receive a notification when a contact is added to your audience through the API, integrations or form submission. You will not receive notifications for manually added users via CSV or other methods.

You can manage your notifications in the [Notifications](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=notifications) page.

## Email notifications

By default, you will receive an email notification from Loopsbot when a contact is added to your audience. You can disable this notification by toggling the **Notifications enabled** switch in the [Notifications section](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=notifications) of your Settings. If you'd like to receive email notifications again, you can toggle the switch back on. This setting is individual to your user account, and won't propagate to the rest of your team.

## Slack notifications

You can receive notifications in Slack for new contacts. Please note, this is a global setting and will apply to all additional seats in your account.

### Set up Slack notifications

1. Go to [Settings -> Notifications](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=notifications).
2. Click the link to be redirected to Slack for authorization.
3. Select the channel you want to add the bot to.

<Tip>
  The bot must be invited to private channels before they become visible in the dropdown.
</Tip>

4. Send a test message to verify the integration works.

That's it! All new contacts added to your audience will now send a notification to the selected Slack channel.

### Other options

Here are a few other ways to get Slack notifications for new contacts:

1. Install an email add-on to send individual emails from [Gmail](https://slack.com/apps/AEFLFJR9Q-slack-for-gmail) or [Outlook](https://slack.com/apps/AFS3736H3-slack-for-outlook) to channels or DMs (free).
2. Create a forwarding address to send individual emails to your DM with Slackbot (free).
