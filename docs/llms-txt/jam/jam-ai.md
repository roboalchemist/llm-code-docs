### Overview

Jam AI transforms your bug captures into complete, actionable reports. Engineers get the context they need to debug faster, while you spend less time writing tickets.

### Key Benefits

* **Complete bug reports in one click:** no more incomplete tickets
* **Faster debugging:** engineers get structured repro steps and potential fixes
* **Consistent quality:** every ticket includes the details that matter

### How it works

* **AI Auto-Title:** AI generates a short summary of the captured video, screenshot, or instant replay
* **AI Repro Steps:** AI generates a list of steps to reproduce the captured bug

{% hint style="warning" %}
AI Repro Steps are not available for screenshot Jams.
{% endhint %}
