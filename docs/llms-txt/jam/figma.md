You can paste Figma links into Jam – and engineers will see the Figma frame side by side your initial bug report.

That means they don't have to open a new tab to see what's in Figma, and they don't have to search around your Figma file. It's right there for them!

## How to embed Figma files in Jams

1. Capture a visual bug on the screen using Jam
2. In the Jam description, paste in a Figma link
3. Click "Create" to create your Jam
4. Open the Jam you just created. You'll see a Figma icon at the bottom of the Jam – click on it, and a perfect Figma embed will appear.&#x20;

That way, engineers don't need to open another tab to see what the intended designs should be. It's right there – in the Jam – embedded perfectly from the Figma.
