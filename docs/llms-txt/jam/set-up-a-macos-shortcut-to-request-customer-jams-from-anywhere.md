# Set up a macOS shortcut to request Customer Jams from anywhere

1\. Generate a recording link (with the Jam extension or from the dashboard) and name it “General feedback” or whatever you like. Copy the link

2\. Go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Text Replacements.

3\. Click the "+" button to add a new replacement.

Enter the text you want to replace “/jam” in the "Replace" field and paste the link in the text in the "With" field.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can choose the title of the Jam that is created from your link by adding `?jam-title=` to the query string that you paste in. When you use your shortcut, you can add the desired title of the resulting Jam.<br>

For example, if you want the title of the Jam to be "Shopping cart bug": \
\
`https://recorder.jam.dev/QrBnf3s?jam-title=Shopping+cart+bug`
{% endhint %}

4\. Click "Add" and then "Done".
