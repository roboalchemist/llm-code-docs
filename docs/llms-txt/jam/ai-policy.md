## Building Jam AI

Jam AI is designed to help teams move faster by automating repetitive tasks and enhancing the clarity of bug reports. Whether you're generating ticket descriptions, capturing detailed reproduction steps, or need help debugging, Jam AI keeps you focused on solving issues rather than spending time documenting them. Learn more about our approach below.

### **Our Approach**

Jam's AI features are powered by third-party AI models that help you create and resolve bugs faster. Key features — including automatic ticket creation, reproduction step generation, and debugger — leverage AI to speed up your workflow. We're continually working to improve Jam AI by developing smarter models that better understand debugging patterns and technical documentation.

### Data and privacy

We know how important it is to keep your data safe. Our AI model development process is built to protect your privacy and confidential information.

For all customer data, we:

* Encrypt data at rest and in transit
* Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access
* Provide granular user access controls and permissions
* Give you the ability to manage AI features per team

When working with third-party AI providers, we:

* Do not allow them to train their models on customer data uploaded or created with Jam
* Limit how long vendors can store data — third-party providers may process data temporarily to enable AI features
* Take steps to de-identify and anonymize content, removing sensitive information from processed text
