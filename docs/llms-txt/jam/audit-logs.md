### Overview

Audit logs give you complete visibility into your team's Jam workspace activity. Track who's doing what, when changes happen, and maintain accountability across your team. Essential for security oversight, compliance requirements, and team management.

### Key Benefits

* **Security oversight:** Monitor access control changes and user permissions in real-time
* **Team accountability:** Track member invitations, role changes, and removals
* **Configuration tracking:** See when critical settings like data retention and AI features are modified
* **Compliance support:** Maintain detailed records for security audits and regulatory requirements

#### What's Tracked

Audit logs capture three main categories of workspace activity:

| Activity Type     | What's Logged                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access Control    | Changes to team, folder, and individual Jam permissions                            |
| Membership Events | User invitations, removals, and role modifications                                 |
| Settings Changes  | Data retention updates, AI feature toggles, and Changes in workspace configuration |

### How It Works

Every significant action in your workspace gets automatically logged with:

* **Who** performed the action
* **What** was changed
* **When** it happened
* **Context** around the change

This creates a complete audit trail that helps you understand workspace evolution and identify any unauthorized changes.
