# Video blur

With blur you can easily hide sensitive information in your video recording, and share your Jams knowing that private details are secure.

Here's how to use blur in your video recording:

1. Select tab or desktop recording from Jam extension
2. You can use blur before the recording starts by selecting the blur tool during countdown \

3. You can also use blur during recording. Clicking the blur tool will pause the recording, and you can start selecting elements you want to hide. To remove the blur, you can click again on the blurred element. Once you’re done, you can click “Done” button, and continue recording your video.\
   \&#xNAN;*Note: Elements cannot be blurred after the recording, only before or during the recording.*<br>
