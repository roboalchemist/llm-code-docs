# Bitrise vs CircleCI

Evaluate which CI/CD platform best fits your development workflow with this side-by-side comparison of Bitrise and CircleCI.

## Why choose CircleCI?

Modern apps depend on more than mobile code. CircleCI helps you ship everything behind the app, too. From frontends to backend services, APIs, and infrastructure, CircleCI supports the full software stack in one CI/CD platform, giving you the flexibility to move fast without outgrowing your tooling.

## Why teams choose CircleCI

### Ship fast, stay flexible

From Xcode builds to Android emulators, CircleCI gives mobile teams the performance they need. Cut your build times dramatically with test splitting, advanced caching, and the most comprehensive fleet of executors and resource classes available anywhere.

### Run everything in one pipeline

Mobile apps don’t exist in isolation. CircleCI supports backend services, APIs, and infrastructure alongside mobile builds so you can deploy your full stack without juggling multiple CI tools.

### Built-in control and confidence

CircleCI provides the governance and visibility needed to scale CI/CD securely. Teams get audit logs, fine-grained access controls, and org-wide security and compliance policies that keep workflows secure without slowing development down.

### Optimized for developers

CircleCI is built for iteration. Developers can trigger workflows with parameters, debug jobs over SSH, and automate repetitive tasks through APIs, CLI tools, and AI integrations, all from their editor.
