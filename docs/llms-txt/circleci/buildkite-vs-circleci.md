# Buildkite vs CircleCI

Explore the differences between CircleCI and Buildkite Pipelines to choose the right CI/CD platform for speed, scale, and long-term success.

## Why choose CircleCI?

CircleCI is a fully managed CI/CD platform that runs at scale in the cloud, with minimal ops overhead. While Buildkite Pipelines now offers both self-hosted and hosted agent options, their hosted solution still requires customers to manage queue configurations and scaling parameters. CircleCI has been cloud-native from day one with more mature tooling and enterprise features in the managed space.
