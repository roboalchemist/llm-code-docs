# Redoc CE deployment guide

Redoc CE offers multiple ways of rendering your OpenAPI description.
Choose a method that best suits your needs.

Redoc CE supports the following rendering methods:

- **[Live demo](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/):**
The live demo offers a fast way to see how your OpenAPI renders with Redoc CE.
A version of the Redocly Museum API is displayed by default.
To test it with your own OpenAPI description, enter the URL for your description and select **Try it**.
- **[HTML element](/docs/redoc/deployment/html):**
Using the HTML element works well for typical website deployments.
- **[React component](/docs/redoc/deployment/react):**
Using the React component is an option for users with a React-based application.
- **[Docker image](/docs/redoc/deployment/docker):**
Using the Docker image works in a container-based deployment.
- **[Redocly CLI](/docs/redoc/deployment/cli):**
Using the Redocly CLI is an option for users who prefer to use a command-line interface.


## Before you begin

To work with Redoc CE, make sure you have:

- an OpenAPI description file
- a utility that simulates an HTTP server


### OpenAPI description

You need an OpenAPI description.
For testing purposes, you can use one of the following sample OpenAPI descriptions:

- OpenAPI 3.0
  - [Museum Example API](https://github.com/Redocly/museum-openapi-example/blob/main/openapi.yaml)
  - [Petstore Sample OpenAPI description](https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json)
- OpenAPI 2.0
  - [Thingful OpenAPI description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingful/openapi-spec/master/spec/swagger.yaml)
  - [Fitbit Plus OpenAPI description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TwineHealth/TwineDeveloperDocs/master/spec/swagger.yaml)


### Local HTTP server

To view your Redoc CE output locally, you can simulate an HTTP server.

#### Python

To install an HTTP server with [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/):

Python 3
1. `cd` into your project directory.
2. run the following command:



```python
python3 -m http.server
```

Python 2
1. `cd` into your project directory.
2. run the following command:



```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

The output provides the local URL where you can access the preview.

To exit the preview, press control+C.

#### Node.js

To install `http-server` with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

1. In your CLI, in your project directory, run the the following command:



```bash
npx http-server
```

1. After the installation completes, run:



```bash
http-server
```

The output provides the local URL where you can access the preview.

To exit the preview, press control+C.
