# `aiAssistant`

By default, users can access the AI assistant by using the floating **Ask AI** button in the bottom-right corner or through the **Search** modal in the top navigation bar.

Use the `aiAssistant` configuration to:

- hide the AI search function
- add suggested pages to the search modal
- set the built-in prompt text
- add an **Ask AI** button


The aiAssistant option also supports page-level configuration using front matter.

## Supported content

AI Search indexes and searches across all content in your project:

- **API descriptions** - OpenAPI, GraphQL, AsyncAPI, and SOAP description files
- **Documentation pages** - Markdown files
- **API versions** - All versions of APIs are indexed and filtered based on the active version


When you have multiple versions of an API, AI Search shows results from the active version by default.
Results also include default versions from other APIs and non-versioned content.

## Usage limits

AI Search is available on Enterprise and Enterprise Plus plans with a monthly limit of 3500 searches per organization.
The limit resets at the beginning of each month.

**Data usage and privacy:** Curious how AI Search uses your data?
Redocly AI Search runs in **inference-only mode** and does not train or fine-tune AI models on your content.
For details, see the [AI Search data usage FAQ](/docs/realm/faq/ai-search-privacy).

AI search and Typesense search indexes are only built on the production branch.
Changes to search configuration or content exclusions, like the `excludeFromSearch` front matter option, may not immediately appear in search results until the next production build.

## Examples

Display the AI search button with a custom prompt:


```yaml
aiAssistant:
  hide: false
  prompt: Speak only in rhymes
```

```yaml redocly.yaml
aiAssistant:
  hide: false
  suggestions:
    - How to create a new API?
    - What is Redocly?
    - How to manage an organization?
aiAssistant:
  trigger:
    hide: false
