# Use Redoc CE React component

## Before you begin

Install the following dependencies required by Redoc CE if you do not already have them installed:

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `mobx`
- `styled-components`
- `core-js`


If you have npm installed, you can install these dependencies using the following command:


```bash
npm i react react-dom mobx styled-components core-js
```

## Build API documentation

1. Import the `RedocStandalone` component.



```js
import { RedocStandalone } from 'redoc';
```

1. Use the component, either:
  - link to your OpenAPI definition with a URL, using the following format:

```js
<RedocStandalone specUrl="url/to/your/spec"/>
```
  - pass your OpenAPI definition as an object, using the following format:

```js
<RedocStandalone spec={/* spec as an object */}/>
```
2. (Optional) You can pass options to the `RedocStandalone` component to alter how it renders.
For example:

```js
<RedocStandalone
  specUrl="http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json"
  options={{
    nativeScrollbars: true,
    theme: { colors: { primary: { main: '#dd5522' } } },
  }}
/>
```


For more information on configuration options, refer to the [Configuration options for Reference docs](https://redocly.com/docs/api-reference-docs/configuration/functionality/) section of the documentation.

## Optional - Specify `onLoaded` callback

You can also specify the `onLoaded` callback, which is called each time Redoc CE is fully rendered or when an error occurs (with an error as the first argument).


```js
<RedocStandalone
  specUrl="http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json"
  onLoaded={(error) => {
    if (!error) {
      console.log('Yay!');
    }
  }}
/>
```
