# Eject components in Reunite

Ejecting a component creates a copy of its source code in your project, where you can modify the component's styles, structure, or behavior.
This guide provides instructions on how to eject and override components in the Reunite editor.

## Identify a component to eject

Before you can eject a component, you need to know what component to eject.
One way to identify a component to eject, is by inspecting the UI element [using the browser developer tools](/docs/realm/customization/eject-components#find-components-with-browser-dev-tools).
Otherwise, to see all components that can be ejected, you can open `Theme components` section in the `Editor` tab.
You can also use search or expand each folder to see which components could be ejected.

## Eject a component

Once you have determined you need to eject a component and you have determined which component to eject, you can eject components in the Reunite editor.

To eject a component in the Reunite editor:

1. Select **Editor** on the left side navigation.
2. Click **Theme components** in the **Files** section.
3. Find the component you would like to eject and click the eject icon.


The ejected component is added to the `@theme` folder, where you can modify it.

## Update ejected component

To update an ejected component:

1. Rename the component's folder in the file tree to make a backup.
2. Eject the component again.
3. Using your backup, re-apply the customization.
4. Delete the backup folder.


## Delete ejected component

If you change your mind and no longer want an ejected component in your project, you can delete the component and it is replaced with the default component.

To revert the ejected component and use the default one, complete the following steps:

1. Select **Editor** on the left side navigation.
2. Click **Theme components** in the **Files** section.
3. Click the **Ejected** folder.
4. Click the **Delete ejected component** icon.
5. Click **Delete** in the confirmation dialog.


The component is removed from the `@theme` folder and the default component is used instead.
You can also delete components from `@theme` folder manually.
