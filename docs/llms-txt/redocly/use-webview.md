# Use the Webview

The Webview pane in the Editor displays a preview for each branch.
Any time you make a change in the Editor, the change is reflected in the Webview.
You can disable auto-sync, view different screen sizes, reload the page or restart, navigate the pages, and close the Webview to expand the Editor.

Webview buttons
There is a difference between the **Webview** and the **[preview deployment](/docs/realm/reunite/project/use-previews)**.
The Webview displays uncommitted changes while the preview deployment triggers when you make a commit to a branch with an open pull request.

## View different screen sizes

If you want to see how a page renders on different screen sizes, click the **Toggle device view** icon.

You can close the Webview by clicking the panel toggle, which changes direction after you click it.
