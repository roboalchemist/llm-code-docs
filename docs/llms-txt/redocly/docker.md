# Use Redoc CE Docker image

Redoc CE is available as a pre-built Docker image in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/redocly/redoc/).

## Before you begin

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

## Build API documentation

1. Pull the image with the following command:



```bash
docker pull redocly/redoc
```

1. Run the image:



```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 redocly/redoc
```

The preview starts on port 8080, based on the port used in the command.
You can access the preview at `http://localhost:8080`.

To exit the preview, press control+C.

## Change the OpenAPI description URL

By default, Redoc CE starts with a demo Swagger Petstore OpenAPI description file located at http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json.

To change the description URL:

- Pass the URL to your description in the `SPEC_URL` environment variable.


For example:


```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -e SPEC_URL=https://api.example.com/openapi.json redocly/redoc
```

## Create a Dockerfile

You can also create a Dockerfile with predefined environment variables.
Check out a sample [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/main/config/docker/Dockerfile) in our code repo.
