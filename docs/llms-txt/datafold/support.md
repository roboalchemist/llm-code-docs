### Grant access to Datafold's team for troubleshooting

For faster resolution of support issues, you can temporarily grant Datafold Support access to your account. This enables a Datafold team member to view the same in-app context as you, minimizing back-and-forth communication.

To grant access:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Org Settings**.
2. Check the box next to *"Allow Datafold access to your account for troubleshooting purposes."*

To revoke access, simply uncheck the box at any time.

<Info>
  **Note:** Admin privileges are required to modify this setting in Org Settings.
