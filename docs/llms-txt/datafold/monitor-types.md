# Monitor Types

> Monitoring your data for unexpected changes is one of the cornerstones of data observability.

Datafold supports all your monitoring needs through a variety of different monitor types:

1. [**Data Diff**](/data-monitoring/monitors/data-diff-monitors) → Detect differences between any two datasets, within or across databases
2. [**Metric**](/data-monitoring/monitors/metric-monitors) → Identify anomalies in standard metrics like row count, freshness, and cardinality, or in any custom metric
3. [**Data Test**](/data-monitoring/monitors/data-test-monitors) → Validate your data with business rules and see specific records that fail your tests
4. [**Schema Change**](/data-monitoring/monitors/schema-change-monitors) → Receive alerts when a table schema changes

If you need help creating your first few monitors, deciding which type of monitor to use in a particular situation, or developing an overall monitoring strategy, please reach out via email ([support@datafold.com](mailto:support@datafold.com)) and our team of experts will be happy to assist.
