## API Credits Costs

### Tavily Search

Your [search depth](/api-reference/endpoint/search#body-search-depth) determines the cost of your request.

* **Basic Search (`basic`):**
  Each request costs **1 API credit**.

* **Advanced Search (`advanced`):**
  Each request costs **2 API credits**.

### Tavily Extract

The number of successful URL extractions and your [extraction depth](/api-reference/endpoint/extract#body-extract-depth) determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a URL extraction fails.

* **Basic Extract (`basic`):**
  Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **1 API credit**

* **Advanced Extract (`advanced`):**
  Every 5 successful URL extractions cost **2 API credits**

### Tavily Map

The number of pages mapped and whether or not natural-language [instructions](/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/map#instructions) are specified determines the cost of your request. You never get charged if a map request fails.

* **Regular Mapping:**
  Every 10 successful pages returned cost **1 API credit**

* **Map with (`instructions`):**
  Every 10 successful pages returned cost **2 API credits**

### Tavily Crawl

Tavily Crawl combines both mapping and extraction operations, so the cost is the sum of both:

* **Crawl Cost = Mapping Cost + Extraction Cost**

For example:

* If you crawl 10 pages with basic extraction depth, you'll be charged **1 credit for mapping** (10 pages) + **2 credits for extraction** (10 successful extractions ÷ 5) = **3 total credits**
* If you crawl 10 pages with advanced extraction depth, you'll be charged **1 credit for mapping** + **4 credits for extraction** = **5 total credits**

### Tavily Research

Tavily Research follows a dynamic
pricing model with minimum and maximum credit consumption boundaries associated
with each request. The minimum and maximum boundaries differ based on if the
request uses `model=mini` or `model=pro`.

| Request Cost Boundaries | model=pro   | model=mini  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Per-request minimum     | 15 credits  | 4 credits   |
| Per-request maximum     | 250 credits | 110 credits |
