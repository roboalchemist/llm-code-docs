## Use cases

### Using TAVILY\_WEB\_SEARCH in Snowsight

1. After installation in the app page, you can click on ***Open Worksheet*** to pop up a Snowflake worksheet with a pre-loaded SQL query to use Tavily web search.

2. Make sure to select the appropriate database for your worksheet. In the top right, ensure the database is `TAVILY_SEARCH_API` and the schema is `TAVILY_SCHEMA`.

3. Now you can click the ***Run*** button on the top left of your worksheet to run the query.

SQL Procedure: `TAVILY_SCHEMA.TAVILY_WEB_SEARCH`

**Parameters:**

* `QUERY` (VARCHAR): The search query in natural language

* `SEARCH_DEPTH` (VARCHAR, optional): `'basic'` (default) or `'advanced'`

* `MAX_RESULTS` (INTEGER, optional): Maximum number of results (default: 5)

**Example:**

```sql  theme={null}
CALL TAVILY_SCHEMA.TAVILY_WEB_SEARCH('latest Quantum computing trends', 'advanced', 10);
```

**Data Enrichment**:
With this setup, you can enhance your Snowflake database with up-to-date information from the web, enabling you to fill your data warehouse with real-world data and keep your analytics current with the latest trends and events.

`For example`: During data analysis in your Snowflake environment, you may discover records with missing, null, or outdated values, such as incomplete company details, stale product information, or missing metadata. Instead of filling these gaps manually, you can leverage the `TAVILY_WEB_SEARCH` stored procedure to automatically query reliable sources on the web. This allows you to fetch the most current information available and enrich your dataset directly within Snowflake, improving data completeness, accuracy, and overall analytical value.

### Using TAVILY\_WEB\_SEARCH in Snowflake Intelligence

1. **Set up Snowflake Intelligence**: Follow the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/snowflake-intelligence) to set up Snowflake Intelligence. Make sure you have the snowflake\_intelligence database, required schema and GRANTs before proceeding to the next steps.

2. **Create an Agent**: In the Snowsight UI sidebar, navigate to the ***Agents*** admin page under ***AI & ML***, click on ***create agent*** and provide agent object name, display name and create the agent.

3. **Add the TAVILY\_WEB\_SEARCH Custom Tool**: Within the current agent's menu bar, navigate to the ***Tools*** section and click on ***+Add*** in Custom tools.

   * Select the Resource type as ***Procedure***

   * Select the database and schema: `TAVILY_SEARCH_API.TAVILY_SCHEMA`

   * Select the custom tool identifier: `TAVILY_SEARCH_API.TAVILY_SCHEMA.TAVILY_WEB_SEARCH`

   * Give your tool a descriptive name

   * Configure the following parameters with their descriptions:

     * `query`: "Search query"

     * `search_depth`: "The depth of the search. It can be 'basic' or 'advanced'"

     * `max_results`: "The maximum number of search results to return. Minimum is 1 and Maximum is 20"

   * Click on ***Add*** to attach the tool to your agent

   * Make sure to click on ***Save*** in the top right corner to update the agent

4. **Use the Agent**: In the Snowsight UI sidebar, navigate to the ***Snowflake Intelligence*** landing page under ***AI & ML***, select the agent you created, and use the tool.

`Real-time AI agents`:
With Snowflake Intelligence, you can ask complex questions about your data in natural language and receive insights from your own personalized enterprise intelligence agent. To ensure those insights are both accurate and current, it’s important to ground the agent in real-time information. By integrating the `TAVILY_WEB_SEARCH` tool, you allow the agent to automatically pull fresh, relevant data from the web, thus resulting in more trustworthy analysis and more informed decision-making.
