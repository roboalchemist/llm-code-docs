Security is a top priority at Braintrust. We implement industry-leading security practices and maintain compliance with key standards to protect your data and ensure the highest levels of security for our platform.

## Trust Center

The [Trust Center](https://trust.braintrust.dev/) is the central resource for information about Braintrust's security practices, certifications, and policies. It provides up-to-date details for customers and partners.

## SOC 2 Type II

Braintrust is SOC 2 Type II compliant. This independent audit confirms that our controls related to security, availability, and confidentiality are operating effectively over time.

## Deployment Options

In addition to the managed cloud service, Braintrust offers a [hybrid deployment model](https://www.braintrust.dev/blog/hybrid-deployment). This allows customers to keep data secure within their own environment while taking advantage of Braintrust's newest UI and platform features.
