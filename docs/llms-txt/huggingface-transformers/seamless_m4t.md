# SeamlessM4T

## Overview

The SeamlessM4T model was proposed in [SeamlessM4T — Massively Multilingual & Multimodal Machine Translation](https://huggingface.co/papers/2308.11596) by the Seamless Communication team from Meta AI.

This is the **version 1** release of the model. For the updated **version 2** release, refer to the [Seamless M4T v2 docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/seamless_m4t_v2).

SeamlessM4T is a collection of models designed to provide high quality translation, allowing people from different linguistic communities to communicate effortlessly through speech and text.

SeamlessM4T enables multiple tasks without relying on separate models:

- Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST)
- Speech-to-text translation (S2TT)
- Text-to-speech translation (T2ST)
- Text-to-text translation (T2TT)
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR)

[SeamlessM4TModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TModel) can perform all the above tasks, but each task also has its own dedicated sub-model.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*What does it take to create the Babel Fish, a tool that can help individuals translate speech between any two languages? While recent breakthroughs in text-based models have pushed machine translation coverage beyond 200 languages, unified speech-to-speech translation models have yet to achieve similar strides. More specifically, conventional speech-to-speech translation systems rely on cascaded systems that perform translation progressively, putting high-performing unified systems out of reach. To address these gaps, we introduce SeamlessM4T, a single model that supports speech-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation, and automatic speech recognition for up to 100 languages. To build this, we used 1 million hours of open speech audio data to learn self-supervised speech representations with w2v-BERT 2.0. Subsequently, we created a multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations. Filtered and combined with human-labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we developed the first multilingual system capable of translating from and into English for both speech and text. On FLEURS, SeamlessM4T sets a new standard for translations into multiple target languages, achieving an improvement of 20% BLEU over the previous SOTA in direct speech-to-text translation. Compared to strong cascaded models, SeamlessM4T improves the quality of into-English translation by 1.3 BLEU points in speech-to-text and by 2.6 ASR-BLEU points in speech-to-speech. Tested for robustness, our system performs better against background noises and speaker variations in speech-to-text tasks compared to the current SOTA model. Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and added toxicity to assess translation safety. Finally, all contributions in this work are open-sourced and accessible at https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication*

## Usage

First, load the processor and a checkpoint of the model:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4TModel

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")
>>> model = SeamlessM4TModel.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")
```

You can seamlessly use this model on text or on audio, to generated either translated text or translated audio.

Here is how to use the processor to process text and audio:

```python
>>> # let's load an audio sample from an Arabic speech corpus
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset("halabi2016/arabic_speech_corpus", split="test", streaming=True)
>>> audio_sample = next(iter(dataset))["audio"]

>>> # now, process it
>>> audio_inputs = processor(audio=audio_sample["array"], return_tensors="pt")

>>> # now, process some English test as well
>>> text_inputs = processor(text = "Hello, my dog is cute", src_lang="eng", return_tensors="pt")
```

### Speech

[SeamlessM4TModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TModel) can *seamlessly* generate text or speech with few or no changes. Let's target Russian voice translation:

```python
>>> audio_array_from_text = model.generate(**text_inputs, tgt_lang="rus")[0].cpu().numpy().squeeze()
>>> audio_array_from_audio = model.generate(**audio_inputs, tgt_lang="rus")[0].cpu().numpy().squeeze()
```

With basically the same code, I've translated English text and Arabic speech to Russian speech samples.

### Text

Similarly, you can generate translated text from audio files or from text with the same model. You only have to pass `generate_speech=False` to [SeamlessM4TModel.generate()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TModel.generate).
This time, let's translate to French.

```python
>>> # from audio
>>> output_tokens = model.generate(**audio_inputs, tgt_lang="fra", generate_speech=False)
>>> translated_text_from_audio = processor.decode(output_tokens[0].tolist()[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

>>> # from text
>>> output_tokens = model.generate(**text_inputs, tgt_lang="fra", generate_speech=False)
>>> translated_text_from_text = processor.decode(output_tokens[0].tolist()[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### Tips

#### 1. Use dedicated models

[SeamlessM4TModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TModel) is transformers top level model to generate speech and text, but you can also use dedicated models that perform the task without additional components, thus reducing the memory footprint.
For example, you can replace the audio-to-audio generation snippet with the model dedicated to the S2ST task, the rest is exactly the same code:

```python
>>> from transformers import SeamlessM4TForSpeechToSpeech
>>> model = SeamlessM4TForSpeechToSpeech.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")
```

Or you can replace the text-to-text generation snippet with the model dedicated to the T2TT task, you only have to remove `generate_speech=False`.

```python
>>> from transformers import SeamlessM4TForTextToText
>>> model = SeamlessM4TForTextToText.from_pretrained("facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium")
```

Feel free to try out [SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText) and [SeamlessM4TForTextToSpeech](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TForTextToSpeech) as well.

#### 2. Change the speaker identity

You have the possibility to change the speaker used for speech synthesis with the `spkr_id` argument. Some `spkr_id` works better than other for some languages!

#### 3. Change the generation strategy

You can use different [generation strategies](./generation_strategies) for speech and text generation, e.g `.generate(input_ids=input_ids, text_num_beams=4, speech_do_sample=True)` which will successively perform beam-search decoding on the text model, and multinomial sampling on the speech model.

#### 4. Generate speech and text at the same time

Use `return_intermediate_token_ids=True` with [SeamlessM4TModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TModel) to return both speech and text !

## Model architecture

SeamlessM4T features a versatile architecture that smoothly handles the sequential generation of text and speech. This setup comprises two sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. The first model translates the input modality into translated text, while the second model generates speech tokens, known as "unit tokens," from the translated text.

Each modality has its own dedicated encoder with a unique architecture. Additionally, for speech output, a vocoder inspired by the [HiFi-GAN](https://huggingface.co/papers/2010.05646) architecture is placed on top of the second seq2seq model.

Here's how the generation process works:

- Input text or speech is processed through its specific encoder.
- A decoder creates text tokens in the desired language.
- If speech generation is required, the second seq2seq model, following a standard encoder-decoder structure, generates unit tokens.
- These unit tokens are then passed through the final vocoder to produce the actual speech.

This model was contributed by [ylacombe](https://huggingface.co/ylacombe). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication).

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **input_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_banks)`, *optional*) --
  Input audio features. This should be returned by the [SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor) class or the

- **return_intermediate_token_ids** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If `True`, also returns the intermediate generated text and unit tokens. Set to `True` if you also want
  to get translated text alongside the audio.
  Note that if `generate_speech=False`, this parameter will be ignored and
  the text tokens are returned.
- **tgt_lang** (`str`, *optional*) --
  The language to use as target language for translation.
- **spkr_id** (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0) --
  The id of the speaker used for speech synthesis. Must be lower than `config.vocoder_num_spkrs`.
- **generate_speech** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  If `False`, will only returns the text tokens and won't generate speech.

- **kwargs** (*optional*) --
  Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments that will be passed to [GenerationMixin.generate()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate). Keyword
  arguments are of two types:

  - Without a prefix, they will be entered as `**kwargs` for the `generate` method of each sub-model,
  except for `decoder_input_ids` which will only be passed through the text components.
  - With a *text_* or *speech_* prefix, they will be input for the `generate` method of the
  text model and speech model respectively. It has the priority over the keywords without a prefix.

  This means you can, for example, specify a generation strategy for one generation but not for the
  other.0`Union[SeamlessM4TGenerationOutput, tuple[Tensor], ModelOutput]`- If `generate_speech` and `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns `SeamlessM4TGenerationOutput`.
- If `generate_speech` and not `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns a tuple composed of waveforms of
  shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` and `waveform_lengths` which gives the length of each sample.
- If `generate_speech=False`, it will returns `ModelOutput`.

Generates translated token ids and/or translated audio waveforms.

This method successively calls the `.generate` function of two different sub-models. You can specify keyword
arguments at two different levels: general arguments that will be passed to both models, or prefixed arguments
that will be passed to one of them.

For example, calling `.generate(input_ids=input_ids, num_beams=4, speech_do_sample=True)` will successively
perform beam-search decoding on the text model, and multinomial beam-search sampling on the speech model.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  Bart uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
  is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

  For translation and summarization training, `decoder_input_ids` should be provided. If no
  `decoder_input_ids` is provided, the model will create this tensor by shifting the `input_ids` to the right
  for denoising pre-training following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read `modeling_bart._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`

  information on the default strategy.

  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention

  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't

  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ...,

  loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/seamless_m4t/modeling_seamless_m4t.py#L2571)

Generates sequences of token ids.

Most generation-controlling parameters are set in `generation_config` which, if not passed, will be set to the
model's default generation configuration. You can override any `generation_config` by passing the corresponding
parameters to generate(), e.g. `.generate(inputs, num_beams=4, do_sample=True)`.

For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
guide](./generation_strategies).

**Parameters:**

input_ids (`torch.Tensor` of varying shape depending on the modality, *optional*) : Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.  Indices can be obtained using [SeamlessM4TTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TTokenizer) or [SeamlessM4TProcessor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TProcessor).

[What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*) : The language to use as target language for translation.

generation_config (`~generation.GenerationConfig`, *optional*) : The generation configuration to be used as base parametrization for the generation call. `**kwargs` passed to generate matching the attributes of `generation_config` will override them. If `generation_config` is not provided, the default will be used, which had the following loading priority: 1) from the `generation_config.json` model file, if it exists; 2) from the model configuration. Please note that unspecified parameters will inherit [GenerationConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig)'s default values, whose documentation should be checked to parameterize generation.

logits_processor (`LogitsProcessorList`, *optional*) : Custom logits processors that complement the default logits processors built from arguments and generation config. If a logit processor is passed that is already created with the arguments or a generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.

stopping_criteria (`StoppingCriteriaList`, *optional*) : Custom stopping criteria that complement the default stopping criteria built from arguments and a generation config. If a stopping criteria is passed that is already created with the arguments or a generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.

prefix_allowed_tokens_fn (`Callable[[int, torch.Tensor], list[int]]`, *optional*) : If provided, this function constraints the beam search to allowed tokens only at each step. If not provided no constraint is applied. This function takes 2 arguments: the batch ID `batch_id` and `input_ids`. It has to return a list with the allowed tokens for the next generation step conditioned on the batch ID `batch_id` and the previously generated tokens `inputs_ids`. This argument is useful for constrained generation conditioned on the prefix, as described in [Autoregressive Entity Retrieval](https://huggingface.co/papers/2010.00904).

synced_gpus (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) : Whether to continue running the while loop until max_length (needed to avoid deadlocking with `FullyShardedDataParallel` and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3).

kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*) : Ad hoc parametrization of `generate_config` and/or additional model-specific kwargs that will be forwarded to the `forward` function of the model.

**Returns:**

`[ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) or `torch.LongTensor``

A [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) (if `return_dict_in_generate=True`
or when `config.return_dict_in_generate=True`) or a `torch.FloatTensor`. The possible

The [SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> import torch

>>> dataset = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_demo", "clean", split="validation")
>>> dataset = dataset.sort("id")
>>> sampling_rate = dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(""facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium"")
>>> model = SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText.from_pretrained(""facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium"")

>>> # audio file is decoded on the fly
>>> inputs = processor(dataset[0]["audio"]["array"], sampling_rate=sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt")
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits
>>> predicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

>>> # transcribe speech
>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids)
>>> transcription[0]
...

>>> inputs["labels"] = processor(text=dataset[0]["text"], return_tensors="pt").input_ids

>>> # compute loss
>>> loss = model(**inputs).loss
>>> round(loss.item(), 2)
...

#### generate[[transformers.SeamlessM4TForSpeechToText.generate]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/seamless_m4t/modeling_seamless_m4t.py#L2826)

Generates sequences of token ids.

Most generation-controlling parameters are set in `generation_config` which, if not passed, will be set to the
model's default generation configuration. You can override any `generation_config` by passing the corresponding
parameters to generate(), e.g. `.generate(inputs, num_beams=4, do_sample=True)`.

For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
guide](./generation_strategies).

**Parameters:**

input_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_banks)`) : Input audio features. This should be returned by the [SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor) class or the [SeamlessM4TProcessor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TProcessor) class. See [SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor.__call__) for details. 

tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*) : The language to use as target language for translation.

generation_config (`~generation.GenerationConfig`, *optional*) : The generation configuration to be used as base parametrization for the generation call. `**kwargs` passed to generate matching the attributes of `generation_config` will override them. If `generation_config` is not provided, the default will be used, which had the following loading priority: 1) from the `generation_config.json` model file, if it exists; 2) from the model configuration. Please note that unspecified parameters will inherit [GenerationConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig)'s default values, whose documentation should be checked to parameterize generation.

logits_processor (`LogitsProcessorList`, *optional*) : Custom logits processors that complement the default logits processors built from arguments and generation config. If a logit processor is passed that is already created with the arguments or a generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.

stopping_criteria (`StoppingCriteriaList`, *optional*) : Custom stopping criteria that complement the default stopping criteria built from arguments and a generation config. If a stopping criteria is passed that is already created with the arguments or a generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.

prefix_allowed_tokens_fn (`Callable[[int, torch.Tensor], list[int]]`, *optional*) : If provided, this function constraints the beam search to allowed tokens only at each step. If not provided no constraint is applied. This function takes 2 arguments: the batch ID `batch_id` and `input_ids`. It has to return a list with the allowed tokens for the next generation step conditioned on the batch ID `batch_id` and the previously generated tokens `inputs_ids`. This argument is useful for constrained generation conditioned on the prefix, as described in [Autoregressive Entity Retrieval](https://huggingface.co/papers/2010.00904).

synced_gpus (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) : Whether to continue running the while loop until max_length (needed to avoid deadlocking with `FullyShardedDataParallel` and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3).

kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*) : Ad hoc parametrization of `generate_config` and/or additional model-specific kwargs that will be forwarded to the `forward` function of the model.

**Returns:**

`[ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) or `torch.LongTensor``

A [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) (if `return_dict_in_generate=True`
or when `config.return_dict_in_generate=True`) or a `torch.FloatTensor`. The possible

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [~SeamlessM4TModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TModel). It is used to instantiate an
SeamlessM4T model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the SeamlessM4T
["facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium"](https://huggingface.co/"facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium") architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

>>> configuration = SeamlessM4TConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the "facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium" style configuration
>>> model = SeamlessM4TModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

Construct a SeamlessM4T tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library). Based on
[BPE](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/components.html?highlight=bpe#models).

This tokenizer inherits from [TokenizersBackend](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend) which contains most of the main methods. Users should
refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

The tokenization method is `  ` for source language documents, and `   ` for target language documents.

Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import SeamlessM4TTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = SeamlessM4TTokenizer.from_pretrained(
...     "facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium", src_lang="eng", tgt_lang="fra"
... )
>>> example_english_phrase = " UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria"
>>> expected_translation_french = "Le chef de l'ONU affirme qu'il n'y a pas de solution militaire en Syrie."
>>> inputs = tokenizer(example_english_phrase, text_target=expected_translation_french, return_tensors="pt")

- **padding** (`bool`, `str` or [PaddingStrategy](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.utils.PaddingStrategy), *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
  index) among:

  - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
    sequence if provided).

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py#L1335)

Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added.

For fast tokenizers, data collators call this with `already_has_special_tokens=True` to build a mask over an
already-formatted sequence. In that case, we compute the mask by checking membership in `all_special_ids`.

**Parameters:**

token_ids_0 : List of IDs for the (possibly already formatted) sequence.

token_ids_1 : Unused when `already_has_special_tokens=True`. Must be None in that case.

already_has_special_tokens : Whether the sequence is already formatted with special tokens.

  list of strings (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized),
  you must set `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
- **padding** (`bool`, `str` or [PaddingStrategy](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.utils.PaddingStrategy), *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
  index) among:

  - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
    sequence if provided).
  - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
    acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
  - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
    lengths).
- **pad_to_multiple_of** (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`) --
  If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

  This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
  `>= 7.5` (Volta).

When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.   

eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The end of sequence token.    When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.   

sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last token of a sequence built with special tokens.

cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.

unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this token instead.

pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/seamless_m4t/feature_extraction_seamless_m4t.py#L38)

Constructs a SeamlessM4T feature extractor.

This feature extractor inherits from [SequenceFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/feature_extractor#transformers.SequenceFeatureExtractor) which contains most of the main methods. Users
should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

This class extracts mel-filter bank features from raw speech.

  a torch tensor, a list of float values, a list of numpy arrays, a list of torch tensors,
  a list of list of float values or a list of a list of list of float values.
  If `raw_speech` is a one-dimensional `np.ndarray`, `torch.Tensor` or a `list[float]`, `raw_speech` is
  considered a single-channel, single-sample sound. In all other cases, the first dimension of
  `raw_speech`, whether from an `np.ndarray`, a `torch.Tensor` or a `list[...]`,
  corresponds to the number of samples in the batch, and the number of channels
  (i.e. mono or stereo character) is derived from the other dimensions
  (1D -> single-channel waveform batches; 2D-> stereo-channel waveform batches).
- **padding** (`bool`, `str` or [PaddingStrategy](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.utils.PaddingStrategy), *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
  index) among:

  - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
    acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
  - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
    lengths).
- **pad_to_multiple_of** (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2) --
  If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

  This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
  `>= 7.5` (Volta), or on TPUs which benefit from having sequence lengths be a multiple of 128.

  For SeamlessM4T models, `attention_mask` should always be passed for batched inference, to avoid subtle
  bugs.

  

- **return_tensors** (`str` or [TensorType](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.TensorType), *optional*) --
  If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

  - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
  - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.
- **sampling_rate** (`int`, *optional*) --
  The sampling rate at which the `raw_speech` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
  `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors.

  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  Bart uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
  is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

  For translation and summarization training, `decoder_input_ids` should be provided. If no
  `decoder_input_ids` is provided, the model will create this tensor by shifting the `input_ids` to the right
  for denoising pre-training following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read `modeling_bart._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`
  and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more
  information on the default strategy.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple[tuple[torch.FloatTensor]]`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  labels (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ...,
  config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the
  loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ...,
  config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or a tuple of

The [SeamlessM4TTextToUnitForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TTextToUnitForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

**Parameters:**

config ([SeamlessM4TConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t#transformers.SeamlessM4TConfig)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

embed_tokens_decoder (`nn.Embedding`, *optional*) : input embedding of the decoder.
