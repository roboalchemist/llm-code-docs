# Moshi

## Overview

The Moshi model was proposed in [Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.00037) by Alexandre Défossez, Laurent Mazaré, Manu Orsini, Amélie Royer, Patrick Pérez, Hervé Jégou, Edouard Grave and Neil Zeghidour.

Moshi is a speech-text foundation model that casts spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. Moshi also predicts time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. This “Inner Monologue” method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech and provides streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. As a result, Moshi is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning— such as emotion or non-speech sounds— is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this “Inner Monologue” method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.*

Moshi deals with 3 streams of information:

1. The user's audio
2. Moshi's audio
3. Moshi's textual output

Similarly to [~MusicgenModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenModel), audio is represented with audio codebooks, which can be interpreted like tokens. The main difference between text tokens and audio codebooks is that audio codebooks introduce an additional dimension of information.
Text tokens are typically of dim `(batch_size, sequence_length)` but audio tokens are of dim `(batch_size, num_codebooks, sequence_length)`.

Moshi's made of 3 components:

**1. The main decoder (Helium in the paper)**

It corresponds to [MoshiForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiForCausalLM). It is strictly a classic text LLM, that uses an architecture similar to [~GemmaForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/gemma#transformers.GemmaForCausalLM). In other words, it takes text tokens, embeds them, pass them through the decoder and a language head, to get text logits.

**2. The depth decoder**

On its own, it's also a classic LLM, but this time, instead of generating over the time dimension, it generates over the codebook dimension.

It also means that its context length is `num_codebooks`, thus it can't generate more than `num_codebooks`.

Note that each timestamp - i.e each codebook - gets its own set of Linear Layers and Embeddings.

**3. [MimiModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/mimi#transformers.MimiModel)**

It's the audio encoder from Kyutai, that has recently been integrated to transformers, which is used to "tokenize" audio. It has the same use that [~EncodecModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel) has in [~MusicgenModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenModel).

## Tips

The original checkpoints can be converted using the conversion script `src/transformers/models/moshi/convert_moshi_transformers.py`

### How to use the model

This implementation has two main aims:

1. quickly test model generation by simplifying the original API
2. simplify training. A training guide will come soon, but user contributions are welcomed!

It is designed for intermediate use. We strongly recommend using the original [implementation](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi) to infer the model in real-time streaming.

**1. Model generation**

Moshi is a streaming auto-regressive model with two streams of audio. To put it differently, one audio stream corresponds to what the model said/will say and the other audio stream corresponds to what the user said/will say.

[MoshiForConditionalGeneration.generate()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiForConditionalGeneration.generate) thus needs 3 inputs:

1. `input_ids` - corresponding to the text token history
2. `moshi_input_values` or `moshi_audio_codes`- corresponding to the model audio history
3. `user_input_values` or `user_audio_codes` - corresponding to the user audio history

These three inputs must be synchronized. Meaning that their lengths must correspond to the same number of tokens.

You can dynamically use the 3 inputs depending on what you want to test:

1. Simply check the model response to an user prompt - in that case, `input_ids` can be filled with pad tokens and `user_input_values` can be a zero tensor of the same shape than the user prompt.
2. Test more complex behaviour - in that case, you must be careful about how the input tokens are synchronized with the audios.

The original model is synchronized text with audio by padding the text in between each token enunciation.

To follow the example of the following image, `"Hello, I'm Moshi"` could be transformed to `"Hello,I'm Moshi"`.

[MoshiForConditionalGeneration.generate()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiForConditionalGeneration.generate) then auto-regressively feeds to itself its own audio stream, but since it doesn't have access to the user input stream while using `transformers`, it will thus **assume that the user is producing blank audio**.

```python
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
>>> import torch, math
>>> from transformers import MoshiForConditionalGeneration, AutoFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer
from accelerate import Accelerator

>>> librispeech_dummy = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")
>>> feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("kyutai/moshiko-pytorch-bf16")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("kyutai/moshiko-pytorch-bf16")
>>> device = Accelerator().device
>>> dtype = torch.bfloat16

>>> # prepare user input audio 
>>> librispeech_dummy = librispeech_dummy.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate))
>>> audio_sample = librispeech_dummy[-1]["audio"]["array"]
>>> user_input_values = feature_extractor(raw_audio=audio_sample, sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt").to(device=device, dtype=dtype)

>>> # prepare moshi input values - we suppose moshi didn't say anything while the user spoke
>>> moshi_input_values = torch.zeros_like(user_input_values.input_values)

>>> # prepare moshi input ids - we suppose moshi didn't say anything while the user spoke
>>> num_tokens = math.ceil(moshi_input_values.shape[-1] * waveform_to_token_ratio)
>>> input_ids = torch.ones((1, num_tokens), device=device, dtype=torch.int64) * tokenizer.encode("")[0]

>>> # generate 25 new tokens (around 2s of audio)
>>> output = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids, user_input_values=user_input_values.input_values, moshi_input_values=moshi_input_values, max_new_tokens=25)

>>> text_tokens = output.sequences
>>> audio_waveforms = output.audio_sequences
```

**2. Model training**

Most of the work has to be done during data creation/pre-processing, because of the need to align/synchronize streams.

Once it's done, you can simply forward `text_labels` and `audio_labels` to [MoshiForConditionalGeneration.forward()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiForConditionalGeneration.forward), alongside the usual inputs, to get the model loss.

A training guide will come soon, but user contributions are welcomed!

### How does the model forward the inputs / generate

1. The input streams are embedded and combined into `inputs_embeds`.

2. `inputs_embeds` is passed through the main decoder, which processes it like a normal LLM would.

3. The main decoder outputs `text logits` but also its `last hidden state` which is called `temporal context` in the paper.

3. The depth decoder switches the dimension on which we forward / generate (codebooks instead of time). It uses the token generated from `text logits`  and the `temporal context` to auto-regressively generate audio codebooks.

This model was contributed by [Yoach Lacombe (ylacombe)](https://huggingface.co/ylacombe).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).

  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast) or a tuple of

elements depending on the configuration ([MoshiConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiConfig)) and inputs.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **past_key_values** (`Cache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values`
  input) to speed up sequential decoding.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
The [MoshiModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

**Parameters:**

config ([MoshiConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/moshi#transformers.MoshiConfig)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.

The Moshi decoder model with a text language modelling head on top. Only usable for text.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ...,
  config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
- **logits_to_keep** (`Union[int, torch.Tensor]`, defaults to `0`) --
  If an `int`, compute logits for the last `logits_to_keep` tokens. If `0`, calculate logits for all
  `input_ids` (special case). Only last token logits are needed for generation, and calculating them only for that
  token can save memory, which becomes pretty significant for long sequences or large vocabulary size.
  If a `torch.Tensor`, must be 1D corresponding to the indices to keep in the sequence length dimension.
  This is useful when using packed tensor format (single dimension for batch and sequence length).0`transformers.models.moshi.modeling_moshi.MoshiCausalLMOutputWithPast` or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A `transformers.models.moshi.modeling_moshi.MoshiCausalLMOutputWithPast` or a tuple of

#### generate[[transformers.MoshiForConditionalGeneration.generate]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/moshi/modeling_moshi.py#L1914)

Generates sequences of text token ids and audio tokens ids.

**Parameters:**

input_ids (`torch.Tensor `of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length), *optional*) : The sequence used as a text prompt for the generation.

user_input_values (`torch.Tensor `of shape `(batch_size, 1, audio_sequence_length), *optional*) : The audio waveforms used as audio user prompt for the generation.

user_audio_codes (`torch.Tensor `of shape `(batch_size, num_codebooks, sequence_length), *optional*) : The audio codes used as audio user prompt for the generation. Has priority over `user_input_values` and represents the audio "tokens" of `user_input_values` once passed through the audio encoder.

moshi_input_values (`torch.Tensor `of shape `(batch_size, 1, audio_sequence_length), *optional*) : The audio waveforms used as audio Moshi prompt for the generation.

moshi_audio_codes (`torch.Tensor `of shape `(batch_size, num_codebooks, sequence_length), *optional*) : The audio codes used as audio Moshi prompt for the generation. Has priority over `moshi_input_values` and represents the audio "tokens" of `moshi_input_values` once passed through the audio encoder.

inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) : Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` and the audio inputs you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert the inputs into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

return_audio_waveforms (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : If `False`, won't generate the audio waveforms.

return_audio_codes (`bool`, *optional*) : If `True`, will also returns the generated audio codes, i.e the intermediate audio "tokens" which transforms to `audio_sequences` once passed through the audio decoder.

concat_unconditional_inputs (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : If `False`, won't concatenate initial audio and text tokens.

kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*) : Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments that are passed to the `generate` method. Refers to the original [`generate` docstrings](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate) for more information on how to use them. Note that keywords with a *depth_* prefix will be input for the `generate` method of the depth decoder. Otherwise, the latter will use its default generation config.

**Returns:**

`MoshiConditionalGenerationGenerateOutput`
#### get_unconditional_inputs[[transformers.MoshiForConditionalGeneration.get_unconditional_inputs]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/moshi/modeling_moshi.py#L2381)

Helper function to get null inputs for unconditional generation, enabling the model to be used without the
feature extractor or tokenizer.

Example:
```python
>>> from transformers import MoshiForConditionalGeneration

>>> model = MoshiForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("kmhf/hf-moshiko-pytorch-bf16")

>>> # get the unconditional (or 'null') inputs for the model
>>> unconditional_inputs = model.get_unconditional_inputs(num_samples=1)
>>> audio_samples = model.generate(**unconditional_inputs, max_new_tokens=256)
```

**Parameters:**

num_samples (int, *optional*) : Number of audio samples to unconditionally generate.

max_new_tokens (int, *optional*) : Number of tokens to generate for each sample. More tokens means longer audio samples, at the expense of longer inference (since more audio tokens need to be generated per sample).
