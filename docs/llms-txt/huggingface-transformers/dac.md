# DAC

## Overview

The DAC model was proposed in [Descript Audio Codec: High-Fidelity Audio Compression with Improved RVQGAN](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.06546) by Rithesh Kumar, Prem Seetharaman, Alejandro Luebs, Ishaan Kumar, Kundan Kumar.

The Descript Audio Codec (DAC) model is a powerful tool for compressing audio data, making it highly efficient for storage and transmission. By compressing 44.1 KHz audio into tokens at just 8kbps bandwidth, the DAC model enables high-quality audio processing while significantly reducing the data footprint. This is particularly useful in scenarios where bandwidth is limited or storage space is at a premium, such as in streaming applications, remote conferencing, and archiving large audio datasets.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Language models have been successfully used to model natural signals, such as images, speech, and music. A key component of these models is a high quality neural compression model that can compress high-dimensional natural signals into lower dimensional discrete tokens. To that end, we introduce a high-fidelity universal neural audio compression algorithm that achieves ~90x compression of 44.1 KHz audio into tokens at just 8kbps bandwidth. We achieve this by combining advances in high-fidelity audio generation with better vector quantization techniques from the image domain, along with improved adversarial and reconstruction losses. We compress all domains (speech, environment, music, etc.) with a single universal model, making it widely applicable to generative modeling of all audio. We compare with competing audio compression algorithms, and find our method outperforms them significantly. We provide thorough ablations for every design choice, as well as open-source code and trained model weights. We hope our work can lay the foundation for the next generation of high-fidelity audio modeling.*

## Model structure

The Descript Audio Codec (DAC) model is structured into three distinct stages:

1. Encoder Model: This stage compresses the input audio, reducing its size while retaining essential information.
2. Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) Model: Working in tandem with the encoder, this model quantizes the latent codes of the audio, refining the compression and ensuring high-quality reconstruction.
3. Decoder Model: This final stage reconstructs the audio from its compressed form, restoring it to a state that closely resembles the original input.

## Usage example

Here is a quick example of how to encode and decode an audio using this model:

```python
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
>>> from transformers import DacModel, AutoProcessor
>>> librispeech_dummy = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")

>>> model = DacModel.from_pretrained("descript/dac_16khz")
>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("descript/dac_16khz")
>>> librispeech_dummy = librispeech_dummy.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=processor.sampling_rate))
>>> audio_sample = librispeech_dummy[-1]["audio"]["array"]
>>> inputs = processor(raw_audio=audio_sample, sampling_rate=processor.sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt")

>>> encoder_outputs = model.encode(inputs["input_values"])
>>> # Get the intermediate audio codes
>>> audio_codes = encoder_outputs.audio_codes
>>> # Reconstruct the audio from its quantized representation
>>> audio_values = model.decode(encoder_outputs.quantized_representation)
>>> # or the equivalent with a forward pass
>>> audio_values = model(inputs["input_values"]).audio_values
```

#### transformers.DacConfig[[transformers.DacConfig]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/dac/configuration_dac.py#L28)

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of an [DacModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/dac#transformers.DacModel). It is used to instantiate a
Dac model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the
[descript/dac_16khz](https://huggingface.co/descript/dac_16khz) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import DacModel, DacConfig

>>> # Initializing a "descript/dac_16khz" style configuration
>>> configuration = DacConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the "descript/dac_16khz" style configuration
>>> model = DacModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

    lengths).
- **truncation** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Activates truncation to cut input sequences longer than `max_length` to `max_length`.
- **max_length** (`int`, *optional*) --

The DAC (Descript Audio Codec) model.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  representation of the input. This parameter should be provided if you want
  to decode directly from the audio codes (it will overwrite quantized_representation).
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether to return a `DacDecoderOutput` instead of a plain tuple.0

**Parameters:**

config ([DacConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/dac#transformers.DacConfig)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.
#### encode[[transformers.DacModel.encode]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/dac/modeling_dac.py#L580)

**Parameters:**

input_values (`torch.Tensor of shape `(batch_size, 1, time_steps)`) : Input audio data to encode,

n_quantizers (`int`, *optional*) : Number of quantizers to use. If None, all quantizers are used. Default is None.

return_dict (`bool`, *optional*) : Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
#### forward[[transformers.DacModel.forward]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0rc1/src/transformers/models/dac/modeling_dac.py#L640)

The [DacModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/model_doc/dac#transformers.DacModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Examples:

```python
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Audio
>>> from transformers import DacModel, AutoProcessor
>>> librispeech_dummy = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")

>>> model = DacModel.from_pretrained("descript/dac_16khz")
>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("descript/dac_16khz")
>>> librispeech_dummy = librispeech_dummy.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=processor.sampling_rate))
>>> audio_sample = librispeech_dummy[-1]["audio"]["array"]
>>> inputs = processor(raw_audio=audio_sample, sampling_rate=processor.sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt")

>>> encoder_outputs = model.encode(inputs["input_values"])
>>> # Get the intermediate audio codes
>>> audio_codes = encoder_outputs.audio_codes
>>> # Reconstruct the audio from its quantized representation
>>> audio_values = model.decode(encoder_outputs.quantized_representation)
>>> # or the equivalent with a forward pass
>>> audio_values = model(inputs["input_values"]).audio_values
```

**Parameters:**

input_values (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, 1, time_steps)`) : Audio data to encode.

n_quantizers (`int`, *optional*) : Number of quantizers to use. If `None`, all quantizers are used. Default is `None`.

return_dict (`bool`, *optional*) : Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0rc1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
