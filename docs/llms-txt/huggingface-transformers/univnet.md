# UnivNet

## Overview

The UnivNet model was proposed in [UnivNet: A Neural Vocoder with Multi-Resolution Spectrogram Discriminators for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation](https://huggingface.co/papers/2106.07889) by Won Jang, Dan Lim, Jaesam Yoon, Bongwan Kin, and Juntae Kim.
The UnivNet model is a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained to synthesize high fidelity speech waveforms. The UnivNet model shared in `transformers` is the *generator*, which maps a conditioning log-mel spectrogram and optional noise sequence to a speech waveform (e.g. a vocoder). Only the generator is required for inference. The *discriminator* used to train the `generator` is not implemented.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Most neural vocoders employ band-limited mel-spectrograms to generate waveforms. If full-band spectral features are used as the input, the vocoder can be provided with as much acoustic information as possible. However, in some models employing full-band mel-spectrograms, an over-smoothing problem occurs as part of which non-sharp spectrograms are generated. To address this problem, we propose UnivNet, a neural vocoder that synthesizes high-fidelity waveforms in real time. Inspired by works in the field of voice activity detection, we added a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs multiple linear spectrogram magnitudes computed using various parameter sets. Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input, we expect to generate high-resolution signals by adding a discriminator that employs spectrograms of multiple resolutions as the input. In an evaluation on a dataset containing information on hundreds of speakers, UnivNet obtained the best objective and subjective results among competing models for both seen and unseen speakers. These results, including the best subjective score for text-to-speech, demonstrate the potential for fast adaptation to new speakers without a need for training from scratch.*

Tips:

- The `noise_sequence` argument for [UnivNetModel.forward()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetModel.forward) should be standard Gaussian noise (such as from `torch.randn`) of shape `([batch_size], noise_length, model.config.model_in_channels)`, where `noise_length` should match the length dimension (dimension 1) of the `input_features` argument. If not supplied, it will be randomly generated; a `torch.Generator` can be supplied to the `generator` argument so that the forward pass can be reproduced. (Note that [UnivNetFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetFeatureExtractor) will return generated noise by default, so it shouldn't be necessary to generate `noise_sequence` manually.)
- Padding added by [UnivNetFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetFeatureExtractor) can be removed from the [UnivNetModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetModel) output through the `UnivNetFeatureExtractor.batch_decode()` method, as shown in the usage example below.
- Padding the end of each waveform with silence can reduce artifacts at the end of the generated audio sample. This can be done by supplying `pad_end = True` to [UnivNetFeatureExtractor.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetFeatureExtractor.__call__). See [this issue](https://github.com/seungwonpark/melgan/issues/8) for more details.

Usage Example:

```python
import torch
from scipy.io.wavfile import write
from datasets import Audio, load_dataset

from transformers import UnivNetFeatureExtractor, UnivNetModel

model_id_or_path = "dg845/univnet-dev"
model = UnivNetModel.from_pretrained(model_id_or_path)
feature_extractor = UnivNetFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_id_or_path)

ds = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")
# Resample the audio to the model and feature extractor's sampling rate.
ds = ds.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate))
# Pad the end of the converted waveforms to reduce artifacts at the end of the output audio samples.
inputs = feature_extractor(
    ds[0]["audio"]["array"], sampling_rate=ds[0]["audio"]["sampling_rate"], pad_end=True, return_tensors="pt"
)

with torch.no_grad():
    audio = model(**inputs)

# Remove the extra padding at the end of the output.
audio = feature_extractor.batch_decode(**audio)[0]
# Convert to wav file
write("sample_audio.wav", feature_extractor.sampling_rate, audio)
```

This model was contributed by [dg845](https://huggingface.co/dg845).
To the best of my knowledge, there is no official code release, but an unofficial implementation can be found at [maum-ai/univnet](https://github.com/maum-ai/univnet) with pretrained checkpoints [here](https://github.com/maum-ai/univnet#pre-trained-model).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [UnivNetModel](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetModel). It is used to instantiate a
UnivNet vocoder model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the UnivNet
[dg845/univnet-dev](https://huggingface.co/dg845/univnet-dev) architecture, which corresponds to the 'c32'
architecture in [maum-ai/univnet](https://github.com/maum-ai/univnet/blob/master/config/default_c32.yaml).

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import UnivNetModel, UnivNetConfig

>>> # Initializing a Tortoise TTS style configuration
>>> configuration = UnivNetConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the Tortoise TTS style configuration
>>> model = UnivNetModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

#### transformers.UnivNetFeatureExtractor[[transformers.UnivNetFeatureExtractor]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.0.0/src/transformers/models/univnet/feature_extraction_univnet.py#L29)

Constructs a UnivNet feature extractor.

This class extracts log-mel-filter bank features from raw speech using the short time Fourier Transform (STFT). The
STFT implementation follows that of TacoTron 2 and Hifi-GAN.

This feature extractor inherits from [SequenceFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/main_classes/feature_extractor#transformers.SequenceFeatureExtractor) which contains
most of the main methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

  The sequence or batch of sequences to be padded. Each sequence can be a numpy array, a list of float
  values, a list of numpy arrays or a list of list of float values. Must be mono channel audio, not
  stereo, i.e. single float per timestep.
- **sampling_rate** (`int`, *optional*) --
  The sampling rate at which the `raw_speech` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
  `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors and allow automatic speech recognition
  pipeline.
- **padding** (`bool`, `str` or [PaddingStrategy](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.utils.PaddingStrategy), *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Select a strategy to pad the input `raw_speech` waveforms (according to the model's padding side and
  padding index) among:

  - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
    sequence if provided).
  - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
    acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
  - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
    lengths).

  If `pad_end = True`, that padding will occur before the `padding` strategy is applied.
- **max_length** (`int`, *optional*) --
  Maximum length of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).
- **truncation** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Activates truncation to cut input sequences longer than `max_length` to `max_length`.
- **pad_to_multiple_of** (`int`, *optional*) --
  If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

  This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
  `>= 7.5` (Volta), or on TPUs which benefit from having sequence lengths be a multiple of 128.
- **return_noise** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether to generate and return a noise waveform for use in [UnivNetModel.forward()](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/univnet#transformers.UnivNetModel.forward).
- **generator** (`numpy.random.Generator`, *optional*, defaults to `None`) --
  An optional `numpy.random.Generator` random number generator to use when generating noise.
- **pad_end** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether to pad the end of each waveform with silence. This can help reduce artifacts at the end of the
  generated audio sample; see https://github.com/seungwonpark/melgan/issues/8 for more details. This
  padding will be done before the padding strategy specified in `padding` is performed.
- **pad_length** (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`) --
  If padding the end of each waveform, the length of the padding in spectrogram frames. If not set, this
  will default to `self.config.pad_end_length`.
- **do_normalize** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether to perform Tacotron 2 normalization on the input. Normalizing can help to significantly improve
  the performance for some models. If not set, this will default to `self.config.do_normalize`.
- **return_attention_mask** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether to return the attention mask. If left to the default, will return the attention mask according
  to the specific feature_extractor's default.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

- **return_tensors** (`str` or [TensorType](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.TensorType), *optional*) --
  If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

  - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.np.array` objects.
  - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.0

Note that this is different from other audio feature extractors such as [SpeechT5FeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/speecht5#transformers.SpeechT5FeatureExtractor) which take the `hop_length` in ms.

win_length (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1024) : The direct number of samples for each sliding window. Note that this is different from other audio feature extractors such as [SpeechT5FeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v5.0.0/en/model_doc/speecht5#transformers.SpeechT5FeatureExtractor) which take the `win_length` in ms.
