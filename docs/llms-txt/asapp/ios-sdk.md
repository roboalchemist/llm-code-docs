## Requirements

ASAPP supports iOS 12.0 and up. As a rule, ASAPP supports two major versions behind the latest. Once iOS 15 is released, ASAPP will drop support for iOS 12 and only support iOS 13.0 and up.

The SDK is written in Swift 5 and compiled with support for binary stability, meaning it is compatible with any Swift compiler version greater than or equal to 5.
