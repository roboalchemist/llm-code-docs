<Update label="2023 - Free-Text and Feedback Feeds for AI Summary">
  ## Free-Text and Feedback Feeds for AI Summary

  ASAPP introduces two feeds to retrieve data for free-text summaries generated by AI Summary and edited versions of summaries submitted by agents as feedback.

  These two feeds enable administrators to retrieve AI Summary data using the [File Exporter API](/reporting/file-exporter):

  * **Free-text feed**: Retrieves data from free-text summaries generated by AI Summary.
    * This feed has one record per free-text summary produced and can have multiple summaries per conversation.
    * [Schema: autosummary\_free\_text](/reporting/fileexporter-feeds#table%3A-autosummary-free-text)
  * **Feedback feed**: Retrieves data from feedback summaries submitted by the agents.
    * This feed contains the text of the feedback submitted by the agent.
    * Developers can join this feed to the AI Summary free-text feed using the summary ID.
    * [Schema: autosummary\_feedback](/reporting/fileexporter-feeds#table%3A-autosummary-feedback)
