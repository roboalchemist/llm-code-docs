# Service Desk Information

**What is the ASAPP Service Desk?**

Service Desk is the tool ASAPP uses for the ingestion and tracking of all issues and modifications in our customers' demo and production environments. All issue reports and configuration requests between ASAPP and our customers are handled via the tool.

**How can I access the Service Desk?**

The Service Desk can be accessed at [support.asapp.com](http://support.asapp.com).

Service Desk access is provisioned by your ASAPP account team after the initial Service Desk training is completed. All subsequent access requests and/or modifications should be handled via email with your ASAPP account team.

**When do I create a ticket?**

A Service Desk ticket should be created any time an issue is identified with an ASAPP product (this includes Admin, Desk, Chat SDK, and AI Services) in either the demo or production environment. Additionally, a ticket should be created in cases where an existing configuration needs to be updated.

**How do I create a ticket?**

A Service Desk ticket can be created by navigating to support.asapp.com, logging in, clicking **Submit a Request** in the top right corner of the screen, and filling out and submitting the ticket form.

**What happens after I've created a ticket?**

Once the ticket form is submitted, ASAPP will receive an automatic notification. The ASAPP Technical Services team will acknowledge and review the ticket, triage internally, and request additional information if needed. All correspondence, including requests for additional information, explanations of existing functionality, and updates on fix timelines will take place in the ticket comments.

**Should I use Service Desk to ask questions?**

In general, reaching out to your ASAPP account contact(s) directly is the best way to answer a question or begin a discussion. Your ASAPP account contacts can help you determine whether observed behavior is expected or an unexpected issue.

If an issue is confirmed unexpected or a configuration available, create a ticket in Service Desk to begin addressing it.

**What if I have an urgent production problem?**

ASAPP calls urgent production issues **Severity 1** and defines them as follows:

<Note>
  "ASAPP is unusable or inoperable; a major function is unavailable with no acceptable bypass/workaround; a security or confidentiality breach occurred"

  An issue that meets this criteria should be reported as a ticket in Service Desk with the Priority level **Urgent**.

  See [Severity Level Classification](/support/reporting-issues-to-asapp#severity-level-classification "Severity Level Classification") for descriptions, illustrative examples and associated reporting processes.
