# Setup ASAPP

> Learn how to get started with your ASAPP account

To get started with ASAPP, you need to:

1. Create and access your account with ASAPP
2. Invite Users and Developers
3. Configure and Integrate your products

## Create and access your account

The first step with ASAPP is getting your own account. If you haven't already, [request a demo](https://ai-console.asapp.com/). During the initial conversations, an ASAPP member would have asked you for the following:

* Display name of company
* Admin user email: ASAPP grants this user initial admin access and the user can invite subsequent users.
* Developer email: This is the user who is responsible for the technical integration. They will receive access to the developer portal.

An account will be created for you, this account is sometimes referred to as an **organization name** or **company marker**.

This company marker is your main account with ASAPP and includes all configuration, user management, and login settings for your account.

When you login to the [ASAPP dashboard](https://ai-console.asapp.com/), called the AI Console, you will need to specify your **organization**, and then login with your email.

<Note>At first, login is based on your email, though we do support SSO authentication.</Note>

If you don't have an account, you can [reach out](https://www.asapp.com/get-started) to see a demo and get an account.

### Multiple company markers

Most users only need a single company marker. If you require different sets configuration such as different sub entities with different configuration needs, you may require multiple company markers.

Work with your ASAPP account team to determine the best account structure for your business.

## Invite users and developers

Once you have access to your account and the [ASAPP dashboard](https://ai-console.asapp.com/). You need to invite your teammates to access relevant products. You can fully manage most products within the AI Console.

<Note>[ASAPP Messaging](/agent-desk) has a separate dashboard to configure the platform compared to the [Agent Desk](/agent-desk/digital-agent-desk) where your agents login and interact with your customers.</Note>

For developers, we would have already requested for your developer's email to get them access to the developer portal where they can manage API Keys. Point your developers to the [developer quickstart](/getting-started/developers).

## Get started with GenerativeAgent

With access to your account and inviting your users, you need to configure and implement GenerativeAgent.
