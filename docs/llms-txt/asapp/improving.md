# Improving Tasks

> Learn how to improve task performance

GenerativeAgent uses LLMs and other generative AI technology, allowing for human-like interactions and reasoning but also requiring careful consideration on the instructions and functions you define to ensure it behaves as expected.

Creating successful tasks is an iterative process. We have multiple resources and tools to help improve task performance:
