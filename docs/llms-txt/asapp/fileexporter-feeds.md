# File Exporter Feed Schema

The tables below provide detailed information regarding the schema for exported data files that we can make available to you via the File Exporter API.

### Table: autosummary\_feedback

The autosummary feedback table stores summary text submitted by the agent after they have reviewed and edited it. This export will be sent daily and contains the hour for time zone conversion later.

**Sync Time:** 1d

**Unique Condition:** company\_marker, conversation\_id, summary\_id

| instance\_ts               | timestamp    | The time window of computed elements.  This window is usually 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the generation time. Times are rounded down to the nearest interval (for a time of 12:34 and an interval of 15m, this is 12:30). As an example, for a 15 minute interval an instance\_ts of 12:30 implies events from 12:30 -> 12:45.

### Table: autosummary\_structured\_data

The autosummary structured data table stores the raw output of ASAPP's API. These structured data outputs consist of LLM generated answers to yes/no questions along with extracted entities based on configuration settings. These outputs can be aggregated and packaged into business insights. This export will be sent daily and contains the hour for time zone conversion later.

**Sync Time:** 1d

**Unique Condition:** company\_marker, conversation\_id, structured\_data\_id, structured\_data\_field\_id

| instance\_ts                      | timestamp    | The time window of computed elements.  This window is usually 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the generation time.

As an example, for a 15 minute interval an instance\_ts of 12:30 implies events from 12:30 -> 12:45.

### Table: utterances

This S3 captures raw utterances, enabling customers to map message IDs and metadata to specific utterances. Each record in this feed represents an individual message within a conversation, providing utterance-level insights. The feed remains minimal and secure, including a comprehensive mapping of message IDs to their corresponding utterances, information not available in the utterance state file. For security purposes, this feed will only be accessible externally, retaining a maximum of 32 days of data before purging. The feed will be exported daily, with time-stamped data for time zone conversion.

**Sync Time:** 1d

**Unique Condition:** company\_marker, conversation\_id, message\_id

| instance\_ts               | timestamp    | The time window of computed elements.  This window is usually 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the generation time.

As an example, for a 15 minute interval an instance\_ts of 12:30 implies events from 12:30 -> 12:45.
