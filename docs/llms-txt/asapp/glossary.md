| **Core Dialog**                       | Refers to the settings that define how the virtual agent behaves in common dialog scenarios like initial welcome, live chat enqueuement, digressions (triggering a new intent in the middle of a flow), and error handling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Disambiguation**                    | The process whereby the virtual agent gets clarification from the consumer on what is meant by the customer's message.

| **Flow**                              | Flows define how the virtual agent interacts with the customer given a specific situation. They are built through a series of nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
