# Human + AI

> Empower GenerativeAgent with Human in the Loop Agent (HILA) and Agent Desk.

As your GenerativeAgent helps your customers, you can bring human judgment into AI-driven conversations with a [Human in the Loop Agent (HILA)](/generativeagent/human-in-the-loop). Your Human in the Loop Agents provide guidance and explicit approvals to GenerativeAgent in real-time.

Some conversations require humans to fully step in for the best customer experience. Our [Agent Desk](/agent-desk) platform allows you to natively hand off conversations to live agents while remaining in the ASAPP CXP.

<Note>
  You can hand off conversations to Agent Desk platforms separate from Agent Desk.
