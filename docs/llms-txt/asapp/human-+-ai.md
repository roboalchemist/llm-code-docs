# Human + AI

> Empower GenerativeAgent with Human in the Loop Agent (HILA) and Agent Desk.

As your GenerativeAgent helps your customers, you can bring human judgment into the AI-driven conversation with a [Human in the Loop Agent (HILA)](/generativeagent/human-in-the-loop). Your Human in the Loop Agents provide guidance and explicit approvals to the GenerativeAgent in realtime.

Some conversations require a human to fully step in for the best customer experience, our [Agent Desk](/agent-desk) platform allows you to natively hand off the conversation to a live agent, while still being in the ASAPP CXP.

<Note>
  You can hand off conversations to agent desk platforms separate from Agent Desk.
