  Set up automated Coolify backups with AWS S3 including IAM policy creation,
  bucket configuration, access key setup, and cost-effective lifecycle rules.
---

Coolify offers automated backups of your instance to an AWS S3 bucket, giving you a hands‑off, reliable way to safeguard your configuration and data.

### Why use AWS S3 with Coolify?

1. **Enterprise‑grade durability & availability:** S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability and automatic replication across multiple facilities, so your backups are always safe and accessible.

2. **Cost‑effective, pay as you go pricing:** Only pay for the storage and requests you actually use, with built‑in lifecycle rules (e.g., transition to Glacier) to optimize long‑term costs.

3. **Seamless integration** – Coolify’s backup scheduler hooks directly into S3’s API, eliminating the need for custom scripts or third‑party tools and ensuring backups run on a schedule.

### When to avoid using AWS S3 with Coolify?

1. **Strict data residency or on‑prem requirements:** If your regulations mandate keeping backups entirely within a private data center, S3’s public cloud model may not comply.

2. **No external network access:** In environments where outbound internet is blocked, Coolify cannot push snapshots to an S3 endpoint.

1. Create a bucket in AWS Console
2. Create a custom policy in AWS Console with the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        // rewrite your-bucket-name with your bucket name
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Create an IAM user in AWS Console & attach the policy from the previous step.
4. Go to User settings & create an `Access Key` in AWS Console.
5. Add the `Access Key` and `Secret Key` in Coolify when you create a new S3 source.
   ::: success Tip
   You need to use the S3 HTTP endpoint without the bucket name, for example,`https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`.

## 1. Create a S3 Bucket

To create your S3 Bucket, follow these steps:

Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3 and Click on **Create Bucket** button

You’ll be asked to choose a name, object ownership, and so on.

::: info Note
Leave everything else to default values, only change things if you know what you are doing.

      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        // replace envix-coolify-backups-s3 with your bucket name on below two lines
        "arn:aws:s3:::envix-coolify-backups-s3",
        "arn:aws:s3:::envix-coolify-backups-s3/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* Click on **Create access key** option to setup a new access key.

## 5. Setup S3 in Coolify

To create your setup S3 in Coolify, follow these steps:

In your Coolify dashboard:


1. Go to the **Storage** section in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add** button

1) Give a name for the S3 storage (this can be any name)
2) Give a short description for the storage (optional)
3) Enter the endpoint without your bucket name: `https://s3.YOUR_REGION_NAME.amazonaws.com`
4) Enter the name of the S3 bucket you created.
5) Enter your S3 bucket's region
6) Enter your Access Key
7) Enter your Secret Access Key
8) Click on **Validate Connection & Continue** button

Once the Bucket is validated you will be redirected to this page:


Then go to **settings** page and click on **Backup**




1. Enable S3
2. Select your S3 storage
3. Select the frequency of the backup (you can use this [website](https://www.convertloom.com/tools/cron-job-generator) if you are new to cron)
4. Setup Backup Retentions
5. Click on **Backup Now** button (just to check if everything works)

You can see the backups stored on your S3 from the execution logs:


Now you’re done! Your Coolify instance is set up to automatically backup and store them on your Aws S3 bucket safely.
