# GitHub App

Github app allows you to grant access to a single or multiple private repositories from your either personal github account or your organization on github.

### Why use github app with Coolify?

Scoped Access: The GitHub app lets you grant Coolify access to a specific repository, a selected group of repositories, or even all of your repositories. This gives you flexibility and better control over what Coolify can access.

### When Not to Use github app with Coolify?

Lack of Permission: If you don't have the necessary permissions to install the GitHub app, or if you prefer not to install it, then it’s best not to use it with Coolify.

## Installation Methods

There are two ways to install Github App on Coolify:

* [Automated Installation](/applications/ci-cd/github/setup-app#automated-installation) (Recommended)
* [Manual Installation](/applications/ci-cd/github/setup-app#manual-installation)
  We highly recommend the Automated Installation method as it automates the process and reduces the chance of errors.

::: info Example Data
The following data is used as an example in this guide. Please replace it with your actual data when following the steps:

* **GitHub App Name on Coolify:** `Github App Tutorial`
* **GitHub App Name on Github:** `coolify-github-app-tutorial`
* **Webhook Endpoint:** `https://coolboxy.shadowarcanist.internal`

## Automated Installation

### 1. Create a Github App on Coolify

::: info

1. If you are using Selfhost or Enterprise version of Github then you can enter your github details on the Selhost/Enterprise github section.
2. The "System wide" option allows all teams you have on your coolify instance to use this specific github app, if you only want the current team to use the github app then leave this option unchecked.
   ::: warning
   Coolify cloud users won't see the option "System wide" because this option will enable your github app to all Cloud users so this option is disabled on Coolify Cloud
   :::

### 2. Set Webhook Endpoint

1. Select the endpoint for github to send Webhook when a event (commit, pr) happens on github. If this endpoint is not reachable then automatic deployments won't work so if you decide to close port 8000 on your server you have to set the webhook endpoint as your Coolify dashboard domain

### 3. Create Github App on Github

### 4. Allow Github app access to repositories

### 5. Create a New Resource on Coolify

1. Select your project from the Coolify dashboard.
2. Click the **+ New** button to create a new resource.

### 6. Select Private Repository (with Github App) as Resource Type

### 6. Choose Your Server

::: warning HEADS UP!

Choose the server where you want to deploy the application.

### 7. Choose Your Github App
