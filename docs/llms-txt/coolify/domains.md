# Domains

You can easily add your own domains to your applications and services in Coolify. Databases do not support domain configuration.

All domain fields are capable to generate your proxy configurations based on the following rules:

1. You need to use FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) format: `https://coolify.io`
2. You can give multiple domains, separated by comma: `https://coolify.io,https://www.coolify.io`
3. You can also add a port to the domain, so the proxy will know which port you would like to map to the domain: `https://coolify.io:8080,http://api.coolify.io:3000`

## HTTPS & SSL Certificates

Coolify automatically handles SSL/TLS certificates for your applications. When you enter a domain with the `https://` protocol, everything is configured for you behind the scenes.

### How Automatic HTTPS Works

When you enter a domain using the `https://` protocol (for example, `https://example.com`):

1. **Automatic Proxy Configuration** - Coolify automatically applies the necessary configuration to your reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy) to serve your application over HTTPS.

2. **Certificate Issuance** - The proxy automatically starts the process to request and install SSL certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org?utm_source=coolify.io).

3. **Automatic Renewal** - Certificates are automatically renewed before they expire. Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days and Coolify handles renewals seamlessly.

::: success TIP
You don't need to do anything special to enable HTTPS. Simply use `https://` when entering your domain, and Coolify takes care of the rest.
:::

### Self-Signed Certificates

If automatic certificate issuance from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org?utm_source=coolify.io) fails, the Coolify Proxy will provide a self-signed certificate to keep your application accessible. This means your application will still be reachable, but browsers will show a security warning.

::: warning TROUBLESHOOTING
If you see a certificate warning in your browser or your application shows a self-signed certificate, see the [Let's Encrypt Not Working](/troubleshoot/dns-and-domains/lets-encrypt-not-working) troubleshooting guide for detailed solutions.

## Path-Based Routing

You can route traffic to different applications and services based on URL paths by appending a path to your domain. This allows multiple applications to share the same domain while being accessible at different paths.

**Format**: `https://domain.com/path` or with a custom port: `https://domain.com:3000/path`

::: warning PORT PLACEMENT
When using both a port and a path, the port must come **after** the domain but **before** the path.

* Correct: `https://coolify.io:3000/api`
* Incorrect: `https://coolify.io/api:3000`
  :::

### How Path Priority Works

Coolify automatically applies priority rules to path-based routing. More specific paths take precedence over less specific ones:

* `/api/v2/users` → highest priority
* `/api/v2` → medium priority
* `/api` → lower priority
* `/` → lowest priority (root/fallback)

This means you can safely deploy multiple applications on the same domain without worrying about routing conflicts.

### Health Requirements

For path-based routing to function correctly, the application serving a specific path must be **running and healthy**. If an application becomes unhealthy or stops responding, traffic to that path will fall back to the application serving the root domain (`/`).

::: tip EXAMPLE
If you have:

* App A serving `https://coolify.io/` (root)
* App B serving `https://coolify.io/api`

And App B becomes unhealthy, requests to `/api` will be routed to App A instead.

## Catch Multiple Domains

Multitenancy is supported with Coolify. When using [Traefik](/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/overview), you can automatically catch multiple domains, by editing the `Container Labels` of your Application or Service and define a [`HostRegexp`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/routing-configuration/http/routing/rules-and-priority/#host-and-hostregexp) rule.

::: warning Catch-All & SSL Certificates
The Coolify Proxy won't be able to issue SSL certificates for catch-all domains. For subdomains of a specific domain, you have the option to generate a [Wildcard SSL certificate](/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/wildcard-certs).
:::

## Wildcard Domain

You can set a wildcard domain (`example: http://example.com`) to your server, so you can easily assign generated domains to all the resources connected to this server. [More details](/knowledge-base/server/introduction#wildcard-domain)

## DNS Validation

Since version `beta.191`, Coolify will validates DNS records for your domains with `1.1.1.1` Cloudflare DNS server.

If you want to use different DNS server, go to your `Settings > Advanced` page and change the `Custom DNS Servers` field (comma separated list).
