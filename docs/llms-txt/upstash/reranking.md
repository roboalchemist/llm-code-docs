# Reranking

Upstash Search combines semantic and full text search results for maximum relevancy. Optionally, you can re-rank the returned documents using a state of the art model to further improve relevancy.

We provide this additional re-ranking as an opt-in setting because it requires more computational resources and is charged at \$1 per 1K re-ranked documents.
