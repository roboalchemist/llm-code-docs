# LINDEX

> Returns the element at index index in the list stored at key.

The index is zero-based, so 0 means the first element, 1 the second element and so on. Negative indices can be used to designate elements starting at the tail of the list.

## Arguments

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the list.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="index" type="number" required>
  The index of the element to return, zero-based.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField type="TValue | null" required>
  The value of the element at index index in the list. If the index is out of range, `null` is returned.
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>
  ```ts Example theme={"system"}
  await redis.rpush("key", "a", "b", "c");
  const element = await redis.lindex("key", 0);
  console.log(element); // "a"
  ```
