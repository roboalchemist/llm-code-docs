<RequestExample>
  ```ts Example theme={"system"}
  await redis.zadd("key", 
      { score: 1, member: "a" },
      { score: 2, member: "ab" },
      { score: 3, member: "b" },
      { score: 4, member: "c" },
      { score: 5, member: "d" },
  )
  const [newCursor, members] = await redis.zscan("key", 0, { match: "a*"});
  console.log(newCursor); // likely `0` since this is a very small set
  console.log(members); // ["a", "ab"]
  ```

  ```ts withCount theme={"system"}
  await redis.zadd("key", 
      { score: 1, member: "a" },
      { score: 2, member: "ab" },
      { score: 3, member: "b" },
      { score: 4, member: "c" },
      { score: 5, member: "d" },
  )
  const [newCursor, members] = await redis.zscan("key", 0, { match: "a*", count: 1});
  console.log(newCursor); // likely `0` since this is a very small set
  console.log(members); // ["a"]
