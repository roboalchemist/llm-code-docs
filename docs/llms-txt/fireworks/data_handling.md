# Zero Data Retention

> Data retention policies at Fireworks

## Zero data retention

Fireworks has Zero Data Retention by default. Specifically, this means

* Fireworks does not log or store prompt or generation data for any open models, without explicit user opt-in.
  * More technically: prompt and generation data exist only in volatile memory for the duration of the request. If [prompt caching](https://docs.fireworks.ai/guides/prompt-caching#data-privacy) is active, some prompt data (and associated KV caches) can be stored in volatile memory for several minutes. In either case, prompt and generation data are not logged into any persistent storage.
* Fireworks logs metadata (e.g. number of tokens in a request) as required to deliver the service.
* Users can explicitly opt-in to log prompt and generation data for certain advanced features (e.g. FireOptimizer).
* For proprietary Fireworks models (e.g. f1, FireFunction), prompt and generation data may be logged to enable bulk analytics to improve the model.
  * In this case, the model description will contain an explicit message about logging.

## Response API data retention

For the Response API specifically, Fireworks retains conversation data with the following policy when the API request has `store=True` (the default):

* **What is stored**: Conversation messages include the complete conversation data:
  * User prompts
  * Model responses
  * Tools called by the model
* **Opt-out option**: You can disable data storage by setting `store=False` in your API requests to prevent any conversation data from being retained.
* **Retention period**: All stored conversation data is automatically deleted after 30 days.
* **Immediate deletion**: You can immediately delete stored conversation data using the DELETE API endpoint by providing the `response_id`. This will permanently remove the record.

This retention policy is designed to be consistent with the OpenAI API while providing users control over their data storage preferences.

<Note>
  The Response API retention policy only applies to conversation data when using the Response API endpoints. All other Fireworks services follow the zero data retention policy described above.
