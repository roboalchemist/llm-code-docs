# How do credits work?

## How credits are applied

Fireworks operates with a **postpaid billing** system:

* **Prepaid credits are used first** for all usage
* Once credits are exhausted, you **continue to accrue charges** for additional usage
* **Usage charges** are billed at the end of each month
* **Prepaid credits are instantly applied** to any outstanding balance

**Example**: If you had a `$750` outstanding bill and added `$500` in credits, your bill would reduce to `$250`, with \$0 remaining credits available for new usage.

## Missing credits after purchase?

If you don't see your credits reflected immediately:

1. Visit your **billing dashboard**
2. Review the **"Credits"** section
3. Check your **current outstanding balance**

**Important**: Credits are always applied to any existing balance before being available for new usage. If you had an outstanding balance, your credits were automatically applied to reduce it.

## Why did I receive an invoice after depositing credits?

You'll receive an invoice for any usage that **exceeded your pre-purchased credits**. This process happens automatically, regardless of subscription status.

**Example**: If you deposited `$20` in credits but incurred `$83` in usage, you'll be billed for the `$63` difference at month-end.

## What happens when I finish my \$1 credit?

When you finish your \$1 credit, the following occurs:

## Account Status

* **Without payment method**: Your account will be **suspended** until you add a payment method. Additionally, accounts without a payment method are subject to a **provisional rate limit of 10 requests per minute (RPM)**. To access full rate limits (up to 6,000 RPM), add a payment method in your [billing settings](https://fireworks.ai/billing).
* **With payment method**: You can continue using the service with full rate limits and usage-based billing

**Payment Method Requirements:**

* Adding a payment method is required to continue service after credit depletion
* You're billed at the end of the month for actual usage
* You can incur bills up to your configured spend limit (default: \$50/month for new accounts)
* As you spend more with Fireworks, your allowed usage limits increase

## Where's my receipt for purchased credits?

Receipts for purchased credits are sent via Stripe upon purchase. Check your email for receipts from Stripe (not Fireworks). If you can't find your receipt, contact [billing@fireworks.ai](mailto:billing@fireworks.ai).
