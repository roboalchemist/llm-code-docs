# What are the rate limits for on-demand deployments?

On-demand deployments have GPU quotas that determine your maximum allocation.

For detailed information about on-demand deployment quotas and GPU limits, see our [Rate Limits & Quotas guide](/guides/quotas_usage/rate-limits#gpu-limits-with-on-demand-deployments).
