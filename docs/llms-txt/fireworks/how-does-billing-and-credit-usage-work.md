# How does billing and credit usage work?

Usage and billing operate through a **tiered system**:

* Each **tier** has a monthly usage limit, regardless of available credits.
* Once you reach your tier's limit, **service will be suspended** even if you have remaining credits.
* **Usage limits** reset at the beginning of each month.
* Pre-purchased credits do not prevent additional charges once the limit is exceeded.
