# I have multiple Fireworks accounts. When I try to login with Google on Fireworks' web UI, I'm getting signed into the wrong account. How do I fix this?

If you log in with Google, account management is controlled by Google. You can log in through an incognito mode or create separate Chrome/browser profiles to log in with different Google accounts. You could also follow the steps in this [guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13533235?hl=en#zippy=%2Csign-in-with-google) to disassociate Fireworks.ai with a particular Google account sign-in. If you have more complex issues please contact us on Discord.
