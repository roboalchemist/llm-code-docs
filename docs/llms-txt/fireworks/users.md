# Managing users

> Add, delete, and manage roles for users in your Fireworks account

See the concepts [page](/getting-started/concepts#account) for definitions of accounts and users.

## User roles

Each user in an account is assigned a role that determines their level of access:

| Role               | Description                                                                                                             |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**          | Full administrative control over resources, users, and access. Can manage all account settings and add or remove users. |
| **User** (default) | Can manage all resources, including those owned by others, but cannot manage users or access settings.                  |
| **Contributor**    | Can run inference on any resource and create and manage their own resources. Cannot modify resources owned by others.   |
| **Inference User** | Can view all resources and run inference, but cannot create or modify resources.                                        |

<Note>
  The `contributor` and `inference-user` roles are newer roles that provide more granular access control. Contact Fireworks support if you need these roles enabled for your account.

## Adding users

To add a new user to your Fireworks account, run the following command. If the email for the new user is already associated with a Fireworks account, they will have the option to freely switch between your account and their existing account(s). You can also add users in the Fireworks web UI at [https://app.fireworks.ai/account/users](https://app.fireworks.ai/account/users).

```bash  theme={null}
firectl user create --email="alice@example.com"
```

To create another admin user, pass the `--role=admin` flag:

```bash  theme={null}
firectl user create --email="alice@example.com" --role=admin
```

## Updating a user's role

To update a user's role, run

```bash  theme={null}
firectl user update <USER_ID> --role=<ROLE>
```

Where `<ROLE>` is one of: `admin`, `user`, `contributor`, or `inference-user`.

## Deleting users

You can remove a user from your account by running:

```bash  theme={null}
firectl user delete <USER_ID>
```
