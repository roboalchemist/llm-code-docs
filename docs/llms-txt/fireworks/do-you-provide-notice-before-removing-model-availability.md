# Do you provide notice before removing model availability?

Yes, we provide advance notice before removing models from the serverless infrastructure:

* **Minimum 2 weeks’ notice** before model removal
* Longer notice periods may be provided for **popular models**, depending on usage
* Higher-usage models may have extended deprecation timelines

**Best Practices**:

1. Monitor announcements regularly.
2. Prepare a migration plan in advance.
3. Test alternative models to ensure continuity.
4. Keep your contact information updated for timely notifications.
