# What email does GitHub authentication use?

When you authenticate with Fireworks using GitHub, we use the **primary email address** associated with your GitHub account for identification and account management.

## How it works

Fireworks automatically retrieves your primary email address from your GitHub profile during the authentication process. This email address becomes your Fireworks account identifier.

## Managing your primary email

To change your primary email address on GitHub:

1. Go to your [GitHub email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails)
2. Select the email address you want to set as primary in the "Primary email address" section

  You can also follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address) for detailed instructions on managing email preferences.

## Switching between accounts

You can easily switch which Fireworks account your GitHub authentication logs into by changing your primary email address on GitHub before logging in. This allows you to:

* Log into different Fireworks accounts using the same GitHub account
* Switch between personal and work accounts by updating your GitHub primary email
* Maintain separate billing and usage tracking for different email addresses

The authentication will use whatever email is set as primary at the time of login, so you can switch accounts by simply updating your GitHub primary email before authenticating.
