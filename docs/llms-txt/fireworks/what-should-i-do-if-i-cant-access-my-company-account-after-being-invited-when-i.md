# What should I do if I can't access my company account after being invited when I already have a personal account?

This issue can occur when you have multiple accounts associated with the same email address (e.g., a personal account created with Google login and a company account you've been invited to).

To resolve this:

1. Email [inquiries@fireworks.ai](mailto:inquiries@fireworks.ai) from the email address associated with both accounts
2. Include in your email:
   * The account ID you created personally (e.g., username-44ace8)
   * The company account ID you need access to (e.g., company-a57b2a)
   * Mention that you're having trouble accessing your company account

Note: This is a known scenario that support can resolve once they verify your email ownership.
