# Inference Error Codes

> Common error codes, their meanings, and resolutions for inference requests

Understanding error codes helps you quickly diagnose and resolve issues when making inference requests to the Fireworks API.

## Common error codes

| **Code** | **Error Name**        | **Possible Issue(s)**                                                                                                                            | **How to Resolve**                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`    | Bad Request           | Invalid input or malformed request.                                                                                                              | Review the request parameters and ensure they match the expected format.                                                                                                      |
| `401`    | Unauthorized          | Invalid API key or insufficient permissions.                                                                                                     | Verify your API key and ensure it has the correct permissions.                                                                                                                |
| `402`    | Payment Required      | Account is not on a paid plan or has exceeded usage limits.                                                                                      | Check your billing status and ensure your payment method is up to date. Upgrade your plan if necessary.                                                                       |
| `403`    | Forbidden             | Authentication issues.                                                                                                                           | Verify you have the correct API key.                                                                                                                                          |
| `404`    | Not Found             | The API endpoint path doesn't exist, the model doesn't exist, the model is not deployed, or you don't have permission to access it.              | Verify the URL path in your request and ensure you are using the correct API endpoint. Check if the model exists and is available. Ensure you have the necessary permissions. |
| `405`    | Method Not Allowed    | Using an unsupported HTTP method (e.g., using GET instead of POST).                                                                              | Check the API documentation for the correct HTTP method.                                                                                                                      |
| `408`    | Request Timeout       | The request took too long to complete, possibly due to server overload or network issues.                                                        | Retry the request after a brief wait. Consider increasing the timeout value if applicable.                                                                                    |
| `412`    | Precondition Failed   | Account is suspended or there's an issue with account status. This error also occurs when attempting to invoke a LoRA model that failed to load. | Check your account status and billing information. For LoRA models, ensure the model was uploaded correctly and is compatible. Contact support if the issue persists.         |
| `413`    | Payload Too Large     | Input data exceeds the allowed size limit.                                                                                                       | Reduce the size of the input payload (e.g., by trimming large text or image data).                                                                                            |
| `429`    | Over Quota            | You've reached the API rate limit.                                                                                                               | Wait for the quota to reset or upgrade your plan for a higher rate limit. See [Rate Limits & Quotas](/guides/quotas_usage/rate-limits).                                       |
| `500`    | Internal Server Error | Server-side code bug that is unlikely to resolve on its own.                                                                                     | Contact Fireworks support immediately, as this error typically requires intervention from the engineering team.                                                               |
| `502`    | Bad Gateway           | The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.                                                                                 | Wait and retry the request. If the error persists, it may indicate a server outage.                                                                                           |
| `503`    | Service Unavailable   | The service is down for maintenance or experiencing issues.                                                                                      | Retry the request after some time. Check the [status page](https://status.fireworks.ai) for maintenance announcements.                                                        |
| `504`    | Gateway Timeout       | The server did not receive a response in time from an upstream server.                                                                           | Wait briefly and retry the request. Consider using a shorter input prompt if applicable.                                                                                      |
| `520`    | Unknown Error         | An unexpected error occurred with no clear explanation.                                                                                          | Retry the request. If the issue persists, contact support for further assistance.                                                                                             |

## Troubleshooting tips

If you encounter an error not listed here:

* Review the API documentation for the correct usage of endpoints and parameters
