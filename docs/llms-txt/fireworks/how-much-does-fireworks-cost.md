# How much does Fireworks cost?

Fireworks AI operates on a **pay-as-you-go** model for all non-Enterprise usage, and new users automatically receive free credits. You pay based on:

* **Per token** for serverless inference
* **Per GPU usage time** for on-demand deployments
* **Per token of training data** for fine-tuning

For customers needing **enterprise-grade security and reliability**, please reach out to us at [inquiries@fireworks.ai](mailto:inquiries@fireworks.ai) to discuss options.
