# FAQ

# General

### Why do Voyage embeddings have superior quality?

Embedding models, much like generative models, rely on powerful neural networks (often transformer-based) to capture and compress semantic context. And, much like generative models, they’re incredibly hard to train. Voyage is a team of leading AI researchers who each have experience in training embedding models for 5+ years. We refine every component, from model architecture and data collection to selecting suitable loss functions and optimizers. Please see our <a href="https://blog.voyageai.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> for more details.

# Model

### What text embedding models are available, and which one should I use?

For general-purpose embedding, our recommendation is `voyage-4-large` for the best quality, `voyage-4-lite` for the lowest latency and cost, and `voyage-4` for a balance between the two. Notably, all 4 series models are [compatible with each other](https://blog.voyageai.com/2026/01/15/voyage-4/) . `voyage-4` also outperforms all major competitors in retrieval quality while being offered at a lower price point. For retrieval, please use the `input_type` parameter to specify whether the text is a query or document, which adds instructions on the backend.

If your application is in a domain addressed by one of our domain-specific embedding models, we recommend using that model.  Specifically:

* `voyage-law-2` is recommended for retrieval tasks in the legal domain.
* `voyage-code-3` is recommended for code-related tasks and programming documentation.
* `voyage-finance-2` is recommended for finance-related tasks.

### Which similarity function should I use?

You can use Voyage embeddings with either dot-product similarity, cosine similarity, or Euclidean distance. An explanation about embedding similarity can be found <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/#std-label-avs-similarity-functions" target="_blank">here</a>.

Voyage AI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:

* Cosine similarity is equivalent to dot-product similarity, while the latter can be computed more quickly.
* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings.

### What is the relationship between characters, words, and tokens?

Please see this [section](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/tokenization#tokens-words-characters).

### When and how should I use the `input_type` parameter?

For retrieval/search tasks and use cases (e.g., RAG), where a "query" is used to search for relevant information among a collection of data referred to as "documents," we recommend specifying whether your inputs are intended as queries or documents by setting `input_type` to `query` or `document`, respectively. Do not omit `input_type` or set `input_type=None`. Specifying whether inputs are queries or documents helps the model create more effective vectors tailored for retrieval/search tasks.

When using the `input_type` parameter, special prompts are prepended to the input text prior to embedding.  Specifically:

> 📘 Prompts associated with `input_type`
>
> * For a query, the prompt is “Represent the query for retrieving supporting documents: “.
> * For a document, the prompt is “Represent the document for retrieval: “.
>
> **Example:**
>
> * When `input_type="query"`, a query like "When is Apple's conference call scheduled?" will become "**Represent the query for retrieving supporting documents:** When is Apple's conference call scheduled?"
> * When `input_type="document"`, a query like "Apple's conference call to discuss fourth fiscal quarter results and business updates is scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET." will become "**Represent the document for retrieval:** Apple's conference call to discuss fourth fiscal quarter results and business updates is scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET."

`voyage-large-2-instruct`, as the name suggests, is trained to be responsive to additional instructions that are prepended to the input text. For classification, clustering, or other [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/mteb) subtasks, please use the instructions [here](https://github.com/voyage-ai/voyage-large-2-instruct).

### What is the total number of tokens for the rerankers?

We define the total number of tokens as the “(number of query tokens × the number of documents) + sum of the number of tokens in all documents". This cannot exceed 600K for `rerank-2.5`, `rerank-2.5-lite`, `rerank-2`, and `rerank-2-lite`; and 300K for `rerank-1` and `rerank-lite-1`. However, if your application is latency-sensitive, we recommend you to use `rerank-2.5-lite` and use no more than 200K total tokens per request.

### How can I retrieve nearest text quickly if I have a large corpus?

To efficiently retrieve the nearest texts from a sizable corpus, you can use a vector database. We recommend using:

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search), a versatile database with best-in-class vector search capabilities

MongoDB and the document data model are the best for representing all the variety of data in the world—whether it's structured, semi-structured, or unstructured (vector) data.

Here are some other choices:

* [Turbopuffer](https://turbopuffer.com/), a fast serverless search engine that combines vector and full-text search
* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database
* [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com), a vector database for enterprise

### What is Base64 encoding?

Base64 encoding converts binary data, such as images, into a sequence of printable characters. It is commonly used to encode data that needs to be stored or transferred over media designed to handle textual data, such as HTTPS requests. The encoding ensures that the data remains intact without modification during transmission.

Python comes with a native <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html" target="_blank"><code>base64</code> library</a>. Here’s an example using the Python `base64` library to create a Base64 image:

```python
import base64

# Replace 'banana.jpg' with the path to your image file
image_path = 'banana.jpg'

# Open the image file in binary mode
with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
    # Read the binary data
    image_data = image_file.read()
    
    # Encode the binary data to Base64
    base64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(image_data)
    
    # Convert the base64 bytes to a string
    base64_string = base64_encoded_data.decode("utf-8")
```

Here’s how you can create a Base64 image with a function and vectorize it with `voyage-multimodal-3.5`:

```python
import base64
import mimetypes
import voyageai

vo = voyageai.Client()
# This will automatically use the environment variable VOYAGE_API_KEY.
# Alternatively, you can use vo = voyageai.Client(api_key="<your secret key>")

# Convert image to Base64 image
def b64encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Image path
image_path = 'banana.jpg'

# Get media type
mediatype, _  = mimetypes.guess_type(image_path)

# Input with text and a Base64 encoded image
inputs = [
    {
        "content": [
            { "type": "text", "text": "This is a banana." },
            { "type": "image_base64", "image_base64": f"data:{mediatype};base64,{b64encode_image(image_path)}" }
        ]
    }
]

# Vectorize inputs
result = vo.multimodal_embed(inputs, model="voyage-multimodal-3.5", input_type="document")
print(result.embeddings)
```

```python Output
[
  [0.0181884765625, -0.01019287109375, 0.021240234375,...]
]
```

### What is Pillow?

<a href="https://python-pillow.org/" target="_blank">Pillow</a> is a widely used Python library for image processing, providing powerful tools to open, manipulate, and save various image file formats. It is popular because it is simple to use, well-documented, and covers many use cases. The following example demonstrates some common tasks with Pillow, such as opening, showing, resizing, and saving images. It also demonstrates retrieving metadata like width, height, and pixel count. Check out the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pillow docs</a> for more details.

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open an image
img = Image.open('banana.jpg')

# Show image
img.show()

# Get image width, height, and pixels
width, height = img.size     # Get image width and height
num_pixels = width * height  # Calculate number of pixels

print(f"Width: {width} pixels")
print(f"Height: {height} pixels")
print(f"Total Pixels: {num_pixels}")

# Resize image to 200 pixels by 150 pixels
new_size = (200, 150)  # Example size: 200x150 pixels

# Resize the image
resized_img = img.resize(new_size)

# Show resized image
resized_img.show()

# Save resized image
resized_img.save('banana-200px-by-150px.jpg')
```

# Billing and Budgets

### When will I receive the bill?

The first 200 million tokens are free for every account, and subsequent usage is priced on a per-token basis. See our [Pricing page](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/pricing) for details

You can add payment methods to your account in the [dashboard](https://dash.voyageai.com). We will bill monthly. You can expect a credit card charge around the 2nd of each month for the usage of the past month.

### How can I set up prepaid billing?

Prepaid billing allows API users to pre-purchase usage credits, which are applied to their monthly invoice. API usage is first deducted from prepaid credits, and any usage exceeding the purchased credits is billed separately. Prepaid billing helps developers plan upfront, providing greater predictability for budgeting and spend management.

**Setting up prepaid billing**. To prepay and add a credit balance, you must have a payment method on file. Navigate to the <a href="https://dashboard.voyageai.com/organization/billing" target="_blank">**Billing**</a> section under Organization in the navigation sidebar. In the **Overview** tab, click **Add to credit balance** to open the **Configure Payment** modal.

<Image alt="Add to credit balance" border={false} src="https://files.readme.io/f40d41f609ce039ab91c7f6ef7ca98d69a0db985207a4a2fb822469cf28a23ba-add-to-credit-balance.png" />

Enter the amount you want to prepay in the **Initial credit purchase** field. Optionally, you can enable automatic recharge and specify an amount to restore your credit balance when it falls below a set threshold.

<Image alt="Configure payment" border={false} src="https://files.readme.io/1f9f6cba6e10a71fd7ead1b127166e9fe0a0076c37da7dc45d538c22e52a70f9-configure-payment.png" />

**Service Credit Terms and Expiration**. Please note that any purchased credits will expire after 1 year, and they are non-refundable.
