# block_suggestion payloads

A `block_suggestion` payload is received when a user interacts with a [select menu of external data source](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/select-menu-element) element. Users may return a maximum of 100 options or option groups when handling the `block_suggestion` payload.

Read our guide to [handling payloads from user interactions](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads) to learn how your app should process and respond to these payloads.

## Properties {#properties}

This is a list of the properties that can be encountered in this type of interaction payload:

Properties received in a `block_suggestion` event may differ based on the source of the interactive elements—a modal view, message, or home tab surface.

A check in the column means that property is included in a `block_suggestion` event sent to a function, a non-function, or both. Functions refer to apps created with the Deno Slack SDK; refer to [Interactivity overview](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/adding-interactivity) for more information.

Property

Functions

Non-Functions

Description

Required?

`user`

✓

✓

Details for the user that initiated the block suggestion interaction. The `user.team_id` will report an enterprise organization ID (which starts with an `E`) instead of team ID (which starts with a `T`), when using an Enterprise organization.

Required

`team`

✓

✓

The workspace, or team, details the Block Kit interaction originated from. In the case of an Enterprise organization, `team` can also have the properties `enterprise_id` and `enterprise_name`, which represent the ID and the name of the org, respectively.

Required

`api_app_id`

✓

✓

The encoded application ID the event was dispatched to, e.g. A123456.

Required

`block_id`

✓

✓

Identifies the block within a surface that contained the interactive component that was used. See the [reference guide for the block you're using](/reference/block-kit/blocks) for more info on the `block_id` field.

Required

`action_id`

✓

✓

Identifies the interactive component itself. Some blocks can contain multiple interactive components, so the `block_id` alone may not be specific enough to identify the source component. See the [reference guide for the interactive element you're using](/reference/block-kit/block-elements) for more info on the `action_id` field.

Required

`function_data`

✓

Metadata about the function execution that generated the block where this block suggestion took place.

Required

`bot_access_token`

✓

A workflow (just-in-time) token generated for this block suggestion.

Required

`enterprise`

✓

✓

The enterprise the installed app is part of, if the app is either workspace-installed on an org, or org-installed.

Optional

`channel`

✓

✓

The channel the block suggestion interaction originated from.

Optional

`message`

✓

✓

The message where this block suggestion took place, if the block was contained in a message.

Optional

`view`

✓

✓

The view where this block suggestion took place, if the block was contained in a view.

Optional

`value`

✓

✓

The value the user entered into the select menu.

Required
