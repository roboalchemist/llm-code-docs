Version `2.22.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here!

* We fixed a bug to prevent project paths including spaces from being separated into multiple arguments when deploying an app.
* We now cease defaulting to the deno runtime, and log unsupported runtimes.
* We fixed a bug that was causing a `team_access_not_granted` error when redeploying an app.
* We fixed a bug to handle an empty `outgoing_domains` attribute within an app's manifest.
* We fixed a bug to remove extra spaces from error messages when creating a new project using `slack create`.
