## Usage info {#usage-info}

Managing app approval

When used in an admin app to approve or restrict other app installs across an entire Enterprise organization, the UI-based process is disabled and the admin app solely manages apps.

This method provides app config information. If domain restrictions (email and instance URL) are set, users will only be able to connect their external accounts belonging to certain email domains or instance URLs. If builder auth restrictions are set, a workflow builder will not be able to delegate their auth for end-user workflow runs.

Here are more details on the output fields:
