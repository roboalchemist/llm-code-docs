## Usage info {#usage-info}

This [Admin API](/admins) invalidates a **single** session for a user on a workspace. The user will be logged out and forced to login again. If the user has multiple sessions with multiple devices, the other sessions will be unaffected.

If you'd like to reset _all sessions_ for a given user, use the [`admin.users.session.reset`](/reference/methods/admin.users.session.reset) method instead.
