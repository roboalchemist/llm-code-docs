## Usage info {#usage-info}

This method fetches the expiration timestamp for a guest.

The behavior of this method depends on whether you provide the optional `target_team` parameter:

* If you do not provide a `target_team` parameter, the guest's expiration timestamp on the current team or org is returned.
* If you do provide a `target_team` parameter, you must also use an org token. The guest's expiration on the specified target team is returned.
