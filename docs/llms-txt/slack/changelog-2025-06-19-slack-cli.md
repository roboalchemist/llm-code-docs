# Release: Slack CLI v3.4.0

June 19, 2025

Version `3.4.0` of the developer tools for the Slack platform is here!

* The install script and the `slack upgrade` command will now automatically detect your macOS architecture and install an Intel or an Apple Silicon binary.
* Outputs from erroring hook scripts, such as those found when gathering an abnormal app manifest, are no longer hidden in verbose outputs but are instead shown with invocation errors.
* In preparation for apps using the [Run on Slack infrastructure](https://docs.slack.dev/workflows/run-on-slack-infrastructure) to work with [Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0), the following Deno ecosystem releases have gone out:
