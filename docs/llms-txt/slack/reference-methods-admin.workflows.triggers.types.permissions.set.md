**Rate Limits**[Tier 3: 50+ per minute](/apis/web-api/rate-limits)

## Arguments {#arguments}

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`id`**Required

The trigger type ID for which to set the permissions

_Example:_ `['FTT01', 'FTT02', 'FTT03']`

### Optional arguments

**`visibility`**`string`Optional

The function visibility

_Acceptable values:_ `everyone` `named_entities` `no_one`

**`user_ids`**`array`Optional

List of user IDs to allow for named\_entities visibility

_Example:_ `['U00000001', 'U00000002', 'U00000003']`

**`permissions`**`object`Optional

## Usage Info {#usage-info}

The following arguments are always required:

* `token` (string): Authentication token (session or cookie)
* `id` (string): The trigger type ID for which to set the permissions
  * Example: `['FTT01', 'FTT02', 'FTT03']`

### Permissions configuration {#permissions-configuration}

After providing the required arguments above, you must use either top-level visibility or a permissions array to configure permissions:

#### Top-Level visibility {#top-level-visibility}

Set permissions using the top-level `visibility` property:

## Public or no access

When `visibility` is set to `"everyone"` or `"no_one"`, no additional properties are required.

## Example (everyone):

```json
{  "token": "session_token",  "id": "FTT01",  "visibility": "everyone"}
```

## Example (no one):

```json
{  "token": "session_token",  "id": "FTT01",  "visibility": "no_one"}
```

## Named entities

When `visibility` is set to `"named_entities"`, you must provide at least one of the following:

* `user_ids` (array): List of user IDs to allow access (max 50 items)
  * Example: `['U00000001', 'U00000002', 'U00000003']`
* `team_ids` (array): List of workspace IDs to allow access (max 50 items)
  * Example: `['T00000001', 'T00000002', 'T00000003']`
* `org_ids` (array): List of enterprise IDs to allow access
  * Example: `['E00000001', 'E00000002', 'E00000003']`

## Example:

```json
{  "token": "session_token",  "id": "FTT01",  "visibility": "named_entities",  "user_ids": ["U00000001", "U00000002"],  "team_ids": ["T00000001"]}
```

#### Permissions array {#permissions-array}

Set multiple permission types using the `permissions` array. Each permission object in the array must specify:

* `type` (string, required): The type of permission
  * `"trigger_type"`
  * `"private_channel_access"`
  * `"private_channel_message_access"`
* `visibility` (string, required): Who has access
  * `"everyone"`, `"named_entities"`, or `"no_one"`

## Public or no access

When `visibility` is `"everyone"` or `"no_one"`, no additional properties are required in the permission object.

## Example:

```json
{  "token": "session_token",  "id": "FTT01",  "permissions": [    {      "type": "trigger_type",      "visibility": "everyone"    },    {      "type": "private_channel_access",      "visibility": "no_one"    }  ]}
```

## Named entities

When `visibility` is `"named_entities"`, you must provide at least one of the following within each permission object:

* `user_ids` (array): List of user IDs (max 50 items)
* `team_ids` (array): List of workspace IDs (max 50 items)
* `org_ids` (array): List of enterprise IDs

## Example:

```json
{  "token": "session_token",  "id": "FTT01",  "permissions": [    {      "type": "trigger_type",      "visibility": "named_entities",      "user_ids": ["U00000001", "U00000002"]    },    {      "type": "private_channel_access",      "visibility": "named_entities",      "team_ids": ["T00000001"]    }  ]}
```

### Notes {#notes}

* All ID arrays support `uniqueItems: true`, meaning duplicate values are not allowed.
* The `user_ids` and `team_ids` properties have a maximum of 50 items.
* You cannot mix both options - use either top-level visibility OR the permissions array, but not both.
* When using the `named_entities` visibility, at least one ID array must be non-empty.
