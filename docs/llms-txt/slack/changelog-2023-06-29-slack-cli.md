# Release: Slack CLI v2.5.0

June 29, 2023

Version `2.5.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is hot off the press!

* We've added a confirmation message if you decide not to delete an app when using the `slack app delete` command.
* We added a `--hide-triggers` flag to the `slack run` and `slack deploy` commands to prevent retrieving and displaying application triggers.
* We added a warning to listed trigger info that Slack Connect channels do not support event triggers.
* We added app collaborators to listed trigger info.
* We added support to limit paginated results with the `trigger list --limit <n>` command.
* We added a prompt for whether you would like to include/exclude app collaborators into the named entities list if you set your trigger's ACL to `named_entities`. The `include-app-collaborators` flag will allow you to skip this prompt.
* We updated the `slack activity` command to support datastore event and error logs. For more information, refer to [logging](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/logging-function-and-app-behavior).
* When the `--token` flag is set, background checks for updates will now be automatically disabled.
* We added support to fall back to a `curl` install of `deno` if `deno upgrade` should fail.
* The `slack logout` command now accepts the `--workspace` flag.
* We removed the `--show-triggers` flag from the `slack run` command, as the command now displays all of your app's triggers and their types.
