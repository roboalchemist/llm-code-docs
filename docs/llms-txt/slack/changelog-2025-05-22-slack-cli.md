# Release: Slack CLI v3.2.0

May 22, 2025

Version `3.2.0` of the developer tools for the Slack platform is here!

* We now display the manifest source as human-friendly output: `project (local)` and `app settings (remote)`. You'll see these changes in the `slack create`, `slack init`, and `slack app link <id>` commands, for example.
* The link between your project code and the configurations within app settings can now be accessed by running the `slack app settings` command. Bolt developers with a remote manifest source managed within app settings may find this useful for discovering new features or making updates.
* We fixed a bug: The example `slack app link` and `slack app list` commands shown when running the `slack app --help` command now use the entire command in order to prevent potential aliasing errors.
* We fixed a bug to improve the console output to handle string values for versions.
