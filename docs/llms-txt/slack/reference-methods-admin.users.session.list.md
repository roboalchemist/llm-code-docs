## Arguments {#arguments}

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

### Optional arguments

**`team_id`**`string`Optional

The ID of the workspace you'd like active sessions for. If you pass a `team_id`, you'll need to pass a `user_id` as well.

_Example:_ `T1234`

**`user_id`**`string`Optional

The ID of user you'd like active sessions for. If you pass a `user_id`, you'll need to pass a `team_id` as well.

_Example:_ `U1234`

**`limit`**`integer`Optional

The maximum number of items to return. Must be between 1 - 1000 both inclusive.

_Default:_ `1000`

_Example:_ `100`

**`cursor`**`string`Optional

Set `cursor` to `next_cursor` returned by the previous call to list items in the next page.

_Example:_ `5c3e53d5`

## Usage info {#usage-info}

This [Admin API](/admins) lists active login sessions to your Slack organization.

If no `user_id` and `team_id` are passed, you'll receive a paginated list of _all_ sessions.

When you pass `user_id` and `team_id` (which must be used together), you'll receive a list of active sessions by that user on the workspace specified by `team_id`.

These sessions can be used to reset a session with the [`invalidate` method](/reference/methods/admin.users.session.invalidate): the user will be logged out and forced to login again. If the user has multiple sessions with multiple devices, the other sessions will be unaffected.

If you'd like to reset _all sessions_ for a given user, use the [`admin.users.session.reset`](/reference/methods/admin.users.session.reset) method instead.

## Response {#response}

#### Typical success response

```json

{  "ok": true,  "active_sessions": [    {      "user_id": "U012S9M77JP",      "team_id": "E011E2SBBFC",      "session_id": 1112275520242,      "recent": {        "device_hardware": "Intel",        "os": "OS X",        "os_version": "10.15.7",        "slack_client_version": "91.0.4472.77",        "ip": "24.6.145.138"      },      "created": {        "device_hardware": "Intel",        "os": "OS X",        "os_version": "10.15.7",        "slack_client_version": "91.0.4472.77",        "ip": "24.6.145.138"      }    }  ]}

Inside an `active_session`, you'll find two objects: `recent` and `created`.

`recent` signifies the most recent version of the session, while `created` represents the original version of the session. This covers the case where the same session persists across multiple `slack_client_version`s (or OS versions or IPs).

If the session hasn't changed since creation, you'll **only** find `created` and not `recent`.

Both `recent` and `created` contain the following info:

* `device_hardware`: The type of device for the session.
* `os`: The operating system for the device.
* `os_version`: The version of the OS.
* `slack_client_version`: The version of the Slack client, if available.
* `ip`: The IP address for the session.
