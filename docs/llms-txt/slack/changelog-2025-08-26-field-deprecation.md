# Deprecation of the allow_message_deletion field

August 26, 2025

As of August 2025, we have updated the `team.preferences.list` API method to deprecate the `allow_message_deletion` response field. This field is no longer a preference, and will therefore no longer be returned from this API method. We'll be rolling out a permission to manage the ability to delete your own messages via the permissions page in the future, which will allow users to more granularly define who can delete their own messages on their team.
