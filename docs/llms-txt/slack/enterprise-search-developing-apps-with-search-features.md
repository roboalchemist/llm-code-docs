# Developing apps with Enterprise Search features

Read on to learn how to configure your apps to use Enterprise Search features.

## The search object {#search-object}

Your app must include the `search` object within the `features` block of its app manifest. This object links the search functionality in Slack to specific custom steps defined by your app.

Field

Description

Required

`search_function_callback_id`

The `callback_id` of the function executed whenever Slack needs to collect search results from your app.

Required

`search_filters_function_callback_id`

The `callback_id` of the function executed to return the available filters for your search functionality.

Optional

In your app manifest, it may look something like this:

```text
..."features": {    "search": {        "search_function_callback_id": "id123456",        "search_filters_function_callback_id": "id987654"    }}
```text

If you already have a custom step for returning search results in your Slack app, you can use the **Search Apps** view within app settings to configure your app as a search app.

## Implementing Enterprise Search {#implementation}

Before we can create custom steps for search functionality in your app, we first need to ensure your app is subscribed to the `function_executed` event.

To do this, update your app manifest as follows:

```text
...  "settings": {      "org_deploy_enabled": true,      "event_subscriptions": {          "bot_events": [              ...              "function_executed",              "entity_details_requested"          ]      },      "app_type": "remote",      "function_runtime": "remote"  }
```text

Each app must define a single custom step function in its app manifest that returns search results. The function's `callback_id` can then be referenced as the `search_function_callback_id` in the app manifest.

### Input parameters {#input-parameters-search-implementation}

Field

Description

Type

Required

`query`

The query string provided by the end user when performing their search.

string

Required

`filters`

An object containing the key-value pair of the filters selected by the user when interacting with search.

object

Optional

`*`

Any additional input parameter with type [`slack#/types/user_context`](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/reference/slack-types/#usercontext), regardless of its name, will be set to the `user_context` value of the user executing the search.

[`slack#/types/user_context`](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/reference/slack-types/#usercontext)

Optional

info

When building an app using Enterprise Search features, you may find that the `query` input is different from the raw `query` input from the end user when they perform a search. This is because the `query` input to your search function is actually parsed and rewritten by Slack to align with other Slack searches (such as for native Slack content and built-in connectors), for security reasons, and for a better search experience.

### Output parameters {#output-parameters-search-implementation}

The function requires a single output parameter `search_results` of type `slack#/types/search_results`, which contains an array of up to 50 `search_results` objects. All other output parameters are ignored.

#### The search_results object {#search-results-object}

Field

Description

Type

Required

`external_ref`

A unique identifier for referencing within the search results. See [`external_ref` object](#external-ref-object).

object

Required

`title`

A concise headline label.

string

Required

`description`

Description of the search results. A cropped version of this description is used to help users identify the search results. In the case of AI answers, the entire description will be fed to the LLM to provide helpful information in natural language.

string

Required

`link`

URI to allow users to navigate to the source of the search results.

string

Required

`date_updated`

The creation date or last updated date of the search results in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format.

string

Required

`content`

Detailed content of search results. If provided, AI answers will use alongside `title` and `description` to generate more comprehensive search answers.

string

Optional

#### The external_ref object {#external-ref-object}

Field

Description

Type

Required

`id`

A unique identifier for referencing within the search results. If your app implements [Work Objects](/messaging/work-objects-overview#enterprise-search), this should be same value used for that implementation.

string

Required

`type`

An optional internal type for entity in the source system. Only needed if the ID is not globally unique or needed when retrieving the item.

string

Optional

### Invocations {#invocations}

The search function specified by the `search_function_callback_id` is triggered when users perform searches or modify search filters.

Slack caches successful search results for each user and query, for up to three minutes. Since search AI answers are generated from the search results, AI answers are also cached for those three minutes.

## Adding optional search filters {#adding-search-filters}

Apps can define a single custom step function that provides search filters available to users and passes them to the search function. The function's `callback_id` should be set as the `search_filters_function_callback_id` in the app manifest.

### Input parameters (2) {#input-parameters-search-filters}

Field

Description

Type

Required

\*

Any input parameter with type [`slack#/types/user_context`](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/reference/slack-types/#usercontext) regardless of their field will be set to the `user_context` value of the user executing the search

[`slack#/types/user_context`](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/reference/slack-types/#usercontext)

Optional

### Output parameters (2) {#output-parameters-search-filters}

The function must define an output parameter named `filter` of the `slack#/types/search_filters` type. The `slack#/types/search_filters` type is an array of up to 5 `filter` objects. Any other output parameters will be ignored by search operations.

#### The filter object {#filter-object}

Field

Description

Type

Required

`name`

A machine-readable unique name set by the developer to reference in the search function.

string

Required

`display_name`

A human-readable name describing the filter in the search user interface.

string

Required

`display_name_plural`

This is optional when the filter type is `multi_select`. When multiple options are selected, the filter label will use `display_name_plural`. If not provided, the filter label will use `display_name` instead.

string

Optional

`type`

Can be `multi_select` or toggle.

string

Required

`options`

An array of options used to define the context of a `select`, `multi_select`, or `dropdown`. See [`option` object](#option-object).

object

Required if type is `multi_select`, otherwise optional.

#### The option object {#option-object}

Field

Description

Type

Required

`name`

A human-readable name describing the filter in the search user interface.

string

Required

`value`

A unique identifier set by the developer to resolve in the search function.

string

Required

### Invocations (2) {#invocations}

When a user selects the app in the search window and views its results, the function defined as `search_filters_function_callback_id` is called. Slack doesn't expect these filters to change while the user is in the same search context. For this reason, once the filters are received, they will be cached and the function won't be called again until the search context changes.

Slack caches successful filter results for each user for up to three minutes.

## Handling events {#handling-events}

To ensure fast search results delivery, apps must handle `function_executed` events synchronously. This means the app must complete the function's execution and and provide output parameters before acknowledging the event. This allows Slack to provide a snappy search experience to end users.

For optimal search response times we recommend the following implementation:

1. Your app receives the `function_executed` event request.

2. Your app completes the function execution by sending a request to the `functions.completeSuccess` or `functions.completeError` API method.

    * These methods notify Slack when a `function_executed` event completes.
    * The [`functions.completeSuccess`](/reference/methods/functions.completeSuccess/) API method informs Slack that the event completed successfully and provides all search results found by the app.
    * The [`functions.completeError`](/reference/methods/functions.completeError/) API method provides Slack with a user-friendly error message and informs Slack that the `function_executed` event completed with an error. The error message provided by your app will be displayed to the user on the search page. It can be any plain text value with links you think could be insightful to the user. For example: _Authentication Required: Please visit [https://getauthhere.slack.dev](https://getauthhere.slack.dev) to authenticate your account._
    * Both methods will invalidate the provided workflow token, but apps can still use their bot tokens.
3. Your app acknowledges the event by responding to the event request.

    * Your app must complete the function execution within 10 seconds.

## Implementing Enterprise Search using Bolt {#implement-search}

You can implement Enterprise Search using the Bolt framework for Node or Python.

### Bolt for Python {#bolt-py}

When using Bolt for Python, developers can gain more control over the search function's [acknowledgment behavior](/tools/bolt-python/concepts/acknowledge/) by setting two key parameters:

Set parameter

Notes

`auto_acknowledge=False`

This gives developers manual control over invoking `ack()`.

`ack_timeout=10`

This extends the default timeout from 3 to 10 seconds.

Additionally, the `complete` and `fail` helper functions provide developers with a way to report success or failure back to Slack — they invoke the [`functions.completeSuccess`](/reference/methods/functions.completeSuccess/) and [`functions.completeError`](/reference/methods/functions.completeError/) API methods.

#### Sample app {#sample-app-py}

To create a sample app in Python using the available template, refer to the sample app's [readme](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-python-search-template?tab=readme-ov-file#using-slack-cli).

### Bolt for Node {#bolt-node}

When using TypeScript or JavaScript, developers can gain more control over the search function's [acknowledgment behavior](/tools/bolt-js/concepts/acknowledge) by setting one parameter:

Set parameter

Notes

`auto_acknowledge=False`

This gives developers manual control over invoking `ack()`.

This is particularly useful when using [Socket Mode](/tools/bolt-js/concepts/socket-mode/), or when you need to handle the `function_executed` event within the default 3-second timeout.

#### Sample app (2) {#sample-app-js}

To create a sample app in TypeScript using the available template, refer to the sample app's [readme](https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-ts-search-template?tab=readme-ov-file#using-slack-cli).
