# Removing the Slack CLI deno command

February 27, 2025

We [previously](/changelog/2023/12/14/slack-cli) mentioned that we had deprecated the `deno` command and removed its listing from the `help` command. We have now removed the `deno` command completely. Developers who were depending on this command should now use the deno executable directly.

We've also removed support for the deprecated, pre-release Deno Slack SDK versions that used `slack.yaml` and `project.ts` files. The Run-on-Slack platform no longer supports the `slack.yaml` file format, and no production projects should be affected. The `project.ts` file was deprecated by the Deno Slack SDK in favor of `manifest.ts` and `manifest.json` files.
