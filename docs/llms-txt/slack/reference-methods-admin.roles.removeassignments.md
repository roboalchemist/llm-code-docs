## Arguments {#arguments}

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`role_id`**`string`Required

ID of the role to which users will be assigned

_Example:_ `R0001`

**`entity_ids`**`array`Required

List of the entity IDs for which roles will be revoked. These can be Org IDs, Team IDs or Channel IDs

_Example:_ `['T00000001', 'E00000002']`

**`user_ids`**`array`Required

List of IDs of the users whose roles will be revoked

_Example:_ `['U00000001', 'U00000002', 'U00000003']`

## Usage info {#usage-info}

Use `admin.roles.removeAssignments` to revoke role assignments for specific users and entities across the your entire organization.

The API will remove role assignments for all user IDs specified in `user_ids` for all org, team, or channel IDs specified in `entities`. In cases where an invalid user or other entity ID is passed, the ID will be rejected and details (including the reason for the rejection) will be provided in the respective `rejected_users` and/or `rejected_entities` response.

### Utilizing Admin API endpoints {#admin-api-endpoints}

This admin scope is obtained through version two of the OAuth V2 flow, but there are a few additional requirements. The app requesting this scope must be installed by an admin or Owner of an Enterprise organization. Also, the app must be installed on the entire org, not on an individual workspace. See below for more details.

If the app is installed by an Org Admin or Owner, ensure the Channel Management settings provide the appropriate permissions. The Org Admin or Owner installing the app must have the **Channel Management** role, and must also be granted access to **Public channels** and **Private channels** within this role. If these criteria aren't met, the Org Admin or Owner will receive a `not_allowed` error when attempting to install an app.

Admin API endpoints reach across **an entire Enterprise organization**, not individual workspaces.

For a token to be imbued with Admin scopes, it must be obtained from installing an app on the **entire Enterprise org**, not just a workspace within the organization.

To configure and install an app supporting Admin API endpoints on your Enterprise organization:

1. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps). Your app will need to be able to handle a standard [OAuth 2 flow](/authentication/installing-with-oauth).
2. In the app's settings, select **OAuth & Permissions** from the left navigation. Scroll down to the section titled **Scopes** and add the `admin.*` scope you want. Click the **Save Changes** button.
3. In the app's settings, select **Manage Distribution** from the left navigation. Under the section titled **Share Your App with Other Workspaces**, make sure all four sections have the green check. Then click the green **Activate Public Distribution** button.
4. Under the **Share Your App with Your Workspace** section, copy the **Sharable URL** and paste it into a browser to initiate the OAuth handshake that will install the app on your organization. You must be logged in as an **admin or Owner** of your Enterprise organization to install the app.
5. Check the dropdown in the upper right of the installation screen to make sure you are installing the app on the organization, not an individual workspace within the organization. See the image below for a visual.
6. Once your app completes the OAuth flow, you will be granted an OAuth token that can be used for calling Admin API methods for your organization.

_When installing an app to use an Admin API endpoint, be sure to install it on your Enterprise organization, not a workspace within the organization._

## Response {#response}

#### This returns an ok: true response letting you know you have successfully removed the user(s) to the assigned role(s)

```json

{  "ok": true}

#### Typical error response if at least one role scope was invalid for the role you were removing. In the example you can see the Enterprise ID is what is causing the issue

```json

{  "ok": false,  "error": "failed_for_some_entities",  "rejected_entities": [    {      "id": "E123ABC456",      "error": "invalid_auth"    }  ]}

## Errors {#errors}

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
