# Release: Slack CLI v2.21.0

April 4, 2024

Version `2.21.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has sprung!

* You can now display runtime versions for your application's execution environment using the `doctor` hook. To enjoy the improved `slack doctor` command experience, existing Deno Slack SDK-based apps must have their `deno-slack-hooks` dependency upgraded to the latest version (`v1.3.0`).
* By relying only on the `get-manifest` hook when attempting to get a manifest rather than checking for a `slack.yaml` file, we now surface any errors that are returned when getting the manifest.
* We removed the possibility of an error when generating the message boundary hook protocol, and now preserve spacing in logged outputs.
* We corrected a few typos behind the scenes.
