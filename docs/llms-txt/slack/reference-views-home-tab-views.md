# Home tab views

The Home tab is available only for Bolt apps, not [apps created with the Deno Slack SDK](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/). Home tab view objects are used within the [`views.publish`](/reference/methods/views.publish) [Web API](/apis/web-api/) method.

Non-standard characters (including characters with diacritics) within view objects are converted and sent in unicode format when you receive the view callback payloads.

Preserving `input` entry in views

Data entered or selected in `input` blocks can be preserved while updating views. The new `view` that you use with `views.update` should contain the same input blocks and elements with identical `block_id` and `action_id` values.
