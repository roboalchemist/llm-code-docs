# Managing workflow and connector permissions

The features within are only available to Slack workspaces on an Enterprise plan.

While Workspace Admins and Org Admins can manage workflow permissions and approval requests from the admin settings site dashboard, they may find using the API directly for these actions is more efficient, especially when it comes to bulk actions.

Each of the methods outlined here accepts an OAuth user token with the specified scope. If you're working with a classic app, read more about authorization [here](/authentication/installing-with-oauth), and if you're exploring new frontiers with workflows, read more about authorization [here](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/integrating-with-services-requiring-external-authentication).

Read on to discover the API methods that help admins manage [workflows](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/creating-workflows), [functions](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/creating-custom-functions), and [connectors](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/reference/connector-functions) in their org.
