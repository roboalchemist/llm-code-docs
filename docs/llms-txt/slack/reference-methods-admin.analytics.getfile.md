`application/json`

**Rate Limits**[Tier 2: 20+ per minute](/apis/web-api/rate-limits)

## Arguments {#arguments}

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`type`**`string`Required

The type of analytics to retrieve. The options are currently limited to `member` (for Enterprise org member analytics) and `public_channel` (for public channel analytics).

_Example:_ `member`

### Optional arguments

**`date`**Optional

Date to retrieve the analytics data for, expressed as `YYYY-MM-DD` in UTC. Required unless `metadata_only` is set to true.

_Example:_ `2020-09-01`

**`metadata_only`**`boolean`Optional

Retrieve metadata for the `type` of analytics indicated. Can be used only with `type` set to `public_channel` analytics. See [detail below](#metadata_only). Omit the `date` parameter when using this argument.

_Default:_ `false`

_Example:_ `true`

## Usage info {#usage-info}

This method returns [member](#member_analytics_fields) and [conversation](#conversation_analytics_fields) analytics data presented as new-line delimited JSON files, compressed with _gzip_.

Each response contains a file with analytics data for a single day.

As of February 2023, analytics data is available on a rolling 13-month basis.

If you recently upgraded from a Free or Pro plan, you will only have access to data starting from when you upgraded (the 13 months of historical data will not immediately apply). Once you've been on a Business+, Select/Compliance, or plan for 13 months, the data will become available on a rolling 13-month basis.

Historical data is not recomputed when a workspace and its accompanying member engagement data is added to or removed from an organization. Similarly, if a member is removed from a workspace, the data returned by the API will not update historical engagement data to reflect only the workspaces the member is currently a part of. This behavior **differs** from the _Analytics Dashboard_ in Org and Team settings, which does consider historical changes in its calculation of 30 day and all time metrics.

The `date` argument is **required** when requesting daily analytics data. It represents the date in UTC corresponding to the analytics data you're requesting. Omit this argument when setting `metadata_only` to `true`, as metadata cannot be filtered by date.

When setting `type` to `public_channel`, you may also use the `metadata_only` boolean argument, which changes the response entirely to give you metadata about the public channels appearing in your conversation analytics. Omit the `date` parameter when using this mode.

### Practical usage example {#usage_example}

To quickly decompress a file and view the JSON directly, use a cURL command like:

```text

curl "{%BASE_API_URL%}/api/admin.analytics.getFile" -d "date=2020-11-03&type=member" | gunzip -c > member_analytics_2020_11_03.json

...and you'll have a `member_analytics_2020_11_03.json` file in the current operating directory. In some organizations the decompressed size can be quite large. Take care that you have the disk or memory space you need to store and process these files.

Here's an example for conversation analytics:

```text

curl "{%BASE_API_URL%}/api/admin.analytics.getFile" -d "date=2021-01-04&type=public_channel" | gunzip -c > public_channel_analytics_2021_01_04.json

And another for channel metadata to accompany that conversation analytics request—note that we omit `date`.

```text

curl "{%BASE_API_URL%}/api/admin.analytics.getFile" -d "type=public_channel&metadata_only=true" | gunzip -c > public_channel_metadata_2021_01_04.json

* * *

## Response {#response}

#### A gzipped new-line delimited JSON file presented with a Content-type: application/gzip HTTP header. An example file name is Slack Corp Member Analytics 2020-08-01.json.gz

```text

""

#### Typical Web API error response is a JSON response with a Content-type: application/json HTTP header

```json

{  "ok": false,  "error": "org_level_email_display_disabled"}

This method is almost completely unlike other [Web API](/apis/web-api/) methods you encounter. It doesn't return `application/json` with the traditional `"ok": true` response on success, though you'll find `"ok": false` on failure.

Instead, it returns a single file, often very large, containing JSON objects that are separated by newlines and then compressed with `application/gzip`.

To open the successful response and utilize the data, you must first store and decompress the response. Some tools may parse new line-separated JSON for you with ease, while other tools will require that you first split each new line separated "row" into its own separate JSON object before being deserialized. After decompression, the file returned in the response will look something like the following, depending on the type of analytics requested.

### Member analytics response {#member_response}

Here are 3 example lines of JSON you would find after decompressing a member analytics file. Each line provides information about a different user.

```json

{"enterprise_id":"E5UBAR8CH","date":"2020-10-05","user_id":"W0POSID23ID","email_address":"rbrautigan@example.org","is_guest":false,"is_billable_seat":false,"is_active":false,"is_active_ios":false,"is_active_android":false,"is_active_desktop":false,"reactions_added_count":0,"messages_posted_count":0,"channel_messages_posted_count":0,"files_added_count":0,"is_active_apps":true,"is_active_workflows":true,"is_active_slack_connect":true,"total_calls_count":15,"slack_calls_count":12,"slack_huddles_count":3,"search_count":223,"date_claimed":1584810430}{"enterprise_id":"E5UBAR8CH","date":"2020-10-05","user_id":"W1ZOSID3ZI2","email_address":"gstein@example.org","is_guest":false,"is_billable_seat":true,"is_active":true,"is_active_ios":false,"is_active_android":false,"is_active_desktop":true,"reactions_added_count":23,"messages_posted_count":123,"channel_messages_posted_count":23,"files_added_count":3,"is_active_apps":false,"is_active_workflows":true,"is_active_slack_connect":false,"total_calls_count":10,"slack_calls_count":4,"slack_huddles_count":5,"search_count":1001,"date_claimed":1584810520}{"enterprise_id":"E5UBAR8CH","date":"2020-10-05","user_id":"W3DOSZD23IP","email_address":"obutler@example.org","is_guest":false,"is_billable_seat":true,"is_active":true,"is_active_ios":true,"is_active_android":false,"is_active_desktop":false,"reactions_added_count":521,"messages_posted_count":5,"channel_messages_posted_count":5,"files_added_count":0,"is_active_apps":true,"is_active_workflows":true,"is_active_slack_connect":false,"total_calls_count":3,"slack_calls_count":3,"slack_huddles_count":0,"search_count":32,"date_claimed":1584810510}

To be extra helpful, here's one of those lines formatted a little prettier:

```json

{ "enterprise_id": "E5UBAR8CH", "date": "2020-10-05", "user_id": "W3DOSZD23IP", "email_address": "obutler@example.org", "is_guest": false, "is_billable_seat": true, "is_active": true, "is_active_ios": true, "is_active_android": false, "is_active_desktop": false, "reactions_added_count": 521, "messages_posted_count": 5, "channel_messages_posted_count": 5, "files_added_count": 0, "is_active_apps": true, "is_active_workflows": true, "is_active_slack_connect": false, "total_calls_count": 10, "slack_calls_count": 3, "slack_huddles_count": 5, "search_count": 32, "date_claimed": 1584810510}

### Public channel analytics response {#public_channel_response}

This example shows 3 lines of decompressed public channel analytics. Each line provides information about activity in a single public channel.

```json

{"enterprise_id":"EJB3MZFLM","team_id":"EJB3MZFLM","originating_team":{"team_id":"T5J3Q04QZ","name":"postmodernity"},"channel_id":"CNGL0KGG1","date_created":1555111593,"date_last_active":1684820530,"total_members_count":7,"full_members_count":6,"guest_member_count":1,"messages_posted_count":223,"messages_posted_by_members_count":80,"members_who_viewed_count":225,"members_who_posted_count":3,"reactions_added_count":23,"visibility":"public","channel_type":"single_workspace_channel","is_shared_externally":false,"shared_with":[],"externally_shared_with_organizations":[],"date":"2020-11-14"}{"enterprise_id":"EJB3MZFLM","team_id":"EJB3MZFLM","originating_team":{"team_id":"T3J3A04QB","name":"modernity"},"channel_id":"CNGG2KB92","date_created":1358111593,"date_last_active":1452719593,"total_members_count":227,"full_members_count":227,"guest_member_count":0,"messages_posted_count":1138,"messages_posted_by_members_count":1137,"members_who_viewed_count":226,"members_who_posted_count":7,"reactions_added_count":7212,"visibility":"public","channel_type":"single_workspace_channel","is_shared_externally":true,"shared_with":[],"externally_shared_with_organizations":[],"date":"2020-11-14"}{"enterprise_id":"EJB3MZFLM","team_id":"EJB3MZFLM","originating_team":{"team_id":"EJB3MZFLM","name":"arcane-enterprise"},"channel_id":"CNGZ5K595","date_created":1355111593,"date_last_active":1452719593,"total_members_count":5,"full_members_count":4,"guest_member_count":1,"messages_posted_count":1,"messages_posted_by_members_count":1,"members_who_viewed_count":5,"members_who_posted_count":1,"reactions_added_count":1,"visibility":"public","channel_type":"multi_workspace_channel","is_shared_externally":true,"shared_with":[{"team_id":"T5J3Q04QA","name":"scifi"},{"team_id":"EJB3MZFLM","name":"arcane-enterprise"}],"externally_shared_with_organizations":[{"name":"Away Org","domain":"away.enterprise.slack.com"}],"date":"2020-11-14"}

And here's just one line of that formatted in a friendly fashion:

```json

{ "enterprise_id": "EJB3MZFLM", "team_id": "EJB3MZFLM", "originating_team": {  "team_id": "EJB3MZFLM",  "name": "arcane-enterprise" }, "channel_id": "CNGZ5K595", "date_created": 1355111593, "date_last_active": 1452719593, "total_members_count": 5, "full_members_count": 4, "guest_member_count": 1, "messages_posted_count": 1, "messages_posted_by_members_count": 1, "members_who_viewed_count": 5, "members_who_posted_count": 1, "reactions_added_count": 1, "visibility": "public", "channel_type": "multi_workspace_channel", "is_shared_externally": false, "shared_with": [  {   "team_id": "T5J3Q04QA",   "name": "scifi"  },  {   "team_id": "EJB3MZFLM",   "name": "arcane-enterprise"  } ], "externally_shared_with_organizations": [  {   "name": "Away Org",   "domain": "away.enterprise.slack.com"  } ], "date": "2020-11-14"}

### Public channel metadata response {#metadata_response}

Uncompressed, you'll find each public channel's metadata on a single line like so:

```json

{"channel_id":"CNGL0K091","name":"tomorrow","topic":"I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today","description":"What do you want to do tomorrow?","date":"2020-11-14"}{"channel_id":"CNGG2KB92","name":"announcements","topic":"What's new with what you do","description":"Company announcements, edicts, and mandates","date":"2020-11-14"}{"channel_id":"CNGZ5K595","name":"teds","topic":"'No you meant the other ted' - @ted","description":"A channel just for teds, by teds.","date":"2020-11-14"}

And here's that last one printed pretty for you:

```json

{ "channel_id": "CNGZ5K595", "name": "teds", "topic": "'No you meant the other ted' - @ted", "description": "A channel just for teds, by teds.", "date": "2020-11-14"}

The response format changes depending on which type of analytics you're retrieving.

### Public channel metadata {#metadata_only}

If you're retrieving conversation analytics but want to know more than just the ID of each channel, you can issue a separate request to retrieve bulk metadata about the public channels in the analytics report.

The response is in line-delimited JSON, similar to all other responses in this method, with each line containing an object with these fields. The same [`admin.analytics:read`](/reference/scopes/admin.analytics.read) scope used typically in this method is all you need to retrieve this data.

The channel's unique identifier—the very same used in the analytics above

`C123ABC456`

`name`

The latest name of the channel

`ama`

`topic`

The latest channel topic

`Are Jesse's paragraphs too long?`

`description`

A longer description about the purpose of the channel

`Ask our editors all about their favorite literature`

`date`

These details are current as of this date, which is also when you're making this API call
