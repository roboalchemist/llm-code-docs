Private file behaviour's ATT&CK techniques

The *attack\_techniques* relationship returns the ***attack techniques observed in the behaviour report***.

This relationship can be retrieved by using the [relationships API endpoint](https://virustotal.readme.io/reference/get-private-file-behaviours-relationship). The response contains a list of [attack technique](https://virustotal.readme.io/reference/attack-techniques) objects.

Additionally, each related item contains the following context attributes:

* `signatures`: <*list of dictionaries*> behaviours observed in the file where this technique applies. Each of these signatures contains the following subfields:
  * `severity`: <*string*> severity of the behaviour (UNKNOWN, INFO, LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH).
  * `description`: <*string*> description of the behaviour.

This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. \nAdversaries may use several methods to accomplish Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion such as checking for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark, etc.) or other system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. Additional methods include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating within a temporary sandbox."
