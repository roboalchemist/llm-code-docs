# files_dropped

Interesting files written to disk during execution.

`files_dropped` contains a list of all **files are files specifically created and written to during an execution recording**. These might be the result of downloading content from the Internet and writing it to a file, unpacking a given file from the execution subject's body, dumping some content to a file, etc.

The object contains a *list of dictionaries*, each one containing the following subfields:

* `path ` <*string*> required. Full path, file name included.
* `sha256` <*string*> required.  File's SHA-256 hash.
