Metadata produced by Wireshark when acting on the file.

`wireshark` contains metadata produced by the [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) tool when acting on the file. Only available for PCAP network captures.

The object contains the following fields:

* `dns`: <*list of lists*> list containing DNS requests and their resolutions. Every sublist contains two items:
  * <*string*> domain name to resolve
  * <*list of strings*> IP addresses to which the domain resolved.
* `pcap`: PCAP capture metadata:
  * `Capture duration`: <*string*> duration in seconds.
  * `Data size`: <*string*> human readable size of the PCAP file.
  * `End time`: <*string*> date when the capture was stopped in `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` [format](http://strftime.org/).
  * `File encapsulation`: <*string*> file encapsulation.
  * `File type`: <*string*> file type (usually `pcap`).
  * `Number of packets`: <*string*> human readable number of packets in the network capture.
  * `Start time`: <*string*> date when the capture was started in `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` [format](http://strftime.org/).
