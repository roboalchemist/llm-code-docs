# GitLab 18.7: Advancing AI and Automation with GitLab Duo, CI/CD Innovations, and Enhanced Security
<h2 id="whats-new-in-gitlab-187-pushing-the-boundaries-of-ai-and-automation">What&rsquo;s New in GitLab 18.7: Pushing the Boundaries of AI and Automation</h2>
<p>The December 2024 release of <strong>GitLab 18.7</strong> marks another significant advancement in the DevSecOps platform’s integration of AI and automation, with a sharper focus on productivity, efficiency, and robust security. In this release, GitLab unveils key updates to its AI-powered capabilities to help teams deliver software faster and with greater confidence.</p>
<p>Leading the charge is the <strong>GitLab Duo Chat</strong>, now entering General Availability. This built-in AI assistant is embedded across multiple stages of the software development lifecycle, offering real-time guidance for writing code, resolving security vulnerabilities, and managing complex tasks—all within the GitLab user interface. Duo Chat leverages context-awareness to ensure better suggestions directly aligned with your project’s current state.</p>
<p>Also included in 18.7 is <strong>Duo Code Suggestions</strong> for self-managed GitLab Ultimate customers, giving developers intelligent code completions in their IDE using AI models trained on publicly available code. Combined with GitLab’s end-to-end platform, this ensures sensitive data stays secure while boosting development productivity.</p>
<p>The expanded <strong>CI/CD component catalog</strong> facilitates standardisation and reusability for internal workflows, enabling faster delivery and enhanced maintainability. GitLab is also introducing <strong>next-gen CI/CD pipelines</strong> that are more flexible, scalable, and designed to reduce complexity in large environments.</p>
<p>Security remains a core focus, with usability improvements to Vulnerability Management, support for <strong>Push Protection</strong> on any branch, and new dependency scanning capabilities. In Governance, enhanced compliance controls help teams enforce policies for SAST scan validations and audit API token usage.</p>
<p>Further enhancements span improved code review experiences, new Visual Review tools in Review Apps, and stronger language support through built-in Python and Java runtime detection.</p>
