# GitLab 18.5.2 Patch Release Now Available
<h2 id="gitlab-1852-patch-release-now-available">GitLab 18.5.2 Patch Release Now Available</h2>
<p>We’re pleased to announce the immediate availability of GitLab 18.5.2, the latest patch release in the 18.5 series. This release addresses a range of critical bug fixes and performance improvements, ensuring your GitLab environment stays secure and stable. As always, we recommend that all customers running 18.5.0 or later update to GitLab 18.5.2 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Included in this version are important fixes for issues affecting merge request filtering, pipeline execution behaviour, and UI regressions. In particular, an error in filtering merge requests by label has now been corrected, improving usability and project navigation for teams. Additionally, performance optimisations have been introduced in the background job processing for continuous integration (CI), ensuring smoother operations for high-demand environments.</p>
<p>This update also resolves user interface glitches that appeared after upgrading to 18.5.0, restoring expected behaviours and visual consistency. As part of GitLab’s ongoing commitment to product quality, our development team continues to release these maintenance-level updates to prevent downtime and improve user productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade Guidance:</strong> We strongly recommend users of GitLab 18.5.0 and 18.5.1 to upgrade to this release immediately. Patch versions are designed to be low-risk and easy to apply without downtime when managed appropriately.</p>
