# What’s New in Git 2.52
<h2 id="git-252-released-smarter-faster-and-more-secure">Git 2.52 Released: Smarter, Faster, and More Secure</h2>
<p>The release of Git 2.52 brings a series of enhancements that offer a smarter, faster, and more secure version control experience. Developers using Git across the globe will appreciate the increased performance, the quality-of-life improvements, and more comprehensive command behaviours that build on the robustness of the CLI tool.</p>
<h3 id="configurable-hooks-and-new-defaults">Configurable Hooks and New Defaults</h3>
<p>With version 2.52, Git introduces an easier mechanism to configure its built-in hook templates. This makes managing and sharing team-wide Git hooks more efficient. A new configuration option, <code>core.hooksPath</code>, allows clearer use of alternate paths, enhancing automation and security.</p>
<h3 id="performance-boosts-on-large-repositories">Performance Boosts on Large Repositories</h3>
<p>New internal optimisations deliver faster operations when working with massive repositories. Command responsiveness, especially during <code>git status</code> and <code>git commit</code>, has been improved, reducing waiting time during daily commits.</p>
<h3 id="more-intuitive-user-experience">More Intuitive User Experience</h3>
<p>The CLI has become even more intuitive. Commands like <code>git switch</code> and <code>git restore</code> now provide clearer explanations when encountering ambiguous usage. Additionally, template cleanups have streamlined outputs for clarity without sacrificing functionality.</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-focused-enhancements">Enterprise-Focused Enhancements</h3>
<p>Git 2.52 makes essential security and performance upgrades particularly relevant for large scale deployments in the enterprise environment. This includes better compatibility with git-daemon setups and improved object access verification during large clone operations.</p>
