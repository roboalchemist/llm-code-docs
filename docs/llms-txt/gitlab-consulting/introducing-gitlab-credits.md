# GitLab Credits Now Available: Streamline Billing and Resource Usage
<h2 id="introducing-gitlab-credits-a-simpler-way-to-manage-your-gitlab-account">Introducing GitLab Credits: A Simpler Way to Manage Your GitLab Account</h2>
<p>GitLab has launched a new, flexible purchasing system called <strong>GitLab Credits</strong>. Designed to streamline the way you manage and allocate spending on GitLab.com, GitLab Credits offer a centralised balance you can use for a variety of services including CI minutes, storage, and user seats. This innovation especially benefits organisations seeking more efficient and adaptable ways to manage and scale DevSecOps usage.</p>
<p>Credits act as a digital wallet, allowing for consolidated billing and transparency across your organisation’s GitLab usage. Whether you&rsquo;re purchasing additional CI/CD minutes or handling overages for storage and users, GitLab Credits provide greater flexibility and financial control. Users can now top up their Credit balance directly via the GitLab customer portal with integrated tax compliance, enhancing global access and ease of use.</p>
<p>The Credits system also allows teams to avoid pre-purchasing specific quantities of individual resources in advance. Instead, funds can be added — either manually or via recurring top-up options — and automatically allocated based on real usage, significantly reducing administrative burden and helping teams plan budgets more effectively.</p>
