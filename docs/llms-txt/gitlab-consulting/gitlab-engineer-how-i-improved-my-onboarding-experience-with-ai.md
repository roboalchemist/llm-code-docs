# How AI Transformed a GitLab Engineer’s Onboarding Experience
<h2 id="revolutionising-gitlab-onboarding-with-ai-a-new-engineers-journey">Revolutionising GitLab Onboarding with AI: A New Engineer&rsquo;s Journey</h2>
<p>Starting a new role can feel like stepping into a whirlwind—especially at a fast-paced, all-remote company like GitLab. But what if onboarding could be smoother, smarter, and faster? That’s exactly what one new engineer at GitLab achieved by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) tools to turbocharge their early days on the job.</p>
<p>In a compelling vignette shared by GitLab, a newly onboarded engineer details how they used GitLab’s own AI assistant and other AI-driven features to boost their productivity from day one. Navigating documentation, understanding complex codebases, and resolving issues became significantly more efficient with AI acting as a mentor and co-pilot.</p>
<p>Rather than relying solely on human interaction or manual searches, they asked the AI for contextual explanations of merge requests, summaries of issues, and clarifications on internal processes. This reduced lag time and allowed them to add value more quickly to their team.</p>
<p>The experience highlights the transformative potential of AI not only for onboarding but for retaining knowledge across an organisation. As more businesses explore DevSecOps tools that incorporate intelligent agents, GitLab proves yet again why it’s a leader in innovation.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re onboarding new team members in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, the United Kingdom, or elsewhere, AI-driven onboarding can save time and raise team efficiency.</p>
