# Beware of Fake GitLab Job Scams Imitating Official Recruiters
<h2 id="alert-rising-wave-of-fake-job-scams-misusing-gitlabs-brand">Alert: Rising Wave of Fake Job Scams Misusing GitLab&rsquo;s Brand</h2>
<p>In recent months, there has been a significant increase in fraudulent job offers falsely claiming to be from GitLab or endorsed recruiters. These scams are targeting job seekers across online platforms like LinkedIn and job boards, imitating GitLab&rsquo;s recruitment process to steal personal data or money. It is important to stay vigilant and informed to avoid falling victim.</p>
<p>Impersonators often use convincing emails, professional-looking offer letters, and even spoofed GitLab logos to gain a victim&rsquo;s trust. They may push for urgent action or request sensitive data such as passports, bank details, or payment for equipment. GitLab has reported these instances to relevant legal authorities and domain hosts to dismantle phishing domains, but these scams continue to evolve.</p>
<p>GitLab emphasises that it will <strong>never</strong>: ask for payment during the hiring process; communicate exclusively via messaging apps; or send offer letters from email accounts outside the <code>@gitlab.com</code> domain. All legitimate job opportunities are listed on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/jobs">gitlab.com/jobs</a>.</p>
<p>IDEA GitLab Solutions urges professionals across the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, North Macedonia, the UK and our global support locations including Israel, South Africa and Paraguay to remain cautious. If in doubt, verify any offer by contacting GitLab directly through official channels or reach out to <a href="https://gitlab.consulting/en-gb/?mtm_campaign=internal-blog-link&amp;mtm_kwd=en-gb:new-wave-of-fake-job-scams-impersonating-recruiters">IDEA GitLab Solutions</a> for advice on legitimate GitLab career paths, licensing, or consulting services.</p>
<p>If you suspect fraud, report it to the platform where it occurred, and notify GitLab via <a href="mailto:abuse@gitlab.com">abuse@gitlab.com</a>.</p>
<p>Stay informed, stay safe, and remember that legitimate job opportunities at GitLab are always transparent and trustworthy.</p>
