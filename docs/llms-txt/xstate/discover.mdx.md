Are you seeking inspiration for your machine? Or do you want to learn how somebody else models their machines? The [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) lists all the public machines created in Stately Studio.

With the search feature, you can quickly filter your results by the number of states in a machine and whether the machineâs creator used [Stately Studioâs editor](https://stately.ai/editor) or our older [Viz](https://stately.ai/viz) tool. Each machine listed details its creator, number of states, and a link to view and edit the machine in the editor.

## Export and fork public machines

When viewing somebody elseâs machine, you canât make changes. You can fork the machine to create an editable copy inside your **My Projects**.
