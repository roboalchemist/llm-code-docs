The [Stately Visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz) is a tool for creating and inspecting statecharts to visualize the state of your applications. You can use the viz as a playground for exploring XStateâs capabilities.

<Callout type="warning">
  The XState Visualizer is deprecated and is no longer maintained.
</Callout>

We recommend you only continue using the legacy visualizer if you need to execute actions and guards or visualize multiple machines simultaneously. These features are coming to the [Stately editor](studio) very soon.

## Use the Visualizer

* [Take me to the Visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz)
* [Try the Visualizer in Inspect mode](https://stately.ai/viz?inspect).

The Visualizer is deprecated and we encourage you to migrate your projects to use the [Stately editor](studio).
