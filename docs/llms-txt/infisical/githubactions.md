> How to sync secrets from Infisical to GitHub Actions

<Note>
  Use our [GitHub Secret Syncs](../secret-syncs/github) to sync secrets to GitHub at the organization-level, repository-level, and repository environment-level.
  Alternatively, you can use Infisical's official GitHub Action [here](https://github.com/Infisical/secrets-action).
