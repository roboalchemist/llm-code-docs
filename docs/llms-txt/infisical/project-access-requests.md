# Project Access Requests

> Learn how to request access to projects in Infisical.

The Project Access Request feature allows users to view all projects within organization, including those they don't currently have access to.
Users can request access to these projects by submitting a request that automatically notifies project administrators via email, along with any comments provided by the user.

# Viewing Available Projects

1. Navigate to the main dashboard after logging in
2. The overview page for each product displays two tabs:

   * **My Projects**: Projects you currently have access to
   * **All Projects**: Complete list of projects in the organization
