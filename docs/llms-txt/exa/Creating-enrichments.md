**Open the enrichment modal**

<Tip>
  Use the chat: you can add enrichments by prompting directly in the Chat! Or click on "Add Enrichment" in the top-right corner.
</Tip>

**Fill in your prompt:** Prompt the AI generator to have our agent fill in the fields for you, or fill in the enrichment type, title and prompt directly.

**Enrichment types:** text, contact information (email & phone number), date, number, options (think of these as tags!)

<Tip>

  * "Create a custom email based on this company's main product"- Text

  * "Give me this candidate's years of experience" - Number

  * "Find any public data on this company's revenue or valuation" - Text

  * "What is the most powerful data point mentioned in each research paper?" - Text
