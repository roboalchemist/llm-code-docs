# Delete a Webhook

> Remove a webhook from your account. Once deleted, the webhook stops getting notifications right away and cannot be brought back.

Important notes: - The webhook stops working as soon as you delete it - You cannot undo this - you'll need to create a new webhook if you want it back - Any notifications currently being sent may still complete
