# Create a task

> Create an asynchronous research task that explores the web, gathers sources, synthesizes findings, and returns results with citations. Can be used to generate:
1. Structured JSON matching an `outputSchema` you provide.
2. A detailed markdown report when no schema is provided.

The API responds immediately with a `researchId` for polling completion status. For more details, see [Exa Research](/reference/exa-research).

Alternatively, you can use the OpenAI compatible [chat completions interface](/reference/chat-completions#research).
