# New Deep Search Type

> Introducing Exa Deep: Get better results with smart query expansion and high-quality summaries.

***

**Date: November 20, 2025**

We're excited to introduce **Exa Deep** - a new search type that finds better results by running multiple searches at once and gives you high-quality context for each result. You can send just one query (we'll create variations automatically) or provide your own query variations using the `additionalQueries` parameter for even better results.

<Info>
  Deep search is available on our API Playground. [Try Deep search in the dashboard →](https://dashboard.exa.ai/playground/search?q=blog%20post%20about%20AI\&filters=%7B%22text%22%3A%22true%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22deep%22%2C%22livecrawl%22%3A%22fallback%22%7D)

### How Deep Search Works

When you use Deep search, here's what happens:

1. **Query Expansion**: If you only send one query, we automatically create variations. If you send query variations yourself using `additionalQueries`, we use those instead. For best results, consider having a good LLM model (like GPT-5 or Claude 4.5 Sonnet) generate the query variations for you.
2. **Parallel Search**: We search for your main query and all variations at the same time
3. **Smart Ranking**: We combine and rank all results to give you the most relevant ones
4. **Summary Generation**: Each result gets a detailed, accurate summary

### How to Use Deep Search

Using Deep search is simple - just add `type="deep"` to your search requests. You can also add `additionalQueries` for even better results:

**Basic Deep Search:**

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.exa.ai/search \
  -H "x-api-key: EXA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "blog post about AI",
    "type": "deep",
    "contents": {
      "text": true,
      "context": true
    }
  }'
```

**Deep Search with Query Variations:**

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.exa.ai/search \
  -H "x-api-key: EXA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "blog post about AI",
    "additionalQueries": ["AI blogpost", "machine learning blogs"],
    "type": "deep",
    "contents": {
      "text": true,
      "context": true
    }
  }'
```

### What You Get Back

Deep search returns a `context` field that gives you detailed context:
