# Browserbase

Automate your job applications by combining Exa's company search with Browserbase's browser automation.

## What is Exa?

[Exa](https://exa.ai) is the perfect web search API that finds exactly what you're looking for on the web. Instead of just matching keywords, Exa understands what you mean and returns the most relevant results. Exa is especially good at finding companies that match your criteria.

## What is Browserbase?

[Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) lets you automate browser tasks at scale. Combined with [Stagehand](https://www.browserbase.com/stagehand), you can build AI agents that navigate and interact with any website.

## How It Works

The [Browserbase x Exa template](https://www.browserbase.com/templates/exa-browserbase) automates the entire job search and application process. Here's the 5-step workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Find Your Perfect Companies">
    **Exa finds companies that match what you're looking for.**

    Search for companies using natural language. For example, "AI startups in SF" or "fintech companies in NYC hiring engineers." Exa returns a list of relevant companies that fit your criteria.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Find the Careers Page">
    **Exa finds the careers page for each company.**

    Once you have your target companies, Exa searches for their careers pages. You just ask Exa to find the "careers page" for each company URL, and it gives you the right link.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Navigate to Job Postings">
    **Browserbase goes to the job posting page.**

    Browserbase opens the careers page and navigates to where the actual job listings are. This is important because often the careers page and the job postings page are different. Browserbase handles this navigation automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Pick the Right Job">
    **Browserbase finds and selects the job that fits you.**

    Browserbase looks at all the available jobs and picks the ones that match your preferences. It can filter by job title, requirements, location, or any other criteria you specify.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5: Apply to the Job">
    **Browserbase fills out and submits the application.**

    Browserbase automatically fills in the application form with your information—name, email, resume, cover letter, and any other required fields. Then it submits the application for you.
  </Step>
</Steps>
