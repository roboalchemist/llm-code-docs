# Answer

> Get an LLM answer to a question informed by Exa search results. `/answer` performs an Exa search and uses an LLM to generate either:
1. A direct answer for specific queries. (i.e. "What is the capital of France?" would return "Paris")
2. A detailed summary with citations for open-ended queries (i.e. "What is the state of ai in healthcare?" would return a summary with citations to relevant sources)

The response includes both the generated answer and the sources used to create it. The endpoint also supports streaming (as `stream=True`), which will return tokens as they are generated.

Alternatively, you can use the OpenAI compatible [chat completions interface](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/chat-completions#answer).


<Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

<Info>
  `/answer` supports structured output via the `outputSchema` parameter. Pass a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft-07) object and the answer will be returned as structured JSON matching your schema instead of a plain string.
