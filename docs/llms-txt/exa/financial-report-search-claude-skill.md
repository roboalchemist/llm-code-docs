Step 1: Install or update Exa MCP

If Exa MCP already exists in your MCP configuration, either uninstall it first and install the new one, or update your existing MCP config with this endpoint. Run this command in your terminal:

claude mcp add --transport http exa "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?tools=web_search_advanced_exa"

# Web Search Advanced - Financial Report Category

## Tool Restriction (Critical)

ONLY use `web_search_advanced_exa` with `category: "financial report"`. Do NOT use other categories or tools.

## Filter Restrictions (Critical)

The `financial report` category has one known restriction:

- `excludeText` - NOT SUPPORTED (causes 400 error)

## Supported Parameters

### Core
- `query` (required)
- `numResults`
- `type` ("auto", "fast", "deep", "neural")

### Domain filtering
- `includeDomains` (e.g., ["sec.gov", "investor.apple.com"])
- `excludeDomains`

### Date filtering (ISO 8601) - Very useful for financial reports!
- `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate`
- `startCrawlDate` / `endCrawlDate`

### Text filtering
- `includeText` (must contain ALL) - **single-item arrays only**; multi-item causes 400
- ~~`excludeText`~~ - NOT SUPPORTED

### Content extraction
- `textMaxCharacters` / `contextMaxCharacters`
- `enableSummary` / `summaryQuery`
- `enableHighlights` / `highlightsNumSentences` / `highlightsPerUrl` / `highlightsQuery`

### Additional
- `additionalQueries`
- `livecrawl` / `livecrawlTimeout`
- `subpages` / `subpageTarget`

## Token Isolation (Critical)

Never run Exa searches in main context. Always spawn Task agents:
- Agent calls `web_search_advanced_exa` with `category: "financial report"`
- Agent merges + deduplicates results before presenting
- Agent returns distilled output (brief markdown or compact JSON)
- Main context stays clean regardless of search volume

## When to Use

Use this category when you need:
- SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, S-1)
- Quarterly earnings reports
- Annual reports
- Investor presentations
- Financial statements

## Examples

SEC filings for a company:

```json
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "Anthropic SEC filing S-1",
  "category": "financial report",
  "numResults": 10,
  "type": "auto"
}
```

Recent earnings reports:

```json
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "Q4 2025 earnings report technology",
  "category": "financial report",
  "startPublishedDate": "2025-10-01",
  "numResults": 20,
  "type": "auto"
}
```

Specific filing type:

```json
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "10-K annual report AI companies",
  "category": "financial report",
  "includeDomains": ["sec.gov"],
  "startPublishedDate": "2025-01-01",
  "numResults": 15,
  "type": "deep"
}
```

Risk factors analysis:

```json
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "risk factors cybersecurity",
  "category": "financial report",
  "includeText": ["cybersecurity"],
  "numResults": 10,
  "enableHighlights": true,
  "highlightsQuery": "What are the main cybersecurity risks?"
}
```

## Output Format

Return:
1) Results (company name, filing type, date, key figures/highlights)
2) Sources (Filing URLs)
3) Notes (reporting period, any restatements, auditor notes)


Step 3: Ask User to Restart Claude Code

You should ask the user to restart Claude Code to have the config changes take effect.
