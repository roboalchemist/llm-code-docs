# OpenAI Tool Calling

> Learn to use OpenAI's tool call feature with Exa's Search Integration

***

<Info>
  OpenAI recommends using the Responses API for all new projects. [See the guide](./openai-responses-api-with-exa).
</Info>

OpenAI's [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?lang=python) allows LLMs to call functions that are defined in your code. This guide will show you how to utilise tool calling to call Exa's search, with the following steps:

1. Install prerequisite packages and set up the environment
2. Overview of how OpenAI's tool calling feature works
3. Use Exa within an OpenAI tool call

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the:

    * `openai` library to perform OpenAI API calls and completions
    * `exa_py` library to perform Exa search
    * `rich` library to make the output more readable

    ```python Python theme={null}
    pip install openai exa_py rich
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up the environment variables">
    Create an `.env` file in the root of your project and set the `EXA_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API keys respectively. Visit the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and the [Exa dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) to generate your API keys.

    <br />

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

    ```Shell Shell theme={null}
    OPENAI_API_KEY=insert your Exa API key here, without quotes
    EXA_API_KEY=insert your Exa API key here, without quotes
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="What is OpenAI tool calling?">
    OpenAI LLMs can call a function you have defined in your code, this is called [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?lang=python). To do this you first need to describe the function you want to call to OpenAI's LLM. You can do this by defining a description object of the format:

    ```json JSON theme={null}
    {
        "name": "my_function_name", # The name of the function
        "description": "The description of my function", # Describe the function so OpenAI knows when and how to use it.
        "input_schema": { # input schema describes the format and the type of parameters OpenAI needs to generate to use the function
            "type": "object", # format of the generated OpenAI response
            "properties": { # properties defines the input parameters of the function
                "query": { # the function expects a query parameter
                    "type": "string", # of type string
                    "description": "The search query to perform.", # describes the paramteres to OpenAI
                },
            },
            "required": ["query"], # define which parameters are required
        },
    }
    ```

    When this description is sent to OpenAI's LLM, it returns an object with a string, which is the function name defined in *your* code, and the arguments that the function takes. This does not execute or *call* functions on OpenAI's side; it only returns the function name and arguments which you will have to parse and call yourself in your code.

    ```python Python theme={null}
    ...
    id='call_62136123',
    function=Function(
        arguments='{"query":"Latest developments in quantum computing"}',
        name='exa_search',),
    type='function'
    ...
    ```

    We will use this object to - in this case - call the `exa_search` function we define with the arguments provided.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Exa Search as an OpenAI tool">
    First, we import and initialise the OpenAI and Exa libraries and load the stored API keys.

    ```python Python theme={null}
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from exa_py import Exa
    from openai import OpenAI

    load_dotenv()

    openai = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    exa = Exa(api_key=os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"))
    ```

    Next, we define the function and the function schema so that OpenAI knows how to use it and what arguments our local function takes:

    ```python Python theme={null}
    TOOLS = [
        {
            "name": "exa_search",
            "description": "Perform a search query on the web, and retrieve the most relevant URLs/web data.",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The search query to perform.",
                    },
                },
                "required": ["query"],
            },
        }
    ]
    ```

    Finally, we'll define the primer `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, which explains to OpenAI what it is supposed to do:

    ```python Python theme={null}
    SYSTEM_MESSAGE = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an agent that has access to an advanced search engine. Please provide the user with the information they are looking for by using the search tool provided.",
    }
    ```

    We can now start writing the code needed to perform the LLM calls and the search. We'll create the `exa_search` function that will call Exa's `search_and_contents` function with the query:

    ```python Python theme={null}
    def exa_search(query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return exa.search_and_contents(query=query, type='auto', highlights=True)
    ```

    Next, we create a function to process the tool calls:

    ```python Python theme={null}
    def process_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages):
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            function_name = tool_call.function.name
            function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
            if function_name == "exa_search":
                search_results = exa_search(**function_args)
                messages.append(
                    {
                        "role": "tool",
                        "content": str(search_results),
                        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                    }
                )
                console.print(
                    f"[bold cyan]Context updated[/bold cyan] [i]with[/i] "
                    f"[bold green]exa_search ({function_args.get('mode')})[/bold green]: ",
                    function_args.get("query"),
                )
        return messages
    ```

    Lastly, we'll create a `main` function to bring it all together, and handle the user input and interaction with OpenAI:

    ```python Python theme={null}
    def main():
        messages = [SYSTEM_MESSAGE]
        while True:
            try:
                user_query = Prompt.ask(
                    "[bold yellow]What do you want to search for?[/bold yellow]",
                )
                messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_query})
                completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
                    model="gpt-4o-mini",
                    messages=messages,
                    tools=TOOLS,
                )
                message = completion.choices[0].message
                tool_calls = message.tool_calls
                if tool_calls:
                    messages.append(message)
                    messages = process_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages)
                    messages.append(
                        {
                            "role": "user",
                            "content": "Answer my previous query based on the search results.",
                        }
                    )
                    completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
                        model="gpt-4o-mini",
                        messages=messages,
                    )
                    console.print(Markdown(completion.choices[0].message.content))
                else:
                    console.print(Markdown(message.content))
            except Exception as e:
                console.print(f"[bold red]An error occurred:[/bold red] {str(e)}")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    The implementation creates a loop that continually prompts the user for search queries, uses OpenAI's tool calling feature to determine when to perform a search, and then uses the Exa search results to provide an informed response to the user's query.

    We also use the rich library to provide a more visually appealing console interface, including coloured output and markdown rendering for the responses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the code">
    Save the code in a file, e.g. `openai_search.py`, and make sure the `.env` file containing the API keys we previously created is in the same directory as the script.

    Then run the script using the following command from your terminal:

    ```bash Bash theme={null}
    python openai_search.py
    ```

    You should see a prompt:

    ```bash Bash theme={null}
    What do you want to search for?
    ```

    Let's test it out.

    ```bash Bash theme={null}
    What do you want to search for?: Who is Tony Stark?
    Context updated with exa_search (None):  Tony Stark
    Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is a fictional superhero from Marvel Comics. He is a wealthy inventor and businessman, known for creating a powered suit of armor that gives him superhuman abilities. Tony Stark is a founding member of the Avengers and has appeared in various comic book series, animated
    television shows, and films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

    ```

    That's it, enjoy your search agent!
