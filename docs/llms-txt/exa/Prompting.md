# Prompting Websets

> Here's how to prompt your query in Websets

Websets is a web research agent designed to find a perfect list of results that matches your criteria. Here's how to prompt it:

<Note>
  **How not to prompt Websets:** Websets is not an answer engine, so it's not meant for queries like "How your I think about xyz" or "Give me a report on abc".&#x20;
</Note>

* Type in your query, thinking of the type of thing you're trying to find (e.g. Companies, People, Research Papers, Articles, Reports, etc.)&#x20;

* Describing in detail the type of results you'd like. Common descriptors include location, size, theme, industry, qualifiers (e.g. have ISO certification, know rust), past experience etc.
