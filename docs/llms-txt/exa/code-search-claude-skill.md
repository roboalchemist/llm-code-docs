# Code Search

> This guide shows you how to set up a Claude skill and Exa MCP that helps you find code examples, API docs, and technical snippets.

<Card title="Copy and Paste in Claude Code">
  Click the copy button on the code block below and paste it into Claude Code. Claude will automatically set up both the MCP connection and the skill for you.

Step 1: Install or update Exa MCP

If Exa MCP already exists in your MCP configuration, either uninstall it first and install the new one, or update your existing MCP config with this endpoint. Run this command in your terminal:

claude mcp add --transport http exa "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?tools=get_code_context_exa"


Step 2: Add this Claude skill

---
name: get-code-context-exa
description: Code context using Exa. Finds real snippets and docs from GitHub, StackOverflow, and technical docs. Use when searching for code examples, API syntax, library documentation, or debugging help.
context: fork

# Code Context (Exa)

## Tool Restriction (Critical)

ONLY use `get_code_context_exa`. Do NOT use other Exa tools.

## Token Isolation (Critical)

Never run Exa in main context. Always spawn Task agents:
- Agent calls `get_code_context_exa`
- Agent extracts the minimum viable snippet(s) + constraints
- Agent deduplicates near-identical results (mirrors, forks, repeated StackOverflow answers) before presenting
- Agent returns copyable snippets + brief explanation
- Main context stays clean regardless of search volume

## When to Use

Use this tool for ANY programming-related request:
- API usage and syntax
- SDK/library examples
- config and setup patterns
- framework "how to" questions
- debugging when you need authoritative snippets

## Inputs (Supported)

`get_code_context_exa` supports:
- `query` (string, required)
- `tokensNum` (number, optional; default ~5000; typical range 1000–50000)

## Query Writing Patterns (High Signal)

To reduce irrelevant results and cross-language noise:
- Always include the **programming language** in the query.
  - Example: use **"Go generics"** instead of just **"generics"**.
- When applicable, also include **framework + version** (e.g., "Next.js 14", "React 19", "Python 3.12").
- Include exact identifiers (function/class names, config keys, error messages) when you have them.

## Dynamic Tuning

Token strategy:
- Focused snippet needed → tokensNum 1000–3000
- Most tasks → tokensNum 5000
- Complex integration → tokensNum 10000–20000
- Only go larger when necessary (avoid dumping large context)

## Output Format (Recommended)

Return:
1) Best minimal working snippet(s) (keep it copy/paste friendly)
2) Notes on version / constraints / gotchas
3) Sources (URLs if present in returned context)

Before presenting:
- Deduplicate similar results and keep only the best representative snippet per approach.

## MCP Configuration

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "exa": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?tools=get_code_context_exa"
    }
  }
}
```


Step 3: Ask User to Restart Claude Code

You should ask the user to restart Claude Code to have the config changes take effect.
