You need to allow the following ports in your firewall:

*   Coolify: `3000` (required)
*   Reverse Proxy: `80, 443` (optional)
*   [Public Port Range](./settings.md#public-port-range): `9000-9100` (optional)

<Warning>
  If you are using `Oracle Cloud free ARM server`, you need to allow these ports inside Oracle's Dashboard, otherwise you cannot reach your instance from the internet after installation.
</Warning>
