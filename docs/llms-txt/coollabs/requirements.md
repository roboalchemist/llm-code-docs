## Supported Architectures

`AMD64` and `ARM` architecture are supported.

## Supported Operating Systems

`Debian` based servers are supported, due to the installation script (Coolify
itself supports every OS that could run a Docker Engine). If you would like to
have other, please consider
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/new).

## Resources

Minimum required resources for Coolify:

*   2 CPUs
*   2 GBs memory
*   30+ GB of storage for the images.

## Additional Resources

Based on what you would like to run with Coolify, additional resources (CPU, memory, disk) are
needed.

Self-hosting could be heavy if you would like to run a lot of things.

For example, I'm hosting most of my production stuffs on a server with:

*   8GB of memory (average usage 3.5GB)
*   4 CPUs (average usage \~20-30%)
*   150GB disk (usage 40GB)

Hosting the following things:

*   3 NodeJS apps
*   4 Static sites
*   Plausible Analytics (for visitor analytics)
*   Fider (feedback tool)
*   UptimeKuma (uptime monitoring)
*   Ghost (my newsletters)
*   3 Redis databases
*   2 PostgreSQL databases

> All static sites and one of the NodeJS applications are cached on
> [BunnyCDN](https://bunny.net), so the usage is super low on my server.

## Resources for building images

Coolify builds images in two places.

*   `Local server` with Local Docker Engine (the server you installed Coolify on).

*   `Remote Server` with Remote Docker Engine (the server you added as a
    Destination).

These servers have higher CPU usage on build time, so if you have 1 CPU, it will
be a bottleneck!
