# Full Terminal Use

Full Terminal Use lets Warp's agent operate directly inside interactive terminal applications, such as database shells, debuggers, text editors, long-running servers, and more.

The agent can see the live terminal buffer (terminal state), write to the PTY to run commands, respond to prompts, and continue working inside the running process while you stay in control.

## Overview

With Full Terminal Use, Warp’s agent can attach to interactive tools like `psql`, `vim`, `python`, `gdb`, `top`, or your dev server, read the terminal output as it changes, and interact with the application as if you were typing.

You can either ask the agent to start an interactive program, or you can start it yourself and then tag the agent in once the tool is already running. In both cases, the agent sees the same terminal buffer (and PTY session) you do and can act on it.

## How Full Terminal Use works

#### Start an interactive command

You can either ask the agent to run an interactive command, or start one manually and then tag the agent in:

* **Ask the agent to start an interactive tool**
  * Example:
    * “Open a Postgres shell and help me inspect the orders table.”
    * “Start the dev server and debug this 500 error.”
* **Or start the command yourself, then tag the agent in**
  * Example:
    * If you’ve already launched an interactive tool (for example `psql` or `npm run dev`), you can bring the agent into the running session using the "Use Agent" button in the terminal footer or via `CMD + I` .
    * Once the agent is tagged in, you can follow up with natural-language requests such as:

      “Watch this process and help debug the error on the /session endpoint.”
    * Warp then attaches the agent to the active PTY so it can see the current terminal buffer and propose actions inside the session.

Warp attaches the agent to the running command so it can see and control the terminal buffer.

#### Agents propose actions inside the session

Once attached, you can continue using natural language and the agent turns your requests into concrete terminal actions. For example, in a Postgres shell:

* You: “Show me all the tables and describe the orders table.”
* Agent: proposes running commands like: `\dt` --> `\d+ orders`

In the UI, you’ll see a request to:

* Run a specific command
* Optionally enable auto-approval for similar commands in this session

#### Switching control between user and the agent

You can swap control at any time.

**Take over**

* Use the Takeover control to stop the agent from typing or performing any actions.
* The shell stays open, and you can type directly into the same session.

**Hand back control**

* When you’re ready for the agent to continue, click the control again.
* The agent resumes where you left off, with full access to the current terminal state.

<figure><img src="https://769506432-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FAULCelT4yIUOcSwWWvPk%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-77a908698b93f516dee09dfcdd7d768fbc900d26%2Ffull-terminal-use-handoff.png?alt=media" alt=""><figcaption><p>Option to hand-off to the agent in the conversation footer.</p></figcaption></figure>

This makes it easy to:

* Let the agent do mechanical work (paging output, trying variants of a command)
* Step in for delicate or security-sensitive actions
* Then let the agent continue once the critical step is done

#### Showing and hiding agent responses

Warp gives you control over how much agent output appears in Full Terminal Use.

**Toggle visibility**

Use the `Hide responses` or `Show responses` button or `CMD + G` in the interactive command footer to switch between showing all agent output or hiding it from the terminal view.

Note that this only affects the agent's messages and proposals; your terminal state and command output remain unchanged.

**Behavior when hidden**

* When agent responses are hidden, your own agent requests automatically dismiss after **4 seconds** to keep the terminal clear.
* You can also manually dismiss any user query at any time by hovering over it and clicking the X.

### Configuring agent permissions and autonomy

You control how much autonomy the agent has when interacting with the terminal.

#### Session-level approvals

Each time the agent wants to take an action inside an interactive shell, you’ll see the agent’s reasoning, a brief explanation, and the proposed command. From there you can:

* Allow the command once (for example by approving it or pressing `ENTER`).
* Turn on auto-approval for similar commands in this session (for example with `CMD + SHIFT + I`).
* Refine the request with `CTRL + C`, which clears the proposed action and lets you follow up with a different query.
* Take over manually with `CMD + I`, which stops the agent from issuing any further PTY writes until you hand control back.

This lets you tighten or loosen control for the current task:

* For exploratory work, you might Always allow to reduce friction.
* For production systems or sensitive operations, you might Allow once and review each step.

#### Global permission settings

You can configure global defaults from your [Agent Profiles & Permissions](https://docs.warp.dev/agent-platform/agent/using-agents/agent-profiles-permissions) settings:

* **Ask on first write**: The first write to a shell process requires approval. After that, all subsequent writes for that specific process/command will be approved.
* **Always ask**: Every write to the shell process from the agent requires your explicit approval.
* **Always allow**: The agent can write to the shell process without prompting you each time.

These settings apply to every session that uses Full Terminal Use. You can still override them on a per-session basis when prompted. For example, you can enable **auto-approval** for similar commands in the current session using the fast-forward control, or switch to a **different AI profile** with its own permission settings for that conversation.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: All [Secret Redaction](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-community/privacy-and-security/secret-redaction) features still apply during Full Terminal Use, so sensitive values in your environment or output remain protected.
{% endhint %}

### AI credits usage

All AI interactions from Full Terminal Use consume [AI Credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-community/plans-and-billing/ai-credits), including understanding your natural language requests

Credits are consumed in a similar way as other Warp AI actions that use the same model and a similar context size.

**Interactive sessions can consume more credits if:**

* The agent runs many commands in an interactive shell on your behalf.
* There is a significant amount of terminal output to read and summarize.

**To manage credit usage:**

* Use tighter scopes:
  * “Describe just the orders table.” instead of “Explain the entire database.”
* Pause autonomy for high-volume tasks with copius terminal output:
  * Take over manual control when running large batches or long logs.
* Use stricter permissions:
  * Set global permissions to "Ask on first write" or "Always ask", then approve only what you need.

## Example workflows

Here’s a demo from one of our engineers, Maggie, that walks through a couple of Full Terminal Use examples.

{% embed url="<https://www.loom.com/share/d47ee09153df417983df65a339a9d6f2>" %}

Below are some common interactive tools where Full Terminal Use is particularly useful: database shells (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite), debuggers such as gdb, language-specific REPLs like python or node, text editors and file explorers, and long-running dev servers or monitoring tools such as top and htop.
