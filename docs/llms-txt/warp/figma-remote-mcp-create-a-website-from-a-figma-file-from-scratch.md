# Figma Remote MCP: Create a Website from a Figma File from Scratch

Learn how to connect Warp to Figma’s remote MCP server to generate code directly from your design files — complete with screenshots, metadata, and design system context.

## Overview

This guide covers how to:

* Connect Warp to the **remote Figma MCP server**
* Log in securely using OAuth
* Use the server to pull live context (components, variables, and assets) from your Figma designs
* Generate front-end code based on your UI files
* Iterate and refine output directly in Warp

**What Is a Remote MCP Server?**

A **remote MCP server** runs outside your local machine — Warp connects to it through a secure network call.\
\
This means you don’t have to manage processes, ports, or tokens manually. Warp handles setup, authentication, and communication for you.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Connect Figma MCP to Warp**

* Copy the Figma MCP configuration JSON

```
{
  "Figma": {
    "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
  }
}
```

* In Warp, paste the JSON — Warp will automatically open an OAuth login window.
* Log in once with your **Figma account** credentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a Figma Dev account for this to work.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**What the Figma MCP Server Provides**

Once connected, the server enables Warp’s AI to understand your design context by fetching:

| Type                             | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`get_screenshot`**             | Helps the AI visualize layout and relationships between elements.    |
| **`create_design_system_rules`** | Components, variables, and styles for consistent, reusable code.     |
| **`get_code`**                   | Extracts code from your Figma design for direct use in projects.     |
| **`get_metadata`**               | Includes text, images, and layer names for more realistic mock data. |
| {% endstep %}                    |                                                                      |

{% step %}
**Generate a Website from a Figma File**

Basic flow:

* Copy your **Figma file link**:
  * Right-click → *Copy / Paste As → Copy Link to Selection*
* In Warp, paste a prompt to create a website based on that design.

Prompt:

{% code title="Prompt" %}

```
Create a website from this Figma file: <LINK HERE>
Follow the design layout and use these guidelines:
- Match spacing and typography from the design
- Use Tailwind CSS and TypeScript
- Make components reusable
```

{% endcode %}

Warp uses the Figma MCP server to pull all necessary context and begin generating code diffs.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Iterating on Output**

* In under five minutes, Warp generates a working site structure based on the Figma layout.
* Missing assets (e.g., logos or images) are automatically referenced in an `assets/` folder.
* Warp prompts you to add any missing files before continuing.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Persistent Input Feature**

Warp’s **persistent input** allows mid-process updates.\
If you forget an image (e.g., the Misho logo), simply upload it and notify Warp:

```
I’ve uploaded the Misho logo to the assets folder.
```

Warp will automatically detect and use it during the same generation session.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Recap**

* Warp now supports **remote MCP servers** for Figma (and others like GitHub, Sentry, and Linear).
* OAuth login streamlines setup and removes manual token handling.
* The Figma MCP integration enables rapid, context-aware code generation.
* Persistent input and real-time iteration make design-to-code workflows seamless.

{% hint style="success" %}
In under 20 minutes, you can go from Figma design to a functioning website — all powered by Warp’s AI coding environment.
