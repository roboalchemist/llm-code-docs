# How To: Actually Code UI That Matches Your Mockup (React + Tailwind)

Learn how to prompt Warp’s AI to produce accurate, design-faithful UI code using your preferred framework.

## Intro

This tutorial walks you through generating pixel-perfect front-end code using Warp.\
\
By treating the AI like a **UI engineer**, you can get closer to real implementation fidelity — especially when working from design mockups.

Although this example uses **React** and **Tailwind**, the same method applies to **Vue**, **Next.js**, or **Svelte**.

**The Problem**

When designing UI with AI, your intended design often gets lost in translation.\
AI struggles with visual fidelity — but structured prompts can help fix that.

**The Prompt**

Step — Generate full specifications:

```
Analyze this web design mockup as a senior UI engineer would. Create a complete technical specification:

1. DESIGN SYSTEM TOKENS:
   - Extract the color palette with semantic naming (primary, secondary, surface, text)
   - Identify the type scale (heading levels, body text sizes)
   - Document the spacing scale pattern (4px, 8px, 16px, etc.)
   - List border radius values used consistently

2. LAYOUT ARCHITECTURE:
   - Describe the overall page structure using semantic HTML5 elements
   - Identify CSS Grid vs Flexbox usage for each section

3. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS:
   For each unique component, provide:
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - CSS layout method
   - All visual states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
   - Exact dimensions and spacing
   - Animation/transition properties

4. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:
   - Describe how the layout adapts (even if only desktop is shown)
   - Note which elements stack, hide, or resize
   - Identify touch targets that need enlarging on mobile

5. ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
   - Color contrast ratios for text/background combinations
   - Interactive element sizes (minimum 44x44px touch targets)
   - Focus indicator styles
   - Screen reader considerations for decorative elements

Format as a structured spec that includes both the visual description AND implementation notes. Flag any ambiguous design decisions that need clarification.

```

Next, give Warp the right prompt to start the code implementation:

```
Using this design specification, build a responsive React component with Tailwind CSS:

Requirements:
- Create reusable components for each element in the spec
- Use CSS variables for the design tokens
- Implement all interactive states
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Add proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Include Framer Motion for any animations mentioned
- Match the spacing system exactly using Tailwind's spacing scale

Create a pixel-perfect implementation that matches the original design.

```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Validate and Iterate**

Warp outputs component files and layout structure.\
You can review spacing, font weights, and responsive behavior directly in preview.

If details feel off, prompt again with clarifications like:

```
Tighten vertical spacing between header and subtext.
```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Recap**

You’ve learned how to:

* Prompt AI for structured UI specs
* Generate React + Tailwind implementations
* Iterate visually for design parity

> Treating the AI like a teammate — not a tool — yields interfaces that finally match your vision.
