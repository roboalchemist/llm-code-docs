In this demo, Ben builds a small TypeScript “Sentry monitor” service that listens for specific Sentry alerts (like a Go nil pointer dereference) and triggers a Warp Ambient Agent to investigate. The server validates the webhook, extracts the stack trace, and injects it into an agent run inside a Warp Environment so the agent can inspect the repo and propose a fix.

He also covers the task lifecycle basics in the TypeScript SDK (running an agent, polling task state to fetch a session link for debugging), and shows the end result: a draft GitHub pull request created from the Sentry event for a maintainer to review.

**What Ben covers**

* Using Warp’s TypeScript SDK to trigger agent runs and retrieve task details.
* Handling task lifecycle states (queued → running) to reliably fetch a session link.
* Running agents inside a Warp Environment so they can investigate real code, run tests, and validate fixes.
* Building a lightweight Sentry webhook server that filters, validates, and routes only the right errors to an agent.
* Creating a workflow that results in draft PRs for human review, instead of silent autonomous changes.
