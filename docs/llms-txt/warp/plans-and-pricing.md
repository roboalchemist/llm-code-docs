## Warp Plans & Pricing

Warp offers flexible, pay-as-you-go plans designed for individual developers, teams, and enterprises.

### Warp’s Refund Policies

Please review the details of our refund policies below. To request a refund, email [**billing@warp.dev**](mailto:billing@warp.dev) with information about your situation — the more context you provide, the faster we can resolve your request.

#### Subscription Refund Policy

If you signed up for a paid Warp subscription by mistake, we can issue a refund if you downgrade within:

* **72 hours** of starting a **monthly** plan, or
* **30 days** of starting an **annual** plan,

***and*** you’ve used **fewer than 150 AI credits** (the Free plan limit).

If you exceed the credit limit usage during your first month on an annual plan, we cannot refund the first month. However, we will refund **months 2–12**.

#### Add-on Credits | Overages Refund Policy

* If you purchased [Add-on Credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/add-on-credits) by mistake, you can receive a refund **as long as none of the credits have been used**. Warp cannot refund Add-on Credits if there has been any usage.  Add-on Credits remain available for **12 months** from the date of purchase, and you can continue to use them even if you do not have an active subscription.
* All [Overages (Legacy)](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) credits are **non-refundable**. Because Overages are charges for AI credits that were already consumed, we cannot refund resources that have already been used.

{% hint style="warning" %}
While Warp does not provide a formal guaranteed uptime SLA, we may choose to offer refunds or extra AI credits, on a case-by-case basis, if a severe product defect or problem with uptime availability occurs.\
