# Pane Dimming & Focus

## How to use it

### Inactive Pane Dimming

The panes that aren't active will be dimmed to better indicate which pane is active. To access it, go to `Settings > Appearance > Panes`

* Toggle on `Dim inactive panes` to enable the feature.

{% hint style="info" %}
Split panes show a triangle indicator on the top left corner of the active pane.
{% endhint %}

### Mouse Focus

The pane with the mouse over it will become active. To access it, go to `Settings > Appearance > Panes`

* Toggle on `Focus follows mouse` to enable the feature.
