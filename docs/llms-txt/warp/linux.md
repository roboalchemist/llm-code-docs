## Native Wayland

Warp Wayland support can be enabled in `Settings > Features > System`. Enabling Wayland support may fix issues with blurry text if you have fractional scaling enabled in your window manager.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When native Wayland is enabled, Global Hotkey support will be disabled. Unlike X11, the Wayland protocol does not expose the configuration necessary to support this feature.
{% endhint %}

## Wayland Crash Recovery

When Wayland support is enabled, Warp uses a custom crash recovery process to detect any crashes that may occur when using Wayland. If there's a crash, Warp will fallback to use X11 to allow you to continue to use the application.
