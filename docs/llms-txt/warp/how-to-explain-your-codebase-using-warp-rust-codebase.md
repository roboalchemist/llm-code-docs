# How to: Explain Your Codebase Using Warp (Rust Codebase)

Learn how to use Warp’s AI agent to explore and understand large, unfamiliar codebases — using semantic and symbol-level search.

## Overview

This walkthrough shows:

* How Warp explains unknown sections of code
* How it combines semantic and keyword searches
* How to use these insights to modify UI components

***

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Prompt**

{% code title="prompt.txt" %}

```
Please explain how the agent popup code is structured,
where it lives in the codebase,
and how it is rendered and called.
I want to understand the full data flow and structure
so I can add a new agent button to it.
```

{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

**How Warp’s Agent Searches**

Warp begins by using **semantic (vectorized) search** to locate relevant files.\
Once it finds probable matches (e.g., `agent_management_popup.rs`), it switches to **symbolic search** (`grep` and direct code reads).

Warp intelligently reads large files (splitting them into smaller chunks) to extract relevant definitions and render logic.
{% endstep %}

**Generated Explanation**

Warp returns a full breakdown:

* File paths where the popup is defined
* How it’s rendered within the workspace
* Which actions and UI components trigger it
* A step-by-step view of data flow through the popup component
