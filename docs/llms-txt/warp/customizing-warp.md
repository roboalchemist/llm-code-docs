# Customizing Warp

## Customizing Warp's appearance

Warp has many [Appearance](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance) settings you can configure:

* [**Themes**](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/themes): You can choose from pre-loaded themes or create your own [custom theme](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/custom-themes), using .yaml or based on a background image you upload.
* **Input format**: Choose between Warp's Standard input or Classic input. Standard enables easier access to AI features, while Classic resembles a traditional terminal input more closely.
* [**Text and fonts**](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/text-fonts-cursor): You can customize your font type and font size. You can also adjust the font to improve readability and accessibility.
* [**Input position**](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/input-position): Set your prompt and command line to the top or bottom of your Warp window.

Navigate to `Settings > Appearance` to customize your setup.

### Modify behavior settings

There are a number of behavior settings and features that will help you customize Warp to best suit your needs:

* [Dedicated window](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/windows/global-hotkey#dedicated-window): Dedicated hotkey window (also known as Quake Mode) allows you to customize your window's position, width, and height ratio relative to your active screen size.
* [Tabs](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/windows/tabs): Organize your windows into multiple sessions, and customize them with different titles and/or colors.
* [Split panes](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/windows/split-panes): Divide any tab into multiple panels, side-by-side or stacked.
