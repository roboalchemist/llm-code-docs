### 1. Welcome to Warp

When you open Warp, you’ll see something familiar — a command line interface — but it’s much more than a traditional terminal.\
\
Warp is an Agentic Development Environment (ADE), meaning it’s a space where your primary mode of interaction is through prompts to an AI agent.

You can still use Warp just like any terminal:

```bash
ls
pwd
```

Warp executes those commands exactly as you’d expect.\
\
But when you type natural language — like *“describe my open git changes”* — Warp interprets it as a prompt to launch the agent.

### 2. Prompt-Based Coding

When you ask something in plain English, Warp’s agent automatically:

* Gathers relevant context (your repo, files, or command output)
* Runs whatever commands are needed
* Returns a structured answer or takes the requested action

Example:

> “Describe my open git changes.”

Warp’s agent will review your current branch, run git commands in the background, and summarize what’s pending.

### 3. Blending Terminal and Agentic Workflows

The beauty of Warp is in how seamlessly it blends traditional CLI workflows with AI-driven automation.\
You can:

* Type commands like a normal shell
* Or prompt an agent to do things like debugging, code review, or environment setup

No context-switching between apps — it’s all one environment.
