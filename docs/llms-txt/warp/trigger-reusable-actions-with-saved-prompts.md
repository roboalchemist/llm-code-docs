# Trigger Reusable Actions With Saved Prompts

### 1. Automating Commits

When working on a PR, instead of typing long commit messages, you can use a saved prompt.

Warp’s agent:

* Runs a `git diff` and summarizes the change
* Generates a clean commit message
* Pushes it automatically to your branch

You can view the saved prompt in Warp Drive → Team Prompts, where it shows:

* Who created it
* When it was last used
* How many times it’s been run

Because it’s saved in your team drive, anyone can reuse it.

### 2. Reviewing Code with Prompts

Before creating a PR, you can run another saved prompt.

This agent:

* Reads your current branch
* Reviews the diffs
* Highlights logical or stylistic issues
* Suggests improvements

Example output:

> “Logic bug detected — potential race condition in async handler.”

Warp automatically surfaces real issues before you even open a PR — saving time and reducing back-and-forth with reviewers.

### 3. Opening a Pull Request Automatically

Once your code looks clean, trigger your final saved prompt.

Warp will:

* Generate a PR title and description
* Push the branch
* Open the PR on GitHub
* Even link related issues if found in commit messages

***

### 4. Sharing and Team Usage

All saved prompts live in your Team Warp Drive, meaning:

* Anyone can discover and run them
* You can parameterize or modify them
* Usage history and creator info are visible

This makes it easy for teams to standardize common actions like code reviews, deployments, or build runs.
