# Block Find

## What is it

Find searches for matches in all your Blocks from the bottom up and can even be isolated to a specific Block.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since command outputs are contained within Blocks, you can still use the input editor when invoking find.
{% endhint %}

## How to access it

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="macOS" %}

1. Hitting `CMD-F` opens the find view which searches across the terminal (scoped within the current pane).
2. Within the find modal, you can also enable the regex toggle, find on a selected Block, and or toggle case sensitive search.
   {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}

1. Hitting `CTRL-SHIFT-F` opens the find view which searches across the terminal (scoped within the current pane).
2. Within the find modal, you can also enable the regex toggle, find on a selected Block, and or toggle case sensitive search.
   {% endtab %}
