# Coding in Warp

When you enter a git repo for the first time, Warp will enter an initialization flow to index your codebase and generate a WARP.md file.

As you're in the repo, Warp will enter an advanced code generation flow that supports both single-line and multi-file changes when it detects an opportunity to write code.

For example, Warp may write code when you prompt:

* **Code creation**: “Write a function in JavaScript to debounce an input”
* **Based on error outputs, suggest fixes**: “Fix this TypeScript error.”
* **Edit a single file**: “Update all instances of ‘var’ to ‘let’ in this file.”
* **Make batch changes**: “Add headers to all .py files in this directory”

**The best way to experience this is to try it yourself —** [*open the Prompt below in Warp*](https://app.warp.dev/drive/prompt/Generate-a-custom-Warp-theme-K8oloLrCZAHuaYKfz2cNqI)

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```markup
Detect the correct Warp themes directory based on the current operating system:
- On macOS, use ~/.warp/themes/
- On Linux, use ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/warp-terminal/themes/
- On Windows, use $env:APPDATA\warp\Warp\data\themes\

Create the directory if it doesn’t already exist. 

Then, generate a custom Warp theme named {{theme_name}} in valid YAML format, following the official structure from Warp’s documentation. Exclude the background_image field, and do not include any extra or missing fields. Save the theme as {{theme_name}}.yaml in the detected themes directory.

Once the theme is created and verified, confirm completion by telling me where the theme file was saved.
```

{% endcode %}

### Context

#### Codebase Context

Warp can index your Git-tracked codebases to help agents understand your code and generate accurate, context-aware responses. **No code is stored on Warp servers**.

You can view and manage your indexed codebases under `Settings > Code > Codebase Index` and you can also specify whether to automatically index new folders as you navigate them.

If your codebase is large, you can exclude specific files by adding them to a `.warpindexingignore` file.

#### Other types of context

You can provide different types of input as context directly to the agent to guide its behavior and improve response quality. This includes:

* [Blocks](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/agent-context#attaching-blocks-as-context) from your terminal output
* [Images](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/agent-context#attaching-images-as-context)
* [Files and code](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/agent-context#referencing-files-and-code-using) (using the @ symbol)
* [Public websites](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/agent-context#referencing-websites-via-urls) via URLs

#### Warp Drive as Context

Agents pull directly from your [**Warp Drive**](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-drive) contents to generate more accurate responses -- including your **Workflows**, **Notebooks**, **Prompts**, and **Environment Variables**.

* When used, context appears under the “References” or “Derived from” section in the conversation.
* This setting is **enabled by default** and can be managed via: `Settings > AI > Knowledge > Warp Drive as Agent Mode Context`.

#### Rules

**Rules** let you provide persistent context to Agents, enabling smarter and more personalized responses.

You can create global rules (accessed through [Warp Drive](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-drive) > Personal > Rules) or project scoped rules, defined in a WARP.md file.

**Examples of Rules include:**

* Coding standards and best practices
* Project- or workspace-specific guidelines
* Personal preferences for tools, formatting, or behavior

How to access project-specific Rules

1. From the file-searcher, CMD+O and search "WARP.md"
2. From the file tree, click the "code" icon when in a repo

How to access Global Rules

1. From the [Warp Drive](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-drive) > Personal > Rules
2. From the [Command Palette](https://github.com/warpdotdev/gitbook/blob/main/docs/features/warp-ai/command-palette.md), search for "Open AI Rules"
3. From the Settings panel, `Settings > AI > Knowledge > Manage Rules`
4. From the macOS Menu, `AI > Open Rules`
