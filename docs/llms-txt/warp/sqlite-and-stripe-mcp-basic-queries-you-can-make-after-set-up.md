# SQLite and Stripe MCP: Basic Queries You Can Make After Set Up

This tutorial teaches you how to use **MCP servers** to connect Warp to **Stripe** and **SQLite**, showing how AI transforms the command line into a connected, conversational workspace.

**Enabling MCP in Warp**

Warp now supports configuring any MCP server directly from the terminal.

To set it up:

* Open **Settings → AI → MCP Servers** in Warp.
* Click **Add Server**, and choose from a list of available MCP configurations.
* Once added, Warp automatically connects and authorizes the agent to use those tools.

In this demo, two MCP servers were enabled:

* **SQLite Server** – for running local database queries
* **Stripe Server** – for retrieving and analyzing payment data
  {% endstep %}

**Querying Stripe**

Once configured, you can issue conversational prompts to the terminal — no manual API calls required.

Example — Querying Stripe

```
How many customers do I have in Stripe?
```

Warp connects to the Stripe MCP server, confirms the action, and returns:

> “You have 3 customers.”

You can continue naturally:

```
List the payments made by the first customer.
```

The agent retrieves seven payment intents — one successful, six canceled — all live from your Stripe test account.

Note: MCP’s confirmation prompts can be disabled once you trust a given server or agent.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Querying SQLite**

The same workflow applies to databases.

Example — Querying SQLite

```
What SQL tables do I have access to?
```

Warp lists all available tables from the local SQLite database.

```
Break down female penguins by island.
```

Warp translates this into a structured SQL query and executes it, returning:

> “Bisco Island — 51 female penguins; Dream Island — ...”

Follow-up prompts work contextually:

```
Do the same with male penguins.
```

Warp runs the updated SQL query and displays results inline.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Why This Matters**

This demo highlights how Warp’s AI and MCP support combine to make your terminal:

* **Connected** — Access cloud APIs, local data, or enterprise tools instantly.
* **Conversational** — Run natural language prompts for structured data retrieval.
