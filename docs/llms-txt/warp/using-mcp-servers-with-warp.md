# Using MCP Servers with Warp

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vn2brhJrF8>" %}

### 1. What Are MCP Servers?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers let Warp agents connect to external systems like GitHub, Linear, or Jira — so they can read, write, and reason about those systems natively.

Each MCP server adds its own “tools” to Warp’s agent.\
For example:

* The Linear MCP Server handles tickets.
* The GitHub MCP Server handles pull requests and issues.

***

### 2. Problem Setup

Andrew starts with Warp’s universal input, but it doesn’t yet know what a “ticket” is.

> Prompt Example:\
> “Help me solve this ticket.”

At this point, Warp can’t find or interpret the ticket, because no MCP server is connected.

***

### 3. Adding the Linear MCP Server

To connect Linear:

1. Open the **MCP Panel** in Warp
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Paste in the JSON configuration for the Linear MCP Server

Once added, Warp:

* Starts the MCP server
* Loads its tools (e.g., `get_ticket`, `update_ticket`, `create_ticket`)
* Makes them available to the agent instantly

***

### 4. Using Rules with MCP Servers

Andrew adds a rule called **check-linear**, which helps the agent automatically associate “tickets” with the Linear MCP Server.

> **Rule Example:**\
> “When the user says ‘ticket,’ check Linear.”

Rules make context switching between systems seamless — the agent doesn’t need reminders.

***

### 5. Dynamic Context Loading

Warp’s MCP support is **dynamic**:

* You can start a conversation without any connected MCPs
* Add one mid-session
* The agent automatically updates its context on the next message

No need to restart Warp or reset your session.

***

### 6. Running the Task

After adding Linear, Andrew runs:

> “Help me solve this ticket.”

Now the agent:

* Queries Linear for the ticket
* Pulls all related context
* Reads the codebase for linked references
* Generates the appropriate fix

He verifies the output by running:

```bash
cargo run
```
