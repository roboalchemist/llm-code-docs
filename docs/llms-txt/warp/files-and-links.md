# Files, Links, & Scripts

## Files & Links

Warp supports opening files, folders, and URL links that are within Blocks. Multiple URL protocols are supported e.g. `https`, `ftp`, `file`, etc. Warp can open files and folders in a variety of editors and opens web links directly in your default browser. Warp can also open markdown files directly with a [Markdown Viewer](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/more-features/markdown-viewer).

{% hint style="info" %}
Warp also supports iTerm2 and Kitty Image protocols on macOS and Linux. You will need to use a cli tool to view images, in some cases the tools expect `$TERM=kitty`, so you may need to workaround this by setting `TERM=kitty` before the command. We're working on updating the popular tools to recognize Warp natively.
{% endhint %}

Warp parses relative and absolute file paths. Warp also tries to capture line and column numbers attached to the file path, supported formats include:

* `file_name:line_num`
* `file_name:line_num:column_num`
* `file_name[line_num, column_num]`
* `file_name(line_num, column_num)`
* `file_name, line: line_num, column: column_num`
* `file_name, line: line_num, in`

1. After hovering over a link, open it directly by holding down `CMD` while clicking it.
2. Clicking a link normally will open a clickable tooltip that says “Open File/Folder/Link”.
3. Right-clicking a link will open a context menu that supports copying the absolute file path or URL to the clipboard.
   {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}

1. After hovering over a link, open it directly by holding down `CTRL` while clicking it.

* You can also Drag and drop a folder or file onto the Warp dock icon to open a new tab in this directory.
* You can also right-click on a folder or file in Finder, then select Services, and "Open new Warp Tab | Window here".
* Configure the default editor to open files by navigating to `Settings > Features > Choose an editor to open file links`.
  * Selecting "Default App" uses your system's default application for the file type.
