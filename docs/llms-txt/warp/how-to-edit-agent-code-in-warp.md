# How to: Edit Agent Code in Warp

Warp lets you see, edit, and refine AI-generated code diffs directly within the app.\
This makes debugging and bug-fix workflows fast, transparent, and interactive.

### 1. Starting an Agent Task

When you start an agent task, Warp:

1. Uses your prompt and context
2. Builds a task list
3. Searches across your codebase using tools like:
   * Grep
   * Codebase embeddings
   * Semantic search

Warp shows progress step-by-step, including what it’s searching and which files are being modified.

***

### 2. Reviewing Diffs

Warp generates diffs for every proposed change.\
You can:

* Accept changes
* Refine them with a follow-up prompt (`Cmd + R`)
* Or directly edit the code in the inline editor view

This editor view works like a lightweight IDE — perfect for quick corrections before applying.

***

### 3. Applying or Skipping Changes

Once you’re happy with a diff:

* Click Apply Changes to accept it
* Or Fast-Forward to let Warp automatically continue the rest of the fix sequence

You can control this level of autonomy globally in Settings → AI → Autonomy.

***

### 4. Compiling and Verifying Fixes

After applying changes, you can immediately test your build, like:

```bash
cargo run
```

Warp monitors compilation, verifies results, and runs post-checks automatically.

***

### 5. Visual Verification

In this example, the bug involved a checkbox not being honored in the UI.\
\
After the agent’s fix:

* The checkbox logic now works as intended
* The model picker toggles correctly
* The UI behaves as expected
