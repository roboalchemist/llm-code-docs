# Code Editor Vim Keybindings

## About Vim keybindings

The Vi family of programs (including Vim and Neovim) are modal text editors that allow for keyboard-driven text editing. Vi-style keybindings are especially popular among developers for their speed and precision in navigating and manipulating code. Warp’s [code editor](https://docs.warp.dev/code/code-editor) now includes native support for Vim keybindings (also known as Vim mode), offering a familiar editing experience directly within your coding workflows.

### How to enable Vim Keybindings

Vim mode in the code editor uses the same setting toggle as the input editor. To enable:

* Through the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-palette), search for "Vim Keybindings".
* Through `Settings > Features > General`, toggle "Edit code and commands with Vim keybindings".

Unlike the input editor, the Vim implementation in the code editor starts in Normal mode.

### Customizing Keybindings

At the moment, Warp only supports default Vim keybindings.

One exception is the keyboard shortcut for exiting insert mode, which can be rebound under `Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts > Exit Vim Insert Mode`, or through the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-palette) search for "Exit Vim Insert Mode".

## Supported Keybindings

Below is a list of the vim functionality implemented in Warp so far.
