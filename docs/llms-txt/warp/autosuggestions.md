# Autosuggestions

## How to access it

* From the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-palette), type in "Autosuggestions" to toggle.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Terminal Tip**

You can change the keybinding for accepting autosuggestions to `Tab`. Configure this in the "Tab key behavior" setting under Features > Editor. *Note: This will update the keybinding for opening the completions menu to `CTRL-SPACE`. You can also enable the "Open completions menu as you type" in Settings > Features so that the completions menu opens automatically.*
{% endhint %}

## How to use it

{% tabs %}

There are several ways to accept autosuggestions, either completely or partially:

* `CTRL-E` also, completes the autosuggestion when your cursor is at the end of the buffer.
* `CTRL-RIGHT` can be used to partially complete the autosuggestion one component at a time.
