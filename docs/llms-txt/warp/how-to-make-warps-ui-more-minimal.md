# How to Make Warp’s UI More Minimal

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GKsIT8FSsE>" %}

### 1. Start with the Command Palette

Open the Command Palette:

* Mac: `Cmd + P`
* Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + P`

From here, type “Disable” to see a full list of UI toggles.\
Warp will surface options that let you quickly hide features and visual elements.

### 2. Key UI Toggles to Disable

#### Inline & AI Features

* Disable Auto Suggestions → removes inline code hints.
* Disable Active AI → hides the ghost prompt that suggests agent queries.
* Disable Completion Menu → prevents popup completions from appearing.
* Disable Voice Input → hides the microphone icon.

#### Interface & Layout

* Disable Block Dividers → removes the horizontal lines between commands.
* Disable Tab Indicators → hides the colored status markers across your tab bar.
* Disable Dimming Inactive Panes → keeps all split panes at equal brightness.
* Disable VIM Status Bar → removes the VIM indicator if you’re not using VIM mode.

### 3. Choose a Simpler Theme

Visual noise can come from colors too.\
Try switching to a calmer theme from the Command Palette:

1. Open the palette again (`Cmd + P`)
2. Type “Theme”
3. Pick one with softer tones — for example:
   * Adeberry → calm, gray, minimal aesthetic
   * Classic Dark → familiar and focused

A consistent neutral palette makes Warp feel lighter and easier on the eyes.

### 4. Switch to the Classic Prompt

Warp’s Universal Prompt is great for AI workflows — it supports:

* Slash commands
* Voice input
* Image context
* Agent Mode

But if you just want a terminal that behaves like a classic shell, switch to the Classic Prompt:

1. Open the Command Palette → search “Prompt”
2. Choose Classic Prompt
3. (Optional) Open the Prompt Customizer to toggle chips:
   * Keep only what you need (e.g., file path)
   * Hide everything else (branch name, context icons, etc.)

This instantly gives Warp a retro, text-first look — no clutter, no distractions.

***

### 5. Reduce Tab Bar Visibility

You can make the tab bar appear only when you hover:

* Open the Settings → Appearance
* Enable “Show Tabs on Hover”

This keeps your workspace focused while still letting you access tabs when needed.
