# Full-screen Apps

## Mouse and Scroll Reporting

Warp supports configuring how to handle mouse and scroll events. They can be sent to the currently running app, e.g. `vim`, or kept and handled by Warp.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mouse reporting must be enabled to also toggle scroll reporting.
{% endhint %}

Once mouse reporting is enabled, Warp will use ANSI escape sequences to communicate mouse events to the running app.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want a mouse event to go to Warp instead (for example, for text selection) without disabling mouse reporting, you can hold the `SHIFT` key.
{% endhint %}

### How to access it

* From the Settings panel, `Settings > Features > Enable Mouse Reporting`
  * Scroll Reporting can be enabled after toggling `Enable Mouse Reporting`
* From the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-palette), search for "Toggle Mouse Reporting"
* From the macOS Menu, `View > Toggle Mouse Reporting`

## Padding

Warp supports configuring how much padding surrounds full-screen apps. The default is 0 pixel padding, but this can be changed to a custom padding amount or to match the padding in the Blocklist.

{% hint style="info" %}
Warp allows you to scale your terminal by fractions of a cell width | height. When your terminal size is not perfectly aligned to a cell width | height, the extra space appears as padding on the right | bottom.
{% endhint %}

### How to access it

* Go to `Settings > Appearance > Full Screen Apps` or from the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-palette) search for "Appearance"
  * `Use custom padding in alt-screen` is enabled by default, you can disable it to match the Blocklist padding
    * Set the desired uniform padding (px) pixels, which is set to 0px by default

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some full-screen applications don't behave well when resizing. If you are experiencing rendering issues with full screen apps, try turning this setting off. This will ensure that full-screen apps don't need to resize when starting up.
