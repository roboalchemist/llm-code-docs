# Blocks as Context

## Attaching blocks as context

Warp’s Agent can use blocks from your Agent conversations as context to better understand your queries and generate more relevant responses.

You can attach a block directly from the terminal blocklist by clicking the AI sparkles icon on it and selecting “Attach as context.”

The most common use case is to ask the AI to fix an error. You can attach the error in a query to Agent Mode and type "fix it."

**If you're already in Agent Mode, use the following ways to attach or clear context from your query:**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="macOS" %}
**Attach a previous block**

* To attach blocks to a query, you can use `CMD-UP` to attach the previous block as context to the query. While holding `CMD`, you can then use your `UP/DOWN` keys to pick another block to attach.
  * You may also use your mouse to attach blocks in your session. Hold `CMD` as you click on other blocks to extend your block selection.

**Clear a previous block**

* To clear blocks from a query, you can use `CMD-DOWN` until the blocks are removed from context.
  * You may also use your mouse to clear blocks in your session. Hold `CMD` as you click on an attached block to clear it.

{% hint style="info" %}
When using "Pin to the top" [Input Position](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/input-position), the direction for attaching or detaching is reversed (i.e. `CMD-DOWN` attaches blocks to context, while `CMD-UP` clears blocks from context).
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

**Attach a previous block**

* To attach blocks to a query, you can use `CTRL-UP` to attach the previous block as context to the query. While holding `CTRL`, you can then use your `UP/DOWN` keys to pick another block to attach.
  * You may also use your mouse to select blocks in your session. Hold `CTRL` as you click on other blocks to extend your block selection.
