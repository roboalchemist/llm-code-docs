## 10 Coding Features You Should Know in Warp

If you didn’t already know, you can code directly in Warp.

Warp includes a full set of features that make editing, reviewing, and navigating your codebase far easier than in a traditional dev tool.

\
Let’s walk through the 10 core features you need to know to get started.

***

### 1. Search for Files

Open the **Command Palette**:

* **Mac:** `Cmd + P`
* **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + P`

Then press:

* **Mac:** `Cmd + O`
* **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + O`

From here, you can search and open any file in your project — no need to `cd` around or remember long paths.

***

### 2. Tabbed File Viewer

When you open files, Warp shows them in **tabs** rather than split panes.\
This keeps your workspace clean while still allowing you to switch quickly between multiple files.

***

### 3. Full Editor Support

You can edit code directly inside Warp — just like any modern editor.

No need for memorized shortcuts:

* Click and type normally
* Highlight, copy, paste, or undo using familiar shortcuts

***

### 4. Find and Replace

Warp supports full **find and replace** with:

* Regular expressions
* Multi-cursor editing
* Replace-all
* Preserve-case rules

These features make renaming variables or refactoring code fast and consistent.

***

### 5. Syntax Highlighting

Warp supports syntax highlighting for **dozens of languages and frameworks**.\
It appears both in:

* Agent-generated diffs
* The file editor view

This makes it easy to visually scan code at a glance.

***

### 6. Linked File References

When Warp’s agent references a file, it automatically **links to the exact line of code**.\
Clicking the link opens that file at that line inside Warp — perfect for tracing logic or verifying changes.

> ⚙️ **Tip:** In **Settings → Features**, set Warp as your default editor for these file links so they open directly in Warp.

***

### 7. Code Review Panel

Warp provides a **dedicated review panel** summarizing all files and diffs touched by an agent.\
You can:

* Review and approve changes
* Edit them inline
* Reference diffs in your next prompt

This reduces hallucinations and keeps agents grounded in your actual code.

***

### 8. Code Snippet References

When Warp explains something about your codebase, it surfaces the **exact code snippet**.\
You can attach that snippet as fresh context for your next prompt.

> **PROMPT HERE:** (INSERT PROMPT USED TO ATTACH CODE SNIPPET)

This keeps token usage lean and the agent’s focus sharp.

***

### 9. Codebase Indexing

Warp can automatically **index your repositories** for faster, more context-aware responses.\
This makes it easier for agents to:

* Summarize large codebases
* Fix bugs
* Handle refactors intelligently

***

### 10. File Tree View

Click the file-tree icon in Warp to **browse your entire repo** and open any file with a single click.
