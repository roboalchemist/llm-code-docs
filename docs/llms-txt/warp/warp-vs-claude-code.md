# Warp vs Claude Code

{% embed url="<https://youtu.be/NUVftxAqZQo>" %}

### 1. Overview

This walkthrough compares Claude Code and Warp’s built-in coding agent — two tools built for AI-assisted development.\
Both can:

* Read and edit files
* Generate code diffs
* Plan multi-step tasks\
  \
  But they differ in experience, configurability, and performance.

***

### 2. Setup and Interface

#### Claude Code

* Runs as a CLI tool, requiring a terminal and the `claude` CLI installed.
* You type prompts directly into a command box.
* Supports file reading, search, and diff generation.

#### Warp

* Built directly into the Warp terminal.
* No installation needed — type a natural-language query or click the Agent button to enter Agent Mode.
* Handles the same operations as Claude Code but integrated into the environment you already use.

***

### 3. Reviewing Diffs

In Claude Code:

* You manually review diffs via CLI or external editors like VS Code.
* You can hit Shift + Tab to auto-accept all edits.

In Warp:

* You get a visual diff view built in.
* Accept, reject, or manually edit diffs inline using Warp’s lightweight editor.
* The agent automatically updates its context to avoid overwriting your changes.

***

### 4. Planning & Context Gathering

Both support planning mode for complex tasks:

* Claude Code uses a Markdown-style plan view.
* Warp can either show a similar plan or skip planning for short tasks.

For context:

* Both allow file references with `@filename`.
* Warp extends this with symbol referencing (`@functionName`) and a file tree explorer, letting you pull in specific lines and symbols as context.

***

### 5. Model Selection

Claude Code lets you pick between Claude 3 models (`Sonnet`, `Opus`, `Haiku`) via the `/model` menu.

Warp supports multiple ecosystems:

* Claude (Sonnet, Opus)
* GPT-5 (various reasoning levels)
* Gemini series

Switch models from the dropdown or directly in the agent menu.

***

### 6. Configuration

In Claude Code:

* Everything is configured via `/commands` in the CLI.
* Includes model switching, tool permissions, and sub-agent creation.

In Warp:

* Configure from Settings → AI & Agents.
* Add MCP servers, prompts, and global rules.
* Define Agent Profiles for read/write permissions, autonomy, and planning behavior.
* Maintain a global rules directory for consistent behavior across projects.

Warp also supports codebase indexing, which creates embeddings for faster semantic search across your repos.

***

### 7. Managing Agents Over Time

Claude Code:

* Shows progress directly in the CLI tab.
* Displays the current task name in the terminal tab title.

Warp:

* Adds visual indicators for agent status, progress, and toast notifications when blocked.
* Optional desktop notifications keep you informed when you’re multitasking.

***

### 8. Performance Comparison

Ben ran both tools on the same coding task — fixing a bug in the `renderKeyboardShortcut` function from a Sentry issue.

Claude Code results:

* Took \~2–4 minutes with Claude 3 Sonnet.
* Found the right issue and produced working code, though some redundant logic remained.

Warp results:

* With GPT-5, average time was \~1 minute 20 seconds.
* Consistent, high-quality output.
* Produced concise solutions with fewer redundant checks.
* Supported multiple models for experimentation.

***

### 9. Conclusions

| Criteria        | Claude Code       | Warp                     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Environment     | CLI tool          | Integrated into terminal |
| Diff Review     | External / Manual | Built-in panel           |
| Planning        | Markdown mode     | Inline or Opus-assisted  |
| Model Options   | Claude only       | Claude, GPT-5, Gemini    |
| Configurability | CLI-based         | UI + Profiles + Rules    |
| Performance     | 2–4 min avg       | \~1.2 min avg (GPT-5)    |

**TL;DR:**\
If you prefer the Claude model suite and CLI workflow — go with Claude Code.\
If you want richer diff editing, context referencing, and model flexibility — Warp is the better fit.
