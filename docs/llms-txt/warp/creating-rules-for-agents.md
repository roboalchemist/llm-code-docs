# Creating Rules For Agents

### 1. Starting with Agent Mode Evals

I’m currently adding **Evals** (short for evaluations) to test a new feature I’ve been building.

Warp quickly surfaces helpful context — like notebooks and internal docs — written by teammates on how to run Evals.\
\
This makes onboarding onto new tasks fast and collaborative.

### 2. Adding a Rust Syntax Eval

Next, I want to add an Eval that tests for Rust syntax errors.\
So I ask Warp to update the Dockerfile to include Rust.

However, the generated Dockerfile installs Rust differently than I wanted.\
It also includes `gcc` and `python` via a single `apt-get` line, which doesn’t follow our internal conventions.

### 3. Stashing Changes & Creating a Rule

Instead of fixing this manually every time, I decide to stash the current changes and create a reusable Rule that encodes our convention:

> Rule Example:\
> “Always use `apt-get` to install packages and follow the same pattern used for installing Python and GCC.”

This way, future sessions — and even other teammates — can automatically apply the same standard.

***

### 4. Applying the Rule

Now, I just ask Warp’s Agent Mode to try again!

Warp re-runs the request, follows the new rule, and correctly adds Rust with the right syntax. The code now matches our conventions.
