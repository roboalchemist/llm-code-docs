# Warp Drive as Agent Mode Context

Agent Mode can leverage your [Warp Drive](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive) contents to tailor responses to your personal and team developer workflows and environments. This includes any Workflows, Notebooks, Environmental Variables, etc..

When a Warp Drive object is pulled as context, it will be displayed in the conversation as a citation under "References" or "Derived from".

Enabled by default, this can be toggled in `Settings > AI > Knowledge > Warp Drive as Agent Mode Context`.
