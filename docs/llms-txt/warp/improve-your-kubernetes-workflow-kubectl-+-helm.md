## Overview

This guide covers 6 key Warp features that enhance Kubernetes productivity:

### AI Integration in the Terminal

Warp’s **Agent Mode** (`Cmd + I`) lets you run complex Kubernetes operations with plain-English prompts.

**Examples**

```
When does my wildcard TLS certificate expire?
```

Warp auto-detects namespaces, runs `kubectl` commands, and outputs expiration details.

```
Generate a command to identify all pods running as root across all namespaces.
```

Warp builds and runs the corresponding `kubectl` + `grep` query, returning a security report.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ideal for on-the-fly debugging or compliance checks without leaving your terminal.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Building AI-Aided Context

You can attach any command’s output as context for follow-up prompts.\
For instance, right-click log output → “Attach as Agent Context,” then run:

```
I’m sending anonymous usage data in Traefik. How can I disable it?
```

Warp detects the Helm chart and outputs the required YAML config to disable stats reporting.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Active AI Suggestions

Warp automatically suggests next actions.\
Examples of suggested actions:

* After `kubectl describe pod` it might propose:

  > “Check the logs of this pod.”
* When running `sudo apt update` it detects available upgrades and offers:

  > “Run sudo apt upgrade to update packages.”
  > {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Custom Workflows

Create reusable, parameterized commands for common operations like:

{% code title="Example workflow" %}

```bash
helm upgrade <chart> --namespace <namespace> -f <values.yaml>
```

{% endcode %}

Accessible from the **Command Palette (`Cmd + P`)**, workflows make repetitive Kubernetes tasks fast and standardized.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Synchronized Panes and Tabs

Link multiple terminal panes or tabs (e.g., master + worker nodes).\
When synchronization is active, running:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

executes simultaneously across all linked sessions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Modern Text Editing

Warp supports **click-to-edit** for commands — no more arrow key gymnastics.\
Hovering shows inline **tooltips** explaining flags and subcommands (e.g., Helm, kubectl, etc.), with autocompletions for 400+ CLI tools.
