## Intro

This tutorial teaches you how to create coding Rules that make AI follow your team’s **best practices** automatically.\
\
By specifying formatting, style preferences, and documentation standards, Warp ensures consistent, high-quality code across your repositories.

### The Problem

Developers often have different habits — formatting styles, TypeScript conventions, or comment quality.\
Without clear rules, AI-generated code can be inconsistent or hard to maintain.

### The Rule Setup

Define Rules that enforce formatting, type preferences, and doc quality.

**Example Rule**

```
Rule: Code Authoring Standards
- Always format and check work before returning results.
- Prefer `types` over `interfaces` in TypeScript.
- Apply concise, human-readable JS Docs using the Hemingway test.
```

The **Hemingway test** ensures code comments are simple and clear — short sentences, active voice, and no unnecessary complexity.

### Benefits

* Encourages readable, maintainable code
* Improves documentation clarity
* Prevents style drift across AI contributions
