# How to: Customize Warp's Appearance

{% embed url="<https://youtu.be/fzb1JcZ0fFA?si=nkWhujJKAezGfB9k>" %}

Warp is highly customizable — from appearance and keyboard shortcuts to agent behavior and autonomy.\
\
Here’s a quick walkthrough of how to make Warp feel like *your* development environment.

***

### 1. Changing Themes

Open the **Command Palette** with:

* `Cmd + P` (Mac)
* `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)

Type **“themes”** to open the theme picker.

You can preview and apply any theme instantly — for example, switching from the default theme to *Phenomenon*.

***

### 2. Adjusting Input Placement

Warp’s **input bar** can live in three different positions:

1. **Bottom-pinned** — chat-style; commands flow upward.
2. **Scrolling input** — traditional terminal style; input stays near the bottom as output moves up.
3. **Top-pinned** *(Warp-exclusive)* — input stays fixed at the top; results appear below.

### 3. Managing AI & Agent Settings

Open **Settings → AI** to control:

* Which **model** Warp uses (e.g., Claude 3.5 for code generation, GPT-4o for planning).
* How much **autonomy** agents have for:
  * Reading files
  * Generating diffs
  * Running commands
  * Planning tasks

You can also whitelist or block specific commands that always require confirmation.

***

### 4. Indexing Your Codebases

Warp prompts you to index your codebase the first time you `cd` into it.\
Indexing enables faster:

* Code navigation
* Summaries and searches
* Refactors and bug fixes

You can also manually re-index a folder from the sidebar anytime.

***

### 5. Team Collaboration

In the Teams tab, you can:

* Invite teammates
* Share Warp Drive assets like prompts, templates, and environment variables

This makes Warp a shared, contextual workspace — not just an individual tool.

***

### 6. Look & Feel

Under Appearance, you can tweak:

* Fonts
* App icons
* Padding and editor density
* VIM mode for command editing
* Custom key bindings
