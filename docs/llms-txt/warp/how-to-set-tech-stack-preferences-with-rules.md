# How To: Set Tech Stack Preferences with Rules

Learn how to guide Warp’s AI to use your favorite tech stack when scaffolding new apps or generating code.

## Intro

This tutorial walks you through teaching Warp’s AI your **preferred technologies** so it consistently uses the frameworks and stacks you care about.

By setting up tech stack Rules, you make sure every new project follows your conventions — whether you prefer **Astro**, **SvelteKit**, **Next.js**, or something else.

***

## The Problem

When you ask AI to scaffold a new web app, it often defaults to **React** and **Express**, or other older stacks.\
This creates friction when your workflow is based on modern tools or opinionated frameworks.

Warp solves this by letting you **store your stack preferences** directly as Rules.

***

## The Rule Setup

Create a simple Rule that defines your favorite frameworks for each project type.

### Example Rule

```
Rule: Tech Stack Preferences
- Use Astro for websites.
- Use SvelteKit for desktop apps.
- Prefer Vite for build tooling.
- Avoid legacy stacks like Create React App or Express.
```

Once added, Warp’s AI automatically applies these defaults when generating new projects or updating existing ones.

## Why It Matters

{% hint style="success" %}
Defining your stack preferences helps the AI:

* Generate **consistent boilerplates**
* Follow your **current tech standards**
* Skip outdated or irrelevant dependencies
