# How To Master Warp's Code Review Panel

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=47s&v=4JlN0rvoZA8>" %}

### 1. Why Use the Code Review Panel

Warp’s Code Review Panel helps you stay focused while coding by showing all active file diffs, additions, and deletions — without leaving your workspace.

***

### 2. Start with a Coding Task

The app has a UI issue: the hover text is black on dark gray, making it unreadable.

Warp’s agent generates diffs with proposed fixes — but for larger projects, scrolling through them is inefficient.

***

### 3. Opening the Code Review Panel

Click:

* View Changes (top-left), or
* The Dirty Chip in your input bar

This opens the Code Review Panel — available only when inside a Git repo.

The panel shows:

* Changed files
* Lines added/deleted
* File-by-file diff summaries

***

### 4. Editing and Reviewing Code

You can open any file directly from the panel in Warp’s **built-in editor**:

* Syntax highlighting
* Find & replace
* Inline editing

Save changes — and they’ll reflect instantly in the diff view.

***

### 5. Componentizing Changes

Want that same hover fix across the app?\
Prompt Warp to componentize the hover style.

Attach the recent diff as context so Warp can generalize it.\
The agent then creates a `Tooltip` component that reuses your schema everywhere.

***

### 6. Reviewing and Committing

Once the fix looks correct:

* Review in the code panel
* Commit directly from Warp
* Watch the panel reset to its “no changes” state

You can also click to compare your branch against `main` instantly.
