# Warp Preview & Alpha Program

### Warp Preview

Warp Preview is an early-access program that allows you to explore Warp's newest and most experimental features. It’s independent from the stable build, so you can always revert to a reliable version of Warp whenever you need it.

### Key Warp Preview Features

* **Early access**: Try out experimental features before they’re officially released.
* **Faster updates**: Enjoy frequent updates and patches as we refine new capabilities.
* **Direct impact**: Your feedback plays a critical role in shaping Warp’s future.

To learn more about Warp Preview, check out our [launch blog post](https://warp.dev/blog/warp-preview).

2. **Sign in**: [Log in](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/readme#log-in-to-warp-optional) with your Warp account (not optional for Warp Preview).
3. **Run side-by-side**: You can keep Warp Preview alongside your stable Warp installation.

### Important Notes
