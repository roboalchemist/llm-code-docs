# Pricing FAQs

### How can I upgrade and subscribe to a Warp plan?

All paid Warp plans come with higher monthly AI credit limits than the Free plan.

When you upgrade from Free to a paid plan, your AI credit usage resets. If you’re switching between paid plans, any AI usage you've already accumulated will carry over.

To subscribe to any Warp paid plan, start by [creating a Team in Warp](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/teams#creating-a-team), even if you're subscribing as an individual. Once your team is created, you can upgrade:

* In the app: Go to `Settings` > `Billing and usage`, then click the Upgrade link
* Online: Visit [warp.dev/pricing](https://www.warp.dev/pricing)

After entering your payment details, you’ll receive an invoice and confirmation via email.

### How can I get the most out of my Warp plan?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warp's legacy paid plans included Pro, Turbo, and Lightspeed.

After **Oct 30, 2025**, we have rolled out the new Build plan to replace them. Existing subscribers will start to roll over onto the Build plan starting **Dec 1st, 2025**. For questions related to the new pricing changes, please refer to [#warps-pricing-change-faqs-oct-30-2025](#warps-pricing-change-faqs-oct-30-2025 "mention").

To see more details on the latest plan, please visit [**warp.dev/pricing**](https://www.warp.dev/pricing).
{% endhint %}

Warp's plans are designed for developers who rely on AI to code, debug, and move faster with their team.

* **Build**, one usage-based plan with a set of AI credits, ability to Bring Your Own API Key (BYOK), and access to [Add-on credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/add-on-credits) with volume-based discounts. See more on [bring-your-own-api-key](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/bring-your-own-api-key "mention").
* **Business** includes everything in Build, with advanced features like automatically enforced team-wide Zero Data Retention, SAML-based SSO, and support for teams up to 50 seats.

Legacy plans:

* **Pro**, gets you a higher AI credit limits than the Free plan, support for larger codebases with [Codebase Context](https://docs.warp.dev/code/codebase-context), and access to premium models with optional pay-as-you-go overages.
* **Turbo** offers even higher AI credit limits, larger Codebase Context indexing, and the option to pay for additional usage beyond your included credits.
* **Lightspeed** is our most powerful plan, offering the highest AI credit limits, expanded codebase indexing, access to top-tier models, and pay-as-you-go overages so you can keep working without interruption.

For the most up-to-date feature and usage details, visit [**warp.dev/pricing**](https://www.warp.dev/pricing).

### How can I subscribe to a Warp Enterprise plan?

Warp offers two options for larger teams and organizations:

* **Business Plan**: Supports up to 50 seats and is available for immediate upgrade. It includes automatically enforced team-wide Zero Data Retention by default and admin-controlled SAML-based SSO.
* **Enterprise Plan**: Offers custom pricing, credit limits, and terms. Along with support for larger engineering orgs or teams with advanced security, compliance, or support needs.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you’d like to explore Enterprise, [contact our sales team](https://warp.dev/contact-sales) and someone from Warp will follow up.
{% endhint %}

### What counts as a team member and how does billing work for members?

In Warp, a *team member* is any seat with access to your Team — including the shared Warp Drive, Notebooks, Workflows, and other team resources. All plans allow you to invite unlimited users, but to unlock higher limits and advanced features, you’ll need to upgrade your team to a plan. Upgrading applies to your entire team, including your own account and all active members.

On the Free plan, you can share a limited number of Notebooks and Workflows with other Free users. If your team exceeds that limit, you’ll be prompted to [upgrade to a plan](https://app.warp.dev/upgrade).\
\
Once you upgrade, you’ll receive email notifications as team members accept invites. Billing is **prorated**, meaning you’re only charged for the days each member has access during your billing cycle. If a member leaves mid-cycle, Warp automatically applies a credit for the unused time to your next invoice.

**There are differences in how members are billed based on your payment schedule:**

* **Monthly plans**: New members are billed immediately for the remaining time in the month.
* **Annual plans**: New members are billed immediately for the remaining time in the year.

For example, if a member joins your monthly plan halfway through the month, you will be charged just half of the monthly fee ($25.00 out of $50). Similarly, if a member joins with four months remaining in an annual plan, you will be charged for those four months only, which amounts to $160 (4/12 of the annual $480).

If a member leaves part way through the billing cycle, Warp will issue a prorated credit based on the unused portion of their membership. This credit is applied to your team's next invoice, regardless of whether you're on a monthly or annual plan.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All members of the team will have the same subscription plan, you can't mix and match plans for each member of a team. In order to have different plans, you currently must have separate teams.
{% endhint %}

### What is the value of joining or creating a team on Warp?

Team members have access to your shared [Warp Drive](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive) objects and limited access to Warp's collaboration features, including Session Sharing and Warp Drive storage.

**Upgrading the team to a plan unlocks powerful collaboration and knowledge-sharing tools to help your team move faster, together:**

* Create unlimited [Notebooks](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/notebooks) and [Workflows](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/workflows) in Warp Drive to organize and share knowledge across your team.
* Use Unlimited [Session Sharing](https://docs.warp.dev/features/session-sharing) to collaborate in real time through live, shared terminal sessions.

### My co-workers are using Warp but we’re not on a Team together yet. How does billing work?

Individual users with either personal or work email domains may continue to use Warp independently without incurring billing. The benefit of joining together on a Warp Team is that you get access to a shared Team Drive and collaboration features.

When you’re ready to use Warp more collaboratively, we suggest you nominate an Admin to [create a Team](https://docs.warp.dev/features/teams) and invite members to join. When your Team exceeds the Warp Drive limits, you will be prompted to upgrade to a plan.

### How does usage work if logged into the same account on multiple devices?

When you use the account to sign into Warp on different devices, for example Linux on one computer and Windows on another, your usage of metered features like AI credits is tracked at the account level, not the device level.

You can use your Warp account on multiple personal computers. Warp is designed to provide a consistent experience across devices. When you log in with the same account on different computers, your settings and preferences can be synced through the [Settings Sync](https://docs.warp.dev/features/settings-sync) feature.

### What happens when I downgrade during a billing cycle?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note this only applies when switching between legacy plans (Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed, or the Old Business) or switching the new plans (Build, New Business). When switching between legacy to new plans, the change is immediate, prorated, and the AI credits are reset. See more in [#what-happens-when-i-change-from-my-legacy-plan-to-the-new-build-or-business-plans](#what-happens-when-i-change-from-my-legacy-plan-to-the-new-build-or-business-plans "mention").
{% endhint %}

The subscription will downgrade to the lower plan limits at the end of the billing cycle. If you’re switching between paid plans, any AI usage you've already accumulated will carry over.\
\
To downgrade at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`.

### What happens when I cancel during a billing cycle?

You can cancel at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`. The subscription will be canceled at the **end of your billing cycle**, monthly or yearly.

**You can continue to use your Warp paid plan features until the cycle end date**. Any additional team members added to your team will be invoiced at the end of your billing cycle.

### What happens if I upgrade from monthly to annual billing?

When upgrading from a monthly to annual billing cycle the billing is prorated, meaning you only pay for the annual portion of the year you haven't paid for yet. You will be billed for the remaining part of the billing year with the discounted rate.

To upgrade at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`.

### What happens to unused AI credits?

Unused AI credits do not rollover to the next cycle and can't be transferred to other accounts. You see when your credits will reset in the `Settings > Billing and usage` menu.

### What happens if my payment fails?

If a payment fails, you will receive an email from Stripe and your Warp Team Settings will show a past-due alert. Certain paid plan features and the ability to invite new members will be locked down while your Team is in a past-due state. Paying the most recent invoice through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing` will fully re-enable your paid plan features.

### What counts as an AI credit?

Each time you submit a prompt in Warp, whether to generate code, suggest a command, or accomplish a task, you initiate an interaction with the Agent. Please see more details in our [AI Credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/ai-credits) page.

### How do overages work?

Overages allow for pay-as-you-go access to premium AI models after reaching your monthly quota on Warp plans. Please see more details in our [Overages](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) page.

### What counts as an AI token?

Tokens are chunks of text, such as words, parts of code, or characters, that large language models (LLMs) break down to analyze and generate responses. LLMs have a maximum number of tokens they can process at once. AI credits and suggestions are not the same as tokens, which are limited separately regardless of which plan you're on.

{% hint style="info" %}
Warp now abstracts away token usage, so you don't need to manage or track it directly. You only need to monitor your **AI credit usage**, which is what’s measured in your plan limits and overages.
{% endhint %}

If you're curious, you can still learn more about tokens [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them), or refer to the pricing page for plan-level credit allocations. If you reach your monthly AI credit limits on a paid plan, premium models will be temporarily disabled until your quota resets at the start of your next billing cycle.

If you’d like to continue using premium models beyond your included quota, you can enable [pay-as-you-go overages](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) in `Settings > Billing and usage`.

### How often do my AI credits reset?

Allotted AI credits refill every 30 days from your signup date. When you upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.warp.dev/pricing), you will be given more credits immediately. You can follow along with your refill period by referencing `Settings > Billing and usage`. Alternatively, you can also set [Overages](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) to your desired amount to continue to use more premium model credits.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unused AI credits do not rollover to the next cycle and can't be transferred to other accounts.
{% endhint %}

### Can I use a Free plan if I'm a developer at a large company or organization?

Yes. Developers at any company size are welcome to use Warp’s Free plan.

If you need access to advanced collaboration features or higher limits, you may benefit from upgrading to a plan, but Warp does not require large organizations to upgrade.

### Are there any Warp discounts for students, non-profits, or open-source teams?

Warp doesn’t currently offer discounts for students, non-profits, or open-source teams. We recommend exploring the Free plan, which includes all core terminal features and is a great starting point for individual or community use.

### Where is Warp Drive data for my team stored?

Warp Drive data is securely stored on Google Cloud Platform servers located in the United States. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

For more details, please [visit the Security Overview](https://www.warp.dev/security) or contact <security@warp.dev>.

### What happened to the Lite model?

Over time, the Lite model—originally designed as a fallback when premium models ran out—began to deliver inconsistent results, especially for users running complex, multi-step prompts.

For credit-efficient usage, we encourage you to try our new **Auto (cost-efficiency) model**, which automatically selects the optimal model based on task complexity to help extend your credits. To continue AI usage please either add [Add-on Credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/add-on-credits) or consider [using your own API key](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/bring-your-own-api-key).

If you have any questions or feedback, please connect with us in our [community Slack](https://docs.warp.dev/sending-us-feedback#sending-warp-feedback).

### What payment options are available for Warp's self-service plans?

Warp processes payments through Stripe. We currently accept credit or debit cards and US bank accounts.

At this time, we do not support ACH transfers, checks, cash, money orders, or cryptocurrency.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`. Cancelled subscriptions will remain active until the end of the billing cycle.

### How do I get a refund?

For monthly subscriptions, we in general do not issue refunds. Please see [Warp's Refund Policy](#warps-refund-policy) for details and exceptions.

You can remove the users you do not want to pay for in `Settings > Teams > Team Members`. Prorated refunds are issued as Warp credit, not cash.

### Why doesn't my promo code work or why was it disabled?

Warp's promotions are a way to try Warp before committing to a subscription, not get unlimited free or inexpensive AI. In order to prevent abuse, we're limiting promotion codes to first-time redemptions only, so each account can only use one promotion code.\
\
In addition certain promo codes we issue are only valid for specific plans (not all plans) and expire after a certain time. If you apply a promo code for a certain plan, then upgrade to another plan, the promotion doesn't transfer to the new plan so you will end up paying full price for the upgrade.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warp reserves the right to disable any promotion codes at any time, and cancel the associated subscriptions if we find that the code was being abused.
{% endhint %}

### How can I subscribe to Warp as tax exempt?

Warp does allow tax exempt organizations to subscribe, but there are some additional steps that you need to take.

1. Create a Warp account, login, and go to the [upgrade page](https://app.warp.dev/upgrade), and select a plan, but **don't checkout or pay yet.** This will only setup your billing account in the system that will be used in the later steps.
2. E-mail <billing@warp.dev> with your proof of your organization tax exempt status and your Warp account email.
3. Warp's team will verify your tax exempt status and will change your account to tax exempt.
4. Finally, subscribe to your plan of choice, you will see not taxes applied to the bill.

### Why can't I subscribe to Warp?

There are certain prohibited and restricted businesses in which Stripe and major credit card networks will not process payments. For the most updated information, please see the full list [here](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses).

### I have a question and need help. How can I reach a human at Warp?

The team at Warp is standing by and ready to help you with any questions you have about your plan or subscription. Please email us at <billing@warp.dev> and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

### Warp's Pricing Change FAQs (Oct 30, 2025)

For more details, see this blog post on [Warp's plan changes](https://www.warp.dev/blog/changing-pricing).

#### How do I change from my current plan to the new Build or Business plan?

You can switch to the new Warp Build or Business plan anytime from `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing > Update subscription` in the Warp app or at [app.warp.dev/upgrade](https://app.warp.dev/upgrade). Select Change plan, then choose the plan that fits your needs.

If you take no action, your Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed, or legacy Business plan will automatically move to the new structure on your first renewal after **December 1, 2025**. You’ll receive an email before your renewal with details and other details to make the transition easier.

#### What happens when I change from my legacy plan to the new Build or Business plans?

If you move from Warp’s legacy Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed, or old Business plans to the new Build or Business plans:

* You’ll receive a prorated credit balance on Stripe for your current plan, based on how far you are into your billing cycle. This balance can be applied toward monthly Build fees or any Add-on Credits you purchase.
  * You can view your credit balance by going to `Settings > Billing and Usage > Manage Account`. You can also view your credit balance on the Stripe invoice that was sent when your plan changed to Build or Business.
* Your credit balance will reset to **0/1,500** when you switch to the Build or Business plan.

If you switched immediately after the rollout, before a subsequent update was applied, we’ll retroactively reset your credit balance to 0/1,500.

* You should see this reflected in `Settings > Billing and Usage`. If you experience any issues, please contact us at **<build-priority@warp.dev>**.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend you use all the AI credits on your legacy plan before you switch over to the new plans. This way you can make best use of them before they are reset to the new plan limits.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Add-on credit auto reload will be enabled by default for some legacy plan users when they transition to the Build plan. Please see more in our [Pricing FAQs](#what-happens-to-my-current-plan-pro-turbo-lightspeed).
{% endhint %}

#### What should I keep in mind about this change?

* **BYOK and Add-on credits**: These are only available on the new Build and Business plans. Switching early gives you immediate access.
* **Pricing differences**: Depending on your usage, your monthly cost may increase or decrease. You’ll now pay based on what you actually use.
* **Renewal timing**: You’ll stay on your current plan until your renewal date after December 1. No interruptions to service will occur.
* **Transparency**: You can view your credit balance, monthly spend limit, and Add-on settings anytime in `Settings > Billing and usage`.

For full details, see [warp.dev/pricing](https://www.warp.dev/pricing) or reach out to <billing@warp.dev> if you have questions about your transition.

#### For existing paid users: when will the new pricing take effect for my account?

For **new customers**, the new pricing and packaging take effect immediately on Oct 30, 2025.

For **existing monthly subscribers**, changes will apply on your first renewal after **December 1, 2025**; most likely during the month of December 2025. For **annual subscribers**, the new plan and pricing will take effect on your next renewal after December 1, 2025.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at **<billing@warp.dev>**.

#### **What happens to my current plan (Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed, Business)?**

You will retain your current plan and credits until the first renewal after December 1, 2025. At renewal, all current Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed, and Business plans will transition to the new Warp Build and Business plans.

The Build and new Business plans includes 1,500 monthly AI credits, the ability to purchase [add-on-credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/add-on-credits "mention") that roll over for 12 months, and the ability to bring your own API key. Learn more at [warp.dev/pricing](https://www.warp.dev/pricing).

In addition, [Add-on credit auto reload](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/add-on-credits#id-2.-enable-auto-reload) will be automatically enabled for some legacy plan users in the following ways (but can be opted out of or modified at any time). Our goal is to maintain the same maximum monthly spend in line with your legacy plan subscription plus any Overages:

* **Pro:** Will transition to the Build plan. Auto-reload ***will not*****&#x20;be enabled by default**.
* **Turbo:** Will transition to the Build plan. Auto-reload ***will*****&#x20;be enabled by default**. It will default to $30 auto-reload monthly spending limit for monthly subscribers and $22 for yearly subscribers. A handful of Turbo subscribers received a bulk discount for teams of 3 or more—please check your email for details on the default spending limits for your account.
* **Lightspeed:** Will transition to the Build plan. Auto-reload ***will*****&#x20;be enabled by default**. It will default to $205 auto-reload monthly spending limit for monthly subscribers and $182 for yearly subscribers.
* **Business:** Will transition to the new Business plan. Auto-reload ***will*****&#x20;be enabled by default**. It will default to $10 auto-reload monthly spending limit for both monthly and yearly subscribers.

In any of the above cases, if Overages were enabled, we will set the monthly auto-reload spending limit equal to your Overage spending limit plus any of the amounts listed above.\
\
If your total auto-reload monthly spend limit is $80 or above, we will set the Add-on credit denomination to $20 / 1000 credits by default. If your total auto reload monthly spending limit is below $80, we will set the Add-on credit denomination to $10 / 400 credits by default.

#### Can I continue to use Warp as my primary terminal?

Yes, the terminal features of Warp will continue to be free to use for developers. Learn more at [](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing "mention").

#### How are Add-on credits different from overages?

Add-on credits replace overages with a simpler, prepaid system. They’re up to \~40% cheaper than the old overage rates, roll over month-to-month, and remain valid for 12 months. They also come with Warp’s full SOC 2 / Zero Data Retention protection.

#### Do AI credits rollover?

For existing users on legacy plans, plan credits on Pro, Turbo, and Lightspeed do not rollover. Neither will pay-as-you-go Overage credits.

For the Build plan, credits will not rollover but Add-on credits will rollover and be valid for 12 months from the date of purchase.

#### Can I bring my own key on legacy plans (Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed)?

No, Bring-your-own API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini is only available to users on the Warp Build plan. You can choose to switch your existing plan to Warp Build at any time before your applicable renewal date to access BYOK.

#### How does the monthly spend limit on Add-on Credits work?

You set a monthly spend limit that applies to your AI usage for each calendar month. This limit acts as the maximum amount you can spend on credits during that period.

If a purchase would exceed your limit, it won’t go through—you’ll need to either increase your limit or choose a smaller purchase amount.

**For auto reload settings:**

* New users who enable auto reload will start with a $200 spend limit.
* Existing paid plan users who enable auto reload will have their limit match their existing Overages spend limit (if previously configured, otherwise $200).

#### I’m an individual developer and need more than 1,500 AI credits per month. What’s the right plan for me?

If you regularly use more than 1,500 AI credits per month, the Build plan is designed for you. It includes 1,500 monthly credits and gives you the flexibility to scale further with Add-on Credits, which you can purchase at discounted rates directly under `Settings > Billing and usage`.

Add-on Credits roll over month to month, remain valid for 12 months, and offer up to \~40% savings for larger denominations. You can also enable auto reload to automatically top up your credits when your balance runs low.

If you’re part of a team that needs shared credit management, SSO, or enforced Zero Data Retention (ZDR), the Business plan provides all the same AI capabilities plus advanced security and administrative features.

#### Should I subscribe to the Build plan or the Business plan?

If you’re an individual developer or part of a small team, the Build plan is the best fit. It includes 1,500 monthly AI credits, discounted Add-on Credits for additional usage, and the ability to bring your own API key (BYOK) for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google models. You’ll also get unlimited Warp Drive objects, collaboration tools, and the highest codebase indexing limits.

If you’re part of a larger team (up to 50 members) that needs advanced administrative and security controls, choose the Business plan. It includes everything in Build, plus SSO, enforced Zero Data Retention (ZDR), shared Add-on Credits that can be used by all team members, and centralized billing – ideal for organizations that need stronger security, compliance, and team-wide management.

#### How do AI credits work for multi-seat teams?

For teams on the Build or Business plans, AI credits are managed at two levels:

* **Included monthly credits**: Each seat on a paid plan receives 1,500 individual credits per month. These credits are tied to the user and reset every 30 days based on their subscription or renewal date.
* **Add-on Credits**: Once individual plan credits are used up, team members draw from a shared Add-on Credit balance that can be topped up and managed by team admins. Add-on Credits roll over month to month, remain valid for 12 months, and can be purchased at discounted rates directly under Settings > Billing and usage.

This shared model gives teams the flexibility to handle variable AI usage – heavy users can consume more when needed, while the entire team benefits from shared value and volume-based discounts.
