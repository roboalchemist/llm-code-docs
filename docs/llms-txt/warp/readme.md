# Quickstart Guide

## Key Features:

* [**Code**](https://docs.warp.dev/code/code-overview): Warp is optimized for writing code by prompt on large, existing codebases. When Warp detects an opportunity to write code, it will enter an advanced code generation flow.
* [**Modern terminal**](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/editor): A fast, editor-style input environment with cursor movement, multi-line editing, and rich completions. Every command or prompt appears in clean, navigable Blocks. Includes built-in SSH support, flexible window management, and full Mac/Windows/Linux compatibility.
* [**Agents**](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/agents-overview): Warp autodetects whether you are typing a natural language prompt or a command. Use natural language prompts to have Warp write code, debug issues, or write commands for you.
* [**Multi-agent management**](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/managing-agents): Warp is designed to have multiple agents running at once. Agents will send you notifications if they require your input, and you can see all your agents in one panel.
* [**Universal Input**](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/universal-input): Type naturally and let Warp understand what you mean. You can talk to it in plain English, ask for fixes or explanations, and invoke agents without switching modes or special syntax.
* [**Code Review**](https://docs.warp.dev/code/code-review): Warp surfaces agent-generated code diffs in an integrated diff view, letting you inspect changes, refine them with natural language, or apply them when ready. You stay in control while agents produce and update code across your repo.
* [**Ambient Agents (Beta)**](https://docs.warp.dev/ambient-agents): Warp can also run agents asynchronously in the cloud. Ambient Agents are designed for background, long-running, or event-driven work, like PR review, issue triage, dependency updates, and routine repo maintenance.&#x20;
* [**Integrations**](https://github.com/warpdotdev/gitbook/blob/main/docs/broken-reference/README.md): Warp connects directly with your team’s tools. Use [Slack](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations/slack), [Linear](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations/linear), [GitHub Actions](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations/github-actions), and other integrations to trigger agents in the cloud, run workflows on your codebase, and make changes asynchronously.
* [**Platform**](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/warp-platform): The underlying infrastructure that powers Ambient Agents and integrations, including the CLI, Agent API/SDK, orchestration layer, environments/execution, secrets, and management/observability.

You can fully customize Warp's appearance, prompts, settings, and keybindings to fit your preferences. Warp works with zsh, bash, fish, and PowerShell, and is built with Rust for high performance.
