# Understanding Your Codebase

### 1. The Challenge

Kevin, who worked on Warp’s Windows and Linux builds, wanted to jump into a feature he hadn’t touched before: Block Sharing.\
\
This feature spans two codebases — Warp’s client (Rust) and server (Go) — making onboarding tough.

That’s where Codebase Context comes in.

***

### 2. What Is Codebase Context?

Warp’s Codebase Context uses semantic search to understand your code.\
It doesn’t rely on exact function or variable names — instead, it searches based on meaning.

You can use it through a shared workflow in Warp Drive.

This prompt tells Warp to:

* Search across both client and server codebases
* Summarize how a feature works end-to-end
* Include clickable links to relevant files

***

### 3. Real Example: Block Sharing

Kevin types `block sharing` into Warp’s shared workflow.\
Warp:

1. Searches the client codebase for the rendering logic
2. Searches the server codebase for GraphQL handlers
3. Generates a summary combining both perspectives

The output includes:

* Architecture overview
* Linked file paths
* Function and module summaries

No more manual onboarding or guessing file names.

***

### 4. Incremental Syncing

Whenever you change a file in an indexed repo:

* Warp detects the update automatically
* Re-embeds just that file
* Keeps your code context fresh

That means agents never reference stale code.

***

### 5. Why It’s Game-Changing

Codebase Context helps teams:

* Understand large or unfamiliar codebases
* Onboard faster
* Jump between client and server logic seamlessly
* Generate accurate, clickable documentation
