# Linear

The Linear integration lets your team delegate development work directly to Warp agents from inside Linear. When you tag Warp on an issue or comment, an agent will spin up in the cloud, clone the repos defined in your environment, and begin working through the task.

Agents keep you updated inside Linear, generate pull requests using your GitHub account, and provide a link to join a live remote session so you can watch or steer the workflow in real time.

This guide explains what the integration does, how it works end-to-end, and how to configure it for your Warp team.

### Using Warp inside Linear

Assigning Warp to an issue or tagging @warp in a Linear comment starts an agent run. Warp clones the repositories defined in your environment, sets up your development environment using your Docker image and setup commands, and begins working through the task with full context from your codebase and the Linear issue. Agents post updates as they progress, including a task list, elapsed time, and checkpoints, so you can follow along without leaving Linear.

Agents also share a link to an interactive remote session using Warp’s [Ambient Agent Session Sharing](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/session-sharing/ambient-agents-session-sharing). Opening this link lets you view the live terminal output for the running agent in Warp or in the browser. From there, you can interrupt or guide the agent with additional instructions when needed. Once the agent finishes, it will create a pull request on your behalf — using your GitHub permissions — and post a summary of its work and the PR link back into Linear.

You can start an agent in two ways:

* **Tag Warp in a comment** (@Warp) and describe what you want done.
* **Assign the issue to Warp** as if it were a teammate.

Warp will acknowledge the request directly in the Linear issue and begin working.

Agents keep you informed through:

* **Activity updates** inside Linear
* A **running task list** and timeline showing what the agent is working on
* A **shared session link** that opens a live view of the agent’s cloud environment

Session sharing works in Warp or in a browser view and allows multiple teammates to watch the session.

#### Joining the remote session

Selecting [**Open in Warp**](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/session-sharing/ambient-agents-session-sharing) (or the web option) opens the active session. You’ll see:

* The agent’s full execution log
* The plan pane with the task list
* An input box to add clarifying instructions
* A real-time view identical to a local Warp task

Any instructions you give will interrupt the agent, feed the new context, and resume work.

When the task is complete:

* Warp commits the changes using your GitHub identity
* A pull request is created through the GitHub CLI
* The PR includes a clean title and description based on the Linear issue and the agent’s work
* A summary and link to the PR appear in the Linear issue

Because PRs are created as *you*, this makes code review, auditing, and team collaboration straightforward.

### Requirements

* Cloud agents are available only to **paid Warp users**. See [Warp Pricing](https://www.warp.dev/pricing) for more details.
* You must be logged into Warp with the same email as your Linear workspace.
* You must authorize the Warp GitHub app the first time you trigger an agent.
  * The repositories involved must be included in your environment and accessible to the Warp GitHub app.
* You must have write access to the repo if you want Warp to create PRs on your behalf.

***

### How to configure the integration

Setup involves two steps powered by the [cli](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/cli "mention"). For more instructions, see [integrations-overview](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations/integrations-overview "mention").

#### 1. Create an environment

An environment defines everything the agent needs to run your code:

* A **Docker image** (public on Docker Hub)
* A set of **GitHub repos** the agent should clone
* Optional **setup commands** that run before the agent starts

You can create an environment via:

* The CLI
* The guided flow using `/create-environment` ([slash-commands](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/slash-commands "mention"))

For full instructions, see our [Environment Setup](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations/integrations-overview) docs.

#### 2. Create the Linear integration

Once your environment exists, create the integration:

```
warp integration create linear --environment <ENV_ID>
```

The CLI will open a browser window prompting you to install the Warp app into your Linear workspace. After installation, the integration becomes available to all members of your Warp team.

***

### Uninstallation instructions

To remove the Warp integration from Linear:

1. Only a Linear team admin can manage app permissions.
2. In Linear, go to **Settings**.
3. Navigate to Agents under the Features section.
4. Select Warp from the list of installed agents.
5. Click **Revoke acces**s to remove the integration for your workspace.

After revoking access, Warp will no longer be able to read issues, receive triggers, or create updates in Linear. If you reinstall later, you’ll need to authorize Warp again during setup.

### Troubleshooting

If something isn’t working as expected—missing repos, PR failures, Linear not detecting Warp, or environment issues—see our [Integrations Troubleshooting](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations-overview#troubleshooting) page for detailed guidance on GitHub permissions, environment configuration, and common setup problems.
