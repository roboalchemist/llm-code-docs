In this demo, Ben shows how to trigger Warp’s coding agent from a GitHub Action to automate bug report handling as soon as issues hit your repository.

* The workflow acts like a maintainer-first “front door” for bugs: it evaluates whether a report is actionable, asks for missing details when it isn’t, and escalates directly into a draft pull request when it is

**The first half focuses on triage.**

* The agent reads the issue (and optionally your repo’s bug report template) and returns a simple ready/not-ready decision.
* If the report is missing key context like a clear description or reproduction steps, the workflow automatically posts a friendly comment requesting the missing info and applies a “needs info” label for maintainers to track.

**The second half extends the workflow into investigation + fix.**

* When a report has sufficient detail, Ben shows the agent investigating the codebase, implementing a fix, adding tests, running verification, and returning a PR-ready summary.
* The GitHub Action then commits the changes and opens a draft PR that follows the repo’s pull request template and links back to the original issue for review.
