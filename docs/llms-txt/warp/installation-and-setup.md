**Debian- and Ubuntu-based distributions**

The easiest way to install Warp is to download [x64 .deb package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=deb) or [ARM64 deb package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=deb_arm64). After downloading, you can install the package with:

```
sudo apt install ./<file>.deb
```

Installing the .deb package will automatically set up the Warp apt repository and signing key needed to automatically update Warp and verify the integrity of the downloaded packages.

Alternatively, you can manually configure the Warp apt repository and install Warp by running the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install wget gpg
wget -qO- https://releases.warp.dev/linux/keys/warp.asc | gpg --dearmor > warpdotdev.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 warpdotdev.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/warpdotdev.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/warpdotdev.gpg] https://releases.warp.dev/linux/deb stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/warpdotdev.list'
rm warpdotdev.gpg
sudo apt update && sudo apt install warp-terminal
```

**RHEL-, Fedora-, and CentOS-based distributions**

The easiest way to install Warp is to download the [x64 .rpm package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=rpm) or [ARM64 .rpm package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=rpm_arm64). After downloading, you can install the package with:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./<file>.rpm
```

Installing the .rpm package will automatically set up the Warp yum repository. On first update, `dnf` will retrieve the signing key needed to verify the integrity of the downloaded packages.

Alternatively, you can manually configure the Warp yum repository and install Warp by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://releases.warp.dev/linux/keys/warp.asc
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[warpdotdev]\nname=warpdotdev\nbaseurl=https://releases.warp.dev/linux/rpm/stable\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://releases.warp.dev/linux/keys/warp.asc" > /etc/yum.repos.d/warpdotdev.repo'
sudo dnf install warp-terminal
```

**Arch Linux-based distributions**

The easiest way to install Warp is to download the [x64 .pkg.tar.zst package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=pacman) or [ARM64 pacman package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=pacman_arm64). After downloading, you can install the package with:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./<file>.pkg.tar.zst
```

The first time you update Warp through the app, it will guide you through setting up the Warp pacman repository and signing key.

Alternatively, you can manually configure the Warp pacman repository and install Warp by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo -e '\n[warpdotdev]\nServer = https://releases.warp.dev/linux/pacman/\$repo/\$arch' >> /etc/pacman.conf"
sudo pacman-key -r "linux-maintainers@warp.dev"
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key "linux-maintainers@warp.dev"
sudo pacman -Sy warp-terminal
```

**OpenSUSE- and SLE-based distributions**

The Warp yum repository also works for OpenSUSE- and SLE-based systems. Download the [x64 .rpm package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=rpm) or [ARM64 .rpm package](https://app.warp.dev/download?package=rpm_arm64). After downloading, you can install the package with:

```bash
sudo zypper install ./<file>.rpm
```

Installing the .rpm package will automatically set up the Warp yum repository. On first update, `zypper` will retrieve the signing key needed to verify the integrity of the downloaded packages.

Alternatively, you can manually configure the Warp yum repository and install Warp by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://releases.warp.dev/linux/keys/warp.asc
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[warpdotdev]\nname=warpdotdev\ntype=rpm-md\nbaseurl=https://releases.warp.dev/linux/rpm/stable\nenabled=1\nautorefresh=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://releases.warp.dev/linux/keys/warp.asc\nkeeppackages=0" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/warpdotdev.repo'
sudo zypper install warp-terminal
```

**AppImage**

We also provide an [AppImage](https://appimage.org), a single-file executable version of Warp. Installing Warp via a package manager is recommended, as it will ensure your system has all necessary dependencies installed.

You can download the Warp AppImage with the following commands:

```bash
# On x64 systems
curl -L "https://app.warp.dev/download?package=appimage" -o Warp-x64.AppImage
chmod +x Warp-x64.AppImage
```

```bash
# On ARM64 systems
curl -L "https://app.warp.dev/download?package=appimage_arm64" -o Warp-ARM64.AppImage
chmod +x Warp-ARM64.AppImage
```

**Running Warp on Linux**

If you installed a package, find Warp in your desktop manager or run `warp-terminal` on your terminal. If you're using the AppImage, you can launch it by navigating to the directory where the AppImage is located and running `./Warp-*.AppImage`.

Want to try our newest features? [Warp Preview](https://docs.warp.dev/community/warp-preview-and-alpha-program) is available on all platforms and architectures (macOS, Windows, Linux) for early access to experimental features.

## Initial Setup

### Log in to Warp (Optional)

After installation, you have the option to create a Warp account thru the "Sign up" bottom on the top right or in `Settings > Account > Sign up`. You have the option to skip this step. If you're having issues logging in, you can check out the [Login Troubleshooting](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/troubleshooting-login-issues) page.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you sign up using Google or GitHub, Warp only gets access to the associated email address. Visit the [Privacy](https://docs.warp.dev/privacy/privacy) page for more details on Warp's approach to privacy.
{% endhint %}

### Use Warp offline

You will only need an active internet connection when you open the Warp app for the first time. Once opened, [Warp is able to run with no internet connection](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/using-warp-offline), although certain features that require an internet connection like AI and real-time collaboration features will be unavailable.

### Import your settings

If you are migrating to Warp from a terminal like iTerm2, you can easily import your settings, such as keyboard shortcuts and color themes. For more details, visit the [Migrate to Warp](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/migrate-to-warp) docs.

### Set up your Warp default shell

Warp tries to load your login shell by default. Currently, Warp supports bash, fish, zsh, and PowerShell (pwsh). If your login shell is set to something else (for example, Nushell) Warp will load zsh by default.

Zsh is the default login and interactive shell on macOS (starting with macOS Catalina in 2019), replacing the bash shell. For most Linux distributions, the default shell is bash.

You can change your default shell by going to `Settings > Features > Session`. In the Startup shell for new sessions section, you can choose which shell you want Warp to use.
