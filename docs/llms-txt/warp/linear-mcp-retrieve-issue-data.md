# Linear MCP: Retrieve issue data

Learn how to connect the Linear MCP server in Warp so your AI agent can access live data — like issues, tickets, and user assignments — directly from your Linear workspace.

#### Overview

This tutorial covers how to:

* Add and configure a Linear MCP server in Warp
* Use MCP to query and retrieve issue data

### 1. Adding the Linear MCP Serve

#### Add a new server in Warp

* In Warp, open Warp Drive → Personal → MCP Servers.\
  Alternatively, press `⌘P` and type **MCP servers** to open the palette.
* Click **Add New Server**.
* Paste in this JSON

```json
{
  "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"],
      "env": {},
      "working_directory": null
    } 
}
```

* Click Save.
* Warp will immediately start the server.&#x20;
* You should now see Linear MCP listed as Running.

### 2. Testing the Connection

After saving, retry your earlier query:

```
Show me all Linear tasks assigned to me.
```

Warp’s agent will now call the Linear MCP server to fetch your data. You can click inside the response panel to inspect the **raw API response** — ideal for debugging or understanding what’s being fetched.

If the server can’t find your user, it may be due to your Linear login address. Try querying a teammate to confirm the connection:

```
Show tasks assigned to [teammate name].
```

Once verified, the agent can display a full list of tasks.
