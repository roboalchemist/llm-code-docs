# Troubleshooting

## Environments

#### How do I see what environment my integration is using?

List your integrations:

```
warp integration list
```

This shows each integration, its ID, and the environment it’s linked to. Use this to confirm which environment to inspect or update before making changes.

#### How do I see what’s inside that environment?

Once you know the environment ID, run:

```
warp environment get <ENV_ID>
```

This prints the full configuration, including:

* The **environment ID** (used in other commands)
* The **name**
* The **Docker image**
* Associated **repos**

This is the most reliable way to verify what the agent will see when it runs.

#### How do I add or remove repos and setup commands?

Use `warp environment` update. You can modify environments incrementally without recreating them.

**Add a repo:**

```
warp environment update <ENV_ID> --repo owner/repo
```

**Remove a repo:**

```
warp environment update <ENV_ID> --remove-repo owner/repo
```

**Add a setup command:**

```
warp environment update <ENV_ID> --setup-command "your command"
```

**Remove a setup command (must match exactly):**

```
warp environment update <ENV_ID> --remove-setup-command "exact command"
```

Notes:

* Warp may prompt you to adjust GitHub app permissions when adding repos.
* Setup commands run in the order they are defined.

#### **How do I delete an environment?**

If an environment is no longer needed:

```
warp environment delete <ID>
```

Only do this once you’ve confirmed no active integrations are relying on that environment. If an integration points to a deleted environment, requests from Slack/Linear will fail until you create a new integration with a valid environment.

### Integrations

#### **How do I figure out what environment my integration is using?**

List your integrations:

```
warp integration list
```

This shows each integration, its ID, and the environment it’s attached to. Use this when you’re unsure which environment to update or delete.

#### **I created a new environment, but don’t see it when running warp integration create**

Check:

1. Environment exists and is healthy: `warp environment list`
2. You’re on the correct Warp team. Make sure your local CLI is logged into the same team where the environment was created.
   1. If both look correct and the environment still doesn’t appear, recreate it and confirm there were no errors during creation.

## GitHub & repo access issues

#### **I’m being asked to authorize GitHub when creating/using an environment**

This happens when:

* You add a repo that Warp doesn’t have access to yet, or
* You personally haven’t granted the Warp GitHub app permissions for that repo.

Follow the GitHub popup flow to install/adjust the Warp GitHub app.

#### **The agent can’t open PRs or push changes to my repo**

Check the following:

1. **Repo is part of your environment**.
   1. Make sure the repo is listed in: `warp environment get <id>`
2. **Warp GitHub app has access to that repo**
   1. In GitHub’s settings, confirm the Warp app is installed and that the repo is selected.
3. **You have write access**
   1. The agent inherits your GitHub permissions. If you only have read access, Warp can’t open PRs or push branches on your behalf.

### Docker image & environment failures

#### **I see errors like “pull access denied” or “repository does not exist”**

Check:

1. The Docker image name and tag are correct.
2. The image is public on Docker Hub.
3. You can pull it locally: `docker pull <image_name>`

If local docker pull fails, fix the image visibility/name first, then recreate or update the environment with a working image.

#### **The agent can’t find tools or runtimes inside the environment**

This usually means the Docker image is missing required dependencies. Fix by either:

* Updating the Dockerfile used to build the image, then pushing a new version to Docker Hub and updating the environment with the new image, or
* Adding additional setup commands to install the missing tools: `warp environment update --setup-command "apt-get update && apt-get install -y "`
