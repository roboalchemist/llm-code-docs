# Ambient Agents Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
**Beta**: Ambient Agents are currently in beta. APIs, CLI commands, and product behavior may change. If you have feedback, reach out in the [Warp Community Slack](https://go.warp.dev/join-preview).
{% endhint %}

Warp’s Ambient Agents are **cloud connected**, **background agents** built on the [Warp Platform](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/warp-platform). They run automatically in response to system events, schedules, or integrations. Together with Warp’s interactive agent (in the desktop app), they support both real-time, human-in-the-loop work and fully autonomous execution.

### What Ambient Agents are designed for

Ambient Agents are designed for situations where:

* **You need agents to react to system events.**
  * Examples include crashes, bug reports, Slack interactions, cron timers, or CI steps.
* **You want observability into agent activity across a team or system.**
  * This includes being able to see what ran, when it ran, and what it did.
* **You need more parallelism than local execution typically allows.**
  * For example, running many agent tasks concurrently in the cloud, sharding a repo-wide task into multiple runs, or fanning out the same task across multiple targets.
* **You want agents to operate continuously as part of engineering infrastructure.**
  * This includes scheduled maintenance tasks and integration-driven automation.

### What is an Ambient Agent run?

An Ambient Agent run is represented as an agent task. A task is created when a trigger fires (for example a webhook event or schedule) or when a user starts a run explicitly.&#x20;

Each task includes:

* **Inputs**: a prompt, and often additional context from the triggering system (for example a Slack message, PR metadata, or CI logs).
* **Execution context (optional)**: an [Environment](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/cli/integrations-and-environments#what-is-an-environment) that defines the repo, image, and startup commands the agent should run with.
* **Lifecycle state**: created → running → completed / failed.
* **Persistent record**: status, metadata, and a session transcript that can be reviewed after the task completes.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are evaluating whether something should be an Ambient Agent, a good test is whether you can define:\
(1) what triggers it, (2) what context it needs, and (3) how the team will inspect or validate the output.
{% endhint %}

### How Ambient Agents work

Ambient Agents run on the [Warp Platform](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/warp-platform), which provides the primitives for triggering work, orchestrating tasks, executing agents (optionally in Environments), injecting secrets, and inspecting results. You can adopt them incrementally, but most production deployments follow the same structure:

* Something **triggers** an agent task.
* The **orchestrator creates** and tracks the task.
* The agent **executes** on a host, optionally inside an [environment](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/cli/integrations-and-environments#what-is-an-environment), with whatever [secrets](https://docs.warp.dev/ambient-agents/agent-secrets) and credentials it needs.

The exact way tasks are triggered and executed depends on your deployment model (for example CLI-only, Warp-hosted orchestration, or self-hosted execution). Those options are covered in the [Deployment Patterns](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/deployment-patterns) pages.

### What you get by default

Because Ambient Agents run on the [Warp Platform](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/warp-platform), each run is tracked and produces a persistent record that can be observed, shared, and audited (even if execution happens outside the Warp app).

#### Observability and steerability

Ambient Agent tasks are designed to be inspectable by the team:

* [Agent Session Sharing](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/session-sharing/ambient-agents-session-sharing) lets authorized teammates attach to a running task to monitor progress and, where supported, steer the agent while it runs.
* Each run produces a session transcript and task metadata, which provides a record of what the agent did.
* A [management experience](https://docs.warp.dev/ambient-agents/managing-ambient-agents) surfaces task status and history.

#### Centralized configuration

Ambient Agent workflows often rely on shared configuration such as [MCP servers](https://docs.warp.dev/ambient-agents/mcp-servers-for-agents), rules, saved prompts, environment variables, and [secrets](https://docs.warp.dev/ambient-agents/agent-secrets).&#x20;

Warp supports centralized configuration so the same workflow behaves consistently across triggers (for example Slack + CI + schedules), without duplicating setup in every system.

#### API access to tasks

The Warp Platform exposes task visibility via the [**Agent API and SDKs**](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/agent-api-and-sdk), so teams can…

* Query which tasks are running or have run.
* Fetch task metadata and outcomes.
* Build internal dashboards or monitoring (for example success rates, runtime, failure reasons).

### Using Ambient Agents with or without Warp’s app

Ambient Agents do not require the Warp desktop app. Teams can deploy and operate them through the Warp Platform using:&#x20;

* [Warp CLI](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/cli)
* Web surfaces (where available)
* [Agent Session Sharing](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/session-sharing/agent-session-sharing)
* [Agent Management UX](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/using-agents/managing-agents)
* Admin settings and [APIs](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/agent-api-and-sdk)

If your team also uses Warp’s terminal, you get an additional workflow: tasks launched via the CLI can be handed off into an interactive session for review, edits, or continuation.

### Team and billing requirements

Ambient Agents and [integrations](https://docs.warp.dev/integrations) run on the [Warp Platform](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/warp-platform) control plane, and usage is billed using AI credits. Credits are shared at the team level.

To run **integrations (and most Ambient Agent automation)**, your team must meet the following requirements:

* **Plan requirements**
  * **Supported plans**: Build, Business
  * Not supported: Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed, legacy Business
  * Your plan must support add-on credits.
* **Credit requirements**
  * Your team must have at least 20 [add-on credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/add-on-credits) available to run an integration.
  * Integration usage is billed to the team’s add-on credit balance.
  * Ambient Agents and integrations do not draw from personal monthly base credits.

For more details, please refer to: [team-access-billing-and-identity-permissions](https://docs.warp.dev/platform/team-access-billing-and-identity-permissions "mention")

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the team’s add-on credit balance reaches zero, integrations and Ambient Agent runs that require add-on credits will not be able to execute until credits are replenished.
{% endhint %}
