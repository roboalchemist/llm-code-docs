# Command Corrections

## What is it

This feature was built on top of the open-source project [nvdn/thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck). Here are some examples that the Warp team usually finds Command Corrections useful for:

* Misspelled commands
  * `gti checkout myBranchName` -> `git checkout myBranchName`
  * `cd ap/sorce/executtor` -> `cd app/source/executor`
* Missing flags
  * `git push` -> `git push –set-upstream myBranchName`
* Add permissions
  * `./script` -> `chmod +x ./script && ./script`

## How to access it

* Command Corrections is enabled by default. You can disable Command Corrections by going to `Settings > Features` > toggle “Suggest corrected commands”.
* After an incorrect command is run, a panel with the corrected command suggestion appears above the Input Editor. `CLICK` or press the `RIGHT` arrow to insert the suggestion.
