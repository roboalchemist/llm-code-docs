# Migrate to Warp

## From iTerm2

You can easily import your settings from iTerm2 to Warp. This includes custom keybindings and color themes.

To do so, you can open the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/command-palette) and search for Import External Settings. This will enter you into the workflow to import your settings.

Select **iTerm2 Profile: Default** to import your settings.

Warp will only import settings associated with the Default profile.

### Choose your Prompt

Next, you can choose your [prompt](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/prompt) and decide whether or not to inherit your existing prompt configuration. There are two prompt options:

1. [Warp prompt](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/prompt#warp-prompt): This is Warp's native prompt that you can customize to meet your needs. In `Settings > Appearance > Prompt`, you can drag and drop context chips into your Warp prompt to display specific information, like git branches or timestamps.
2. [Shell prompt (PS1)](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/prompt#custom-prompt): This custom prompt inherits your pre-existing prompt configuration. Select this option if you want your Warp prompt to match your settings from iTerm2.

After choosing a prompt, you’re ready to start using Warp.

### Import additional settings

After importing your iTerm2 profile and choosing your prompt, you might have additional settings from iTerm2 that you would like to configure. For example:

* Customizing your dedicated hotkey window, allowing you to customize your windows relative to your active screen size.
* Dividing and organizing tabs into multiple panels or terminal sessions.
* Setting up your keyboard shortcuts and completion suggestions.

You can find more information on these behavior settings in our Quickstart guide.
