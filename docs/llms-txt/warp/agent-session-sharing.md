# Agent Session Sharing

**Agent Session Sharing** extends Warp's regular [Session Sharing](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/session-sharing) to include full visibility and control over Agent activity. Anyone viewing a shared session can now see Agent messages, thinking indicators, credit usage, and, if granted permission, send their own Agent queries from the shared environment.

This makes it simple to demo AI workflows, pair on debugging, or walk someone through an Agent-powered task remotely.

### Built on top of Session Sharing

Agent Session Sharing adds the following capabilities to standard Session Sharing:

* View Agent prompts, responses, and conversation threads
* See live “thinking” states and credit consumption
* Start new Agent conversations from a shared session
* Switch between conversations
* Let collaborators send their own Agent queries when granted edit access

### How it works

#### 1. Start sharing as usual

Open a session and share it through:

* Command Palette
* Pane header overflow menu
* Right-click context menu

Choose your starting point (full scrollback, no scrollback, or a specific block), just like standard Session Sharing.

#### 2. Open the shared session on another device

Viewers can join from:

* The Warp desktop app
* The Web viewer (no installation required)

The web experience mirrors the desktop view and shows complete Agent activity in real time.

#### 3. Watch Agent actions unfold

Viewers see:

* Agent thinking animations
* Tool use
* Planning steps
* [AI Credits](https://docs.warp.dev/support-and-community/plans-and-billing/ai-credits) usage
* Final responses

This happens live as the sharer interacts with the Agent.

#### 4. Grant edit access for collaborative Agent use

If a viewer requests edit access, the sharer can approve it. Once approved, collaborators can:

* Send new Agent queries
* Type directly into the prompt
* Execute commands
* Start and switch Agent conversations
* Run terminal commands alongside Agent queries

Multiple collaborators can participate at the same time. Each viewer’s cursor, avatar, and actions appear in the shared session.

### Multi-viewer collaboration

Agent Session Sharing works seamlessly with multiple participants. Viewers may join from different machines, browsers, or environments, and all will:

* See each other’s avatars
* Watch Agent activity in sync
* Edit together if granted access
* Run terminal or Agent commands concurrently

The experience is consistent for every participant — desktop or web.
