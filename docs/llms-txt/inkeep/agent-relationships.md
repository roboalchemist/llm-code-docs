  Sub Agent relationships are used to coordinate specialized Sub Agents for complex workflows. This framework implements Sub Agent relationships through using `canDelegateTo()` and `canTransferTo()`, allowing a parent Sub Agent to automatically coordinate specialized Sub Agents for complex workflows.

  ## Understanding Sub Agent Relationships

  The framework supports two types of Sub Agent relationships:

  ### Transfer Relationships

  Transfer relationships **completely relinquish control** from one Sub Agent to another. When a Sub Agent hands off to another:

  * The source Sub Agent stops processing
  * The target Sub Agent takes full control of the conversation
  * Control is permanently transferred until the target Sub Agent hands back

  ```typescript
  import { subAgent, agent } from "agent-sdk";

  // Create specialized Sub Agents first
  const qaSubAgent = subAgent({
    id: "qa-agent",
    name: "QA Sub Agent",
    description: "Answers product and service questions",
    prompt: "Provide accurate information using available tools. Hand back to router if unable to help.",
    canUse: () => [knowledgeBaseTool],
    canTransferTo: () => [routerSubAgent],
  });

  const orderSubAgent = subAgent({
    id: "order-agent",
    name: "Order Sub Agent",
    description: "Handles order-related inquiries and actions",
    prompt: "Assist with order tracking, modifications, and management.",
    canUse: () => [orderSystemTool],
    canTransferTo: () => [routerSubAgent],
  });

  // Create router Sub Agent that coordinates other Sub Agents
  const routerSubAgent = subAgent({
    id: "router-agent",
    name: "Router Sub Agent",
    description: "Routes customer inquiries to specialized Sub Agents",
    prompt: `Analyze customer inquiries and route them appropriately:
      - Product questions → Hand off to QA Sub Agent
      - Order issues → Hand off to Order Sub Agent
      - Complex issues → Handle directly or escalate`,
    canTransferTo: () => [qaSubAgent, orderSubAgent],
  });

  // Create the agent with router as default entry point
  const supportAgent = agent({
    id: "customer-support-agent",
    defaultSubAgent: routerSubAgent,
    subAgents: () => [routerSubAgent, qaSubAgent, orderSubAgent],
    models: {
      base: {
        model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
        providerOptions: {
          temperature: 0.5,
        },
      },
      structuredOutput: {
        model: "openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  ### Delegation Relationships

  Delegation relationships are used to **pass a task** from one Sub Agent to another while maintaining oversight:

  * The source Sub Agent remains in control
  * The target Sub Agent executes a specific task
  * Results are returned to the source Sub Agent
  * The source Sub Agent continues processing
  * If a user redirects the task mid-delegation (e.g. by denying a tool call with a reason like "I want Tokyo instead"), the delegation response includes a note about the redirect so the parent Sub Agent has full context about how the task evolved

  ```typescript
  // Sub Agents for specific tasks
  const numberProducerA = subAgent({
    id: "number-producer-a",
    name: "Number Producer A",
    description: "Produces low-range numbers (0-50)",
    prompt: "Generate numbers between 0 and 50. Respond with a single integer.",
  });

  const numberProducerB = subAgent({
    id: "number-producer-b",
    name: "Number Producer B",
    description: "Produces high-range numbers (50-100)",
    prompt: "Generate numbers between 50 and 100. Respond with a single integer.",
  });

  // Coordinating Sub Agent that delegates tasks
  const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
    id: "math-supervisor",
    name: "Math Supervisor",
    description: "Coordinates mathematical operations",
    prompt: `When given a math task:
      1. Delegate to Number Producer A for a low number
      2. Delegate to Number Producer B for a high number
      3. Add the results together and provide the final answer`,
    canDelegateTo: () => [numberProducerA, numberProducerB],
  });

  const mathAgent = agent({
    id: "math-delegation-agent",
    defaultSubAgent: mathSupervisor,
    subAgents: () => [mathSupervisor, numberProducerA, numberProducerB],
    models: {
      base: {
        model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
        providerOptions: {
          temperature: 0.1,
        }
      }
    },
  });
  ```

  ## When to Use Each Relationship

  ### Use Transfers for Complex Tasks

  Use `canTransferTo` when the task is complex and the user will likely want to ask follow-up questions to the specialized Sub Agent:

  * **Customer support conversations** - User may have multiple related questions
  * **Technical troubleshooting** - Requires back-and-forth interaction
  * **Order management** - User might want to modify, track, or ask about multiple aspects
  * **Product consultations** - Users often have follow-up questions

  ### Use Delegation for Simple Tasks

  Use `canDelegateTo` when the task is simple and self-contained:

  * **Data retrieval** - Get a specific piece of information and return it
  * **Calculations** - Perform a computation and return the result
  * **Single API calls** - Make one external request and return the data
  * **Simple transformations** - Convert data from one format to another

  ```typescript
  // TRANSFER: User will likely have follow-up questions about their order
  const routerSubAgent = subAgent({
    id: "router",
    prompt: "For order inquiries, transfer to order specialist",
    canTransferTo: () => [orderSubAgent],
  });

  // DELEGATION: Just need a quick calculation, then continue
  const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
    id: "supervisor",
    prompt: "Delegate to number producers, then add results together",
    canDelegateTo: () => [numberProducerA, numberProducerB],
  });
  ```

  ## Types of Delegation Relationships

  ### Sub Agent Delegation

  Sub agent delegation is used to delegate a task to a sub agent as seen above.

  ### External Agent Delegation

  External agent delegation is used to delegate a task to an [external agent](/typescript-sdk/external-agents).

  ```typescript
  import { myExternalAgent } from "./external-agents/external-agent-example";

  const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
    id: "supervisor",
    prompt: "Delegate to the external agent to calculate the answer to the question",
    canDelegateTo: () => [myExternalAgent],
  });
  ```

  You can also specify headers to include with every request to the external agent.

  ```typescript
  const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
    id: "supervisor",
    prompt: "Delegate to the external agent to calculate the answer to the question",
    canDelegateTo: () => [myExternalAgent.with({ headers: { "authorization": "my-api-key" } })],
  });
  ```

  ### Team Agent Delegation

  Team agent delegation is used to delegate a task to another agent in the same project.

  ```typescript
  import { myAgent } from "./agents/my-team-agent";

  const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
    id: "supervisor",
    prompt: "Delegate to the team agent to calculate the answer to the question",
    canDelegateTo: () => [myAgent],
  });
  ```

  You can also specify headers to include with every request to the team agent.

  ```typescript
  const mathSupervisor = subAgent({
    id: "supervisor",
    prompt: "Delegate to the team agent to calculate the answer to the question",
    canDelegateTo: () => [myAgent.with({ headers: { "authorization": "my-api-key" } })],
  });
  ```
