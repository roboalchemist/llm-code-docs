# Working with the manage database (Doltgres) (/community/contributing/manage-database)

How branch-scoped database connections work in the Inkeep Agent Framework



## Overview

The management database is a [Doltgres](https://docs.doltgres.com/) instance — a PostgreSQL-compatible database with Git-like versioning built in.

## Branch naming convention

Each project gets its own main branch, namespaced as:

```
<tenantId>_<projectId>_main
```

For example, a project with `tenantId: "acme"` and `projectId: "proj_123"` has a main branch named `acme_proj_123_main`.

Connections to doltgres default to the `main` branch, so it is critical that **every connection checks out the correct project branch before performing any operations**. The framework provides two mechanisms for this depending on where your code runs.

## Mechanism 1: middleware (manage routes)

All `/manage` API routes pass through the `branchScopedDbMiddleware`. This middleware:

1. Acquires a dedicated connection from the pool
2. Checks out the correct branch (resolved from the request's `ref` query parameter)
3. Creates a Drizzle ORM client scoped to that connection
4. Injects it into the Hono context as `'db'`
5. Executes the route handler
6. Auto-commits changes on success for write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
7. Cleans up: checks out `main` and releases the connection

### Usage in manage routes

Inside any `/manage` route handler, retrieve the branch-scoped database client from context:

```typescript
async (c) => {
  const db: AgentsManageDatabaseClient = c.get('db');
  const { tenantId, projectId } = c.req.valid('param');

  const tools = await listTools(db)({
    scopes: { tenantId, projectId },
  });

  return c.json({ data: tools });
}
```

## Mechanism 2: `withRef`

When you need to read or write manage data from outside the `/manage` routes — for example from the `/run` domain, `/evals` domain, or other packages — use the `withRef` wrapper from `@inkeep/agents-core`.

`withRef` handles the full lifecycle of a branch-scoped connection:

1. Acquires a dedicated connection from the pool
2. Checks out the specified branch
3. Executes your callback with a scoped Drizzle client
4. Optionally auto-commits on success for write operations
5. Cleans up: checks out `main`, releases the connection

### Read example

```typescript
import { withRef } from '@inkeep/agents-core';
import manageDbPool from '../data/db/manageDbPool';

const agent = await withRef(manageDbPool, resolvedRef, (db) =>
  getFullAgent(db)({
    scopes: { tenantId, projectId, agentId },
  })
);
```

### Write example with auto-commit

```typescript
await withRef(
  manageDbPool,
  resolvedRef,
  async (db) => {
    await updateAgent(db, agentId, data);
  },
  { commit: true, commitMessage: 'Update agent config' }
);
```

### Batching multiple operations

You can batch multiple reads or writes in a single `withRef` call. This uses one connection and one branch checkout for all operations:

```typescript
const result = await withRef(
  manageDbPool,
  resolvedRef,
  async (db) => {
    await createCredential(db, credData);
    await updateTool(db, toolId, { credentialId });
    return { success: true };
  },
  {
    commit: true,
    commitMessage: 'Link credential to tool',
    author: { name: 'oauth-flow', email: 'oauth@inkeep.com' },
  }
);
```

### Obtaining a `resolvedRef`

Most runtime code paths already have a `resolvedRef` available — either through the Hono context (`c.get('resolvedRef')`) or via an execution context (`this.executionContext.resolvedRef`).
If you need to resolve a ref manually, use `getProjectScopedRef` and `resolveRef`:

```typescript
import { getProjectScopedRef, resolveRef } from '@inkeep/agents-core';

const projectScopedRef = getProjectScopedRef(tenantId, projectId, 'main');

// You can directly use a manage db client to resolve the ref
const resolvedRef = await resolveRef(agentsManageDbClient)(projectScopedRef);
```

## Decision guide

| Where is your code?                 | What to use                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/manage` route handler             | `c.get('db')` — the middleware handles checkout and commit |
| `/run` or `/evals` route handler    | `withRef(manageDbPool, resolvedRef, (db) => ...)`          |
| Service class or utility            | `withRef(manageDbPool, resolvedRef, (db) => ...)`          |
| Already inside a `withRef` callback | Use the `db` from the callback argument directly           |
