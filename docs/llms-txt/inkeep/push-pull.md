Push and pull your agents to and from the Visual Builder



## Push code to visual

With Inkeep, you can define your agents in code, push them to the Visual Builder, and continue developing with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. You can switch back to code any time.

Let's walk through the process.

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-j4LuabeHQ" title="Using Inkeep push" />

### Step 1: Install the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 2: Download a template project

Navigate to the `src/projects` directory.

```bash
cd src/projects
```

Add the docs assistant agent using `inkeep add`.

```bash
inkeep add --project docs-assistant
```

Find the downloaded code in `src/projects/docs-assistant`.

<Tip>
  `inkeep add` imports a template project from our [cookbook library](https://github.com/inkeep/agents/tree/main/agents-cookbook/template-projects).
</Tip>

### Step 3: Push code to visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep push` to push the code to the Visual Builder.

```bash
inkeep push
```

<Tip>
  To validate your project without pushing, use the `--json` flag: `inkeep push --json`
</Tip>

### Step 4: Chat with your agent

Refresh [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), switch to the **Docs Assistant** project (in the bottom left).

Under **Agents**, click on the Docs Assistant agent and press **Try it**. Ask a question about Inkeep.

## Run `inkeep pull`

Make some changes, like changing a prompt, and let's walk through `inkeep pull`.

  ### Prerequisite

  The `inkeep pull` command in-part leverages AI to sync your TypeScript files to the state of your Visual Builder, so **at least one** of the below environment variables to be defined:

  ```txt .env
  # Choose one:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  # or
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  # or
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

  The CLI prioritizes Anthropic → OpenAI → Google.

  Here are the models used:

  | Provider  | Model(s)                              | Where to Get API Key                                |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.5 (extended thinking) | [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) |
  | OpenAI    | GPT-5.1                               | [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)     |
  | Google    | Gemini 2.5 Flash                      | [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)          |
</>

### Step 1: Make an edit visually

Make an edit to the docs assistant agent in the UI, such as changing the prompt of the agent.

### Step 2: Pull code from visual

Navigate to your docs assistant project.

```bash
cd src/projects/docs-assistant
```

Use `inkeep pull` to pull the code from the Visual Builder to your local project.

```bash
inkeep pull
```

### Step 3: Verify the code was pulled

Check the `src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts` file for the updated prompt.

```bash
cat src/projects/docs-assistant/agents/docs-assistant.ts
```

## Next steps

Next, we recommend setting up observability to see live traces of your agent. See [Traces](/get-started/traces) to get started.
