  ## Overview

  Conversation memory determines how much of the conversation history is included in the context window when your Agent processes a new message. The Inkeep Agent Framework automatically manages conversation history to balance context retention with token efficiency, with specialized handling for delegated agents and tool results.

  ## What's Included in Memory

  The conversation history now includes:

  * **Chat messages**: User messages and agent responses
  * **Tool results**: Results from tool executions, providing context about what actions were performed
  * **Agent communications**: Messages exchanged between agents during transfers and delegations

  ## Memory Management

  The system uses two approaches for managing conversation history:

  ### Intelligent Compression (Primary Method)

  When agents have a summarizer model configured (standard setup):

  * **Up to 10,000 messages**: Retrieves extensive conversation history to find compression summaries and make intelligent decisions
  * **No token limits**: Model-aware compression manages context based on each model's actual capabilities
  * **Dynamic optimization**: Automatically compresses when approaching model-specific thresholds (50% for conversation-level, 75-91% for sub-agent operations)

  ### Fixed Limits (Fallback Method)

  For agents without a summarizer model:

  * **50 messages**: Up to the 50 most recent messages from the conversation
  * **8,000 tokens**: Maximum of 8,000 tokens from previous conversation messages

  <Note>
    Most agents use intelligent compression, which provides superior context management tailored to each model's capabilities. The fixed limits serve as safety nets when a summarizer model is not available.
  </Note>

  ## Intelligent Compression System

  The framework's intelligent compression system is the primary method for managing conversation memory. It automatically analyzes model capabilities and compresses context when needed to optimize performance.

  ### How Compression Works

  The compression system operates continuously, making intelligent decisions about context management:

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      **Context Monitoring**: System continuously monitors conversation size against model limits
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **Automatic Triggering**: Compression triggers at 50% of context window for conversation-level, or at model-aware thresholds (\~75-91% depending on model size) for sub-agent generation
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **Tool Result Archiving**: Large tool results are stored as artifacts and replaced with summary references
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **AI Summarization**: Older conversation parts are summarized by AI while preserving key context
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **Fallback Protection**: If compression is unavailable, system falls back to fixed message and token limits
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  ### Model-Specific Behavior

  Different models have different context windows, and compression adapts accordingly:

  ### Compression Types

  #### Conversation-Level Compression

  * **Trigger**: When conversation reaches 50% of model's context window
  * **Action**: Compresses entire conversation history into summary + artifacts
  * **Use Case**: Long conversations with extensive history

  **Example**: You have a 20-message conversation about planning a software project. The conversation includes requirements gathering, architecture discussions, and code reviews. When it hits the 50% threshold, the system creates a summary like "User discussed project requirements for e-commerce platform, decided on microservices architecture, reviewed authentication flow\..." and stores detailed tool outputs as artifacts.

  #### Sub-Agent Generation Compression

  * **Trigger**: During sub-agent execution when tool results exceed model-aware limits (75-91% depending on model size)
  * **Action**: Compresses generated tool results while preserving original context
  * **Use Case**: Sub-agents performing many tool operations during generation

  **Example**: A sub-agent is tasked with "analyze this codebase for security issues." During execution, it uses tools to:

  1. Read 15 different files (large outputs)
  2. Run security scans (detailed reports)
  3. Check dependencies (long lists)
  4. Analyze configurations (verbose JSON)

  When these tool results fill up the context window, the system compresses them into: "Analyzed 15 files, found 3 SQL injection risks in auth.py, 2 XSS vulnerabilities in templates..." while keeping the original conversation and task intact.

  <Note>
    Compression happens automatically and transparently. Your agents will continue to work normally even with compressed conversations, as the system preserves all essential context and provides artifact references for detailed information.
  </Note>

  ## How It Works

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      **Message Retrieval**: The system retrieves conversation history (up to 10,000 messages with intelligent compression, or 50 messages with fixed limits)
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **Delegation Filtering**: Messages are filtered based on delegation context - delegated agents see their own tool results plus top-level conversation context
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **Context Management**: With intelligent compression, the system analyzes model capabilities and compresses when needed. With fixed limits, messages are truncated at token thresholds.
    </Step>

    <Step>
      **Optimization**: Intelligent compression creates summaries and artifacts to preserve essential context while staying within model limits
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  ## Memory for Delegated Agents

  When agents delegate tasks to other agents, memory is intelligently filtered:

  ### Main Agents

  * See complete conversation history including all tool results
  * Maintain full context of delegated actions and their results

  ### Delegated Agents

  * See conversation history filtered to their delegation scope
  * Receive tool results from:
    * Their own tool executions
    * Top-level (non-delegated) tool executions
  * Cannot see tool results from unrelated delegations

  This ensures delegated agents have sufficient context while preventing memory pollution from unrelated parallel delegations.

  ## Tool Results in Memory

  Tool execution results are automatically included in conversation history, helping agents:

  * Understand what actions have already been performed
  * Avoid duplicate tool calls
  * Build on previous results when transferring between agents

  The tool results include both the input parameters and output results, formatted as:

  ```
  ## Tool: search_knowledge_base

  **Input:**
  {
    "query": "API authentication methods"
  }

  **Output:**
  {
    "results": [...]
  }
  ```
