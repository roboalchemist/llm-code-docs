# User-Level vs Project-Level MCP Servers (/visual-builder/tools/user-vs-project-mcp)

Understand the difference between user-level and project-level MCP servers and how they affect your team workflow



## Overview

When [creating a new MCP server](/visual-builder/tools/mcp-servers) in the Inkeep Visual Builder, you can choose to configure it at the user-level or project-level.

Understanding the difference between these two types is important for managing your team's access to agents and their associated tools.

## User-Level MCP Servers

User-level MCP servers are configured per individual user. When you create a user-level MCP server, each team member must authenticate with their own credentials to use the associated tools.

### Benefits

* **Personal accounts**: Team members can use their own accounts (e.g., their personal Notion workspace, Google Drive, etc.)
* **Better security**: Credentials are not shared across the team
* **Flexible access**: Each team member can connect to different resources based on their own permissions

### Considerations

* **Individual authentication required**: Each team member must authenticate their own credentials before using an agent that relies on user-level MCPs
* **Setup overhead**: New team members need to complete authentication before they can use shared agents
* **Not compatible with triggers**: User-level MCPs cannot be used with [webhook triggers](/talk-to-your-agents/triggers/webhooks) or scheduled jobs because these invocation methods don't have user context

## Project-Level MCP Servers

Project-level MCP servers use shared credentials that are configured at the project level. All team members in the project can use these servers without individual authentication.

### Benefits

* **Shared access**: All team members can immediately use agents without additional setup
* **Simplified onboarding**: New team members can start using agents right away
* **Centralized management**: Credentials are managed in one place

### Considerations

* **Shared credentials**: All team members use the same account, which may have security implications
* **Limited flexibility**: Team members cannot use their own accounts or personal resources

### When Sharing an Agent

When sharing an agent with your team, they'll need to authenticate their own credentials for any user-level MCPs before being able to use the agent. Make sure to communicate this requirement to your team members.
