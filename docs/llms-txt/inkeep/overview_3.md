Learn how to talk to your agents



<>
  You can talk to an Inkeep Agent in a few ways, including:

  * **UI Chat Components**: Drop-in React components for chat UIs with built-in streaming and rich UI customization. See [`agents-ui`](/talk-to-your-agents/react/chat-button).
  * **As an MCP server**: Use your Inkeep Agent as if was an MCP Server. Allows you to connect it to any MCP client, like Claude, ChatGPT, Claude and other Agents. See [MCP server](/talk-to-your-agents/mcp-server).
  * **Via API (Vercel format)**: An API that streams responses over server-side events (SSE). Use from any language/runtime, including the Vercel's `useChat` and AI Element primitives for custom UIs. See [API (Vercel format)](/talk-to-your-agents/api).
  * **Via API (A2A format)**: An API that follows the Agent-to-Agent ('A2A') JSON-RPC protocol. Great for when combining Inkeep with different Agent frameworks that support the A2A format. See [A2A protocol](/talk-to-your-agents/a2a).
  * **Via Webhook Triggers**: Create webhook endpoints that allow external services (GitHub, Slack, Stripe, etc.) to invoke your Agents. See [Triggers](/talk-to-your-agents/triggers).
  * **Slack**: Interact with agents directly in Slack using `@Inkeep` and slash commands. Available for Enterprise. See [Slack](/talk-to-your-agents/slack/overview).
