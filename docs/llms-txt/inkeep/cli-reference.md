Complete reference for the Inkeep CLI commands



## Overview

The Inkeep CLI is the primary tool for interacting with the Inkeep Agent Framework. It allows you to push Agent configurations and interact with your multi-agent system.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the CLI globally
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli

# Install the dashboard package (for visual agents orchestration)
npm install @inkeep/agents-manage-ui
```

## Global Options

All commands support the following global options:

* `--version` - Display CLI version
* `--help` - Display help for a command

  ## Commands

  ### `inkeep init`

  Initialize a new Inkeep configuration file in your project.

  ```bash
  inkeep init [path]
  ```

  **Options:**

  * `--local` - Initialize for local development (creates a local profile with no authentication required)
  * `--no-interactive` - Skip interactive path selection
  * `--config <path>` - Path to use as template for new configuration

  **Cloud vs Local Initialization:**

  By default, `inkeep init` runs the remote instance onboarding wizard which:

  * Opens browser-based authentication
  * Fetches your organizations and projects from remote instance
  * Creates project directories with configuration files
  * Sets up the `cloud` profile as the default in `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml`

  Use `--local` for local development:

  * Prompts for tenant ID and API URL (defaults to `localhost:3002`); Manage UI defaults to `localhost:3000`
  * Creates `inkeep.config.ts` with your local configuration
  * Sets up a `local` profile as the default in `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml`
  * No authentication required

  For self-hosted deployments that require authentication, use `inkeep profile add` and select **Custom**.

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Cloud initialization (default) - opens browser for auth
  inkeep init

  # Local initialization - no auth required
  inkeep init --local

  # Initialize in specific directory
  inkeep init ./my-project

  # Local init in specific directory
  inkeep init --local ./my-project

  # Non-interactive mode
  inkeep init --no-interactive

  # Use specific config as template
  inkeep init --config ./template-config.ts
  ```

<SkillRule id="cli-push-command" skills="typescript-sdk" title="CLI inkeep push Command" description="Push agent configurations to your server">
  ### `inkeep push`

  **Primary use case:** Push a project containing Agent configurations to your server. This command deploys your entire multi-agent project, including all Agents, Sub Agents, and tools.

  ```bash
  inkeep push
  ```

  **Options:**

  * `--project <project-id>` - Project ID or path to project directory
  * `--all` - Push all projects found in the current directory tree
  * `--env <environment>` - Load environment-specific credentials from `environments/<environment>.env.ts`
  * `--config <path>` - Override config file path (bypasses automatic config discovery)
  * `--tenant-id <id>` - Override tenant ID
  * `--agents-api-url <url>` - Override the agents API URL from config
  * `--json` - Generate project data as JSON file instead of pushing to server
  * `--profile <name>` - Use a specific CLI profile (overrides the active profile)
  * `--quiet` - Suppress interactive prompts and extra logs

  #### Single Project Push

  The most common workflow is to run `inkeep push` from inside a project directory. A project directory is identified by having an `index.ts` file that exports a project object (with `__type = "project"`).

  ```bash
  # Navigate to your project directory
  cd my-project

  # Push the current project
  inkeep push
  ```

  The CLI will:

  1. Detect `index.ts` in the current directory
  2. Load the project export from `index.ts`
  3. Search upward for `inkeep.config.ts` to get tenant/API configuration
  4. Push the project to the server

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Push project from current directory (most common)
  cd my-project && inkeep push

  # Push specific project directory
  inkeep push --project ./my-project

  # Push all projects in current directory tree
  inkeep push --all

  # Push with development environment credentials
  inkeep push --env development

  # Generate project JSON without pushing
  inkeep push --json

  # Override tenant ID
  inkeep push --tenant-id my-tenant

  # Override API URL
  inkeep push --agents-api-url https://api.example.com

  # Use specific config file
  inkeep push --config ./custom-config/inkeep.config.ts

  # Use a named profile (overrides the active profile)
  inkeep push --profile staging

  # Quiet non-essential output for CI
  inkeep push --quiet
  ```

  #### Batch Push with `--all`

  The `--all` flag discovers and pushes all projects in the current directory tree. A directory is considered a project if its `index.ts` file exports an object with `__type = "project"`.

  ```bash
  # From a workspace root containing multiple projects
  inkeep push --all
  ```

  **Project Discovery:**

  1. Searches recursively for directories containing `index.ts` files
  2. Validates each `index.ts` exports a project (checks for `__type = "project"`)
  3. Ensures each project can access an `inkeep.config.ts` (in the same directory or a parent directory)

  **Shared Configuration:**

  You can use a single `inkeep.config.ts` at the workspace root for multiple projects:

  ```
  workspace-root/
  ├── inkeep.config.ts          # Shared config for all projects
  └── projects/
      ├── project-a/
      │   └── index.ts          # Project A
      ├── project-b/
      │   └── index.ts          # Project B
      └── project-c/
          └── index.ts          # Project C
  ```

  Running `inkeep push --all` from `workspace-root/` or `workspace-root/projects/` will discover and push all three projects using the shared configuration.

  **Output:**

  ```
  🚀 Batch Push: Finding all projects...

  Found 3 project(s) to push:

    • project-a
    • project-b
    • project-c

  [1/3] Pushing project-a...
    ✓ Project A
  [2/3] Pushing project-b...
    ✓ Project B
  [3/3] Pushing project-c...
    ✓ Project C

  📊 Batch Push Summary:
    ✓ Succeeded: 3
  ```

  **Environment Credentials:**

  The `--env` flag loads environment-specific credentials when pushing your project. This will look for files like `environments/development.env.ts` or `environments/production.env.ts` in your project directory and load the credential configurations defined there.

  **Example environment file:**

  ```typescript
  // environments/development.env.ts
  import { CredentialStoreType } from "@inkeep/agents-core";
  import { registerEnvironmentSettings } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

  export const development = registerEnvironmentSettings({
    credentials: {
      "api-key-dev": {
        id: "api-key-dev",
        type: CredentialStoreType.memory,
        credentialStoreId: "memory-default",
        retrievalParams: {
          key: "API_KEY_DEV",
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  #### Project Discovery and Structure

  The `inkeep push` command follows this discovery process:

  1. **Config File Discovery**: Searches for `inkeep.config.ts` using this pattern:

     * Starts from current working directory
     * Traverses **upward** through parent directories until found
     * Can be overridden by providing a path to the config file with the `--config` flag

  2. **Workspace Structure**: Expects this directory layout:

     ```
     workspace-root/
     ├── package.json              # Workspace package.json
     ├── tsconfig.json             # Workspace TypeScript config
     ├── inkeep.config.ts          # Inkeep configuration file
     ├── my-project/               # Individual project directory
     │   ├── index.ts              # Project entry point
     │   ├── agents/               # Agent definitions
     │   │   └── *.ts
     │   ├── tools/                # Tool definitions
     │   │   └── *.ts
     │   ├── data-components/      # Data component definitions
     │   │   └── *.ts
     │   └── environments/         # Environment-specific configs
     │       ├── development.env.ts
     │       └── production.env.ts
     └── another-project/          # Additional projects
         └── index.ts
     ```

  3. **Resource Compilation**: Automatically discovers and compiles:
     * All project directories containing `index.ts`
     * All TypeScript files within each project directory
     * Categorizes files by type (agents, Sub Agents, tools, data components)
     * Resolves dependencies and relationships within each project

  #### Push Behavior

  When pushing, the CLI:

  * Finds and loads configuration from `inkeep.config.ts` at workspace root
  * Discovers all project directories containing `index.ts`
  * Applies environment-specific settings if `--env` is specified
  * Compiles all project resources defined in each project's `index.ts`
  * Validates Sub Agent relationships and tool configurations across all projects
  * Deploys all projects to the management API
  * Prints deployment summary with resource counts per project

<SkillRule id="cli-pull-command" skills="typescript-sdk" title="CLI inkeep pull Command" description="Pull project configuration from server and update local TypeScript files">
  ### `inkeep pull`

  Pull project configuration from the server and update all TypeScript files in your local project using LLM generation.

  ```bash
  inkeep pull
  ```

  **Options:**

  * `--project <project-id>` - Project ID to pull (or path to project directory). If in project directory, validates against local project ID.
  * `--all` - Pull all projects from the server to the current directory
  * `--config <path>` - Path to configuration file
  * `--env <environment>` - Environment file to generate (development, staging, production). Defaults to development
  * `--json` - Output project data as JSON instead of generating files
  * `--debug` - Enable debug logging
  * `--verbose` - Enable verbose logging
  * `--force` - Force regeneration even if no changes detected
  * `--introspect` - Completely regenerate all files from scratch (no comparison needed)
  * `--profile <name>` - Use a specific CLI profile (overrides the active profile)
  * `--quiet` - Suppress interactive prompts and extra logs

  #### Single Project Pull

  The most common workflow is to run `inkeep pull` from inside a project directory. A project directory is identified by having an `index.ts` file that exports a project object (with `__type = "project"`).

  ```bash
  # Navigate to your project directory
  cd my-project

  # Pull updates from the server
  inkeep pull
  ```

  The CLI will:

  1. Detect `index.ts` in the current directory
  2. Load the project export to get the project ID
  3. Fetch the latest configuration from the server
  4. Update your local TypeScript files with any changes

  **Smart Project Detection:**

  The pull command intelligently handles different scenarios:

  1. **Project Directory Detection**: If your current directory contains an `index.ts` file that exports a project, the command automatically uses that project's ID
  2. **Project ID Validation**: If you specify `--project` while in a project directory, it validates that the ID matches your local project
  3. **Subdirectory Creation**: When not in a project directory, creates a new subdirectory named after the project ID

  **`--project` Flag Behavior:**

  The `--project` flag has dual functionality:

  * **Directory Path**: If the value points to a directory containing `index.ts`, it uses that directory
  * **Project ID**: If the value doesn't match a valid directory path, it treats it as a project ID

  **Pull Modes:**

  | Scenario                 | Command                                | Behavior                                                         |
  | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | In project directory     | `inkeep pull`                          | ✅ Automatically detects project, pulls to current directory      |
  | In project directory     | `inkeep pull --project <matching-id>`  | ✅ Validates ID matches local project, pulls to current directory |
  | In project directory     | `inkeep pull --project <different-id>` | ❌ Error: Project ID doesn't match local project                  |
  | Not in project directory | `inkeep pull`                          | ❌ Error: Requires --project flag                                 |
  | Not in project directory | `inkeep pull --project <id>`           | ✅ Creates `<id>/` subdirectory with project files                |

  **How it Works:**

  The pull command discovers and updates all TypeScript files in your project based on the latest configuration from the server:

  1. **File Discovery**: Recursively finds all `.ts` files in your project (excluding `environments/` and `node_modules/`)
  2. **Smart Categorization**: Categorizes files as index, agents, Sub Agents, tools, or other files
  3. **Context-Aware Updates**: Updates each file with relevant context from the server:
     * **Agent files**: Updated with specific agent data
     * **Sub Agent files**: Updated with specific Sub Agent configurations
     * **Tool files**: Updated with specific tool definitions
     * **Other files**: Updated with full project context
  4. **LLM Generation**: Uses AI to maintain code structure while updating with latest data

  #### TypeScript Updates (Default)

  By default, the pull command updates your existing TypeScript files using LLM generation:

  1. **Context Preservation**: Maintains your existing code structure and patterns
  2. **Selective Updates**: Only updates relevant parts based on server configuration changes
  3. **File-Specific Context**: Each file type receives appropriate context (Agents get Agent data, Sub Agents get Sub Agent data, etc.)

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Directory-aware pull: Automatically detects project from current directory
  cd my-project  # Directory contains index.ts with project export
  inkeep pull    # Pulls to current directory, no subdirectory created

  # Validate project ID while in project directory
  cd my-project  # Directory contains index.ts
  inkeep pull --project my-project  # Validates ID matches, pulls to current directory

  # Error case: Wrong project ID in project directory
  cd my-project  # Directory contains index.ts with different project ID
  inkeep pull --project different-project  # ERROR: Project ID mismatch

  # Pull when NOT in a project directory (requires --project)
  cd ~/projects
  inkeep pull  # ERROR: Requires --project flag

  # Pull specific project to new subdirectory
  cd ~/projects
  inkeep pull --project my-project  # Creates ./my-project/ subdirectory

  # Save project data as JSON file instead of updating files
  inkeep pull --json

  # Enable debug logging
  inkeep pull --debug

  # Enable verbose logging
  inkeep pull --verbose

  # Force regeneration even if no changes detected
  inkeep pull --force

  # Completely regenerate all files from scratch
  inkeep pull --introspect

  # Generate environment-specific credentials
  inkeep pull --env production

  # Use specific config file
  inkeep pull --config ./custom-config/inkeep.config.ts

  # Pull all projects from server
  inkeep pull --all

  # Pull using a specific profile (overrides active)
  inkeep pull --profile staging

  # Quiet non-essential output for CI
  inkeep pull --quiet
  ```

  #### Batch Pull with `--all`

  The `--all` flag fetches all projects from your tenant and pulls them to the current directory. Each project is created as a subdirectory.

  ```bash
  # From a workspace directory
  inkeep pull --all
  ```

  **How it Works:**

  1. Fetches all projects from the API for your tenant
  2. Categorizes each project as "existing" or "new":
     * **Existing**: Directory with `index.ts` already exists → uses smart comparison mode
     * **New**: No local directory → uses introspect mode for fresh generation
  3. Processes each project sequentially

  **Output:**

  ```
  🔄 Batch Pull: Sequential processing with smart comparison

    • Existing projects: Smart comparison + LLM merging + confirmation prompts
    • New projects: Fresh generation with introspect mode

  Projects to pull:

    Existing (smart comparison):
      • My Agent (my-agent)
    New (introspect):
      • New Project (new-project)

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [1/2] Pulling My Agent...
    ✓ My Agent → ./my-agent

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [2/2] Pulling New Project...
    ✓ New Project → ./new-project

  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  📊 Batch Pull Summary:
    ✓ Succeeded: 2
  ```

  #### Model Configuration

  The `inkeep pull` command automatically selects the best available model for LLM generation based on your API keys:

  1. **Anthropic Claude** (if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set): `claude-sonnet-4-5`
  2. **OpenAI GPT** (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set): `gpt-5.1`
  3. **Google Gemini** (if `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` is set): `gemini-2.5-flash`

  The models are used for intelligent content merging when updating modified components, ensuring your local customizations are preserved while incorporating upstream changes.

  #### Validation Process

  The `inkeep pull` command includes a two-stage validation process to ensure generated TypeScript files accurately represent your backend configuration:

  **1. Basic File Verification**

  * Checks that all expected files exist (index.ts, agent files, tool files, component files)
  * Verifies file naming conventions match (kebab-case)
  * Ensures project export is present in index.ts

  **2. Round-Trip Validation** *(New in v0.24.0)*

  * Loads the generated TypeScript using the same logic as `inkeep push`
  * Serializes it back to JSON format
  * Compares the serialized JSON with the original backend data
  * Reports any differences found

  This round-trip validation ensures:

  * ✅ Generated TypeScript can be successfully loaded and imported
  * ✅ The serialization logic (TS → JSON) works correctly
  * ✅ Generated files will work with `inkeep push` without errors
  * ✅ No data loss or corruption during the pull process

  **Validation Output:**

  ```bash
  ✓ Basic file verification passed
  ✓ Round-trip validation passed - generated TS matches backend data
  ```

  **If validation fails:**

  The CLI will display specific differences between the generated and expected data:

  ```bash
  ✗ Round-trip validation failed

  ❌ Round-trip validation errors:
     The generated TypeScript does not serialize back to match the original backend data.
    • Value mismatch at agents.my-agent.name: "Original Name" vs "Generated Name"
    • Missing tool in generated: tool-id

  ⚠️  This indicates an issue with LLM generation or schema mappings.
  The generated files may not work correctly with `inkeep push`.
  ```

  **TypeScript generation fails:**

  * Ensure your network connectivity and API endpoints are correct
  * Check that your model provider credentials (if required by backend) are set up
  * Try using `--json` flag as a fallback to get the raw project data

  **Validation errors during pull:**

  * The generated TypeScript may have syntax errors or missing dependencies
  * Check the generated file manually for obvious issues
  * Try pulling as JSON first to verify the source data: `inkeep pull --json`
  * If round-trip validation fails, report the issue with the error details

<SkillRule id="cli-profile-command" skills="typescript-sdk" title="CLI inkeep profile Command" description="Manage named CLI profiles for multiple remotes, credentials, and environments">
  ### `inkeep profile`

  Manage named CLI profiles for multiple remotes, credentials, and environments. Profiles are stored in `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml`. A default `cloud` profile points to hosted endpoints.

  ```yaml
  # ~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml
  activeProfile: cloud
  profiles:
    cloud:
      remote: cloud
      credential: inkeep-cloud
      environment: production
    local:
      remote:
        api: http://localhost:3002
        manageUi: http://localhost:3000
      credential: none
      environment: development
  ```

  **Subcommands:**

  * `inkeep profile list` — Show all profiles and the active one.
  * `inkeep profile add <name>` — Interactive profile creation. Choose between Inkeep Cloud, Local (localhost defaults, no auth required), or Custom (self-hosted/staging URLs).
  * `inkeep profile use <name>` — Switch the active profile.
  * `inkeep profile current` — Show the active profile details and credential key.
  * `inkeep profile remove <name>` — Delete a profile (cannot remove the active one).

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Create a local profile and switch to it
  inkeep profile add local
  inkeep profile use local

  # Inspect which profile is active
  inkeep profile current

  # List all profiles
  inkeep profile list

  # Remove an unused profile
  inkeep profile remove staging
  ```

  **How profiles are used:**

  * `inkeep login --profile <name>` stores credentials under the profile’s credential key.
  * Commands that talk to the APIs (`push`, `pull`, `status`, `login`, `logout`) honor `--profile <name>`; if omitted, the active profile is used.
  * Each profile bundles remote URLs, an environment name, and a credential reference so you can move between remote instances without editing config files.

  #### Using profiles with authenticated deployments

  If your deployment requires authentication (remote instance or self-hosted), run `inkeep login` for each profile so its credential slot in `profiles.yaml` has a token in the system keychain:

  ```bash
  # Authenticate against your secured deployment
  inkeep login --profile local

  # Validate which profile is active before running commands
  inkeep profile current

  # Use the profile when pushing/pulling
  inkeep push --profile local
  inkeep pull --profile local
  ```

  * The `credential` field in the profile is the key used to store the token; `login` writes to that key and `push/pull/status` read from it.
  * Repeat `login --profile <name>` for every profile/remote you operate against.
  * Use `inkeep logout --profile <name>` to clear a profile’s stored credentials if you need to rotate access.

  ### `inkeep add`

  Pull a template project or MCP from the [Inkeep Agents Cookbook](https://github.com/inkeep/agents/tree/main/agents-cookbook).

  ```bash
  inkeep add [options]
  ```

  **Options:**

  * `--project <name>` - Add a project template
  * `--mcp <name>` - Add a custom MCP server template for common use cases (adds server code to your project)
  * `--ui [component-id]` - Add a data or artifact UI component to your app (writes to `apps/agents-ui/src/ui` by default). Use the component id from the dashboard. Omit the id to see available components.
  * `--ui --list` - List available data and artifact components that have render code (same ids as in the dashboard “Use in your app” flow).
  * `--target-path <path>` - Target path to add the template to
  * `--config <path>` - Path to configuration file
  * `--profile <name>` - Profile to use for auth (with `--ui`)
  * `--quiet` - Suppress non-essential output (with `--ui`)

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  # List available templates (both project and MCP)
  inkeep add

  # Add a project template
  inkeep add --project activities-planner

  # Add project template to specific path
  inkeep add --project activities-planner --target-path ./examples

  # Add a custom MCP server template (auto-detects apps/mcp/app directory)
  inkeep add --mcp zendesk

  # Add MCP server template to specific path
  inkeep add --mcp zendesk --target-path ./apps/mcp/app

  # Using specific config file
  inkeep add --project activities-planner --config ./my-config.ts

  # List addable UI components (data/artifact components with render code)
  inkeep add --ui --list

  # Add a single UI component by id (id from dashboard)
  inkeep add --ui weather-forecast
  ```

  **Behavior:**

  * When adding an MCP server template without `--target-path`, the CLI automatically searches for an `apps/mcp/app` directory in your project
  * If no app directory is found, you'll be prompted to confirm whether to add to the current directory
  * Project templates are added to the current directory or specified `--target-path`
  * Model configurations are automatically injected based on available API keys in your environment (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`)
  * For `--ui`: requires authentication (same as push/pull). The component file is written with an export ensured on the main component. Register the component in your chat widget with the dashboard component **name** as the key and your imported component as the value (e.g. `components: { "Weather Forecast": WeatherForecast }`).

<SkillRule id="cli-update-command" skills="typescript-sdk" title="CLI inkeep update Command" description="Update the Inkeep CLI to the latest version">
  ### `inkeep update`

  Update the Inkeep CLI to the latest version from npm.

  ```bash
  inkeep update
  ```

  **Options:**

  * `--check` - Check for updates without installing
  * `--force` - Force update even if already on latest version

  **How it Works:**

  The update command automatically:

  1. **Detects Package Manager**: Identifies which package manager (npm, pnpm, bun, or yarn) was used to install the CLI globally
  2. **Checks Version**: Compares your current version with the latest available on npm
  3. **Updates CLI**: Executes the appropriate update command for your package manager
  4. **Displays Changelog**: Shows a link to the changelog for release notes

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  # Check if an update is available (no installation)
  inkeep update --check

  # Update to latest version (with confirmation prompt)
  inkeep update

  # Force reinstall current version
  inkeep update --force

  # Skip confirmation prompt (useful for CI/CD)
  inkeep update --force
  ```

  **Output Example:**

  ```
  📦 Version Information:
    • Current version: 0.22.3
    • Latest version:  0.23.0

  📖 Changelog:
    • https://github.com/inkeep/agents/blob/main/agents-cli/CHANGELOG.md

  🔍 Detected package manager: pnpm

  ✅ Updated to version 0.23.0
  ```

  **Troubleshooting:**

  If you encounter permission errors, try running with elevated permissions:

  ```bash
  # For npm, pnpm, yarn
  sudo inkeep update

  # For bun
  sudo -E bun add -g @inkeep/agents-cli@latest
  ```

  **Package Manager Detection:**

  The CLI automatically detects which package manager you used by checking global package installations:

  * npm: Checks `npm list -g @inkeep/agents-cli`
  * pnpm: Checks `pnpm list -g @inkeep/agents-cli`
  * bun: Checks `bun pm ls -g`
  * yarn: Checks `yarn global list`

  If automatic detection fails, the CLI will prompt you to select your package manager.

<SkillRule id="cli-config-file-structure" skills="typescript-sdk" title="CLI Configuration File Structure" description="Structure of inkeep.config.ts and configuration priority">
  ## Configuration File

  The CLI uses a configuration file (typically `inkeep.config.ts`) to store settings:

  ```typescript
  import { defineConfig } from "@inkeep/agents-cli/config";

  export default defineConfig({
    tenantId: "your-tenant-id",
    agentsApi: {
      url: "http://localhost:3002",
    },
  });
  ```

  ### Configuration Priority

  The CLI resolves configuration values in the following order. Higher-priority sources override lower ones:

  **Local development (with a profile):**

  | Priority    | Source             | Example                                                                                |
  | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1 (highest) | CLI flags          | `--tenant-id`, `--agents-api-url`                                                      |
  | 2           | Active profile     | API URLs, API key, and tenant ID from `~/.inkeep/profiles.yaml` + keychain credentials |
  | 3           | `inkeep.config.ts` | `tenantId`, `agentsApi.url`                                                            |
  | 4 (lowest)  | Built-in defaults  | Default API URLs                                                                       |

  When a profile is active, it overrides `inkeep.config.ts` for these fields:

  * `agentsApiUrl` — from `profile.remote.api`
  * `manageUiUrl` — from `profile.remote.manageUi`
  * `agentsApiKey` — from the profile's keychain credential
  * `tenantId` — from the profile's authenticated organization ID

  Other `inkeep.config.ts` values (like `outputDirectory`) are still respected.

  **CI/CD (no profile):**

  In CI environments, profiles are skipped entirely. The precedence becomes:

  | Priority    | Source                | Example                                                       |
  | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1 (highest) | CLI flags             | `--tenant-id`, `--agents-api-url`                             |
  | 2           | Environment variables | `INKEEP_API_KEY`, `INKEEP_TENANT_ID`, `INKEEP_AGENTS_API_URL` |
  | 3           | `inkeep.config.ts`    | `tenantId`, `agentsApi.url`                                   |
  | 4 (lowest)  | Built-in defaults     | Default API URLs                                              |

  <Tip>
    Use `--profile <name>` on any command to override the active profile for a single invocation. This is useful for pushing to staging while your default profile points to production.

<SkillRule id="cli-environment-variables" skills="typescript-sdk" title="CLI Environment Variables" description="Environment variables respected by the CLI and SDK">
  ## Environment Variables

  The CLI and SDK respect the following environment variables:

  * `INKEEP_TENANT_ID` - Tenant identifier
  * `INKEEP_AGENTS_API_URL` - Agents API base URL
  * `INKEEP_ENV` - Environment name for credentials loading during `inkeep push`
  * `INKEEP_AGENTS_MANAGE_API_BYPASS_SECRET` - Optional bearer for Manage API (advanced)
  * `INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_BYPASS_SECRET` - Optional bearer for Run API (advanced)
</SkillRule>

## Troubleshooting

**Project Not Found:**

* Projects are automatically managed based on your tenantId
* `inkeep push` will create resources as needed
