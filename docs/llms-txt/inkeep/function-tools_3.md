# Function Tools in Visual Builder (/visual-builder/tools/function-tools)

Create custom JavaScript functions that your agents can execute directly in the Visual Builder



Function tools allow you to create custom JavaScript functions that agents can execute in secure sandboxes. Unlike [MCP servers](/visual-builder/tools/mcp-servers) that connect to external services, function tools run your own code directly within the agent framework.

## Overview

Function tools are ideal for:

* **Custom business logic** - Implement domain-specific calculations or workflows
* **Data processing** - Transform, validate, or analyze data using JavaScript
* **API integrations** - Connect to services that don't have MCP servers
* **Utility functions** - Create reusable helper functions across your agents
* **Pipeline processing** - Chain tool outputs directly into subsequent tools without storing intermediate results

## Creating Function Tools

Function tools are created within an Agent and can be used by multiple Sub Agents in that Agent.

<Tip>
  If a function tool performs sensitive actions, require explicit user approval before it runs. See
  [Tool approvals](/typescript-sdk/tools/tool-approvals).
</Tip>

### In an Agent

1. **Add a Function Tool Node**: In the Agent editor, drag a "Function Tool" node from the node palette onto the canvas

2. **Configure the Function Tool**: Click on the function tool node to open the configuration panel in the right sidebar:

| Field          | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`         | A unique name for your function tool (e.g., "calculate\_tax") |
| `Description`  | What the function does and when to use it                     |
| `Code`         | The JavaScript function code to execute                       |
| `Input Schema` | JSON Schema defining the function parameters                  |
| `Dependencies` | NPM packages required by your function                        |

3. **Connect to Agents**: Drag from the function tool node to any agent nodes that should have access to this tool

### Function Code

Write your JavaScript function in the Code editor. The function receives arguments based on your Input Schema and should return a result:

```javascript
// Example: BMI calculator
function calculateBMI({ weight, height }) {
  const bmi = weight / (height * height);
  let category = "Normal";
  if (bmi < 18.5) category = "Underweight";
  else if (bmi >= 30) category = "Obese";

  return { bmi: Math.round(bmi * 10) / 10, category };
}
```

<Note>
  Code can be synchronous aor asynchronous, we accept any flavor.
</Note>

### Input Schema

Define the parameters your function accepts using JSON Schema. This ensures proper validation and helps agents understand how to use your function:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "weight": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Weight in kilograms"
    },
    "height": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Height in meters"
    }
  },
  "required": ["weight", "height"]
}
```

The Input Schema field offers two editing modes, controlled by the **JSON** toggle:

* **Visual builder** (toggle off) — Form-based editor for easier schema creation without writing JSON
* **JSON mode** (toggle on) — Raw JSON editing with syntax highlighting for advanced users

### Dependencies

If you need external packages for your code to run, then specify the desired version in dependencies; otherwise we always use the latest version.

```javascript
// Dependencies auto-detected from imports
const axios = require("axios"); // latest axios version
const lodash = require("lodash"); // Uses latest lodash version
```

**Manual Override**: Specify dependencies in the Dependencies field to pin to specific versions:

```json
{
  "axios": "1.6.0",
  "lodash": "4.17.21"
}
```

## Example: Weather API Integration

Here's a complete example of a function tool that fetches weather data:

**Name**: `get_current_weather`

**Description**: `Get current weather information for any city using OpenWeatherMap API`

**Code**:

```javascript
// Simple weather lookup example
async function getWeather({ city }) {
  const axios = require("axios");
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.weather.com/city/${city}`);

  return {
    city: response.data.city,
    temperature: response.data.temp,
    description: response.data.weather,
  };
}
```

**Input Schema**:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "city": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "City name"
    }
  },
  "required": ["city"]
}
```

**Dependencies**:

```json
{
  "axios": "^1.6.0"
}
```

## Execution Environment

Function tools run in secure, isolated sandboxes that provide a safe execution environment for your code.

### Sandbox Execution

Functions execute with the following characteristics:

* **Isolated execution** - Each function runs in its own sandbox
* **No file system access** - Cannot read or write outside the sandbox
* **Network access** - Only through explicitly declared dependencies (like axios)
* **Resource limits** - CPU, memory, and execution time constraints enforced
* **Stateless execution** - No data persists between function calls

### Runtime Options

When deploying, you can configure:

* **Runtime**: Node.js 22 or TypeScript
* **Timeout**: Maximum execution time per function call
* **Concurrency**: Number of simultaneous function executions

See [Deploy to Vercel](/deployment/vercel#step-2-configure-sandbox-in-your-application) for deployment-specific configuration.

## Tool Output Pipelines

Agents can pass the output of one tool directly as the input to another — no artifact creation required. This is useful when intermediate results are purely processing steps that don't need to be saved or shown to the user.

For example, a function tool that fetches a webpage can pass its output directly into a second function tool that extracts the relevant content. The intermediate data never surfaces to the user. When designing tools meant to be used in sequence, ensure their return types match the input types of downstream tools.

MCP server tools work the same way — their outputs can be piped into function tools or other MCP tools in a pipeline.

### Best Practices

* **Keep functions simple** - Each function should have a single, clear purpose
* **Minimize dependencies** - Only include packages you actually need for better performance
* **Handle errors** - Always catch and return meaningful error messages
* **Test thoroughly** - Test your functions independently before deploying
* **Clear descriptions** - Write descriptive names and descriptions to help agents use tools effectively
* **Design for composability** - When tools form a pipeline, align return types with downstream input types

Function tools provide powerful customization capabilities while maintaining security and performance through sandboxed execution.
