# Webhook Triggers (/talk-to-your-agents/triggers/webhooks)

Create webhook endpoints for external services to invoke your Agents





Triggers create webhook endpoints that allow external services to invoke your Agents via HTTP. When a service like GitHub, Slack, Zendesk, or Stripe sends a webhook, the payload is validated, transformed, and used to start a new conversation with your Agent.

## How Triggers Work

<Mermaid chart="sequenceDiagram\n    participant Service as External Service\n    participant Webhook as Trigger Endpoint\n    participant Agent as Your Agent\n    participant DB as Invocation Log\n\n    Service->>Webhook: POST webhook payload\n    Webhook->>Webhook: Validate auth & signature\n    Webhook->>Webhook: Validate payload schema\n    Webhook->>Webhook: Transform payload → message\n    Webhook->>DB: Create invocation (pending)\n    Webhook-->>Service: 202 Accepted + invocationId\n    Webhook->>Agent: Start conversation (async)\n    Agent->>Agent: Process message\n    Agent->>DB: Update invocation (success/failed)" />

1. **External service sends a webhook** to your trigger's URL
2. **Authentication is verified** (custom headers or signature)
3. **Payload is validated** against the input schema (if configured)
4. **Payload is transformed** using the message template
5. **Invocation is logged** and the webhook returns immediately with `202 Accepted`
6. **Agent processes the message** asynchronously in a new conversation

## When to Use Triggers

Triggers are ideal for:

| Use Case              | Example                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **CI/CD pipelines**   | Trigger code review agents on PR creation  |
| **Customer events**   | Respond to Stripe payment webhooks         |
| **DevOps alerts**     | Process PagerDuty or Datadog alerts        |
| **Chat integrations** | Handle Slack or Discord messages           |
| **Form submissions**  | Process Typeform or webhook-enabled forms  |
| **Scheduled tasks**   | Invoke agents from cron jobs or schedulers |

<Warning>
  \*\*User-scoped MCP servers require a configured `runAsUserId`. Without `runAsUserId` set on the trigger, tools that require user-scoped credentials will fail. See [User vs Project MCPs](/visual-builder/tools/user-vs-project-mcp) for more details.
</Warning>

## Trigger Configuration

Each trigger is configured with:

### Required

* **Name**: Human-readable identifier for the trigger
* **Message Template**: Template that converts the webhook payload into a message for the Agent

### Optional

* **Input Schema**: JSON Schema to validate incoming payloads
* **Authentication**: Custom headers with expected values
* **Signing Secret**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (for GitHub, Slack, etc.)
* **Output Transform**: Reshape payloads before interpolating the message template. Choose one approach:
  * **Object Transformation**: Simple field remapping (recommended for basic use cases)
  * **JMESPath**: Complex transformations like filtering arrays or restructuring nested data
* **Run As User**: Execute the trigger on behalf of a specific user, enabling access to their connected credentials

## Authentication Options

Triggers support flexible header-based authentication:

| Configuration                            | Use Case                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Custom header (e.g., `X-API-Key`)        | Simple API key authentication             |
| `Authorization` header with Bearer token | OAuth-style authentication                |
| Multiple headers                         | Multi-factor authentication               |
| Signing secret only                      | Webhooks from services that sign requests |
| No authentication                        | Public webhooks (use with caution)        |

```typescript
// Example: Require a custom API key header
authentication: {
  headers: [
    { name: "X-API-Key", value: process.env.MY_API_KEY },
  ],
}
```

<Note>
  Header values are securely hashed before storage. For services that sign webhooks (GitHub, Stripe, Slack), you can rely on `signingSecret` alone for security.
</Note>

## Webhook URL Format

After creating a trigger, the webhook URL follows this pattern:

```
POST https://<your-run-api>/tenants/{tenantId}/projects/{projectId}/agents/{agentId}/triggers/{triggerId}
```

You can find the complete webhook URL in the API response when creating or listing triggers.

## User-Scoped Execution

By default, webhook triggers execute without a user identity — tools with user-scoped credentials will fail. Setting `runAsUserId` makes the trigger execute as a specific user, enabling access to their connected credentials (e.g., per-user OAuth tokens for GitHub, Slack, or Jira).

Any user with `edit` permission on a project can set `runAsUserId` to themselves. Org admins and owners can set it to any user in their organization.

When `runAsUserId` is set, agents automatically use that user's profile timezone for time-aware responses.

## Invocation Tracking

Every webhook invocation is tracked with:

* **Status**: `pending` → `success` or `failed`
* **Request Payload**: The original webhook body
* **Transformed Payload**: The payload after transformation
* **Conversation ID**: The conversation created for this invocation
* **Error Message**: Details if the invocation failed

This allows you to monitor webhook activity, debug failures, and audit trigger usage.

## Example: GitHub Issue Handler

Here's a conceptual example of a trigger that responds to GitHub issues:

```typescript
// When GitHub sends: { action: "opened", issue: { title: "Bug report", body: "..." }, ... }
// The trigger creates a message like:
// "New GitHub issue opened: Bug report\n\nDescription: ..."
// And starts a conversation with your support agent
```

## Example: Zendesk Ticket

Here's a conceptual example of a trigger that responds to Zendesk tickets:

```typescript
// Create a webhook from Zendesk when a ticket is created or updated
// The webhook triggers your Zendesk support ticket agent
// The agent can draft a reply to the ticket, write summaries as internal notes, add tags & custom fields, etc
```
