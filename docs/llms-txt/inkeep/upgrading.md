Upgrade the packages that make up the Inkeep Agent Framework



## Overview

The Inkeep Agent Framework is composed of several npm packages:

* [`@inkeep/agents-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-api): The unified API for managing projects, agent configurations and executing conversations with your agents.
* [`@inkeep/agents-manage-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-manage-ui): The UI for the visual builder and dashboard.
* [`@inkeep/agents-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-core): The core shared functionality of the agent framework.
* [`@inkeep/agents-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-sdk): The TypeScript SDK for building multi-agent systems.
* [`@inkeep/agents-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-cli): The CLI for managing and interacting with the agent framework.
* [`@inkeep/agents-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inkeep/agents-ui): The UI library containing chat widget components.

## Upgrading the quickstart template

<Warning>
  Because the packages are pre-1.0.0, updates may contain breaking changes that require you to reset your database. Please upgrade at your own risk.
</Warning>

If you used the `npx @inkeep/create-agents` CLI command to create your workspace, run the following command from the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm upgrade-agents
```

This will update all the packages to the latest version and migrate your database schema to the latest version.

<Note>
  Your Docker databases must be running before upgrading. If they aren't running, run `pnpm setup-dev` first, then run `pnpm upgrade-agents`.
</Note>

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter migration errors during the upgrade, this indicates a breaking schema change. You'll need to reset your database:

1. Drop your database: `pnpm db:drop`
2. Try again: `pnpm upgrade-agents`

## Upgrading the Agent CLI

If you installed the `@inkeep/agents-cli` package globally, you can upgrade it to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
inkeep update
```
