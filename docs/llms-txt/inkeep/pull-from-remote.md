Pull agent configurations from remote Inkeep instance to your local TypeScript project



This tutorial walks you through pulling agent configurations from an remote Inkeep instance to your local project. Use pull to bootstrap a local project from the [Visual Builder](/visual-builder/sub-agents), sync remote changes made by teammates, or set up a new development environment.

## Prerequisites

* Access to a remote Inkeep instance (e.g. [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav) or a [self-hosted deployment](/deployment/vercel))
* The Inkeep CLI installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

* A CLI profile configured and authenticated (only needed for remote deployments). If you haven't done this yet, follow the [Set up a CLI profile](/guides/cli/setup-profile) tutorial.
* An LLM API key set as an environment variable. The pull command uses LLM generation to produce TypeScript files. Set one of the following:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key    # Recommended
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key       # Alternative
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-key  # Alternative
```

## Step 1: Choose your pull target

You have two options depending on whether the project already exists locally.

### Option A: Pull into an existing project

If you already have a local project directory with an `index.ts` file, navigate into it:

```bash
cd my-project
```

### Option B: Pull a new project from the remote instance

If you don't have the project locally yet, you'll specify the project ID in the next step. The CLI creates a new directory for it automatically.

## Step 2: Run the pull command

<Note>
  Run `inkeep pull` from the directory that contains your `inkeep.config.ts`, or from any subdirectory below it.
</Note>

### For an existing project

From inside your project directory, run:

```bash
inkeep pull
```

The CLI will:

1. Detect the project from your `index.ts` file
2. Resolve configuration — your active [CLI profile](/guides/cli/setup-profile) overrides `inkeep.config.ts` for API URLs, API key, and tenant ID (see [Configuration Priority](/typescript-sdk/cli-reference#configuration-priority))
3. Fetch the latest configuration from the remote instance
4. Compare remote changes against your local files
5. Generate updated TypeScript files, preserving your local code structure

<Tip>
  The pull command uses smart comparison to detect what changed. If nothing has changed remotely, it tells you the project is already up to date.
</Tip>

### For a new project

Specify the project ID:

```bash
inkeep pull --project my-project-id
```

This creates a `./my-project-id/` directory with the full TypeScript project structure:

```
my-project-id/
├── index.ts                 # Project definition and wiring
├── agents/                  # Agent definitions
│   ├── my-agent.ts
│   └── sub-agents/
│       └── my-sub-agent.ts
├── tools/                   # Tool definitions
│   ├── my-tool.ts
│   └── functions/
│       └── my-function.ts
├── credentials/             # Credential references
│   └── my-credential.ts
├── environments/            # Environment-specific settings
│   ├── development.env.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── data-components/         # Data component definitions
    └── my-data-component.ts
```

## Step 3: Review the generated files

After pulling, the CLI runs a two-stage validation:

1. **File verification** -- checks that all expected files exist with correct naming
2. **Round-trip validation** -- loads the generated TypeScript, serializes it back to JSON, and compares with the original remote data to ensure no data loss

If validation passes, you'll see:

```
✓ Basic file verification passed
✓ Round-trip validation passed - generated TS matches backend data
```

Review the generated files to confirm they look correct. If validation fails, the CLI reports specific differences so you can investigate.

## Step 4: Use the pulled project

Once pulled, your project is a standard TypeScript project using `@inkeep/agents-sdk` builder APIs. You can:

* Edit agent configurations in code
* Push changes back with `inkeep push`
* Run the Visual Builder locally with `inkeep dev`

## Additional options

### Pull all projects

To pull every project from your tenant at once:

```bash
inkeep pull --all
```

Each project is created as a subdirectory in the current directory. The CLI handles existing and new projects differently:

* **Existing projects** (local `index.ts` found): Uses smart comparison to merge changes
* **New projects** (no local directory): Generates files from scratch

### Force a full regeneration

To regenerate all files from scratch, ignoring local changes:

```bash
inkeep pull --introspect
```

This bypasses the smart comparison and rebuilds every TypeScript file from the remote configuration. Use this when your local files are in a broken state or you want a clean slate that matches the remote instance exactly.

<Note>
  The `--introspect` flag overwrites all local files. Commit or back up any local changes you want to keep before using it.
</Note>

### Pull for a specific environment

Generate environment-specific credential files by passing the `--env` flag:

```bash
inkeep pull --env production
```

This generates credential configurations in `environments/production.env.ts` instead of the default `environments/development.env.ts`.

### Export as JSON

To inspect the raw project data without generating TypeScript files:

```bash
inkeep pull --json
```

This outputs the project configuration as JSON, which is useful for debugging or piping into other tools.
