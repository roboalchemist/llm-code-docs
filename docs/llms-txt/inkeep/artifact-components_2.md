Learn how to use artifact components to store and retrieve data from the agent



<>
  Artifacts are structured components that capture and store source information when agents interact with tools or other agents. They act as a record-keeping system, automatically documenting where information comes from during tool and agent interactions.

  ## How Artifacts Work

  When an agent uses a tool (whether that's another agent or a utility tool), the response is automatically parsed to create artifacts. These artifacts store:

  * The source of the information (tool/agent used)
  * The relevant content from the response
  * Metadata about the interaction

  ## Oversized Artifacts

  When tool results exceed **30% of the model's context window**, they're marked as **oversized** to prevent context overflow.

  **What happens:**

  * ✅ Full data is persisted to storage
  * ❌ Retrieval is blocked to preserve context space
  * ⚠️ Visual warnings appear in the UI traces panel

  **UI Indicators:**

  * Amber warning badge in timeline: `⚠️ Oversized artifact (~247K tokens)`
  * Detailed warning in expanded view with size and percentage of context

  **Tracing Attributes:**

  * `artifact.is_oversized` - Boolean flag
  * `artifact.retrieval_blocked` - Whether retrieval is blocked
  * `artifact.original_token_size` - Estimated token count
  * `artifact.context_window_size` - Model's context limit

  **Troubleshooting:**
  If seeing many oversized artifacts, consider:

  * Filter tool outputs to return only necessary fields
  * Paginate large result sets
  * Pre-summarize responses in tools
  * Use models with larger context windows

  ## Defining Artifact Components

  Artifact components are defined using the `artifactComponent` builder function. **We recommend using Zod schemas** for type safety and better developer experience.

  <Callout>
    **Quick Start**: Citation artifacts are automatically included when you create
    a new project with `npx @inkeep/create-agents`, providing a ready-to-use
    example.
  </Callout>

  ```typescript
  import { artifactComponent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
  import { z } from "zod";
  import { preview } from "@inkeep/agents-core";

  export const citation = artifactComponent({
    id: "citation",
    name: "citation",
    description: "Structured factual information extracted from search results",
    props: z.object({
      title: preview(z.string().describe("Title of the source document")),
      url: preview(z.string().describe("URL of the source document")),
      record_type: preview(
        z.string().describe("Type of record (documentation, blog, guide, etc.)")
      ),
      content: z
        .array(
          z.object({
            type: z
              .string()
              .describe("Type of content (text, image, video, etc.)"),
            text: z.string().describe("The actual text content"),
          })
        )
        .describe(
          "Array of structured content blocks extracted from the document"
        ),
    }),
  });
  ```

  <Callout>
    JSON Schema is also supported. Set `inPreview: true` on properties instead of
    using `preview()`.
  </Callout>

  ## Schema Requirements

  <Callout type="warning">
    **Critical**: Artifact schemas must match your tool's output structure. The
    system uses JMESPath selectors on JSON - it **cannot extract from free text**.
  </Callout>

  ```typescript
  // ❌ WRONG: Tool returns text, schema expects structured data
  // Tool output: { result: { content: [{ text: "Weather: Sunny, 75°F" }] } }
  props: z.object({
    temperature: z.number(), // ❌ Cannot extract number from text
    condition: z.string(), // ❌ Cannot extract condition from text
  });

  // ✅ CORRECT: Tool returns structured data matching schema
  // Tool output: { result: { temperature: 75, condition: "Sunny" } }
  props: z.object({
    temperature: z.number(),
    condition: z.string(),
  });
  ```

  Use OpenTelemetry traces to debug schema validation issues.

  ## Preview Fields

  Use `preview()` to mark fields for immediate availability. The `preview()` helper automatically sets `inPreview: true` in the generated schema.

  **Preview fields are:**

  * Included in the agent's context when an artifact is referenced, so the agent can reason about them directly
  * Shown to other agents in the project for cross-agent reasoning
  * Streamed in real-time to clients (Vercel AI SDK)
  * Auto-rendered by Inkeep's widget (citations as interactive cards)
  * Available immediately in UI (full artifact loads on-demand)

  **Non-preview fields** are persisted in storage but kept out of the agent's working context by default, keeping the context window lean. Agents can retrieve the complete artifact — including all non-preview fields — on demand when they need it.

  **No schema?** Omit `props` to save the entire tool result without filtering.

  ## Accessing Artifact Data

  Agents can access artifact data in a few ways:

  * **In context** — after creating or referencing an artifact, the agent can see its preview fields directly in its working context
  * **Passing to a tool** — the agent can supply an artifact as an argument to a tool; the tool receives the complete artifact data, including all non-preview fields
  * **On-demand retrieval** — the agent can explicitly fetch the full artifact when it needs to read non-preview fields itself

  Not every intermediate tool result needs to become an artifact. When an agent chains tool calls — passing one tool's output directly into the next — no artifact is created and nothing surfaces to the user. See [Tool Output Pipelines](/typescript-sdk/tools/function-tools#tool-output-pipelines).

  ## Passing Artifacts to Tools

  When an agent passes an artifact to a tool as an argument, the tool receives the **complete artifact data** — all fields, including those not marked `inPreview`. This means you can design tools that work with rich artifact content without needing to fetch or reconstruct data manually.

  For example, a document processing tool can access the full `content` array from a citation artifact even though `content` is a non-preview field:

  ```typescript
  import { functionTool } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
  import { z } from "zod";

  const summarizeTool = functionTool({
    id: "summarize-document",
    description: "Summarize the content of a document artifact",
    inputSchema: z.object({
      // The agent passes an artifact here; the tool receives all fields
      document: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        url: z.string(),
        content: z.array(z.object({ type: z.string(), text: z.string() })),
      }),
    }),
    execute: async ({ document }) => {
      // document.content is fully available here, even though it's non-preview
      const fullText = document.content.map((c) => c.text).join("\n");
      return { summary: fullText.slice(0, 500) };
    },
  });
  ```

  ## Artifact Creation

  When an agent uses a tool:

  1. The tool processes the request and returns a response
  2. **The agent decides** whether to create an artifact from the tool response
  3. If created, the artifact is parsed according to the artifact component schema
  4. The artifact can be associated with any data components that reference this information

  ## Artifacts vs Data Components

  **Artifacts** and **Data Components** are different:

  * **Artifacts**: Citations/sources from tool results stored in the database
  * **Data Components**: UI elements agents output in responses (Text, Fact, etc.)

  Artifacts provide the source citations that back up information in data components.

  ## Using in Agents

  After defining your artifact component, use it in an agent:

  ```typescript
  import { agent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
  import { citation } from "./artifact-components/citation";

  const searchAgent = agent({
    id: "search-agent",
    canUse: () => [searchTool],
    prompt: "Search for information and cite sources using artifacts.",
    artifactComponents: () => [citation],
  });
  ```

  ## Citation Artifacts

  Citation artifacts that are named `citation` and have `title` and `url` preview fields are automatically rendered as interactive cards by Inkeep's widget library. This provides source attribution and allows users to verify information at the source.

  <Image src="/images/citation-widget-example.png" alt="Citation artifact rendered as an interactive card in the Inkeep widget showing source attribution" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} />

  ## Example Flow

  Here's a complete example with inline artifact component definition:

  ```typescript
  import { agent } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";
  import { z } from "zod";
  import { preview } from "@inkeep/agents-core";

  const searchAgent = subAgent({
    id: "search",
    canUse: () => [searchTool],
    prompt: "Search for information and cite sources using artifacts.",
    artifactComponents: [
      {
        id: "citation",
        name: "citation",
        description: "Search result document",
        props: z.object({
          title: preview(z.string().describe("Document title")),
          url: preview(z.string().describe("Document URL")),
          content: z.string().describe("Document content"),
        }),
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  ## No Schema Example

  ```typescript
  const rawDataAgent = subAgent({
    id: "raw-data",
    canUse: () => [apiTool],
    prompt: "Fetch data and save complete responses.",
    artifactComponents: [
      {
        id: "api-response",
        name: "API Response",
        description: "Complete API response data",
        // No props - saves entire tool result
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  Example flow:

  1. Agent uses search tool and gets results
  2. **Agent decides** to create an artifact citing the source document
  3. Artifact is stored with preview fields (title, url) shown to other agents
  4. Other agents can reference this artifact or get full content when needed
