Create a CLI profile and authenticate with remote Inkeep instance



<Note>
  Profile setup is only required when pushing or pulling to a remote deployment (e.g. [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav) or a [self-hosted deployment](/deployment/vercel)). If you're pushing or pulling locally, you can skip this step.
</Note>

A CLI profile tells the CLI where to connect and how to authenticate with a remote deployment. This tutorial walks you through creating a profile and logging in.

## Prerequisites

* Access to a remote Inkeep instance (e.g. [Inkeep Enterprise](https://inkeep.com/enterprise?cta_id=docs_nav) or a [self-hosted deployment](/deployment/vercel))
* The Inkeep CLI installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

## Step 1: Create a profile

Profiles let you manage multiple environments (remote, local, staging) from the same CLI. Create a profile for remote Inkeep instance:

```bash
inkeep profile add <profile-name>
```

The CLI prompts you to configure the profile:

1. **Remote type**:
   * Select **Inkeep Cloud** if you have an Inkeep Enterprise account (URLs are configured automatically)
   * Select **Local** for local development (localhost defaults, no authentication required)
   * Select **Custom** for self-hosted deployments, then enter your API and Manage UI URLs
2. **Environment name**: Enter `production` (or your preferred name)
3. **Credential reference**: Enter a name for your credential (defaults to `inkeep-<profile-name>`)

<Tip>
  You can verify the profile was created by running `inkeep profile list`.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Set the active profile

Set the profile you created as the active profile:

```bash
inkeep profile use <profile-name>
```

Confirm which profile is active:

```bash
inkeep profile current
```

## Step 3: Log in

Authenticate with your active profile:

```bash
inkeep login
```

The CLI will:

1. Open your browser to the Inkeep authentication page
2. Display a device code (e.g., `ABCD-1234`)
3. Wait for you to complete authentication in the browser

Once authenticated, you'll see confirmation:

```
✓ Logged in as you@example.com
✓ Organization: Your Organization
✓ Profile: cloud
```

<Note>
  Your credentials are securely stored in your system keychain. You only need to log in once per profile.
</Note>

## Managing multiple profiles

You can create profiles for different environments and switch between them:

```bash
inkeep profile add staging
inkeep profile use staging
inkeep login
```

To authenticate a specific profile without switching:

```bash
inkeep login --profile staging
```

To remove a profile you no longer need:

```bash
inkeep profile remove staging
```
