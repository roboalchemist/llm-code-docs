# Evaluations in Visual Builder (/visual-builder/evaluations)

Configure evaluators, batch evaluations, and continuous tests in the Visual Builder



The Visual Builder lets you define, manage, and run evaluations. You define evaluators (how to score agents), then run them in two ways: **batch evaluations** (one-time jobs over selected conversations) and **continuous tests** (automatic evaluation on a sample of live conversations).

## Where to find evaluations

1. Open your project in the Visual Builder.
2. In the project sidebar, go to **Evaluations** for evaluators, batch jobs, and continuous tests.

<Note>
  You need **Edit** permission on the project to create or change evaluators, batch evaluations, and continuous tests. See [Access control](/visual-builder/access-control) for roles and permissions.

## Evaluators

Evaluators define how agent responses are scored. Each evaluator has a **prompt**, a **schema**, and optionally a **pass criteria** to produce a score or structured output.

### Creating an evaluator

1. Go to **Evaluations** and open the **Evaluators** tab.

2. Click **New evaluator**.

3. Fill in:
   * **Name** and optional **Description**
   * **Prompt** — instructions for the model (e.g. what to score and how)
   * **Schema** — JSON schema for structured output (e.g. numeric score, categories)
   * **Model** — the model used to run the evaluator
   * **Pass criteria** (optional) — conditions on numeric schema fields that define pass/fail (e.g. `score >= 0.8`)

4. Save. The evaluator is then available for batch evaluations and continuous tests.

### Editing or deleting

From the Evaluators list, open an evaluator to view or edit it, or use the delete action.

## Batch evaluations

Batch evaluations run selected evaluators over a set of conversations once. You choose which evaluators to run and over what date range.

### Creating a batch evaluation

1. Go to **Evaluations** and open the **Batch Evaluations** tab.
2. Click **New batch evaluation**.
3. Select one or more **Evaluators**.
4. Narrow the scope by **Date range** — only conversations within that range
5. Start the job. A new batch evaluation job is created and runs asynchronously.

### Viewing results

From the Batch Evaluations list, open a job to see its **results**: per-conversation evaluation outputs, pass/fail if pass criteria are set, and status. You can filter and inspect individual results.

## Continuous tests

Continuous tests evaluate a sample of **live** conversations automatically. You specify which evaluators to run, which agents (optional), and a **sample rate** (e.g. 10% of conversations).

### Creating a continuous test

1. Go to **Evaluations** and open the **Continuous Tests** tab.
2. Click **New continuous test**.
3. Set **Name** and optional **Description**.
4. The config is **Active** so it runs on new conversations.
5. Choose **Evaluators** to run.
6. Optionally restrict by **Agents** (only evaluate conversations for those agents).
7. Set **Sample rate** (0–1) to evaluate a fraction of matching conversations.
8. Save. Once active, matching conversations will be evaluated according to the sample rate.

### Viewing results

From the Continuous Tests list, open a config to see **Results** for that run config: all evaluation results triggered by that continuous test, with filters.

| Area                  | Purpose                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Evaluators**        | Define how to score agent outputs (prompt, model, schema, pass criteria). |
| **Batch evaluations** | Run evaluators once over a scoped set of conversations (date range).      |
| **Continuous tests**  | Automatically run evaluators on a sample of live conversations.           |
