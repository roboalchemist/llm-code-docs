# Chat Components Overview (/talk-to-your-agents)

Pre-built chat components to integrate Inkeep agents into your application



The Inkeep chat components provide pre-built UI elements to quickly integrate conversational AI into your application. These components handle the chat interface, message streaming, and user interactions out of the box.

## Available Components

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [Chat Button](/talk-to-your-agents/react/chat-button)       | A floating button that opens a chat modal          |

## Framework Support

The chat components are available for:

* **[React](/talk-to-your-agents/react/chat-button)** - Native React components with full TypeScript support
* **[Next.js](/talk-to-your-agents/nextjs/chat-button)** - Same React components with App Router–friendly setup (dynamic import, `"use client"`)
* **[JavaScript](/talk-to-your-agents/javascript/chat-button)** - Vanilla JavaScript for any framework or plain HTML

## Automatic Headers

The chat components automatically send the following headers with each request to provide client context:

| Header                      | Description                                       | Example Value              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `x-inkeep-client-timestamp` | The client's current timestamp in ISO 8601 format | `2025-01-30T18:15:00.000Z` |
| `x-inkeep-client-timezone`  | The client's timezone identifier                  | `America/New_York`         |

These headers enable your agents to provide time-aware responses. See [Headers](/typescript-sdk/headers#widget-provided-headers) to learn how to use these values in your agent configuration.
