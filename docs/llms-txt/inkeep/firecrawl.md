# Connect Your Data with Firecrawl (/connect-your-data/firecrawl)

Connect websites to your agents using Firecrawl



## Overview

Firecrawl is a web scraping and web crawling platform that extracts clean content from web pages and converts it to markdown or structured JSON, ready for embedding and use in RAG pipelines.

With Firecrawl you can connect your agents to:

* **Websites**: Website crawling and indexing for extracting clean content from web pages
* **Web pages**: Individual page scraping with automatic content extraction

## RAG pipeline workflow

Here's what a complete RAG pipeline looks like to connect your websites to your agents:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Scrape web content with Firecrawl** - Extract clean markdown from websites
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Save the clean markdown** - Store scraped content locally
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Index the documents in Pinecone** - Using Pinecone Assistant SDK
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Agent queries via MCP server** - Retrieves relevant content using semantic search
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

* A [Firecrawl account](https://firecrawl.dev/)
* A [Pinecone account](https://app.pinecone.io/)
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed
* A python virtual environment running

### Step 1: Set up Firecrawl and collect data

Install Firecrawl and retrieve your API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev):

```bash
uv pip install firecrawl-py python-dotenv
```

Save your API key to a `.env` file:

```bash title=".env"
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-YOUR-KEY-HERE
```

The following script uses Firecrawl to explore a website's structure, identify all available pages, and convert each page's content into markdown files.

```python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path

load_dotenv()
app = Firecrawl()

# Crawl to discover pages
crawl_result = app.crawl(
    "https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements",
    limit=10,
    scrape_options={'formats': ['markdown']}
)

# Extract URLs
urls = [page.metadata.url for page in crawl_result.data
        if page.metadata and page.metadata.url]

# Batch scrape
batch_job = app.batch_scrape(urls, formats=["markdown"])

# This creates a directory for our documents and saves each scraped page as a numbered markdown file
output_dir = Path("data/documents")
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

for i, result in enumerate(batch_job.data):
    filename = f"doc_{i:02d}.md"
    with open(output_dir / filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(result.markdown)
```

<Tip>
  For a more in-depth tutorial on programmatically scraping with Firecrawl, follow Firecrawl's [guide](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/best-vector-databases-2025) under the "Building a RAG Pipeline" section.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Set up Pinecone Assistant and index your documents

We'll load those markdown files, chunk them, and store them in Pinecone. First, install the required packages:

```bash
uv pip install langchain-pinecone langchain-openai pinecone langchain langchain-text-splitters
```

Set up your Pinecone API key environment variable:

```bash title=".env"
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-key
```

In your Pinecone Assistant, create a new assistant named "drug-info-rag". The code below indexes your documents in the assistant with their embeddings.

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pinecone import Pinecone

load_dotenv()

# Initialize Pinecone
pc = Pinecone(api_key=os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"])

# Create assistant
assistant = pc.assistant.Assistant(
    assistant_name="drug-info-rag",
)

# Upload markdown files to assistant
for md_file in Path("data/documents").glob("*.md"):
    response = assistant.upload_file(
        file_path=str(md_file.absolute()),
        timeout=None
    )
    print(f"Uploaded {md_file.name}: {response}")
```

### Step 3: Get your Pinecone Assistant MCP server URL

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab in [Pinecone Assistant](https://app.pinecone.io/)
2. Copy the MCP URL provided

### Step 4: Register the MCP server

Register the Pinecone MCP server as a tool in your agent configuration. Replace `<your-mcp-url>` with the MCP URL you copied in Step 4.

**Using TypeScript SDK:**

You can create your [credential](/typescript-sdk/credentials/overview) using keychain, nango, or environment variables, but in this example we use environment variables.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title=".env"
  PINECONE_API_KEY=<your-pinecone-api-key>
  ```

  ```typescript title="agents/documentation-agent.ts"
  import { mcpTool, subAgent, credential } from "@inkeep/agents-sdk";

  const pineconeCredential = credential({
    id: 'pinecone-credential',
    name: 'Pinecone Credential',
    type: CredentialStoreType.memory,
    credentialStoreId: 'memory-default',
    retrievalParams: {
      "key": "PINECONE_API_KEY", // where PINECONE_API_KEY is the API key for your Pinecone project
    },
  });

  const pineconeTool = mcpTool({
    id: "pinecone-documents",
    name: "pinecone_search",
    description: "Search uploaded documents and files using semantic search",
    serverUrl: "<your-mcp-url>", // From Pinecone Settings tab
  });

  const docAgent = subAgent({
    id: "doc-agent",
    name: "Documentation Assistant",
    description: "Answers questions using uploaded documents",
    prompt: `You are a documentation assistant with access to company documents and files.`,
    canUse: () => [pineconeTool],
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Using Visual Builder:**

1. **Add a Pinecone credential:**
   * Go to the **Credentials** tab in the Visual Builder
   * Click **"New credential"**
   * Select **"Bearer authentication"**
   * Enter:
     * **Name**: `Pinecone API Key` (or your preferred name)
     * **API key**: Your Pinecone API key (found in your [Pinecone dashboard](https://app.pinecone.io/))
   * Click **"Create Credential"** to save

2. **Register the MCP server:**
   * Go to the **MCP Servers** tab in the Visual Builder
   * Click **"New MCP server"**
   * Select **"Custom Server"**
   * Enter:
     * **Name**: `Pinecone Documents`
     * **URL**: Your MCP URL from Pinecone Settings tab
     * **Transport Type**: `Streamable HTTP`
     * **Credential**: Select the Pinecone credential you created
   * Click **"Create"** to save the server

3. **Add the MCP tool to your sub agent:**
   * Drag the Pinecone Documents MCP tool onto your agent canvas and connect it to the sub agent

### Step 5: Use the Pinecone Assistant MCP server in your agent

Once you have registered your MCP server as a tool and connected it to your agent, your agent can use the Pinecone Assistant tool to search and retrieve relevant content from your uploaded documents.

Ask an interesting question like, "What are the primary uses of amlodipine and atorvastatin, and how do they work in the body?"

The Pinecone tool provides a `get_context` function that retrieves relevant document snippets from your knowledge base. When your agent calls this tool, it will:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Search semantically**: Use vector similarity search to find the most relevant content based on the query
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Return formatted snippets**: Each result includes:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>file_name</code>

        : The name of the file containing the snippet
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>pages</code>

        : The page numbers where the snippet appears (for PDFs and DOCX files)
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>content</code>

        : The actual text content of the snippet
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Parameters:**

* `query` (required): The search query to retrieve context for
* `top_k` (optional): The number of context snippets to retrieve. Defaults to 15.
