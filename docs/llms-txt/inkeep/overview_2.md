# Connecting Your Data (/connect-your-data/overview)

Learn how to connect your data sources to your agents through MCP servers



Connect your data sources to your agents through MCP servers. Support websites, GitHub repositories, documentation, knowledge bases, PDFs, and more. Your agents can search and access this content in real-time.

## How it works

1. **Set up your data source** - Configure your chosen provider and connect your data sources
2. **Get your MCP server URL** - Obtain the MCP server endpoint from your provider
3. **Register the MCP server** - Register it as a tool in the Visual Builder or TypeScript SDK
4. **Use in your agents** - Your agents can now search and access your connected data

## Other options

Consider these additional options for connecting your data:

* **[Reducto](https://reducto.ai/)** - Self-serve document processing with a free tier. Upload documents and access them via APIs or SDKs. Wrap their APIs in your own MCP server or invoke them directly using [function tools](/typescript-sdk/tools/function-tools).

* **[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/)** - Document processing platform with a free tier. Upload documents and access them via APIs or SDKs. Wrap their APIs in your own MCP server or invoke them directly using [function tools](/typescript-sdk/tools/function-tools).

* **[Milvus](https://milvus.io/)** - Open-source vector database with self-hosting options. See their [MCP integration guide](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus_and_mcp.md) for setup instructions. Must manage deployment and hosting for MCP server.

* **[SingleStore](https://singlestore.com/)** - Relational database with a managed MCP server that converts natural language queries into SQL. Learn more in their [MCP server documentation](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/ai-services/singlestore-mcp-server/).
