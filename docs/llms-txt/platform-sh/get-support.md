Find out how to get help if you’re experiencing issues with Upsun.

## Create a support ticket

If you're experiencing issues related to the proper functioning of the Upsun infrastructure, application container software, build processes, have found possible bugs, have general questions or wish to submit a feature request, open a support ticket:

1. [Open the Console](https://console.upsun.com/).
1. In the upper right-hand corner, click **Help** and select **Support** from the menu.
1. In the **Support tickets** section, click **New ticket**.
1. Complete the **Create a ticket** form and then click **Submit**.

Or use these shortcuts to [access all support tickets](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets)
or [open a new ticket](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open).

Once you submit a ticket, you see it in a list of all tickets created, for all projects you have access to, within your organization.

**Note**: 

Note that once you submit the ticket, you can’t modify or delete the submission.
If you have any additional information, you can select the submitted ticket and write a message.

**Upgrade to the Organization Support add-on**: 

The Upsun Organization Support add-on provides tiered support options tailored to organizational needs. All organizations are automatically enrolled in the Standard support tier.

To upgrade to either the Premium or Advanced support tier, visit the [add-on subscriptions page](https://docs.upsun.com/administration/billing/add-on-subscription.md#organization-support-add-on).
