# Use DDEV for local development


[DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an open-source tool for local development environments.
It allows you to use Docker in your workflows while maintaining a GitOps workflow.
You get fully containerized environments to run everything locally
without having to install tools (including the Upsun  CLI, PHP, and Composer) on your machine.

Please see the [Upsun Integration docs on DDEV Docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/upsun/).
