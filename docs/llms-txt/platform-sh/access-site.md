# Access your site

Once you have an environment running, you can view it in a web browser. 
To find which URLs you can use to access your site, follow these steps:

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
upsun url
```

 - Select the URL to open in a browser.

For more information about URLs in your project and how you can control access to your web applications, 
see how to [define routes](https://docs.upsun.com../define-routes/).
