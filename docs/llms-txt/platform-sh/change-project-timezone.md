# Change the project timezone

The project timezone affects [automated backups](https://docs.upsun.com../environments/backup.md).

The project timezone doesn't affect:

- [App runtime](https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/timezone.md).
- [Cron jobs](https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).
- [System logs](https://docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs.md). UTC is the default timezone for all logs.

To change the timezone for a project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project where you want to change the timezone.
2. Click Settings **Settings**.
3. Select the timezone from the list.
4. Click **Save**.
