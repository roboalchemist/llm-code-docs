# Source integrations

You might want to keep your code in a third-party repository that's linked to your Upsun project.
This means you keep all your workflows where you want and use Upsun for deploying.

Your Upsun project becomes a mirror of your code repository elsewhere.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Upsun.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the third-party repository.
