# Upsun Fixed

> Upsun Fixed is a PaaS to host all of your web applications.

Things to remember when deploying applications on Upsun Fixed:
- **Deliver your applications faster, at scale**: Built for developers, by developers. The efficient, reliable, and secure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that gives development teams control and peace of mind while accelerating the time it takes to build and deploy applications.
- **2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant for Cloud Application Platforms**: Recognized as a Niche Player in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Application Platforms
- **Optimized developer experience**: Our flexible, automated infrastructure provisioning and Git-based process optimizes development-to-production workflows. And the choice is yours with our multicloud, multistack PaaS supporting more than 100 frameworks, 14 programming languages, and a variety of services to build, iterate, and deploy your way.
- **Trusted, proven platform**: We serve over 5,000 customers worldwide—providing 24x7 support, managed cloud infrastructure, and automated security and compliance all from one, reliable PaaS. Keeping your applications safe, secure, and available around the clock with full control over your data.
- **Committed to carbon-conscious computing**: In addition to allowing our clients to pick lower carbon regions, our high-density computing allows up to 12x fewer resources used, which translates into lower greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Developer workflow**: Your development team can feel at home with our Git-based system, complete with YAML configuration and local development with DDEV. Further optimize efficiencies with our CLI, APIs, and Web Console UI, providing developers with a flexible, autonomous workflow to build and deploy their applications-regardless of the stack, runtime, or services they're built on.
- **Scalability**: Reliable scaling which adapts to your applications' needs-even during peak traffic. Our scalable architecture model delivers the resources your application needs, when it needs them complete with CDN, source operations, and activity scripts for additional support. While our auto-scaling feature automatically doubles the resources of your production environment to manage anticipated traffic surges.
- **Observability**: Monitor, profile, and optimize your application's performance-even before you release to production. Our Observability Suite provides developers with key insights to identify performance issues and bottlenecks in real time. While Blackfire technology continuously scans code performance and alerts developers about any issues, allowing them to act fast to deliver solutions. Ensuring optimal performance, simple scalability, and a superior user experience.
- **Security and compliance**: Develop, deploy, and host applications securely with a PaaS built on the three pillars of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. From anti-malware, software updates, and vulnerability scanning to data retention and breaches-(https://docs.upsun.com/api/) has a robust security and compliance framework developed to help applications remain as secure as possible through a shared responsibility model.

## Get started

### Git init

The basic unit for organizing work within Upsun Fixed is a project.
Each project represents one Git repository, a centralized place to store code and work history.
For now, Upsun Fixed represents the source of truth for your repository.
You can later set up an integration with GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.

To deploy your app, you need to connect its repository to a project in Upsun Fixed.

First, create an Upsun Fixed project by running the following command:

```bash
platform project:create
```

Then go through each of the steps to create the project:

1. Give it a title.
2. Choose a [region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md).
   The CLI lists each region's location, cloud provider, and average carbon intensity.
3. Choose a plan.
   A Development plan is enough before you deploy anything.
   During a free trial, you can't choose production plans so you won't see this option.
4. Select enough environments.
   This defaults to 3 environments, which are included in any production-level plan, but you can add more.
5. Select enough storage.
   This defaults to 5 GiB, which is included in any production-level plan, but you can add more.
6. Choose a default branch.
   This defaults to `main`, but you can always [change it later](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/default-environment.md).

A Git repository is automatically initialized and Upsun Fixed is set as a remote.

Now your project is initialized and ready for you to make changes.

### Git commit

Once you have your project initialized, it's time to add the basics to get it deployed.

In your repository, create a file to hold your app configuration:

```bash
touch .platform.app.yaml
```

This file holds all the configuration for the container where your app lives.
By keeping the configuration in this file,
you ensure it remains the same across all environments, from development to production.

Start by adding basic properties for your app, such as its name and language.
You can adjust the file to fit your code, such as the `start` command to start your app, or desires, such as changing the `name`.

You may need to adapt the start command to fit your app.

To build your app, you may also need to add commands to go through the build process.
These are included in what's known as the build hook.

Add something similar to the following to the end of the file you just added:

    <a

      :class="{ '!text-ebony font-bold border-b': frametech === 'default' || frametech === 'pipenv' }"

Commit your changes (to save your changes):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Upsun Fixed files"
```

Push your changes (to share your changes with everyone with access to your project/repository):

```bash
platform push
```

You can now see your built app at the returned URL.

Your app is built and served at the returned URL, but it doesn't yet have all the services it needs to work.

You could [define more complicated routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md),
but the default is enough for basic apps.
Now branch your environment to see how data works in Upsun Fixed  and then add services.


### Git branch

The next step in building out your app is adding a service.
For comfortable development and testing, start with a separate branch for development.

##### Create a preview environment

To develop without affecting production, you need a separate environment.
Create one in a terminal:

```bash
platform branch dev main
```

This creates a separate environment with its own data.
It's based on your default branch (the last argument in the command).
This means it copies all data and services from its parent.

Because nothing about your `dev` environment is different,
it reuses the built containers from your `main` environment.
This saves time and ensures the build is the same whenever the environment is the same.

##### Add environment variable

To make your `dev` environment different, change the environment by adding a variable.
Add a variable available in the build:

```bash
platform variable:create example --visible-build true --environment dev --value "This is a variable"
```

This `example` variable is visible in the build and so its creation triggers a new build of your app.

##### Read variable

To see the difference in the environments, read the variable in each environment.

Read the variable from your `dev` environment:

```bash
platform variable:get --environment dev example
```

This returns a table with information on the variable including its creation date and value.

Read the variable from your `main` environment:

```bash
platform variable:get --environment main example
```

You get a message saying the variable wasn't found.

Differences such as this allow you to have different builds in different environments.
This is useful for things such as connecting to different databases in development and production.

Now you have a preview environment and know how it works.
Next, add a service in that environment and then merge it.

### Git merge

You have a separate environment with separate data.
Next, add a service to your preview environment.

##### Add a service

Upsun Fixed includes many services such as databases, cache, and search engines.
These are included in your project, so you can manage them with Git and back them up with your project.

Add a database service (or choose [another service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)) by following these steps:

1. Create a services configuration file.

   ```bash
   touch .platform/services.yaml
   ```

   This file holds the configuration for all services your app needs.

2. Add a database in that file.
   (If you need a different database service, you can choose from the [available services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md#available-services).
   Then change the `type` to fit your choice.)

   ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
   db:
     type: mariadb:10.5
     disk: 1024
   ```

   Note that `db` is the name of the service.
   You can give it any name you want with lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.

3. Add a relationship between the database and your app in your app configuration:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   relationships:
     database:
       service: "db"
       endpoint: "mysql"
   ```

   This relationship is where connections are made.
   The `database` is the name of the relationship, which you can change if you want.
   The `db` has to be the same as the service name from step 2.

4. Commit your changes and push:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add database and connect to app"
   platform push
   ```

Now you have a database you can connect to your app.

##### Connect database to app

Now connect the database to your app.

First, add the Upsun Fixed  Config Reader library to make the connection easier.

```bash
composer require platformsh/config-reader
```

```bash
npm install platformsh-config
```

```bash
pip install platformshconfig
```

Then connect to the database in your app using the library.
You can choose where to do this depending on what makes sense in your app.

```php {}
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config;

// Create a new config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
// You can alternatively use getenv() yourself.
$config = new Config();

// The 'database' relationship is generally the name of primary SQL database of an application.
// That's not required, but much of our default automation code assumes it.
$credentials = $config->credentials('database');

try {
    // Connect to the database using PDO.  If using some other abstraction layer you would
    // inject the values from $database into whatever your abstraction layer asks for.
    $dsn = sprintf('mysql:host=%s;port=%d;dbname=%s', $credentials['host'], $credentials['port'], $credentials['path']);
    $conn = new \PDO($dsn, $credentials['username'], $credentials['password'], [
        // Always use Exception error mode with PDO, as it's more reliable.
        \PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => \PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
        // So we don't have to mess around with cursors and unbuffered queries by default.
        \PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY => TRUE,
        // Make sure MySQL returns all matched rows on update queries including
        // rows that actually didn't have to be updated because the values didn't
        // change. This matches common behavior among other database systems.
        \PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_FOUND_ROWS => TRUE,
    ]);

    // Creating a table.
    $sql = "CREATE TABLE People (
      id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
      city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
      )";
    $conn->query($sql);

    // Insert data.
    $sql = "INSERT INTO People (name, city) VALUES
        ('Neil Armstrong', 'Moon'),
        ('Buzz Aldrin', 'Glen Ridge'),
        ('Sally Ride', 'La Jolla');";
    $conn->query($sql);

    // Show table.
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM People";
    $result = $conn->query($sql);
    $result->setFetchMode(\PDO::FETCH_OBJ);

    if ($result) {
        print <<<TABLE

<tbody>

        foreach ($result as $record) {
            printf("<tr><td>%s</td><td>%s</td></tr>\n", $record->name, $record->city);
        }
        print "</tbody>\n</table>\n";
    }

    // Drop table
    $sql = "DROP TABLE People";
    $conn->query($sql);

} catch (\Exception $e) {
    print $e->getMessage();
}

```

```

This example creates a table in your database, adds some data, prints the data as an HTML table,
and deletes the database table.
If you commit your changes and push, you see the HTML table in your built app.

##### Merge your changes

You added the database to the `dev` environment.
To have a database in your production environment, merge your changes.

```bash
platform merge dev
```

Now your production branch has its own database.

##### Data inheritance

Data is inherited from parent environments, but not from child environments.
So when you branch an environment (or later sync it), it copies data from its parent.
But when you merge an environment, its data isn't automatically copied into its parent.

This allows you to test your setup with production data so you can be sure changes work in production.
At the same time, your testing has no effect on the production data so you don't have to worry about issues there.

###### Data in child environments

To see how the data in child environments is separate, follow these steps:

1. Add a table to your `dev` database:

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment dev 'CREATE TABLE child_data (a int); INSERT INTO child_data(a) VALUES (1), (2), (3);'
   ```

2. See the data in the `dev` database:

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment dev 'SELECT * FROM child_data'
   ```

   You get a table with a single column and 3 numbers.

3. Merge the environment:

   ```bash
   platform merge
   ```

4. Check the data in the production environment:

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment main 'SELECT * FROM child_data'
   ```

You get an error message that the table doesn't exist.

###### Data in parent environments

To see how the data in parent environments can be inherited, follow these steps:

1. Add a table to your production database:

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment main 'CREATE TABLE parent_data (a int); INSERT INTO parent_data(a) VALUES (1), (2), (3);'
   ```

2. See the data in the production database:

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment main 'SELECT * FROM parent_data'
   ```

   You get a table with a single column and 3 numbers.

3. Sync the data from your `dev` environment (this means copy the data from production):

   ```bash
   platform sync data --environment dev
   ```

4. Check the data in the preview environment

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment dev 'SELECT * FROM parent_data'
   ```

   You see the same table as in step 2.

So you can test your changes with confidence in your preview environments, knowing they work in production.
But you don't have to worry about your tests affecting your production data.

##### What's next

You've got your app up and running and connected it to a service with data.
Great job!

You can end there if you want or continue to monitor your app.


### Git log

Once your app is up and running, you want to monitor it to make sure it stays that way.
Take advantage of the observability of apps running on Upsun Fixed to see everything that's happening.

##### Check activities

All events that change your environments are logged as activities.
See a list of all activities by running the following command:

```bash
platform activities
```

You get a table with all activities that have run or are running.
The most recent one at the top of the table is probably your merge of the `dev` branch into `main`.

To see all the details of that activity, copy its `ID` from the table.
Then use the ID in place of `<ID>` in the following command:

```bash
platform activity:get <ID>
```

This returns the build log from the merge activity.
This way, you can keep track of everything that happens in your project.

##### View logs

Another way to keep track of your project and troubleshoot any issues is to view its logs.
Different types of logs are available, such as error logs and any logs your app creates.

To see the access log, a list of all attempts to access your website, run the following command:

```bash
platform log access
```

If you visited your site to test it, you see your visit here.
Otherwise, get its URL by running this command:

```bash
platform environment:url
```

Open the website in a browser and then run `platform log access` again.
You now see your visit.

For an interactive prompt with all available logs, run `platform log`.

##### Monitor metrics

In addition to keeping track of events, you might want to see how your infrastructure responds to these events.
For that, your project offers infrastructure metrics where you can see your CPU, RAM, and disk usage.

These metrics are available in the Upsun Fixed Console,
which is a web interface that offers similar options for interacting with your project as the CLI.

Open the Console by running this command:

```bash
platform web
```

This opens your project in the current environment.
You can change environments using the `--environment` flag.

You see information about your project as well as a list of activities,
which should be the same as what you saw by running `platform activities`.

To see metrics, open the **Metrics** tab.
You see your CPU, RAM, and disk usage over the past 15 minutes, with options for changing the time frame.

![Sample metrics you might see for an app](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/all-grid.png)

Now you know where to go to get information on your app's performance.
Activities, logs, and metrics are useful for keeping track of changes and investigating issues.

But to stay on top of everything, you want to be notified wherever you are.
Continue to find out how.

### Git status

In addition to being able to react to issues by actively monitoring,
sometimes you want to get notifications when your project status has changed.
You can get notifications on your project health
and also activity notifications whenever an event happens in your project.

##### Get health notifications

Health notifications tell you when something in your project needs attention.
At present, the only notification is a low-disk warning when your project is running out of disk space.

This notification is automatically sent to all project admins.
See this notification by running this command:

```bash
platform integration:list
```

You see a table similar to the following example:

```bash
+---------------+--------------+-------------+
| ID            | Type         | Summary     |
+---------------+--------------+-------------+
| abcdefg123456 | health.email | To: #admins |
+---------------+--------------+-------------+
```

Assuming you want to keep admins notified, you can add another recipient with a command like the following:

```bash
platform integration:update <INTEGRATION_ID> --recipients '#admins' --recipients <ADDITIONAL_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
```

So to add `jane@example.com` to the above integration, you'd run the following:

```bash
platform integration:update abcdefg123456 --recipients '#admins' --recipients jane@example.com
```

And get the following in response:

```bash
Integration abcdefg123456 (health.email) updated

+--------------+--------------------+
| Property     | Value              |
+--------------+--------------------+
| id           | abcdefg123456      |
| type         | health.email       |
| role         |                    |
| from_address |                    |
| recipients   | - '#admins'        |
|              | - jane@example.com |
+--------------+--------------------+
```

Now you can be sure you and Jane are notified whenever your app is running low on disk space.
You can also set this up to be notified in Slack, PagerDuty, or anywhere that accepts a webhook.

For now, focus on getting notified about activities.

##### Get activity notifications

Webhooks enable you to monitor events as they happen.
Upsun Fixed sends information about activities in your project to the URL you specify.

Say you want to get a notification any time your `main` environment gets new code or is redeployed.
To see such a notification in action, follow these steps:

1. Open [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/) in a browser.
2. Copy the URL from the body of the page.
   Note this is not the one from the address bar with `#` in it.
3. In a terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   platform integration:add --type=webhook --url <WEBHOOK_URL> --events 'environment.push,environment.redeploy' --environments 'main' --excluded-environments '' --states complete --shared-key=null
   ```

   The last three flags are all the default options.
   You could also leave them out and just accept the defaults when the CLI prompts you.
4. Redeploy your main environment by running this command:

   ```bash
   platform environment:redeploy --environment main
   ```

5. After the activity has finished, see the JSON payload at the `webhook.site` page.
   You can use its values to trigger anything you wish, including human-readable notifications elsewhere.

You can also run the redeploy command for the `dev` environment and verify that it doesn't send anything.

##### What's next

Your Upsun Fixed project is now up and running and you can keep track of it!
That's a great start to working with Upsun Fixed.

## Learn
### Philosophy

Upsun Fixed aims at reducing configuration and making developers more productive.
It abstracts your project infrastructure and manages it for you,
so you never have to configure services like a web server, a MySQL database, or a Redis cache from scratch again.

Upsun Fixed is built on one main idea — your server infrastructure is part of your app,
so it should be version controlled along with your app.

Every branch you push to your Git repository can come with bug fixes,
new features, **and** infrastructure changes.
You can then test everything as an independent deployment,
including your application code and all of your services with a copy of their data
(database entries, search index, user files, etc.).

This allows you to preview exactly what your site would look like if you merged your changes to production.

##### The basics

On Upsun Fixed, a **project** is linked to a Git repository and is composed of one or more **apps**.
An app is a directory in your Git repository with a specific Upsun Fixed configuration
and dedicated HTTP endpoints (via the `.platform.app.yaml` file).

Projects are deployed in **environments**.
An environment is a standalone copy of your live app which can be used for testing,
Q&A, implementing new features, fixing bugs, and so on.

Every project you deploy on Upsun Fixed is built as a *virtual cluster* containing a series of containers.
The main branch of your Git repository is always deployed as a production cluster.
Any other branch can be deployed as a staging or development cluster.

There are three types of containers within your cluster,
all configured by files stored alongside your code:

- The [*router*](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md), configured in `.platform/routes.yaml`,
  is a single Nginx process responsible for mapping incoming requests to an app container,
  and for optionally providing HTTP caching.

- One or more [*apps*](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md), configured via `.platform.app.yaml` files, holding the code of your project.

- Some optional [*services*](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), configured in `.platform/services.yaml`,
  like MySQL/MariaDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, or RabbitMQ.
  They come as optimized pre-built images.

##### The workflow

Every time you deploy a branch to Upsun Fixed, the code is *built* and then *deployed* on a new cluster.

The [**build** process](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#build-steps) looks through the configuration files in your repository
and assembles the necessary containers.

The [**deploy** process](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#deploy-steps) makes those containers live, replacing the previous
versions, with no service downtime.

Depending on your needs, you can also [set up a **post-deploy** hook](#add-a-post-deploy-hook) to run after your app is deployed and your application container starts accepting traffic.
Adding a [`post-deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook) can be useful to run updates that don't require exclusive database access.

Note that if you're using [Gatsby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/headless.md) to pull from a backend container on the same environment,
you need a `post-deploy` hook to successfully build and deploy your app.

###### How your app is built

During the [build step](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#build-steps),
dependencies specified in `.platform.app.yaml` are installed on application containers.

You can also customize the build step by providing a [`build` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook) composed of one or more shell commands
that help create your production codebase.
That could be compiling TypeScript files, running some scripts,
rearranging files on disk, or whatever else you want.

Note that at this point all you have access to is the filesystem;
there are **no services or other databases available**.
Your live website is unaffected.

Once the build step is completed, the filesystem is frozen and a read-only container image is created.
That filesystem is the final build artifact.

###### How your app is deployed

Before starting the [deployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#deploy-steps) of your app,
Upsun Fixed pauses all incoming requests and holds them to avoid downtime.

Then, the current containers are stopped and the new ones are started.
Upsun Fixed then opens networking connections between the various containers,
as specified in the configuration files.
The connection information for each service is available from the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md).

Similar to the build step, you can define a [deploy hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook) to prepare your app.
Your app has complete access to all services, but the filesystem where your code lives is now read-only.

Finally, Upsun Fixed opens the floodgates and lets incoming requests through your newly deployed app.

###### Add a post-deploy hook

You can add a [`post-deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook) to be run after the build and deploy steps.

Similar to the [`deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook),
the `post-deploy` hook only runs once your application container accepts requests.
So you can use it to run updates such as content imports or cache warmups that can be executed simultaneously with normal traffic.

During a redeploy, the `post-deploy` hook is the only hook that is run.

##### Get support

If you're facing an issue with Upsun Fixed,
open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### What's next?

To get a feeling of what working with Upsun Fixed entails,
see the [Get Started](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/get-started.md) framework guides.
### YAML

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human-readable format for data serialization across languages.
This means it's a good fit for human-edited configuration files, like those at Upsun Fixed.
You can control nearly all aspects of your project's build and deploy pipeline with YAML files.

Learn what YAML is or, if you're already familiar, what custom tags Upsun Fixed offers.
#### What YAML is

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human-readable format for data serialization.
This means it can be used for structured data, like what you can find in configuration files.

Some basic rules about YAML files:

- YAML files end in `.yaml`.
  Some other systems use the alternative `.yml` extension.
- YAML is case-sensitive.
- YAML is whitespace-sensitive and indentation defines the structure,
  but it doesn't accept tabs for indentation.
- Empty lines are ignored.
- Comments are preceded by an octothorpe `#`.

###### Data types

YAML represents data through three primitive data structures:

- Scalars (strings/numbers/booleans)
- Mappings (dictionaries/objects)
- Sequences (arrays/lists)

####### Scalars (strings/numbers/booleans)

The most straightforward data structure involves defining key–value pairs where the values are strings or integers.

So you could have a basic configuration for an app:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: "golang:1.18"
disk: 1024
```

This results in three key–value pairs:

| Key                 | Value               |
| ------------------- |-------------------- |
| name                | app                 |
| type                | golang:1.18         |
| disk                | 1024                |

You can define strings either with or without quotes, which can be single `'` or double `"`.
Quotes let you escape characters (if double) and make sure the value is parsed as a string when you want it.

For example, you might be representing version numbers and want to parse them as strings.
If you use `version: 1.10`, it's parsed as an integer and so is treated the same as `1.1`.
If you use `version: "1.10"`, it's parsed as a string and isn't treated as the same as `1.1`.

####### Mappings (dictionaries/objects)

In addition to basic scalar values, each key can also represent a set of other key–value pairs.
So you can define entire dictionaries of pairs.

The structure of the mapping is determined by the indentation.
So children are indented more than parents and siblings have the same amount of indentation.
The exact number of spaces in the indentation isn't important, just the level relative to the rest of the map.

In contrast, when you define mappings, the order doesn't matter.

So you could expand the configuration from before to add another mapping:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: "golang:1.18"
disk: 1024

web:
  commands:
    start: ./bin/app
  locations:
    '/':
      passthru: true
      allow: false
```

This creates a `web` dictionary that has two dictionaries within it: `commands` and `locations`,
each with their own mappings:

- `web` → `commands` → `start: ./bin/app`
- `web` → `locations` → `'/'` → `passthru: true` and `allow: false`

####### Sequences (arrays/lists)

In addition to maps defining further key–value pairs, you can also use sequences to include lists of information.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      index:
        - index.html
        - index.htm
      passthru: true
      allow: false
```

You can also define sequences using a flow syntax:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      index: [index.html, index.htm]
      passthru: true
      allow: false
```

In either case, you get a list of values within `index`:

`web` → `locations` → `'/'` → `index` → `index.html` and `index.htm`

###### Define multi-line strings

If you have a long string that spans multiple lines, use a pipe `|` to preserve line breaks.
The new lines need to have at least the same indentation as the first
(you can add more indentation that's then preserved).

So you could add a multi-line string to a `build` key in the `hooks` map:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    cp a.txt b.txt
```

And the resulting value preserves the line break.
This lets you do things like enter small shell scripts within a YAML file.

`hooks` → `build` → `set -e` and `cp a.txt b.txt`

###### Reuse content

YAML supports internal named references, known as anchors, which can be referenced using an alias.
This allows you to reuse YAML blocks in multiple places within a single file.

Define an anchor by adding `&<NAME>` to the start of a value, where `<NAME>` is a unique identifier.
The anchor represents this entire value.
Then refer to the anchor using `*<NAME>`.

The following example shows 4 different workers:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue1: &runner
    size: S
    commands:
      start: python queue-worker.py
  queue2: *runner
  queue3:
    <<: *runner
    size: M
  queue4:
    <<: *runner
    disk: 512
```

- `queue1` and `queue2` are identical with the same `size` and `commands` properties.
- `queue3` is the same as `queue1` except that it has a different value for `size`.
- `queue4` is the same as `queue1` except that it has the `disk` property.

Note that you need to place an alias with `<<:` at the same level as the other keys within that value.

#### Upsun Fixed YAML structure

In addition to the [basic functions you should be familiar with](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml/what-is-yaml.md), YAML structure is important.
Upsun Fixed accepts a certain structure for YAML configuration files.

When you run the `platform project:init` command, three default YAML configuration files are generated in the `.platform` folder and at the root of your source code. They contain the minimum default configuration based on your detected local stack.
These YAML files are a good starting point before customization.

```bash
.
├── .platform
|   ├── routes.yaml
|   └── services.yaml
├── .platform.app.yaml
└── 
```

These three YAML files configure the following:
- ``routes.yaml``: this file contains all of your [routes definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md)
- ``services.yaml``: this file contains the list of your [services definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)
- ``.platform.app.yaml``: this file contains your [application definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md)

###### Examples

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}

# Complete list of all available properties

# A unique name for the app. Must be lowercase alphanumeric characters.
# Changing the name destroys data associated with the app.
name: "myapp"

# The runtime the application uses.

# Complete list of available runtimes
type: "php:8.2"
...
```

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.
# Full list of available services

mariadb:
  # All available versions are: 10.6, 10.5, 10.4, 10.3
  type: mariadb:10.6
```

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.
# More information

"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"

# A basic redirect definition
# More information

"https://www.{default}":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://{default}/"
```

In these files, you can use any of the [available YAML tags](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml/platform-yaml-tags.md) you need.

###### Multi-app
In a [multiple application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) context, you can also group all of your app configurations in a global ``.platform/applications.yaml`` file.
This file contains a list of app configurations, such as:
```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
app1:
  type: php:8.3
  source:
    root: app1

app2:
  type: nodejs:20
  source:
    root: app2
```

#### Upsun Fixed YAML tags

In addition to the [basic functions you should be familiar with](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml/what-is-yaml.md), YAML allows for special tags.
Upsun Fixed accepts certain custom tags to facilitate working with configuration files.

These tags work with Upsun Fixed configuration files, but may not elsewhere.

###### Include

Use the `!include` tag to embed external files within a given YAML file.

The tag requires two properties:

| Property | Type     | Possible values               | Description                                                                                             |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`   | `string` | `string`, `binary`, or `yaml` | See the descriptions of [strings](#string), [binaries](#binary), and [YAML](#yaml). Defaults to `yaml`. |
| `path`   | `string` |                               | The path to the file to include, relative to the application directory or `source.root` if defined.     |

By default, `path` is relative to the current application's directory (what you would define with `source.root`).

For example, to include another ``.platform/app1.yaml`` file in the main `.platform/applications.yaml`, follow these steps:

1. Write and save your ``.platform/app1.yaml`` file:

```yaml  {location=".platform/app1.yaml"}
source:
  root: "/"
type: "nodejs:20"
web:
  commands:
    start: "node index.js"
upstream:
  socket_family: tcp
locations:
  "/":
    passthru: true
```

And including it:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp: !include
  type: yaml
  path: ./app1.yaml
# or as default type is "yaml", it could be:
#api: !include ./app1.yaml
```

You can also include files from a directory that is parent to the folder.

For example, for the following project structure:

```bash
.
├── .platform
|   └── applications.yaml
├── backend
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── scripts
│       ├── ...
│       └── common_build.sh
└── frontend
    ├── README.md
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── public
    ├── scripts
    │   └── clean.sh
    └── src
```

This configuration is valid:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
frontend:
  source:
    root: frontend
  # ...
  hooks:
    build: !include
      type: string
      path: ../backend/scripts/common_build.sh
```

**Note**: 

Upsun Fixed will execute this ``../backend/scripts/common_build.sh`` script using [Dash](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dash).

####### `string`

Use `string` to include an external file inline in the YAML file as if entered as a multi-line string.

For example, if you have a build hook like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
frontend:
  hooks:
    build: |
      set -e
      cp a.txt b.txt
```

You could create a file for the script:

```text  {location="build.sh"}
set -e
cp a.txt b.txt
```

And replace the hook with an include tag for an identical result:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
frontend:
  hooks:
    build: !include
      type: string
      path: build.sh
```

This helps you break longer configuration like build scripts out into a separate file for easier maintenance.

####### `binary`

Use `binary` to include an external binary file inline in the YAML file.
The file is base64 encoded.

For example, you could include a `favicon.ico` file in the same folder as your app configuration.
Then you can include it as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
properties:
  favicon: !include
    type: binary
    path: favicon.ico
```

####### `yaml`

Use `yaml` to include an external YAML file inline as if entered directly.
Because `yaml` is the default, you can use it without specifying the type.

For example, you could have your configuration for works defined in a `worker.yaml` file:

```yaml  {location="worker.yaml"}
size: S
commands:
  start: python queue-worker.py
variables:
  env:
    type: worker
```

Then the following three configurations are exactly equivalent:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue1: !include "worker.yaml"
```

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue1: !include
    type: yaml
    path: 'worker.yaml'
```

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue1:
    size: S
    commands:
      start: python queue-worker.py
    variables:
      env:
        type: worker
```

This can help simplify more complex files.

###### Archive

Use the `!archive` tag for a reference to an entire directory specified relative to where the YAML file is.

For example, you might want to define a configuration directory for your [Solr service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md).
You might do so as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mysearch:
  type: solr:8.0
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    conf_dir: !archive "solr/conf"
```

The `!archive` tag means that the value for `conf_dir` isn't the string `solr/conf` but the entire `solr/conf` directory.
This directory is in the `.platform` directory, since that's where the `.platform/services.yaml` file is.
The `solr/conf` directory is then copied into the Upsun Fixed management system to use with the service.
### Structure

**Note**: 

This page describes how things work on Grid projects.

For Dedicated Gen 2 projects, read about how [Dedicated Gen 2 projects are structured](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md).

Each environment you deploy on Upsun Fixed is built as a set of containers.
Each container is an isolated instance with specific resources.

Each environment has 2 to 4 types of containers:

- One [*router*](#router) (configured in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file)
- One or more [*app* containers](#apps) (configured in `.platform.app.yaml` files)
- Zero or more [*service* containers](#services) (configured in a `.platform/services.yaml` file)
- Zero or more [*worker* containers](#workers) (configured in the files for apps)

If you have two app containers, two services (a database and a search engine), and a worker,
requests to your environment might look something like this:

![A user request goes to the router, which sends it to either a Node.js app or a Python app. Each app communicates separately with the database and search services and sends responses to the user. The Node.js app triggers actions in a worker, which communicates separately with the database.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/config-diagrams/structure-diagram.png)

If you have only one app container, your repository might look like this:

```text
project
├── .git
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── .platform.app.yaml
└── <YOUR_APP_FILES>
```

##### Router

Each environment always has exactly one router.

This router maps incoming requests to the appropriate app container
and provides basic caching of responses, unless configured otherwise.

The router is configured in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
If you don't include configuration, a single [default route is deployed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md#default-route-definition).

Read more about how to [define routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

##### Apps

You always need at least one app container, but you can have more.

App containers run the code you provide via your Git repository.
They handle requests from the outside world and can communicate with other containers within the environment.
Each app container is built from a specific language image with a given version for the language.

To configure your apps, you usually create one `.platform.app.yaml` file for each app container.
A basic app generally has only one such file placed in the repository root.

Read more about how to [configure apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).

##### Services

You don't need any service containers, but you can add them as you like.

Service containers run predefined code for specific purposes, such as a database or search service.
You don't need to add their code yourself, just set up how your apps communicate with them.

Service containers are configured by the `.platform/services.yaml` file.

Read more about how to [add services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).

##### Workers

You don't need any worker containers, but you can add them as you like.

Worker containers are copies of an app containers
that have no access to the outside world and can have a different start command.
They're useful for continually running background processes.

Read more about how to [work with workers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/workers.md).
### Build and deploy

Each time you push a change to your app through Git or activate an [environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments.md),
your app goes through a process to be built and deployed.
If your app is redeployed with no changes to its codebase, the output of the previous build and deploy process is reused.

The build process looks through the configuration files in your repository and assembles the necessary containers.
The deploy process makes those containers live, replacing any previous versions, with minimal interruption in service.

![The steps in the build and deploy process](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/workflow/build-pipeline.svg "0.50")

Hooks are points in the build and deploy process where you can inject a custom script.

##### The build

The outcome of the build process is designed to be repeatable and reusable.
Each app in a project is built separately.

Container configuration depends exclusively on your configuration files.
So each container is tied to a specific Git commit.
If there are no new changes for a given container, the existing container can be reused.
This saves you the time the build step would take.

This means the build is independent of the given environment and preview environments are perfect copies of production.
If you use environment variables to set up different build configuration options for different environments,
your build step isn't reused and your preview environments may differ from production.

You can't connect to services (like databases) during the build step.
Once the app has gone through all of the build steps, it can connect to services in the deploy process.

###### Build steps

1. **Validate configuration**:
   The configuration is checked by validating the `.platform` directory and scanning the repository for any app configurations to validate individually.
2. **Pull container images**:
   Any container images that have been built before and that don't have any changes are pulled to be reused.
3. **Install dependencies**:
   If you have specified additional global dependencies, they're downloaded during this step.
   This is useful for commands you may need in the build hook.
4. **Run build flavor commands**:
   For some languages (NodeJS, PHP), a series of standard commands are run based on the build flavor.
   You can change the flavor or skip the commands by specifying it in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.
5. **Run build hook**:
   The `build` hook comprises one or more shell commands that you write to finish creating your production code base: for example, compiling Sass files, running a bundler, rearranging files on disk, or compiling.
   The committed build hook runs in the build container.
   During this time, commands have write access to the file system, but there aren't connections to other containers (services and other apps).

   For automated builds, you can use the [`CI` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) in build scripts and tooling to modify build behavior (for example, to disable attempts to connect to other containers during the build phase, or to disable interactivity). These modifications can help to prevent build failures. 
   You can also manually [cancel deployments stuck on the build hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/cancel-activity.md).

6. **Freeze app container**:
   The file system is frozen and produces a read-only container image, which is the final build artifact.

##### The deploy

The deploy process connects each container from the build process and any services.
The connections are defined in your app and services configuration.

So unlike the build process, you can now access other containers,
but the file system is read-only.

###### Deploy steps

1. **Hold requests**:
   Incoming [idempotent requests](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml) (like `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` but **not** `POST`, `PATCH` etc.) are held.
1. **Unmount current containers**:
   Any previous containers are disconnected from their file system mounts.
1. **Mount file systems**:
   The file system is connected to the new containers.
   New branches have file systems cloned from their parent.
1. **Expose services**:
   Networking connections are opened between any containers specified in your app and services configurations.
1. **Run (pre-) start commands**:
   The [commands](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web-commands) necessary to start your app are run.
   Often this stage will only include a start command, which is restarted if ever terminated going forward.
   You may also, however, define a `pre_start` command, when you need to run _per-instance_ actions.
   In this case, as you might expect, the `pre_start` command is run, then the `start` command.
1. **Run deploy hook**:
   The `deploy` hook is any number of shell commands you can run to finish your deployment.
   This can include clearing caches, running database migrations, and setting configuration that requires relationship information.
1. **Serve requests**:
  Incoming requests to your newly deployed application are allowed.

After the deploy process is over, any commands in your `post_deploy` hook are run.

##### Deployment types

Upsun Fixed supports two deployment types - automatic and manual. These types help to provide control over when changes are applied to development, staging and production environments.

###### Automatic deployment (default)

This is the default behavior for all environments. With automatic deployment, changes like code pushes and variable updates are deployed immediately.

###### Manual deployment

When enabled, manual deployment lets you control when deployments happen. This means that changes will be staged but not deployed until explicitly triggered by the user. This type of deployment is ideal for teams that want to bundle multiple changes and deploy them together in a controlled manner.

When manual deployment is enabled in an environment, the following actions are queued until deployment is triggered:

| Category             | Staged Activities |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **Code**             | `environment.push`, `environment.merge`, `environment.merge-pr` |
| **Variables**        | `environment.variable.create`, `update`, `delete` |
| **Resources**        | `environment.resources.update` |
| **Domains & Routes** | `environment.domain.*`, `environment.route.*` |
| **Subscription**     | `environment.subscription.update `|
| **Environment Settings** | `environment.update.http_access`, `smtp`, `restrict_robots` |

**Note**: 

Manual deployment is available for **development**, **staging** and **production** environments.

###### Change deployment type

You can adjust deployment behavior in your environment. 

The output should look similar to the example below:

```bash {}
Selected project: [my-project (ID)]
Selected environment: main (type: production)
Deployment type: manual
```

For more information about how this command works, use:

```bash {}
platform environment:deploy:type --help
```

To switch to manual, navigate to the environment settings in the Console and select the manual deployments option.

###### Trigger deployment manually

Once manual deployment is enabled, eligible changes are staged. You can deploy them in the following ways:

The output should look similar to the example below:

```bash {}
Deploying staged changes:
+---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| ID            | Created                   | Description                                               | Result  |
+---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| 5uh3xwmkh5boq | 2024-11-22T14:01:10+00:00 | Patrick pushed to main                                    | failure |
| fno2qiodq7e3c | 2024-11-22T13:06:18+00:00 | Arseni updated resource allocation on main                | success |
| xzvcazrtoafeu | 2024-11-22T13:01:10+00:00 | Pilar added variable HELLO_WORLD to main                  | success |
| fq73u53ruwloq | 2024-11-22T12:06:17+00:00 | Pilar pushed to main                                      | success |
+---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

In the Console, a deploy button will be visible in the environment whenever changes are staged. Click this button to deploy your staged changes.Trigger the deployment of staged changes with the following:

```bash {}
POST /projects/{projectId}/environments/{environmentId}/deploy
```

**Note**: 

As soon as your deployment type is switched from manual to automatic, all currently staged changes are deployed immediately and the environment resumes its default automatic deployment behavior.

##### Deployment philosophy

Upsun Fixed values consistency over availability, acknowledging that it's nearly impossible to have both.
During a deployment, the [deploy hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook) may make database changes
that are incompatible with the previous code version.
Having both old and new code running in parallel on different servers could therefore result in data loss.

Upsun Fixed believes that a minute of planned downtime for authenticated users is preferable to a risk of race conditions
resulting in data corruption, especially with a CDN continuing to serve anonymous traffic uninterrupted.

That brief downtime applies only to the environment changes are being pushed to.
Deployments to a staging or development branch have no impact on the production environment and cause no downtime.

### Automate your code updates

Upsun Fixed allows you to update your dependencies through [source operations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md).

##### Before you start

You need:

- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)
- An [API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token)

##### 1. Define a source operation to update your dependencies

To facilitate updating your dependencies in your project,
define a source operation in your `.platform.app.yaml` file
depending on your dependency manager:

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    update:
      command: |
        set -e
        composer update
        git add composer.lock
        git add -A
        git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit --allow-empty -m "Update Composer dependencies"        
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    update:
      command: |
        set -e
        npm update
        git add package.json package-lock.json
        git add -A
        git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit --allow-empty -m "Update npm dependencies"        
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    update:
      command: |
        set -e
        yarn upgrade
        git add yarn.lock
        git add -A
        git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit --allow-empty -m "Update yarn dependencies"        
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    update:
      command: |
        set -e
        go get -u
        go mod tidy
        git add go.mod go.sum
        git add -A
        git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit --allow-empty -m "Update Go dependencies"        
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    update:
      command: |
        set -e
        pipenv update
        git add Pipfile Pipfile.lock
        git add -A
        git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit --allow-empty -m "Update Python dependencies"        
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    update:
      command: |
        set -e
        bundle update --all
        git add Gemfile Gemfile.lock
        git add -A
        git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit --allow-empty -m "Update Ruby dependencies"        
```

##### 2. Automate your dependency updates with a cron job

After you've defined a source operation to [update your dependencies on your project](#1-define-a-source-operation-to-update-your-dependencies),
you can automate it using a cron job.

Note that it’s best not to run source operations on your production environment,
but rather on a dedicated environment where you can test changes.

Make sure you have the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) installed
and [an API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token)
so you can run a cron job in your app container.

1. Set your API token as a top-level environment variable:

 - Open the environment where you want to add the variable.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Variables**.
 - Click **+ Add variable**.
 - In the **Variable name** field, enter ``env:PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN``.
 - In the **Value** field, enter your API token.
 - Make sure the **Available at runtime** and **Sensitive variable** options are selected.
 - Click **Add variable**.

**Note**: 

Once you add the API token as an environment variable,
anyone with [SSH access](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md) can read its value.
Make sure you carefully check your [user access on this project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#manage-project-users).

2. Add a build hook to your app configuration to install the CLI as part of the build process:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    hooks:
      build: |
        set -e
        echo "Installing Upsun Fixed CLI"
        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/cli/main/installer.sh | bash

        echo "Testing Upsun Fixed CLI"
        platform
    ```

3. Then, to configure a cron job to automatically update your dependencies once a day,
   use a configuration similar to the following:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    crons:
      update:
        # Run the code below every day at midnight.
        spec: '0 0 * * *'
        commands:
          start: |
            set -e
            platform sync -e development code data --no-wait --yes
            platform source-operation:run update --no-wait --yes
    ```

The example above synchronizes the `development` environment with its parent
and then runs the `update` source operation defined [previously](#1-define-a-source-operation-to-update-your-dependencies).

**Note**: 

If you have enabled a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md), and have enabled ``--fetch-branches`` on that
integration, merging on Upsun Fixed is not possible. Therefore, the ``sync`` command in the example above would
fail.

##### 3. Configure notifications about dependency updates

To get notified every time a source operation is triggered and therefore every time a dependency is updated,
you can configure activity scripts or webhooks.

###### Notifications through an activity script

After you've defined a source operation to [update your dependencies on your project](#1-define-a-source-operation-to-update-your-dependencies),
you can configure an activity script
to receive notifications every time a dependency update is triggered.

**Example**: 

You want to get notified of every dependency update
through a message posted on a Slack channel.
To do so, follow these steps:

 - In your Slack administrative interface, [create a new Slack webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
You get a URL starting with ``https://hooks.slack.com/``.

 - Replace ``SLACK_URL`` in the following ``.js`` script with your webhook URL.

 - Add the following code to a ``.js`` file:

```javascript {}
/**
 * Sends a color-coded formatted message to Slack.
 *
 * To control what events trigger it, use the --events switch in
 * the Upsun Fixed CLI.
 *
 * Replace SLACK_URL in the following script with your Slack webhook URL.
 * Get one here: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
 * You should get something like: const url = 'https://hooks.slack.com/...';
 *
 * activity.text: a brief, one-line statement of what happened.
 * activity.log: the complete build and deploy log output, as it would be seen in the Console log screen.
 */
function sendSlackMessage(title, message) {
  const url = 'SLACK_URL';
  const messageTitle = title;
  const color = activity.result === "success" ? "#66c000" : "#ff0000";
  const body = {
    attachments: [
      {
        title: messageTitle,
        text: message,
        color: color,
      },
    ],
  };
  const resp = fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  });
  if (!resp.ok) {
    console.log("Sending slack message failed: " + resp.body.text());
  }
}
sendSlackMessage(activity.text, activity.log);
```

 - Run the following [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) command:

```bash {}
platform integration:add --type script --file ./my_script.js --events=environment.source-operation
```

Optional: to only get notifications about specific environments,
add the following flag to the command: ``--environments=your_environment_name``.

Anytime a dependency is updated via a source operation,
the activity script now reports it to Slack.

###### Notifications through a webhook

After you've defined a source operation to [update your dependencies on your project](#1-define-a-source-operation-to-update-your-dependencies),
you can configure a webhook to receive notifications every time a dependency update is triggered.

[Webhooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/webhooks.md) allow you to host a script yourself externally.
This script receives the same payload as an activity script and responds to the same events,
but can be hosted on your own server and in your own language.

To configure the integration between your webhook and your source operation,
run the following [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) command:

```bash
platform integration:add --type=webhook --url=URL_TO_RECEIVE_JSON --events=environment.source-operation
```

Optional: to only get notifications about specific environments,
add the following flag to the command: `--environments=your_environment_name`.

To test the integration and the JSON response,
you can generate a URL from a service such as [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
and use the generated URL as `URL_TO_RECEIVE_JSON`.
This URL then receives the JSON response when a source operation is triggered.

Anytime a dependency is updated via a source operation,
the webhook now receives a POST message.
This POST message contains complete information about the entire state of the project at that time.
### Restrict access to a service

Upsun Fixed allows you to restrict access to a service.

In this tutorial, learn how to grant your Data team `read-only` access to your production database.

##### Before you start

You need:

- A project with a database service
- A `viewer` user on your project

##### 1. Add a read-only endpoint to your database service

Edit your `.platform/services.yaml` file and add the following [endpoints](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/_index.md#define-permissions):

- `website` with `admin` access to the `main` database
- `reporting` with read-only `ro` access to the `main` database

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
maindb:
  type: mariadb:10.5
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    schemas:
      - main
    endpoints:
      website:
        default_schema: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
      reporting:
        privileges:
          main: ro
```

##### 2. Grant your app access to the new endpoints

Edit your app configuration and add new relationships to your new endpoints:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  database:
    service: maindb
    endpoint: website
  reports:
    service: maindb
    endpoint: reporting
```

##### 3. Create a worker with access to the read-only endpoint

Edit your app configuration to add a new worker which:

- Does nothing (`sleep infinity`)
- Can access the read-only `reporting` endpoint
- Allows SSH access to `viewer`

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  data_access:
    size: S
    disk: 128
    mounts: {}
    commands:
      start: |
        sleep infinity
    relationships:
      reports:
        service: maindb
        endpoint: reporting
    access:
      ssh: viewer
```

You're done!
From now on, your `viewer` users can SSH in to the worker application,
and connect to your database with read-only permissions.
### Converting to Upsun Fixed

If you already have an app running somewhere else, you want to convert it to Upsun Fixed and deploy it.
To do so, follow these steps.

##### Before you begin

You need:

 - An app that works and is ready to be built
 - Code in Git
 - A Upsun Fixed account – if you don’t already have one, [start a trial](https://auth.upsun.com/register)
 - The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) installed locally

##### 1. Export from previous system

Start by exporting everything you might need from your current app.
This includes data in databases, files on a file system,
and for some apps, such as Drupal, configuration that you need to export from the system into files.

##### 2. Create a project

When prompted, fill in details like the project name, [region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md), and [plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
[Create a new project from scratch](https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/info?_utm_campaign=cta_deploy_marketplace_template&utm_source=public_documentation&_utm_medium=organic).
In the form, fill in details like the project name and [region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md).
The project is automatically created with a [Development plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md),
which you can then upgrade.

##### 3. Add configuration

The exact configuration you want depends on your app.
You likely want to configure three areas:

- [The app itself](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md) -- this is the only required configuration
- [Services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)
- [Routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md)

You can also take guidance from the [project templates](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/templates.md),
which are starting points for various technology stacks with working configuration examples.

When you've added your configuration, make sure to commit it to Git.

##### 4. Push your code

The way to push your code to Upsun Fixed depends on
whether you're hosting your code with a third-party service using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md).
If you aren't, your repository is hosted in Upsun Fixed
and you can use the CLI or just Git itself.

 - Add Upsun Fixed as a remote repository by running the following command:

```bash {}
platform project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
```

 - Push to the Upsun Fixed repository by running the following command:

```bash {}
platform push
```

When you try to push, any detected errors in your configuration are reported and block the push.
After any errors are fixed, a push creates a new environment.
Set up the integration for your selected service:

 - [Bitbucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Then push code to that service as you do normally.
Pushing to a branch creates an environment from that branch.
Note that the source integration doesn’t report any errors in configuration directly.
You have to monitor those in your project activities.

 - Add an [SSH key](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/ssh-keys.md).
 - In the Console, open your project and click **Code **.
 - Click **Git**.
 - From the displayed command, copy the location of your repository.
It should have a format similar to the following:

```text {}
abcdefgh1234567@git.eu.platform.sh:abcdefgh1234567.git
```

 - Add Upsun Fixed as a remote repository by running the following command:

```bash {}
git remote add platform <REPOSITORY_LOCATION>
```

 - Push to the Upsun Fixed repository by running the following command:

```bash {}
git push -u platform <DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME>
```

When you try to push, any detected errors in your configuration are reported and block the push.
After any errors are fixed, a push creates a new environment.

##### 5. Import data

Once you have an environment, you can import the data you backed up in step 1.
The exact process may depend on the service you use.

For SQL databases, for example, you can use a version of this command:

```bash
platform sql < <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>
```

For any potential more details, see the [specific service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).

##### 6. Import files

Your app may include content files, meaning files that aren't intended to be part of your codebase so aren't in Git.
You can upload such files to [mounts you created](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).
Upload to each mount separately.

Suppose for instance you have the following file mounts defined:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  'web/uploads':
    source: local
    source_path: uploads
  'private':
    source: local
    source_path: private
```

Upload to each of directories above by running the following commands:

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount web/uploads --source ./uploads
platform mount:upload --mount private --source ./private
```

You can adjust these commands for your own case.
Or upload to your mounts using a different [SSH method](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/file-transfer.md#transfer-files-using-an-ssh-client).

##### Optional: Add variables

If your app requires environment variables to build properly, [add them to your environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md).

##### What's next

Now that your app is ready to be deployed, you can do more:

 - Upgrade from a Development plan.

- [Add a domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
- Set up for [local development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local.md).
- Configure [health notifications](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/notifications.md).

 - For monitoring and profiling, [integrate Blackfire](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/blackfire.md).

### Exporting data

As an Upsun Fixed user, your code and data belong to you.
At any time, you can download your site's data for local development, to back up your data, or to change provider.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- An Upsun account
- Code in your project
- Optional: the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

##### 1. Download your app's code

Your app's code is maintained through the Git version control system.

To download your entire app's code history:

 - Retrieve the project you want to back up by running the following command:

```bash {}
platform get <PROJECT_ID>
```

 - In the [Console](https://console.platform.sh/), open your project and click **Code **.

 - Click **Git**.

 - To copy the command, click ** Copy**.
The command is similar to the following:

```text {}
git clone abcdefgh1234567@git.eu.platform.sh:abcdefgh1234567.git project-name
```

##### 2. Download your files

Some files might not be stored in Git,
such as data your app writes [in mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).

You can download your files [using the CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/file-transfer.md#transfer-files-using-the-cli) or [using SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/file-transfer.md#transfer-files-using-an-ssh-client).

##### 3. Download data from services

The mechanism for downloading from each service (such as your database) varies.

For services designed to hold non-persistent data, such as [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md) or [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md),
it's generally not necessary to download data as it can be rebuilt from the primary data store.

For services designed to hold persistent data, see each service's page for instructions:

- [MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#exporting-data)
- [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md#exporting-data)
- [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mongodb.md#exporting-data)
- [InfluxDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/influxdb.md#export-data)

##### 4. Get environment variables

Environment variables can contain critical information such as tokens or additional configuration options for your app.

Environment variables can have different prefixes:

- Variables beginning with `env:` are exposed [as Unix environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#top-level-environment-variables).
- Variables beginning with `php:` are interpreted [as `php.ini` directives](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#php-specific-variables).

All other variables are [part of `$PLATFORM_VARIABLES`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

To back up your environment variables:

Note that you can also get all the environment variable values by running the following command:

```bash {}
platform ssh -- env
```

 - Store the data somewhere secure on your computer.

 - In the [Console](https://console.platform.sh/), open your project and click **Settings**.
 - Click **Project Settings **.
 - Click **Variables** and access your variable’s values and settings.
 - Store the data somewhere secure on your computer.

Note that in the Console, you can’t access the value of variables that have been [marked as sensitive](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#variable-options).
Use the CLI to retrieve these values.

##### What's next

- Migrate data from elsewhere [into Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/migrating.md).
- Migrate to [another region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/projects/region-migration.md).
- To use data from an environment locally, export your data and set up your [local development environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local.md).

### HTTP caching

You can configure HTTP caching for your site on Upsun Fixed in several ways.
Which one you should use depends on your specific use case.

You should use only one of these at a time and disable any others.
Mixing them together most likely results in stale cache that can't be cleared.

##### The Upsun Fixed router cache

Every project includes a router instance that includes [optional HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
It's reasonably configurable and obeys HTTP cache directives, but doesn't support push-based clearing.

If you're uncertain what caching tool to use, start with this one.
It's enough for most uses.

##### A Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Upsun Fixed is compatible with most commercial CDNs.
If you have a Dedicated instance, it comes with the [Fastly CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md).

CDNs generally offer the best performance as they're the only option that includes multiple geographic locations.
But they do tend to be the most expensive option.

See more on setting up [Fastly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md) and [Cloudflare](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/cloudflare.md).
The methods for other CDNs are similar.

##### Varnish

Upsun Fixed offers a [Varnish service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/varnish.md) that you can insert between the router and your app.

It has roughly the same performance as the router cache.
Varnish is more configurable, but it requires you to be comfortable with Varnish Configuration Language (VCL).
Upsun Fixed doesn't help with VCL configuration and a misconfiguration may be difficult to debug.

Varnish supports [clearing cache with a push](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/varnish.md#clear-cache-with-a-push),
but access control is complicated by the inability to have [circular relationships](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/varnish.md#circular-relationships).

Generally speaking, you should use Varnish only if your application requires push-based clearing or relies on Varnish-specific business logic.

##### App-specific caching

Many web apps and frameworks include a built-in web cache layer that mimics what Varnish or the Router cache would do.
Most of the time they're slower than a dedicated caching service as they still require invoking the app server
and only serve as a fallback for users that don't have a dedicated caching service available.
Generally speaking, use app-specific web cache only when it includes app-specific business logic you depend on,
such as app-sensitive selective cache clearing or partial page caching.

Note that this refers only to HTTP caching.
Many apps have an internal app cache for data objects and similar information.
That should remain active regardless of the HTTP cache in use.

##### Cookies and caching

HTTP-based caching systems generally default to including cookie values in cache keys
to avoid serving authenticated content to the wrong user.
While this is a safe default, it means that *any* cookie effectively disables the cache,
including mundane cookies like analytics.

The solution is to set which cookies should impact the cache and limit them to session cookies.
For the router cache, see [cookies in HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md#cookies).
For other cache systems, consult their documentation.
### From monoliths through headless to microservices

With Upsun Fixed, you can run multiple application containers in a single environment.
This gives you access to a large variety of setups and allows you to seamlessly upgrade your app
from a monolith with a single application server to a more elaborate and effective topology.

You can set up multiple apps to achieve the following:
- Keep your backend and frontend systems separate
- Run workers alongside your main app
- Or even go for a full microservices architecture

Upsun Fixed makes implementing such setups and switching from one to the other pain-free.

The same flexibility applies to any supported services, from relational databases to search engines and message queues.
Depending on your specific use case, you can run a single database,
multiple databases inside a single instance, or multiple databases in multiple versions...
It's up to you!

Whether you embrace a mono-repo approach with a single Git repository describing your entire setup,
or divide your project into multiple repositories, Upsun Fixed allows you to build the best architecture for your needs.

But while the possibilities are endless, making the right choice between creating one big project with multiple apps
or keeping each app in its own project can be a tough formula to crack.
So read on for guidance!

##### Separate projects

If you have multiple apps sharing the same code but each of them has its own data,
keep your apps in separate projects.
Upsun Fixed provides the automation to deploy multiple projects from the same code base,
which makes their maintenance effortless.

**Note**: 

By design, Upsun Fixed doesn’t allow your app to access services in another project through HTTP.

So separate projects are appropriate in the following cases:

- Your apps are for different customers/clients
- Your apps don't need to directly connect to the same database
- Different teams are working on different apps
- You want to develop true microservices, where each microservice is a fully standalone process with its own data

When in doubt over your own needs,
it's better to keep separate projects than build an architecture that may prove difficult for you to maintain.

##### Clustered applications

A clustered application is one where your project requires multiple _app services_ that are all part of the same conceptual project.

Clustered applications can range from a straightforward headless architecture, where frontend and backend systems are separated,
to micro-services with dozens of apps in multiple runtimes and frameworks forming a consistent whole.
Meaning, removing one of the app services would break the others.

Upsun Fixed allows you to configure access from one service to another
without having to worry about service discovery or complex _ingress controllers_.
[Configuring incoming routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) is straightforward.
You can have services that are only exposed to another service as well as services that are exposed to the internet.

In a clustered application, you can have one of the following configurations:

- Multiple [`.platform.app.yaml` files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) in different directories, with separate code bases that deploy separately
- A single app that spawns one or more [worker instances](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers) that run background processes

**Note**: 

Note that a clustered application requires at least a [Medium](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).

With a clustered application, you often don't need multiple service instances.
The [MySQL, MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md),
and [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) services support defining multiple databases on a single service,
which is significantly more efficient than defining multiple services.
[Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md), [Memcached](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/memcached.md),
[Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md), and [RabbitMQ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/rabbitmq.md)
natively support multiple bins (also called _queues_ or _indexes_) defined by the client application as part of the request.
Therefore, they don't need additional configuration on Upsun Fixed.

Clustered applications are appropriate in the following cases:

- You want one user-facing app and an entirely separate admin-facing app that are both operating on the same data
- You want to have a user-facing app and a separate worker process (either the same code or separate) that handles background tasks
- You want a single conceptual app written in multiple programming languages

##### A note on "multi-site" applications

Some Content Management Systems or other applications support running multiple logical "sites" off of a single code base.
This approach isn't recommended on Upsun Fixed.

This multi-site logic is often dependent on the domain name of the incoming request, which on Upsun Fixed varies by branch.
Running multiple databases, as is often recommended with this approach,
is supported on Upsun Fixed but makes the setup process for each site more difficult.

Leveraging the multi-site capabilities of an app are appropriate only in the following cases:

- There is only a single team working on all of the "sites" involved
- All "sites" should be updated simultaneously as a single unit
- Each individual site is relatively low traffic, such that the aggregate traffic is appropriate for your plan size
- All sites really do use the same codebase with no variation, just different data

Otherwise, [separate projects](#separate-projects) are a better long-term plan.
### Keep your Git repository clean

When a Git repository contains a high number of references and files, the performance of Git can decrease.
This is why most Git providers have repository size limits in place (for more information, see the [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/index.md#account-and-limit-settings)
and [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/reduce-repository-size/) documentation).

The Upsun Fixed API and [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md) are closely tied to Git.
When the performance of Git decreases, Upsun Fixed API servers also become slower.
As a user, you can then experience significant latencies.
If your repository becomes too large, your Console may even become unresponsive,
leaving you unable to access your project.

To avoid such issues, make sure you keep your Git repository clean by following the instructions on this page.

If you're already facing performance issues and suspect they might be related to the size of your Git repository,
see how you can [troubleshoot a sizeable Git repository](#troubleshoot-a-sizeable-git-repository).

##### Enable the automated pruning of old branches in your project

To keep your repository size to a minimum,
make sure that branches that don't exist anymore in your repository have also been deleted from Upsun Fixed.

To automate this process, when setting up a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations.md),
enable the `prune-branches` option.

If you already have a source integration set up and want to enable the `prune-branches` option,
follow these steps:

 - Then, to enable the ``prune-branches`` option, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform integration:update --project <PROJECT_ID> <SOURCE_INTEGRATION_ID> --prune-branches true
```

 - Navigate to your project.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Project Settings**.
 - Click **Integrations** and select your source integration.
 - Click **Edit**.
 - Enter your access token and click **Continue**.
 - Select your repository and check the following boxes:

 - **Fetch branches from the remote repository to your project** (``fetch-branches`` option, mandatory to enable ``prune-branches``).
 - **Remove branches from your project that have disappeared remotely (requires the fetch branches option to be enabled)** (``prune-branches`` option).

 - Click **Save**.

##### Upload your files through mounts

Keeping too many files, especially large binary files, in your Git repository can cause performance and stability issues.
Therefore, Upsun Fixed recommends that you only commit your source code in Git.

To upload any other files to your app, [create mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts)
and [transfer your files directly to them](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/file-transfer.md#transfer-a-file-to-a-mount).

**Note**: 

Upsun Fixed does not currently support [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com/).

There is a **100MB default file size limit** for direct Git pushes to Upsun Fixed. Pushing files larger than the limit will result in rejecting the push, so please keep this in mind. If you’d like to request a custom limit, please [contact Support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### Troubleshoot a sizeable Git repository

If you're experiencing latencies or can't access your Console anymore,
your Git repository may have become too large and may need to be cleaned up.
To do so, follow these instructions:

1. Remove old, unwanted files from your repository (especially large files).
   You can do it manually, or use a tool such as [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).
2. Remove stale branches from your repository and Upsun Fixed project.
3. Rebase and/or squash commits to clean up your history.
4. Make sure you [enable the automated pruning of old branches in your project](#enable-the-automated-pruning-of-old-branches-in-your-project)
   and [upload your files through mounts](#upload-your-files-through-mounts) to avoid facing the same situation in the future.


## Frameworks
### Deploy Django on Upsun Fixed

Django is a web application framework written in Python with a built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

This guide provides instructions for deploying, and working with, Django on Upsun Fixed. 
It includes examples for working with Django on all of the major package managers: pip, Pipenv, and Poetry. 

To get Django running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Django site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Django site.
        See an example for doing this under initializing a project.

    -   Use a ready-made [Django template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Django template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

**Note**: 

This guide is written for Django 4, but should apply almost exactly the same for other versions.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.
        If you don’t have code, create a new Django project from scratch.
The following commands create a brand new Django project using [Django Admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project).

```bash {}
django-admin startproject <PROJECT_NAME>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
git init
git add . && git commit -m "Create basic Django app."
```

The community also provides a number of open-source starting points you can consult:

 - [django-simple-deploy](https://github.com/ehmatthes/django-simple-deploy) maintained by [@ehmatthes](https://github.com/ehmatthes)
 - [djangox](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox) maintained by [@wsvincent](https://github.com/wsvincent)

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Django for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Django in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Django requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

The examples vary based on whether you use Pip, Pipenv, or Poetry to manage dependencies.

####### How to start your app

Each of these examples includes a command to start your app under `web.commands.start`.
It uses the Gunicorn WSGI server and Unix sockets.

```yaml {}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: unix
  commands:
    start: "gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: unix
  commands:
    start: "pipenv run gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: unix
  commands:
    start: "poetry run gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
```

To use this server, update the command to replace the WSGI application Gunicorn calls.
The example uses a `myapp/wsgi.py` file with a callable `application`.

To use a different web server, change this start command.
For examples of how to do so, see more about [Python web servers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/python/server.md).

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Django to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

Below is an example configuration to make [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md) available for your Django application.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/
# Full list of available services: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/available/
db:
  type: postgresql:12
  disk: 1024
```

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Django app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"

# A basic redirect definition
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/examples/redirect/
"https://www.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://{default}/"

```

#### Customize Django for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed,
it's time to make your Django site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment.
A number of additional steps are either required or recommended, depending on how much you want to optimize your site.

###### Optional: Set up the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

In all of the following examples,
you can replace retrieving and decoding environment variables with this library.

###### Django configuration

Most configuration for Django, such as service credentials, is done in a `settings.py` file.
You can see an example of a [complete settings file in the Django template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4/blob/master/myapp/settings.py).

The example file configures app settings and credentials for connecting to a PostgreSQL database.
The environment variables defined there enable Django apps to remain independent of their environment.

The example file itself contains a lot of settings,
the most important of which are highlighted here to show where you could modify your code.

####### Allowed hosts

[`ALLOWED_HOSTS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) defines the host names that your Django site can serve.
It's where you define `localhost` and also your site's primary domain.

On Upsun Fixed, every branch or pull request you create can become an active environment:
a deployed site where you can test changes.
The environment is given a URL that ends with `.platform.site`.
To allow your site to serve these environment, add this suffix to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

```py  {location="settings.py"}
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    'localhost',
    '127.0.0.1',
    '.platformsh.site',
]
```

####### Decoding variables

Upsun Fixed environment variables, which contain information on deployed environments, are often obscured.
For example, `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`, which contains credentials to connect to services, is a base64-encoded JSON object.

The example Django configuration file has a `decode` helper function to help with these variables.
Alternatively, you can use the [Upsun Fixed Config Reader](#optional-set-up-the-config-reader).

```py  {location="settings.py"}
#################################################################################
# Upsun Fixed-specific configuration

# Helper function for decoding base64-encoded JSON variables.
def decode(variable):
    """Decodes an Upsun Fixed environment variable.
    Args:
        variable (string):
            Base64-encoded JSON (the content of an environment variable).
    Returns:
        An dict (if representing a JSON object), or a scalar type.
    Raises:
        JSON decoding error.
    """
    try:
        if sys.version_info[1] > 5:
            return json.loads(base64.b64decode(variable))
        else:
            return json.loads(base64.b64decode(variable).decode('utf-8'))
    except json.decoder.JSONDecodeError:
        print('Error decoding JSON, code %d', json.decoder.JSONDecodeError)
```

####### Handling overrides

Once you have a [way to decode variables](#decoding-variables),
you can use them to override settings based on the environment.
The following example uses the `decode` function to set access to the one service defined in this example,
a PostgreSQL database.

```py  {location="settings.py"}
# This variable must always match the primary database relationship name,
#   configured in .platform.app.yaml.
PLATFORMSH_DB_RELATIONSHIP="database"

# Import some Upsun Fixed settings from the environment.
# The following block is only applied within Upsun Fixed environments
# That is, only when this Upsun Fixed variable is defined
if (os.getenv('PLATFORM_APPLICATION_NAME') is not None):
    DEBUG = False

    # Redefine the static root based on the Upsun Fixed directory
    # See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#static-root
    if (os.getenv('PLATFORM_APP_DIR') is not None):
        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.getenv('PLATFORM_APP_DIR'), 'static')

    # PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY is unique to your project
    # Use it to define define Django's SECRET_KEY
    # See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#secret-key
    if (os.getenv('PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY') is not None):
        SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY')

    # Database service configuration, post-build only
    # As services aren't available during the build
    if (os.getenv('PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT') is not None):
        platformRelationships = decode(os.getenv('PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS'))
        db_settings = platformRelationships[PLATFORMSH_DB_RELATIONSHIP][0]
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': db_settings['path'],
                'USER': db_settings['username'],
                'PASSWORD': db_settings['password'],
                'HOST': db_settings['host'],
                'PORT': db_settings['port'],
            },
            'sqlite': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
```

As noted in comments in the example, services on Upsun Fixed (like PostgreSQL) aren't yet available during the build.
This it enables the environment-independent builds that make the Upsun Fixed inheritance model possible.

For this reason, when defining a service connection, you need to overwrite the settings during the deploy phase.
You can determine the deploy phase using the `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT` variable, which is only available at deploy time.

###### `.environment` and Poetry

`source .environment` is run in the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)
when a project starts, before cron commands are run, and when you log into an environment over SSH.
So you can use the `.environment` file to make further changes to environment variables before the app runs,
including modifying the system `$PATH` and other shell level customizations.

Django projects like this example using Pip or Pipenv don't need a `.environment` file to run.
Using Poetry requires additional configuration to ensure that Poetry can be called during the deploy phase and SSH sessions.

```text  {location=".environment"}
# Updates PATH when Poetry is used, making it available during deploys and SSH.
if [ -n "$POETRY_VERSION" ]; then
    export PATH="/app/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

If you have other environment variables your app depends on that aren't sensitive and so can be committed to Git,
you can include them in the `.environment` file

#### Deploy Django


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

**Note**: 

The example Django app used in this guide can be migrated solely by importing data into the database.
Other forms of data, such as user uploads, also need to be migrated in the way described above.

To see how to define directories that are writable at runtime, see the [mounts reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).
Then adjust the previous commands to upload files to them.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

###### Local development

Once Django has been deployed on Upsun Fixed, you need to set up a local development environment to begin making revisions.
For more information, consult the [Django local development guides](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/local.md).

###### Package management

pip comes pre-installed on all Python containers.
You can also use Pipenv and Poetry to manage dependencies,
but there are a caveats to keep in mind when using those tools.

For more information, see how to [manage Python dependencies](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/python/dependencies.md).

###### Web servers

The examples in this guide primarily use Gunicorn as a web server for Django apps.
Other servers such as Daphne and Uvicorn are equally supported.

See how to configure [Python web servers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/python/server.md).

###### Sanitize data

By default, each preview environment automatically inherits all data from its parent environment.
So a developer working on a small feature has access to production data,
including personally identifiable information (PII).
This workflow isn't always desirable or even acceptable based on your compliance requirements.

For how to enforce compliance requirements for user data across environments,
see how to [sanitize databases](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/sanitize-db.md).

  [Back](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/deploy/deploy.md)

### Local development

A significant amount of work developing Django takes place locally rather than on an active Upsun Fixed environment.
You want to ensure that the process of local development is as close as possible to a deployed environment.

You can achieve this through various approaches.
Each of these examples:

- Creates a local development environment for a Django site.
- Syncs data from the active Upsun Fixed environment where team review takes place.
- Commits aspects of that local development method to the project so collaborators can replicate configuration to contribute.

If you're already using Docker Compose,
consult the Community guide on [using Docker Compose with Django and Upsun Fixed](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439578981138).
#### DDEV


[DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an open-source tool for local development environments.
It allows you to use Docker in your workflows while maintaining a GitOps workflow.
You get fully containerized environments to run everything locally
without having to install tools (including the Upsun Fixed  CLI, PHP, and Composer) on your machine.

###### Before you begin

You need:

- A local copy of the repository for a [Django](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../deploy.md)  project running on Upsun Fixed.

  To get one, run ``platform
 get <PROJECT_ID>
``.

  Alternatively, you can clone an integrated source repository and set the remote branch.
  To do so, run ``platform
 project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
``.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

- DDEV installed on your computer.

  Make sure your computer meets the [system requirements for DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements).

  For the integration to run smoothly, you also need the following tools:

  - `jq`
  - `base64`
  - `perl`

  If you don't have these already installed, use your normal package manager.

  To install DDEV, follow the [DDEV documentation for your operating system](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/).

  This installs the self-contained `ddev` command-line interface (CLI).
  For more information on `ddev`, run `ddev help`.

###### Assumptions

This example makes some assumptions, which you may need to adjust for your own circumstances.

It's assumed you want to run a built-in lightweight development server with `manage.py runserver`.
To match a production web server (such as Gunicorn or Daphne),
[modify those commands accordingly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../../languages/python/server.md).

It's generally assumed that Upsun Fixed is the primary remote for the project.
If you use a source integration, the steps are identical in most cases.
When they differ, the alternative is noted.

###### Set up DDEV

1.  Create a new environment off of production.

    ```bash
    platform branch new-feature main
    ```

    If you're using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
    open a merge/pull request.

2.  Add DDEV configuration to the project.

    ```bash
    ddev config --auto
    ```

3.  Add a Python alias package to the configuration.

    ```bash
    ddev config --webimage-extra-packages python-is-python3
    ```

4.  Add an API token.

    To connect DDEV with your Upsun Fixed  account, use a Upsun Fixed  API token.

    First [create an API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token) in the Console.

    Then add the token to your DDEV configuration.
    You can do so globally (easiest for most people):

    ```bash
    ddev config global --web-environment-add=PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN>

    ```

    You can also add the token only to the project:

    ```bash
    ddev config --web-environment-add=PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN>

    ```

5.  Connect DDEV to your project and the `new-feature` environment.

    The best way to connect your local DDEV to your Upsun Fixed project is through the [Upsun Fixed  DDEV add-on](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh).
    To add it, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ddev get ddev/ddev-platformsh
    ```

    Answer the interactive prompts with your project ID and the name of the environment to pull data from.

    With the add-on, you can now run `ddev platform ` from your computer without needing to install the Upsun Fixed  CLI.

6.  Update the DDEV PHP version.

    Python support in DDEV and the Upsun Fixed integration is in active development.
    At this time, the only officially supported runtime is PHP.
    With a few changes, the generated configuration can be modified to run local Django environments.

    A `.ddev` directory has been created in the repository containing DDEV configuration.

    In the `.ddev/config.platformsh.yaml` file, update the `php_version` attribute to a supported version, like `8.2`.

    ```yaml  {location=".ddev/config.platformsh.yaml"}
    # Leaving the generated line as is results in an error.
    # php_version: python:3.10
    php_version: 8.2
    ```

7.  Update the DDEV `post-start` hooks.

    The generated configuration contains a `hooks.post-start` attribute that contains Django's `hooks.build` and `hooks.deploy`.
    Add another item to the end of that array with the start command defined in `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml {}
hooks:
    post-start:
        ...
        # Upsun Fixed start command
        - exec: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

    .ddev/docker-compose.django.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
    post-start:
        ...
        # Upsun Fixed start command
        - exec: pipenv run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

    .ddev/docker-compose.django.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
    post-start:
        ...
        # Upsun Fixed start command
        - exec: poetry run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

8.  Create a custom Docker Compose file to define the port exposed for the container you're building, `web`:

    ```yaml  {location=".ddev/docker-compose.django.yaml"}
    version: "3.6"
    services:
        web:
            expose:
                - 8000
            environment:
                - HTTP_EXPOSE=80:8000
                - HTTPS_EXPOSE=443:8000
            healthcheck:
                test: "true"
    ```

9.  Create a custom `Dockerfile` to install Python into the container.

    ``` {location=".ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.python"}
    RUN apt-get install -y python3.10 python3-pip
    ```

10. Update your allowed hosts to include the expected DDEV domain suffix:

    ```py  {location="APP_NAME/settings.py"}
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
        'localhost',
        '127.0.0.1',
        '.platformsh.site',
        '.ddev.site'
    ]
    ```

11. Update your database configuration to include environment variables provided by DDEV:

    ```py  {location="APP_NAME/settings.py"}
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_NAME'),
            'USER': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_USER'),
            'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_PASSWORD'),
            'HOST': 'db',
            'PORT': 5432,
        }
    }
    ```

    This example assumes you have a PostgreSQL database with `db` as the relationship name.
    If you have a different setup, adjust the values accordingly.

12. Start DDEV.

    Build and start up Django for the first time.

    ```bash
    ddev start
    ```

    If you have another process running, you may get an error such as the following:

    ```bash
    Failed to start django: Unable to listen on required ports, port 80 is already in use
    ```

    If you do, either cancel the running process on port `80` or do both of the following:

    - Edit `router_http_port` in `.ddev/config.yaml` to another port such as `8080`.
    - Edit the `services.web.environment` variable `HTTP_EXPOSE` in `ddev/docker-compose.django.yaml` to `HTTP_EXPOSE=8080:8000`.

13. Pull data from the environment.

    Exit the currently running process (`CTRL+C`)
    and then run the following command to retrieve data from the current Upsun Fixed environment:

    ```bash
    ddev pull platform
    ```

14. Restart DDEV

    ```bash
    ddev restart
    ```

    You now have a local development environment that's in sync with the `new-feature` environment on Upsun Fixed.

15. When you finish your work, shut down DDEV.

    ```bash
    ddev stop
    ```

###### Next steps

You can now use your local environment to develop changes for review on Upsun Fixed environments.
The following examples show how you can take advantage of that.

####### Onboard collaborators

It's essential for every developer on your team to have a local development environment to work on.
Place the local configuration into a script to ensure everyone has this.
You can merge this change into production.

1.  Create a new environment called `local-config`.

2.  To set up a local environment for a new Upsun Fixed environment, create an executable script.

    ```bash
    touch init-local.sh && chmod +x init-local.sh
    ```

3. Fill it with the following example, depending on your package manager:

```bash {}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PROJECT=$1
ENVIRONMENT=$2
PARENT=$3

# Create the new environment
platform branch $ENVIRONMENT $PARENT

# Configure DDEV

printf "
RUN apt-get install -y python3.10 python3-pip
" > .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.python

ddev start
ddev pull platform -y
ddev restart
```

4. To commit and push the revisions, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "Add local configuration" && git push platform local-config
   ```

5.  Merge the change into production.

Once the script is merged into production,
any user can set up their local environment by running the following commands:

```bash
platform <PROJECT_ID>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
./init-local.sh <PROJECT_ID> another-new-feature <PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

####### Sanitize data

It's often a compliance requirement to ensure that only a minimal subset of developers within an organization
have access to production data during their work.
By default, your production data is automatically cloned into _every_ child environment.

You can customize your deployments to include a script that sanitizes the data within every preview environment.

1.  Create a new environment called `sanitize-non-prod`.

2.  Follow the example on how to [sanitize PostgreSQL with Django](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../../development/sanitize-db/postgresql.md).
    This adds a sanitization script to your deploy hook that runs on all preview environments.

3.  Commit and push the revisions by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git add . && git commit -m "Add data sanitization" && git push platform sanitize-non-prod
    ```

4.  Merge the change into production.

    Once the script is merged into production, every preview environment created on Upsun Fixed
    and all local environments contain sanitized data free of your users' personally identifiable information (PII).

#### Tethered local

**Note**: 

This guide is an example for setting up a local development environment for Django.
The recommended tool for local development is DDEV.
See the [Django DDEV guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/local/ddev.md).

To test changes locally, you can connect your locally running Django server
to service containers on an active Upsun Fixed environment.

- A local copy of the repository for a [Django](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../deploy.md)  project running on Upsun Fixed.

  To get one, run ``platform
 get <PROJECT_ID>
``.

  Alternatively, you can clone an integrated source repository and set the remote branch.
  To do so, run ``platform
 project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
``.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

###### Assumptions

This example makes some assumptions, which you may need to adjust for your own circumstances.

It's assumed you want to run a built-in lightweight development server with `manage.py runserver`.
To match a production web server (such as Gunicorn or Daphne),
[modify those commands accordingly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../../languages/python/server.md).

It's generally assumed that Upsun Fixed is the primary remote for the project.
If you use a source integration, the steps are identical in most cases.
When they differ, the alternative is noted.

If you followed the [Django deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/deploy.md),
you should have a Django configuration file with settings for [decoding variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/deploy/customize.md#decoding-variables)
and also [overrides for Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django/deploy/customize.md#decoding-variables).

You can use these settings to set up a tethered connection to services running on an Upsun Fixed environment.
The settings are used to mock the conditions of the environment locally.

###### Create the tethered connection

1. Create a new environment based on production.

   ```bash
   platform branch new-feature <PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
   ```

   If you're using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
   open a merge/pull request.

1. To open an SSH tunnel to the new environment's services, run the following command:

   ```bash
   platform tunnel:open
   ```

   This command returns the addresses for SSH tunnels to all of your services.

1. Export the `PLATFORMSH_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable with information from the open tunnel:

   ```bash
   export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info --encode)"
   ```

1.  To ensure your `settings.py` file acts as if in an Upsun Fixed environment,
    mock two variables present in active environments:

    ```bash
    export PLATFORM_APPLICATION_NAME=django && export PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=new-feature
    ```

1.  To install dependencies, run the command for your package manager:

```bash {}
pipenv install

```
```bash {}
poetry install

```

1.  Collect static assets.

```bash {}
pipenv run python manage.py collectstatic

```
```bash {}
poetry run python manage.py collectstatic

```

1.  To start your local server, run the following command based on your package manager:

```bash {}
pipenv run python manage.py runserver

```
```bash {}
poetry run python manage.py runserver

```

1.  When you've finished your work, close the tunnels to your services by running the following command:

    ```bash
    platform tunnel:close --all -y
    ```

###### Next steps

You can now use your local environment to develop changes for review on Upsun Fixed environments.
The following examples show how you can take advantage of that.

####### Onboard collaborators

It's essential for every developer on your team to have a local development environment to work on.
Place the local configuration into a script to ensure everyone has this.
You can merge this change into production.

1.  Create a new environment called `local-config`.

1.  To set up a local environment for a new Upsun Fixed environment, create an executable script.

    ```bash
    touch init-local.sh && chmod +x init-local.sh
    ```

1. Fill it with the following example, depending on your package manager:

```bash {}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PROJECT=$1
ENVIRONMENT=$2
PARENT=$3

# Create the new environment

ddev start
ddev pull platform -y
ddev restart
```

1. To commit and push the revisions, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "Add local configuration" && git push platform local-config
   ```

1.  Merge the change into production.

Once the script is merged into production,
any user can set up their local environment by running the following commands:

```bash
platform <PROJECT_ID>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
./init-local.sh <PROJECT_ID> another-new-feature <PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

####### Sanitize data

It's often a compliance requirement to ensure that only a minimal subset of developers within an organization
have access to production data during their work.
By default, your production data is automatically cloned into _every_ child environment.

You can customize your deployments to include a script that sanitizes the data within every preview environment.

1.  Create a new environment called `sanitize-non-prod`.

2.  Follow the example on how to [sanitize PostgreSQL with Django](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../../development/sanitize-db/postgresql.md).
    This adds a sanitization script to your deploy hook that runs on all preview environments.

3.  Commit and push the revisions by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git add . && git commit -m "Add data sanitization" && git push platform sanitize-non-prod
    ```

4.  Merge the change into production.

    Once the script is merged into production, every preview environment created on Upsun Fixed
    and all local environments contain sanitized data free of your users' personally identifiable information (PII).


### Deploy Drupal on Upsun Fixed

Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework. To deploy Drupal on Upsun Fixed, the recommended way is to use Composer, the PHP package management suite.

This guide assumes you are using the well-supported Composer flavor of Drupal.

To get Drupal running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a [Composer-flavored Drupal](https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project/) site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic [Composer-flavored Drupal](https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project/) site.
        See an example for doing this under initializing a project.

    -   Use a ready-made [Drupal template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal11).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Drupal template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.
        If you don’t have code, create a new Drupal project from scratch.
The following commands create a brand new Drupal project using Composer.

```bash {}
composer create-project drupal/core-recommended <PROJECT_NAME>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
git init
git add . && git commit -m "Init Drupal from upstream."
```

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Drupal for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Drupal in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Drupal requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}

# in the same project.

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

We recommend the latest [MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) version for Drupal,
although you can also use Oracle MySQL or [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md).
For Drupal caching, we strongly recommend [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md).
Drupal’s cache can be very aggressive,
and keeping that data out of the database helps with both performance and disk usage.
See an example of Redis for caching in our [Drupal template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10).

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Drupal to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` and `cache` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.

db:
    type: mariadb:10.11
    disk: 2048

cache:
    type: redis:7.2
```

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.
Generally, you want the user session cookie, which is included in the example for Drupal.
You may need to add other cookies depending on what additional modules you have installed.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Drupal app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "drupal:http"
    cache:
      enabled: true

      # Base the cache on the session cookie and custom Drupal cookies. Ignore all other cookies.
      cookies: ['/^SS?ESS/', '/^Drupal.visitor/']

"https://www.{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://{default}/"

```

#### Customize Drupal for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed,
it's time to make your Drupal site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment.
There are a number of additional steps that are either required or recommended, depending on how well you want to optimize your site.

###### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

The following examples use it, so install it through Composer if you haven't already.

```bash
composer require platformsh/config-reader
```

###### `settings.php`

`settings.php` is the main Drupal environment-configuration file.
In a stock Drupal installation it contains the database credentials, various other settings, and an enormous amount of comments.

In the Drupal template, the [`settings.php`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10/blob/master/web/sites/default/settings.php) file
is mostly replaced with a stub that contains only the most basic configuration
and then includes a `settings.platformsh.php` and `settings.local.php` file, if they exist.
The latter is a common Drupal pattern, and the `settings.local.php` file should never be committed to Git.
It contains configuration that's specific to your local development environment,
such as a local development database.

The `settings.platformsh.php` file contains glue code that configures Drupal
based on the information available in Upsun Fixed's environment variables.
That includes the database credentials, Redis caching, and file system paths.

The file itself is a bit long, but reasonably self-explanatory.

```php
<?php
/**
 * @file
 * Upsun Fixed settings.
 */

use Drupal\Core\Installer\InstallerKernel;

$platformsh = new \Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config();

// Set up a config sync directory.
//

    ],
  ];
}

// Enable verbose error messages on development branches, but not on the production branch.
// You may add more debug-centric settings here if desired to have them automatically enable
// on development but not production.
if (isset($platformsh->branch)) {
  // Production type environment.
  if ($platformsh->onProduction() || $platformsh->onDedicated()) {
    $config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'hide';
  } // Development type environment.
  else {
    $config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'verbose';
  }
}

// Enable Redis caching.
if ($platformsh->hasRelationship('redis') && !InstallerKernel::installationAttempted() && extension_loaded('redis') && class_exists('Drupal\redis\ClientFactory')) {
  $redis = $platformsh->credentials('redis');

  // Set Redis as the default backend for any cache bin not otherwise specified.
  $settings['cache']['default'] = 'cache.backend.redis';
  $settings['redis.connection']['host'] = $redis['host'];
  $settings['redis.connection']['port'] = $redis['port'];

  // Apply changes to the container configuration to better leverage Redis.
  // This includes using Redis for the lock and flood control systems, as well
  // as the cache tag checksum. Alternatively, copy the contents of that file
  // to your project-specific services.yml file, modify as appropriate, and
  // remove this line.
  $settings['container_yamls'][] = 'modules/contrib/redis/example.services.yml';

  // Allow the services to work before the Redis module itself is enabled.
  $settings['container_yamls'][] = 'modules/contrib/redis/redis.services.yml';

  // Manually add the classloader path, this is required for the container cache bin definition below
  // and allows to use it without the redis module being enabled.
  $class_loader->addPsr4('Drupal\\redis\\', 'modules/contrib/redis/src');

  // Use redis for container cache.
  // The container cache is used to load the container definition itself, and
  // thus any configuration stored in the container itself is not available
  // yet. These lines force the container cache to use Redis rather than the
  // default SQL cache.
  $settings['bootstrap_container_definition'] = [

        'class' => 'Drupal\Component\Serialization\PhpSerialize',
      ],
    ],
  ];
}

if ($platformsh->inRuntime()) {
  // Configure private and temporary file paths.
  if (!isset($settings['file_private_path'])) {
    $settings['file_private_path'] = $platformsh->appDir . '/private';
  }
  if (!isset($settings['file_temp_path'])) {
    $settings['file_temp_path'] = $platformsh->appDir . '/tmp';
  }

// Configure the default PhpStorage and Twig template cache directories.
  if (!isset($settings['php_storage']['default'])) {
    $settings['php_storage']['default']['directory'] = $settings['file_private_path'];
  }
  if (!isset($settings['php_storage']['twig'])) {
    $settings['php_storage']['twig']['directory'] = $settings['file_private_path'];
  }

  // Set the project-specific entropy value, used for generating one-time
  // keys and such.
  $settings['hash_salt'] = empty($settings['hash_salt']) ? $platformsh->projectEntropy : $settings['hash_salt'];

  // Set the deployment identifier, which is used by some Drupal cache systems.
  $settings['deployment_identifier'] = $settings['deployment_identifier'] ?? $platformsh->treeId;
}

// The 'trusted_hosts_pattern' setting allows an admin to restrict the Host header values
// that are considered trusted.  If an attacker sends a request with a custom-crafted Host
// header then it can be an injection vector, depending on how the Host header is used.
// However, Upsun Fixed already replaces the Host header with the route that was used to reach
// Upsun Fixed, so it is guaranteed to be safe.  The following line explicitly allows all
// Host headers, as the only possible Host header is already guaranteed safe.
$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = ['.*'];

// Import variables prefixed with 'drupalsettings:' into $settings
// and 'drupalconfig:' into $config.
foreach ($platformsh->variables() as $name => $value) {
  $parts = explode(':', $name);
  list($prefix, $key) = array_pad($parts, 3, null);
  switch ($prefix) {
    // Variables that begin with `drupalsettings` or `drupal` get mapped
    // to the $settings array verbatim, even if the value is an array.
    // For example, a variable named drupalsettings:example-setting' with
    // value 'foo' becomes $settings['example-setting'] = 'foo';
    case 'drupalsettings':
    case 'drupal':
      $settings[$key] = $value;
      break;
    // Variables that begin with `drupalconfig` get mapped to the $config
    // array.  Deeply nested variable names, with colon delimiters,
    // get mapped to deeply nested array elements. Array values
    // get added to the end just like a scalar. Variables without
    // both a config object name and property are skipped.
    // Example: Variable `drupalconfig:conf_file:prop` with value `foo` becomes
    // $config['conf_file']['prop'] = 'foo';
    // Example: Variable `drupalconfig:conf_file:prop:subprop` with value `foo` becomes
    // $config['conf_file']['prop']['subprop'] = 'foo';
    // Example: Variable `drupalconfig:conf_file:prop:subprop` with value ['foo' => 'bar'] becomes
    // $config['conf_file']['prop']['subprop']['foo'] = 'bar';
    // Example: Variable `drupalconfig:prop` is ignored.
    case 'drupalconfig':
      if (count($parts) > 2) {
        $temp = &$config[$key];
        foreach (array_slice($parts, 2) as $n) {
          $prev = &$temp;
          $temp = &$temp[$n];
        }
        $prev[$n] = $value;
      }
      break;
  }
}
```

If you add additional services to your application, such as Solr, Elasticsearch, or RabbitMQ,
you would add configuration for those services to the `settings.platformsh.php` file as well.

###### `.environment`

Upsun Fixed runs `source .environment` in the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)
when a project starts, before cron commands are run, and when you log into an environment over SSH.
That gives you a place to do extra environment variable setup before the app runs,
including modifying the system `$PATH` and other shell level customizations.

The Drupal template includes a small [`.environment` file](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10/blob/master/.environment).
This modifies the `$PATH` to include the `vendor/bin` directory,
where command line tools like Drush are stored.

You need the file or one like it if you plan to run `drush` as a command,
such as in a cron task like the one in the [app configuration from the previous step](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/deploy/configure.md#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).
If you don't include the file, you get a [command not found error](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#command-not-found).

Some Drush commands need to know the site's URI. This is achieved with the
`DRUSH_OPTIONS_URI` variable defined in the same file.

```text  {location=".environment"}
# Allow executable app dependencies from Composer to be run from the path.
if [ -n "$PLATFORM_APP_DIR" -a -f "$PLATFORM_APP_DIR"/composer.json ] ; then
  bin=$(composer config bin-dir --working-dir="$PLATFORM_APP_DIR" --no-interaction 2>/dev/null)
  export PATH="${PLATFORM_APP_DIR}/${bin:-vendor/bin}:${PATH}"
fi

# Set the URI for Drush commands.
export PRIMARY_ROUTE_URL="$(echo "$PLATFORM_ROUTES" | base64 --decode | jq -r 'to_entries[] | select(.value.primary) | .key | rtrimstr("/")')"
export DRUSH_OPTIONS_URI="$PRIMARY_ROUTE_URL"
```

#### Deploy Drupal

###### Deployment

Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Post-install (new site)

If you are creating a new site, visiting the site in your browser will trigger the Drupal installer.
Run through it as normal, but note that you will not be asked for the database credentials.
The `settings.platformsh.php` file added earlier automatically provides the database credentials
and the installer is smart enough to not ask for them again.

Once the installer is complete you are presented with your new site.

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Drupal has a number of database tables that are useless when migrating
and you’re better off excluding their data.

 - If you’re using a database cache backend then you can and should exclude all ``cache_*`` table data.
On Upsun Fixed we recommend using Redis anyway,
and the template described on the previous pages uses Redis automatically.
 - The ``sessions`` table’s data can also be excluded.

While you can trim the data out of these tables post-migration,
that’s wasteful of both time and disk space, so it’s better to exclude that data to begin with.

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

###### Adding modules and themes

3rd party modules and themes can be installed and managed using Composer.
All packages on Drupal.org are registered with Drupal's own Packagist clone.
It should be included in the `composer.json` that comes with Drupal,
but in case it isn't you can add the following block to the file:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
    }
]
```

(Drupal 8 and 9 share the same package repository.)

Once that's there, you can install any module or theme with the following command:

```bash
composer require drupal/devel
```

Replace `devel` with the name of the module or theme you're installing.
Do *not* commit the `web/modules/contrib` directory to Git.
The build process re-downloads the correct version for you based on the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files, which should be committed to Git.

###### Custom modules and themes

Site-specific custom modules and themes can be written directly in the `web/modules/custom` and `web/themes/custom` directories.
They should be committed to Git as normal.

###### Updating Drupal core and modules

Drupal is fully managed via Composer, which means so are updates to Drupal core itself.
Run `composer update` periodically to get new versions of both Drupal core
and any modules or themes you have installed via Composer.
Commit the resulting changes to your `composer.lock` file and push again.

The [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) has more information on options to update individual modules or perform other tasks.

Note that updating modules or core through the Drupal UI isn't possible, as the file system is read-only.
All updates should be done through composer to update the lock file, and then pushed to Git.

###### Use Drush aliases

####### Create Drush aliases

[Drush site aliases](https://www.drush.org/latest/site-aliases/) help you manage your development websites.

The Upsun Fixed CLI can generate Drush aliases for you automatically
when you clone a project using the ``platform get <PROJECT_ID>`` command.

To see the aliases that are created, run the following command:

```bash
platform drush-aliases
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
Aliases for My Site (tqmd2kvitnoly):
    @my-site._local
    @my-site.main
    @my-site.staging
    @my-site.sprint1
```

####### Recreating Drush aliases

To recreate existing aliases or to create a new alias after pushing a new branch via git, run:

```bash
platform drush-aliases -r
```

  [Back](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/deploy/deploy.md)

### Using Elasticsearch with Drupal

##### Requirements

###### Add an Elasticsearch service

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `elasticsearch`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: elasticsearch:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

If you’re using a [premium version](add-services/elasticsearch.md#supported-versions), use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type instead.

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

####### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md#2-define-the-relationship) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: elasticsearch
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#2-define-the-relationship) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

####### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
elasticsearch:
  type: elasticsearch:8.5
  disk: 256
```

If you're using a [premium version](add-services/elasticsearch.md#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type in the service definition.

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  elasticsearch:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: elasticsearch
    endpoint: elasticsearch
```

###### Add the Drupal modules

You need to add the [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) and [Elasticsearch Connector](https://www.drupal.org/project/elasticsearch_connector) modules to your project. If you are using composer, the easiest way to add them is to run:

```bash
composer require drupal/search_api drupal/elasticsearch_connector
```

And then commit the changes to `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.

##### Configuration

Because Drupal defines connection information via the Configuration Management system, you need to first define an Elasticsearch "Cluster" at `admin/config/search/elasticsearch-connector`.
Note the "machine name" the server is given.

Then, paste the following code snippet into your `settings.platformsh.php` file.

**Note**: 

If you do not already have the [Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app) installed and referenced at the top of the file, you need to install it with ``composer require platformsh/config-reader`` and then add the following code before the block below:

```php {}
<?php

$platformsh = new \Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config();
if (!$platformsh->inRuntime()) {
   return;
}
```

- Edit the value of `$relationship_name` if you are using a different relationship.

- Edit the value of `$es_server_name` to match the machine name of your cluster in Drupal.

```php
<?php

// Update these values to the relationship name (from .platform.app.yaml)
// and the machine name of the server from your Drupal configuration.
$relationship_name = 'essearch';
$es_cluster_name = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_HERE';
if ($platformsh->hasRelationship($relationship_name)) {
  $platformsh->registerFormatter('drupal-elastic', function($creds) {
    return sprintf('http://%s:%s', $creds['host'], $creds['port']);
  });

  // Set the connector configuration to the appropriate value, as defined by the formatter above.
  $config['elasticsearch_connector.cluster.' . $es_cluster_name]['url'] = $platformsh->formattedCredentials($relationship_name, 'drupal-elastic');
}
```

Commit that code and push.
The specified cluster now always points to the Elasticsearch service.
Then configure Search API as normal.
### Using Memcached with Drupal

Upsun Fixed recommends using Redis for caching with Drupal over Memcached,
as Redis offers better performance when dealing with larger values as Drupal tends to produce.
But Memcached is also available if desired and is fully supported.

##### Requirements

###### Add a Memcached service

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `memcached`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: memcached:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: memcached
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#app-configuration) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - memcached
```

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
memcached:
  type: memcached:1.6
```

####### App configuration

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.

    endpoint: memcached
```

###### Add the Drupal module

You need to add the [Memcache](https://www.drupal.org/project/memcache) module to your project.
If you're using Composer to manage your Drupal site (which is recommended), run:

```bash
composer require drupal/memcache
```

Then commit the resulting changes to your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.

**Note**: 

You need to commit and deploy your code before continuing, then enable the module.
The Memcache module must be enabled before it’s configured in the ``settings.platformsh.php`` file.

##### Configuration

The Drupal Memcache module must be configured via `settings.platformsh.php`.

Place the following at the end of `settings.platformsh.php`.
Note the inline comments, as you may wish to customize it further.
Also review the `README.txt` file that comes with the Memcache module,
as it has a more information on possible configuration options.
For instance, you may want to consider using Memcache for locking as well as configuring cache stampede protection.

The example below is intended as a "most common case" and has been tested with version `8.x-2.3` of the Memcache module.

**Note**: 

If you don’t already have the [Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app) installed and referenced at the top of the file,
you need to install it with ``composer require platformsh/config-reader`` and then add the following code before the block below:

```php {}
<?php

$platformsh = new \Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config();
if (!$platformsh->inRuntime()) {
   return;
}
```

```php
<?php

// If you named your Memcached relationship something other than "memcachedcache", set that here.
$relationship_name = 'memcachedcache';

if ($platformsh->hasRelationship($relationship_name) && extension_loaded('memcached')) {
  $platformsh->registerFormatter('drupal-memcached', function($creds) {
    return sprintf("%s:%d", $creds['host'], $creds['port']);
  });

  // This is the line that tells Drupal to use Memcached as a backend.
  // Comment out just this line if you need to disable it for some reason and
  // fall back to the default database cache.
  $settings['cache']['default'] = 'cache.backend.memcache';

  $host = $platformsh->formattedCredentials($relationship_name, 'drupal-memcached');
  $settings['memcache']['servers'][$host] = 'default';

  // By default Drupal starts the cache_container on the database. The following
  // code overrides that.
  // Make sure that the $class_load->addPsr4 is pointing to the right location of
  // the Memcache module. The value below should be correct if Memcache was installed
  // using Drupal Composer.
  $memcache_exists = class_exists('Memcache', FALSE);
  $memcached_exists = class_exists('Memcached', FALSE);
  if ($memcache_exists || $memcached_exists) {
    $class_loader->addPsr4('Drupal\\memcache\\', 'modules/contrib/memcache/src');

    // If using a multisite configuration, adapt this line to include a site-unique
    // value.
    $settings['memcache']['key_prefix'] = $platformsh->environment;

    // Define custom bootstrap container definition to use Memcache for cache.container.

### Multiple Drupal sites in a single Project

Upsun Fixed supports running [multiple applications](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/bestpractices/oneormany.md) in the same project, and these can be two or more Drupal sites.

But they would be separate Drupal instances: they have their assets separate and live their lives apart, and it would be much better for them not to share the same database (though they could).

##### Multisite Drupal

Upsun Fixed actively discourages running Drupal in "multisite" mode. Doing so eliminates many of the advantages Upsun Fixed offers, such as isolation and safe testing.
Additionally, because of the dynamic nature of the domain names that are created for the different environments, the multisite configuration would be complex and fragile.

We recommend running separate projects for separate Drupal sites, or using one of the various "single instance" options available such as [Domain Access](https://www.drupal.org/project/domain), [Organic Groups](https://www.drupal.org/project/og), or [Workbench Access](https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench_access).

The only reason to use multisite Drupal would be to manage a series of nearly identical sites with separate databases.
For that case we have built a [template repository](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal9-multisite) that uses a unified lookup key for a subdomain, database name, and file paths.
Note that it will likely require modification for your specific setup and some configurations may require a different approach.

In particular, this example:

* Defines two MySQL databases.
* Uses a modified `settings.platformsh.php` that accepts a key variable from `settings.php` to specify which database and file system paths to use.
* Extracts the `sites` directory to use from the domain.
### Using Redis with Drupal

Redis is a fast open-source in-memory database and cache, useful for application-level caching. For more information on this service, see the [dedicated Redis page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md) or the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/).

Follow the instructions on this page to do one of the following:

- Add and configure Redis for Drupal if you have deployed Drupal manually.
- Fine-tune your existing configuration if you have deployed Drupal using a [Upsun Fixed template](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/templates.md).

##### Before you begin

You need:

- A [Drupal version deployed on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/deploy.md)
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- The [Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/deploy/customize.md#install-the-config-reader)

You also need a `settings.platformsh.php` file from which you can [manage the configuration of the Redis service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/deploy/customize.md#settingsphp).
If you installed Drupal with a template, this file is already present in your project.

**Note**: 

By default, Redis is an ephemeral service.
This means that the Redis storage isn’t persistent
and that data can be lost when a container is moved, shut down
or when the service hits its memory limit.

To solve this, Upsun Fixed recommends that you change the [service type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#service-types)
to [persistent Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#persistent-redis) (``redis-persistent``).

##### Add a Redis service

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `redis-persistent` endpoint:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: redis-persistent:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the `redis` endpoint :

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration, you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: redis
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#2-define-the-relationship) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - redis
```

###### 3. Add the Drupal module

To add the Redis module to your project, run the following command:

```bash
composer require drupal/redis
```

Then commit the resulting changes to your `composer.json`
and `composer.lock` files. Afterwards, you can enable the module with:

```bash
platform drush enable redis
```

##### Configure your Redis service

To configure your Redis service, follow these steps:

1. Add the following code at the top of your `settings.platformsh.php` file:

   ```php  {location="settings.platformsh.php"}
    <?php

    $platformsh = new \Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config();
    if (!$platformsh->inRuntime()) {
       return;
    }
   ```

2. Add the following code at the end of the file:

   ```php  {location="settings.platformsh.php"}
   <?php

   // Enable Redis caching.
    if ($platformsh->hasRelationship('rediscache') && !InstallerKernel::installationAttempted() && extension_loaded('redis')) {
      $redis = $platformsh->credentials('rediscache');

      // Set Redis as the default backend for any cache bin not otherwise specified.
      $settings['cache']['default'] = 'cache.backend.redis';
      $settings['redis.connection']['host'] = $redis['host'];
      $settings['redis.connection']['port'] = $redis['port'];

      // You can leverage Redis by using it for the lock and flood control systems
      // and the cache tag checksum.
      // To do so, apply the following changes to the container configuration.
      // Alternatively, copy the contents of the modules/contrib/redis/example.services.yml file
      // to your project-specific services.yml file.
      // Modify the contents to fit your needs and remove the following line.
      $settings['container_yamls'][] = 'modules/contrib/redis/example.services.yml';

      // Allow the services to work before the Redis module itself is enabled.
      $settings['container_yamls'][] = 'modules/contrib/redis/redis.services.yml';

      // To use Redis for container cache, add the classloader path manually.
      $class_loader->addPsr4('Drupal\\redis\\', 'modules/contrib/redis/src');

      // Use Redis for container cache.
      // The container cache is used to load the container definition itself.
      // This means that any configuration stored in the container isn't available
      // until the container definition is fully loaded.
      // To ensure that the container cache uses Redis rather than the
      // default SQL cache, add the following lines.
      $settings['bootstrap_container_definition'] = [
        'parameters' => [],
        'services' => [
          'redis.factory' => [
            'class' => 'Drupal\redis\ClientFactory',
          ],
          'cache.backend.redis' => [
            'class' => 'Drupal\redis\Cache\CacheBackendFactory',
            'arguments' => ['@redis.factory', '@cache_tags_provider.container', '@serialization.phpserialize'],
          ],
          'cache.container' => [
            'class' => '\Drupal\redis\Cache\PhpRedis',
            'factory' => ['@cache.backend.redis', 'get'],
            'arguments' => ['container'],
          ],
          'cache_tags_provider.container' => [
            'class' => 'Drupal\redis\Cache\RedisCacheTagsChecksum',
            'arguments' => ['@redis.factory'],
          ],
          'serialization.phpserialize' => [
            'class' => 'Drupal\Component\Serialization\PhpSerialize',
          ],
        ],
      ];
    }
   ```

   You can customize your configuration further
   using the inline comments from this example configuration.
   For more information on possible configuration options,
   see the `README.txt` file delivered with the Redis module
   or the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/).

##### Verify Redis is running

To verify that Redis is running, run the following command:

```bash
platform redis info
```

The output produces information and statistics about Redis,
showing that the service is up and running.
### Using Valkey with Drupal

[Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is an open source datastore that can be used high-performance data retrieval and key-value storage. For more information on this service, see the [dedicated Valkey page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../add-services/valkey.md) or the [official Valkey documentation](https://valkey.io/topics/).

Follow the instructions on this page to do one of the following:

- Add and configure Valkey for Drupal if you have deployed Drupal manually.
- Fine-tune your existing configuration if you have deployed Drupal using a [Upsun Fixed template](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../development/templates.md).

##### Before you begin

You need:

- A [Drupal version deployed on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../drupal/deploy.md)
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/cli/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- The [Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../guides/drupal/deploy/customize.md#install-the-config-reader)

You also need a `settings.platformsh.php` file from which you can [manage the configuration of the Valkey service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../drupal/deploy/customize.md#settingsphp).
If you installed Drupal with a template, this file is already present in your project.

**Note**: 

By default, Valkey is an ephemeral service.
This means that the Valkey storage isn’t persistent

To solve this, Upsun Fixed recommends that you change the [service type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/valkey.md#service-types)
to [persistent Valkey](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/valkey.md#persistent-valkey) (``valkey-persistent``).

##### Add a Valkey service

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `valkey-persistent` endpoint:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: valkey-persistent:8.0
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the `valkey` endpoint :

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: valkey
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - redis
```

###### 3. Add the Drupal module

[Drupal supports Valkey through the existing redis module](https://www.drupal.org/project/redis/issues/3443819). To add
the Redis module to your project, run the following command:

```bash
composer require drupal/redis
```

Then commit the resulting changes to your `composer.json`
and `composer.lock` files. Afterwards, you can enable the module with:

```bash
platform drush enable redis
```

##### Configure your Valkey service

To configure your Valkey service, follow these steps:

1. Add the following code at the top of your `settings.platformsh.php` file:

   ```php  {location="settings.platformsh.php"}
    <?php

    $platformsh = new \Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config();
    if (!$platformsh->inRuntime()) {
       return;
    }
   ```

2. Add the following code at the end of the file:

   ```php  {location="settings.platformsh.php"}

          'serialization.phpserialize' => [
            'class' => 'Drupal\Component\Serialization\PhpSerialize',
          ],
        ],
      ];
    }
   ```

   You can customize your configuration further
   using the inline comments from this example configuration.
   For more information on possible configuration options,
   see the `README.txt` file delivered with the Valkey module
   or the [official Valkey documentation](https://valkey.io/topics/).

##### Verify Valkey is running

To verify that Valkey is running, run the following command:

```bash
platform valkey info
```

The output produces information and statistics about Valkey,showing that the service is up and running.

### SimpleSAML

SimpleSAMLphp is a library for authenticating a PHP-based application against a SAML server, such as Shibboleth.
Although Drupal has modules available to authenticate using SimpleSAML some additional setup is required.

The following configuration assumes you are building Drupal using Composer.
If not, you need to download the library manually and adjust some paths accordingly.

##### Download the library and Drupal module

The easiest way to download SimpleSAMLphp is via Composer.
The following command will add both the Drupal module and the PHP library to your `composer.json` file.

```bash
composer require simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp drupal/externalauth drupal/simplesamlphp_auth
```

Once that's run, commit both `composer.json` and `composer.lock` to your repository.

##### Include SimpleSAML cookies in the cache key

The SimpleSAML client uses additional cookies besides the Drupal session cookie that need to be allowed for the cache.
To do so, modify your `.platform/routes.yaml` file for the route that points to your Drupal site and add two additional cookies to the `cache.cookies` line.
It should end up looking approximately like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"
  cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ['/^SS?ESS/', '/^Drupal.visitor/', 'SimpleSAMLSessionID', 'SimpleSAMLAuthToken']
```

Commit this change to the Git repository.

##### Expose the SimpleSAML endpoint

The SimpleSAML library's `www` directory needs to be publicly accessible.
That can be done by mapping it directly to a path in the Application configuration.
Add the following block to the `web.locations` section of `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
 web:
  locations:
    '/simplesaml':
      root: 'vendor/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/www'
      allow: true
      scripts: true
      index:
        - index.php
```

That will map all requests to `example.com/simplesaml/` to the `vendor/simplesamlphp/www` directory, allowing static files there to be served, PHP scripts to execute, and defaulting to index.php.

##### Create a configuration directory

Your SimpleSAMLphp configuration needs to be outside of the `vendor` directory.
The `composer require` downloads a template configuration file to `vendor/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/config`.

Rather than modifying that file in place (as it isn't included in Git),
copy the `vendor/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/config` directory to `simplesamlphp/config` (in [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)).
It should contain two files, `config.php` and `authsources.php`.

Additionally, create a `simplesamlphp/metadata` directory.
This directory holds your IdP definitions.
Consult the SimpleSAMLphp documentation and see the examples in `vendor/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/metadata-templates`.

Next, you need to tell SimpleSAMLphp where to find that directory using an environment variable.
The simplest way to set that is to add the following block to your `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    SIMPLESAMLPHP_CONFIG_DIR: /app/simplesamlphp/config
```

Commit the whole `simplesamplphp` directory and `.platform.app.yaml` to Git.

##### Configure SimpleSAML to use the database

SimpleSAMLphp is able to store its data either on disk or in the Drupal database.
Upsun Fixed strongly recommends using the database.

Open the file `simplesamlphp/config/config.php` that you created earlier.
It contains a number of configuration properties that you can adjust as needed.
Some are best edited in-place and the file already includes ample documentation, specifically:

* `auth.adminpassword`
* `technicalcontact_name`
* `technicalcontact_email`

Others are a little more involved.
In the interest of simplicity we recommend pasting the following code snippet at the end of the file, as it will override the default values in the array.

```php  {location="simplesamlphp/config/config.php"}
<?php

// Set SimpleSAML to log using error_log(), which on Upsun Fixedwill
// be mapped to the /var/log/app.log file.
$config['logging.handler'] = 'errorlog';

// Set SimpleSAML to use the metadata directory in Git, rather than
// the empty one in the vendor directory.
$config['metadata.sources'] = [
   ['type' => 'flatfile', 'directory' =>  dirname(__DIR__) . '/metadata'],
];

// Setup the database connection for all parts of SimpleSAML.
if (isset($_ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS'])) {
  $relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']), TRUE);
  foreach ($relationships['database'] as $instance) {
    if (!empty($instance['query']['is_master'])) {
      $dsn = sprintf("%s:host=%s;dbname=%s",
        $instance['scheme'],
        $instance['host'],
        $instance['path']
      );
      $config['database.dsn'] = $dsn;
      $config['database.username'] = $instance['username'];
      $config['database.password'] = $instance['password'];

      $config['store.type'] = 'sql';
      $config['store.sql.dsn'] = $dsn;
      $config['store.sql.username'] = $instance['username'];
      $config['store.sql.password'] = $instance['password'];
      $config['store.sql.prefix'] = 'simplesaml';

    }
  }
}

// Set the salt value from the Upsun Fixed entropy value, provided for this purpose.
if (isset($_ENV['PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY'])) {
  $config['secretsalt'] = $_ENV['PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY'];
}
```

##### Generate SSL certificates (optional)

Depending on your Identity Provider (IdP),
you may need to generate an SSL/TLS certificate to connect to the service provider.
If so, you should generate the certificate locally following the instructions in the [SimpleSAMLphp documentation](https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/index.md).
Your resulting IdP file should be placed in the `simplesamlphp/metadata` directory.
The certificate should be placed in the `simplesamlphp/cert` directory.
(Create it if needed.)

Then add the following line to your `simplesamlphp/config/config.php` file to tell the library where to find the certificate:

```php  {location="simplesamlphp/config/config.php"}
<?php
$config['certdir'] = dirname(__DIR__) . '/cert';
```

##### Deploy

Commit all changes and deploy the site, then enable the `simplesamlphp_auth` module within Drupal (usually by enabling it locally and pushing a config change).

Consult the module documentation for further information on how to configure the module itself.
Note that you shouldn't check the "Activate authentication via SimpleSAMLphp" checkbox in the module configuration until you have the rest of the configuration completed, or you may be locked out of the site.
### Drupal Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

##### How can I import configuration on production?

If you don't want to do so manually, include the following lines in your deploy hook in `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml
drush -y updatedb
drush -y config-import
```

That automatically runs `update.php` and imports configuration on every new deploy.

The above configuration is included by default if you used the Drupal example repository or created a project through the Console.

##### I'm getting a PDO Exception 'MySQL server has gone away'

Normally, this means there is a problem with the MySQL server container and you may need to increase the storage available to MySQL to resolve the issue. Ballooning MySQL storage can be caused by a number of items:

1. A large number of watchdog entries being captured.
Examine the watchdog logs and resolve the errors reported.
2. Cron should run at regular intervals to ensure cache tables get cleared out.
3. You are using database caching.
That isn't recommended, primarily because it can balloon the size of the database.
[Redis caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/redis.md) is recommended for all Drupal sites.

##### Why do I get "MySQL can't connect to the database server"?

If you are having a problem connecting to the database server, you need force a redeployment of the database container. To do so, you can edit the service definition to add or remove a small amount of storage and then push.

##### Can I use the name of the session cookie for caching?

For Drupal sites, the name of the session cookie is based on a hash of the domain name. This means that it's actually consistent for a specific website and can safely be used as a fixed value.

##### Why do I see "File not found"?

If you see a bare "File not found" error when accessing your Drupal site with a browser,
you've pushed your code as a vanilla project but no `index.php` has been found.

Make sure your repository contains an `index.php` file in the [web location root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

### Ibexa DXP with Fastly


Ibexa DXP is a “commercial extended” version of Ibexa OSS that includes, among other things, support for push-based purging on the Fastly CDN.

##### Remove Varnish configuration

In Ibexa DXP, Varnish is enabled by default when deploying on Upsun Fixed
To use Fastly, Varnish must be disabled:

- Remove environment variable `TRUSTED_PROXIES: "REMOTE_ADDR"` in [`.platform.app.yaml](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml)
- Remove the Varnish service in [`.platform/services.yaml`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/.platform/services.yaml)
- In [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/master/.platform/routes.yaml),
   change routes to use `myapp` instead of the `varnish` service you removed in previous step:

```diff {no-copy="true"}
 "https://{default}/":
     type: upstream
-     upstream: "varnish:http"
+     upstream: "myapp:http"
```

##### Setting up Ibexa DXP to use Fastly

Ibexa DXP's documentation includes instructions on how to [configure Ibexa DXP for Fastly](https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/infrastructure_and_maintenance/cache/http_cache/reverse_proxy/#using-varnish-or-fastly).
Follow the steps there to prepare Ibexa DXP for Fastly.

##### Set credentials

The best way to provide the Fastly credentials and configuration to Ibexa DXP on Upsun Fixed is via environment variables.
That way private credentials are never stored in Git.

Using the CLI, run the following commands to set the configuration on your production environment
(assumed to be `main` below, but change it to fit your setup).
(Note that they inherit to all other environments by default unless overridden.)

```bash
platform variable:create -e main --level environment env:HTTPCACHE_PURGE_TYPE --value 'fastly'
platform variable:create -e main --level environment env:FASTLY_SERVICE_ID --value 'YOUR_ID_HERE'
platform variable:create -e main --level environment env:FASTLY_KEY --value 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```

Replacing `YOUR_ID_HERE` with the Fastly Service ID and Key obtained from Fastly.

Note: On a Dedicated Gen 2 cluster, set those values on the `production` branch:

```bash
platform variable:set -e production env:HTTPCACHE_PURGE_TYPE fastly
platform variable:set -e production env:FASTLY_SERVICE_ID YOUR_ID_HERE
platform variable:set -e production env:FASTLY_KEY YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

##### Setup the correct VCL files

There are two VCL files provided as starting points for using Fastly with Ibexa DXP;
you can find them in `vendor/ibexa/fastly/fastly/ez_*.vcl`.
A VCL snippet can be found in `vendor/ibexa/fastly/fastly/snippet_re_enable_shielding.vcl`.
They handle varying cache by user context hash _(permissions)_
as well as several other needs by Ibexa DXP and it's underlying HttpCache system.

##### Configure Fastly

See the alternate [Go-live process for Fastly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md#enable-mtls) on Upsun Fixed.
This process is the same for any application.

### Get started

[Symfony](https://symfony.com/) is a PHP framework that you can use to create web applications.
Upsun Fixed is the official Symfony Cloud Application Platform.

This guide provides instructions for deploying, and working with, Symfony on Upsun Fixed.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

**Note**: 

The Symfony CLI wraps the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) with added features related to Symfony.
So when using Symfony, you can replace ``platform <command>`` by ``symfony cloud:<command>`` in all of your commands.

##### Create your Symfony app

To get familiar with Upsun Fixed, create a new Symfony project from scratch.
The present tutorial uses the [Symfony Demo](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.md#the-symfony-demo-application) app as an example :

```bash
symfony new <PROJECT_NAME> --demo --cloud
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
```

The `--demo` flag pulls the [Symfony Demo skeleton](https://github.com/symfony/demo). 
The `--cloud` flag automatically generates the Upsun Fixed configuration files.

**Note**: 

Alternatively, you can deploy an **existing Symfony project**.
To do so, follow these steps:

 - To generate a sensible default Upsun Fixed configuration,
run the following command from within the project’s directory:

```bash {}
symfony project:init
```

This generates the following set of configuration files: ``.platform.app.yaml``, ``.platform/services.yaml``, ``.platform/routes.yaml``, and ``php.ini``.

 - Commit these new files to your repository:

```bash {}
git add .platform.app.yaml .platform/services.yaml .platform/routes.yaml php.ini
git commit -m "Add Upsun Fixed configuration"
```

Upsun Fixed manages the entire infrastructure of your project,
from code to services (such as databases, queues, or search engines),
all the way to email sending, [cron jobs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/crons.md), and [workers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/workers.md).
This infrastructure is described through configuration files stored alongside your code.

##### Create the project

To create the project on Upsun Fixed, run the following command from within the project's directory:

```bash
symfony cloud:create --title PROJECT_TITLE --set-remote
```

The `--set-remote` flag sets the new project as the remote for this repository.

**Tip**: 

You can link any repository to an existing Upsun Fixed project using the following command:

```bash {}
symfony project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
```

##### Deploy your project

To deploy your project, run the following command:

```bash
symfony cloud:push
```

**Tip**: 

During deployment, the logs from the Upsun Fixed API are displayed in your terminal so you can monitor progress.
To stop the display of the logs **without interrupting the deployment**,
use ``CTRL+C`` in your terminal.
To go back to displaying the logs, run ``symfony cloud:activity:log``.

Congratulations, your first Symfony app has been deployed on Upsun Fixed!

Now that your app is deployed in production mode,
you can define a custom domain for your live website.
To do so, see how to [set up a custom domain on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-project.md#domains),
or run the following command:

```bash
symfony cloud:domain:add <YOUR_DOMAIN>
```

##### Make changes to your project

Now that your project is deployed, you can start making changes to it.
For example, you might want to fix a bug or add a new feature.

In your project, the main branch always represents the production environment.
Other branches are for developing new features, fixing bugs, or updating the infrastructure.

To make changes to your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new environment (a Git branch) to make changes without impacting production:

   ```bash
   symfony cloud:branch feat-a
   ```

   This command creates a new local `feat-a` Git branch based on the main Git branch
   and activates a related environment on Upsun Fixed.
   The new environment inherits the data (service data and assets) of its parent environment (the production environment here).

2. Make changes to your project.

   For example, if you created a Symfony Demo app,
   edit the `templates/default/homepage.html.twig` template and make the following visual changes:

   ```diff {location="templates/default/homepage.html.twig",}
   {% block body %}

   -        {{ 'title.homepage'|trans|raw }}
   +        Welcome to the Upsun Fixed Demo

   ```

3. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "Update text"
   ```

4. Deploy your changes to the `feat-a` environment:

   ```bash
   symfony cloud:push
   ```

   Note that each environment has its own domain name.
   To view the domain name of your new environment, run the following command:

   ```bash
   symfony cloud:url --primary
   ```

5. Iterate by changing the code, committing, and deploying.
   When satisfied with your changes, merge them to the main branch, deploy,
   and remove the feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feat-a
   symfony environment:delete feat-a
   git branch -d feat-a
   symfony cloud:push
   ```

   **Note**: 

Deploying to production was fast because the image built for the ``feat-a`` environment was reused.

   For a long running branch, to keep the code up-to-date with the main branch, use `git merge main` or `git rebase main`.
   You can also keep the data in sync with the production environment by using `symfony cloud:env:sync`.

##### Use a third-party Git provider

When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service, the Upsun Fixed Git
repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository. All your
changes take place in the third-party repository.

Add an integration to your existing third-party repository:

- [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
- [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
- [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

##### Next steps

###### Symfony integration

Learn more about the [Symfony integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/integration.md),
a set of tools and auto-configurations that makes it easier to use Upsun Fixed for Symfony projects.

###### Environment variables

When you use the Symfony integration,
more [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/environment-variables.md) related to Symfony are defined.

###### Local development

Once Symfony has been deployed on Upsun Fixed,
you might want to [set up a local development environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/local.md).

###### Symfony CLI tips

You might find the following commands useful when using the Symfony CLI.

-   Open the web administration console:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud: web
    ```

-   Open the URL of the current environment:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud: url
    ```

-   Open an SSH connection to your environment:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud: ssh
    ```

-   Initialize a new project using templates:

    ```bash
    symfony project:init
    ```

-   Get a list of all the domains:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:domains
    ```

-   Create a new environment:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:branch new-branch
    ```

-   Get a list of all the environments:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:environments
    ```

-   Push code to the current environment:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:push
    ```

-   Get a list of all the active projects:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:projects
    ```

-   Add a user to the project:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:user:add
    ```

-   List variables:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud:variables
    ```

You might find the following commands useful when using a database with your Symfony app.

-   Create a local dump of the remote database:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud: db:dump --relationship database
    ```

-   Run an SQL query on the remote database:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud: sql 'SHOW TABLES'
    ```

-   Import a local SQL file into a remote database:

    ```bash
    symfony cloud: sql < my_database_backup.sql
    ```

### Symfony integration

Symfony has a special integration with Upsun Fixed that makes it easier to use Upsun Fixed for Symfony projects.

**When using the Symfony integration, you are contributing financially to the Symfony project.**

The Symfony integration is automatically enabled when:

- You run the `symfony new` command with the `--cloud` option;

- You run `symfony project:init` on an existing project to automatically
  generate the Upsun Fixed configuration.

If you already have an Upsun Fixed configuration without the Symfony
integration, enable it by adding the following configuration:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    hooks:
      build: |
        set -x -e

        curl -fs https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash

        # ...
   ```

The **configurator** enables the following integration:

- It installs some helper scripts that you can use as the [default build and deploy hook scripts](#hooks):
    - [`symfony-build`](#symfony-build);
    - [`symfony-deploy`](#symfony-deploy);
    - [`php-ext-install`](#php-ext-install).

- It adds some [extra tools](#tools);

- It defines [additional infrastructure environment
variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/environment-variables.md#symfony-environment-variables) and
[environment variables for all
services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/environment-variables.md#service-environment-variables).

##### Tools

The **configurator** (`curl -fs https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash`) is a script specially crafted for Upsun Fixed.
It ensures that projects are always using the latest version of the following tools:

- [croncape](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/crons.md#use-croncape) for cron feedback
- [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

##### Hooks

The `hooks` section defines the scripts that Upsun Fixed runs at specific times of an application lifecycle:

- The [build hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook) is run during the build process
- The [deploy hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook) is run during the deployment process
- The [post-deploy hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook) is run after the deploy hook,
  once the application container starts accepting connections

Here's the default `hooks` section optimized for Symfony projects:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -x -e

    curl -s https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash

    symfony-build

  deploy: |
    set -x -e

    symfony-deploy
```

**Warning**: 

As each hook is executed as a single script, a hook is considered as failed only if the final command fails.
To have your hooks fail on the first failed command, start your scripts with ``set -e``.

For more information, see [Hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md).

To gain a better understanding of how hooks relate to each other when building and deploying an app,
see the [Upsun Fixed philosophy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/philosophy.md).

**Tip**: 

During the ``deploy`` or ``post_deploy`` hooks, you can execute actions for a specific environment type only.
To do so, in your ``.platform.app.yaml``file,
use the ``PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`` [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md)) in a condition:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  deploy: |
    if [ "${PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE}" != "production" ]; then
      symfony console app:dev:anonymize
    fi    
```

###### symfony-build

**symfony-build** is the script that builds a Symfony app in an optimized way for Upsun Fixed.
Use it as the main build script in your `build` hook.

**symfony-build** performs the following actions:

- Removes the development frontend file (Symfony <4)
- Installs PHP extensions through the [`php-ext-install` script](#php-ext-install)
- Installs application dependencies using Composer
- Optimizes the autoloader
- Builds the Symfony cache in an optimized way to limit the time it takes to deploy
- Installs the JavaScript dependencies via npm or Yarn
- Builds the production assets using Encore

To override the flags used by Composer, use the `$COMPOSER_FLAGS` environment variable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -x -e

    curl -s https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash

    COMPOSER_FLAGS="--ignore-platform-reqs" symfony-build
```

When installing dependencies, the script automatically detects if the app is using npm or Yarn.

To disable the JavaScript dependencies and asset building,
set `NO_NPM` or `NO_YARN` to `1` depending on your package manager.

To customize Node/npm/Yarn behaviors,
prefix the `symfony-build` script with the following environment variables:

- ``NODE_VERSION``:  to pinpoint the Node version that nvm is going to install.
  The default value is ``--lts``.
- ``YARN_FLAGS``: flags to pass to ``yarn install``.
  There is no default value.

###### symfony-deploy

Use **symfony-deploy** as the main deploy script in the `deploy` hook.
It only works if you're using the [`symfony-build` script](#symfony-build) in your `build` hook.

**symfony-deploy** performs the following actions:

- Replaces the Symfony cache with the cache generated during the build hook
- Migrates the database when the Doctrine migration bundle is used

###### php-ext-install

You can use the **php-ext-install** script to compile and install PHP extensions
not provided out of the box by Upsun Fixed,
or when you need a specific version of an extension.
The script is written specifically for Upsun Fixed to ensure fast and reliable setup during the build step.

**php-ext-install** currently supports three ways of fetching sources:

- From [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/): ``php-ext-install redis 5.3.2``
- From a URL: ``php-ext-install redis https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis/archive/5.3.2.tar.gz``
- From a Git repository: ``php-ext-install redis https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis.git 5.3.2``

To ensure your app can be built properly, run ``php-ext-install`` after the [configurator](#tools)
but before [symfony-build](#symfony-build):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -x -e

    curl -s https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash

    php-ext-install redis 5.3.2

    symfony-build
```

When installing [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/) PHP extensions, you can configure
them directly as *variables* instead:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  php-ext:
    redis: 5.3.2
```

**Note**: 

The source code is cached between builds so compilation is skipped if it’s already been done.
Changing the source of downloads or the version invalidates this cache.

###### Advanced Node configuration

If you need to use the Node installation setup by [symfony-build](#symfony-build),
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -x -e

    curl -s https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash

    symfony-build

    # Setup everything to use the Node installation
    unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
    export NVM_DIR=${PLATFORM_APP_DIR}/.nvm
    set +x && . "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh" use --lts && set -x
    # Starting from here, everything is setup to use the same Node
    yarn encore dev
```

If you want to use two different Node versions,
use the following configuration instead:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -x -e

    curl -s https://get.symfony.com/cloud/configurator | bash

    symfony-build

    cd web/js_app
    unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
    export NVM_DIR=${PLATFORM_APP_DIR}/.nvm

    NODE_VERSION=8 yarn-install

    # Setup everything to use the Node installation
    set +x && . "${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh" use 8 && set -x

    # Starting from here, everything is setup to use Node 8
    yarn build --environment=prod
```

### Environment variables

By default, Upsun Fixed exposes some [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
If you're using the [Symfony integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/integration.md),
more [infrastructure environment variables](#symfony-environment-variables) related to Symfony are defined.

As Symfony relies heavily on environment variables to configure application services (such as the database or the mailer DSN),
the Symfony integration automatically defines [environment variables for all the services](#service-environment-variables) connected to your app.

**Tip**: 

The code that defines these additional environment variables is part of the open-source [Symfony CLI tool](https://symfony.com/download).
Check the code for [infrastructure](https://github.com/symfony-cli/symfony-cli/blob/main/envs/remote.go#L139)
and [service](https://github.com/symfony-cli/symfony-cli/blob/main/envs/envs.go#L110) environment variables on GitHub.

##### Symfony environment variables

Upsun Fixed exposes [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
about the app and its infrastructure.

The Symfony integration exposes more environment variables:

- `APP_ENV` is set to `prod` by default.
  You can manually override this value for a preview environment
  by setting the `SYMFONY_ENV` environment variable to `dev`, and remove it when done.

- `APP_DEBUG` is set to `0` by default.
  You can manually override this value for a preview environment
  by setting the `SYMFONY_DEBUG` environment variable to `1`, and remove it when done.

- `APP_SECRET` is set to the value of `PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY`, which is a random and unique value for all Upsun Fixed projects.
  It overrides the value configured in the `.env` file of your app.

- `MAILFROM` is set to a random value.
  This value is used as a `From` header when using [croncape](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/crons.md#use-croncape).

- `SYMFONY_IS_WORKER` is set to `1` when the container is running in the context of a worker
  (instead of the main application container).

- `SYMFONY_CACHE_DIR` (only available during the build hook execution):
  The absolute path to a subdirectory of your build cache directory.

  Note that the build cache directory is persisted between builds but **isn't** deployed.
  It’s a good place to store build artifacts, such as downloaded files that can be reused between builds.

  **Tip**: 

This directory is shared by **all** builds on **all** branches.
Make sure your [build hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/integration.md#hooks) accounts for that.

  If you need to clear the build cache directory, run the `symfony cloud:project:clear-build-cache` command.

- `SYMFONY_PROJECT_DEFAULT_ROUTE_URL` (only defined at **runtime**): The default endpoint serving your project.
  Use this variable to avoid hard-coding domains that can be used to reach preview environments.
  Parts of the URL are also exposed as their own variables using the following syntax:
  `SYMFONY_PROJECT_DEFAULT_ROUTE_` followed by the name of the part (`SCHEME`, `DOMAIN`, `PORT`, and `PATH`).

  Guessing the default endpoint can prove difficult for multi-routes or multi-app projects.
  In such cases, the following preference order is used:

  1. Project-wide route defined only by `{default}` or `{all}` (no path)
  2. Project-wide route defined by `www.{default}` or `www.{all}` (no path)
  3. Route for the **current application** including `{default}` or `{all}` (might include a path)
  4. Route for the **current application** including `www.{default}` or `www.{all}` (might include a path)
  5. First route for the current application
  6. First route for the whole project

  When several routes match a rule, the first one wins, the user order is kept. There's no preference regarding protocols.

  **Tip**: 

If you have a multi-app project containing several publicly reachable apps,
you might need to determine the current application endpoint (for webhooks for example)
and the project endpoint (to send emails for example).

In this case, you can use an additional ``SYMFONY_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_ROUTE_*`` set of environment variables.
The same rules are applied to determine their value, but only routes matching the current application are evaluated.

##### Service environment variables

When using the [Symfony integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/integration.md), information about services
are exposed via environment variables.

To list all of the exposed environment variables, run the following command:

```bash
symfony ssh -- symfony var:export --multiline
```

Each exposed environment variable is prefixed by the relationship name.
For example, if you have the following [relationships](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) in your configuration:

```yaml
relationships:
  database:
    service: securitydb
    endpoint: postgresql
```

The environment variables for the database service is prefixed by `DATABASE_`
which is the upper-cased version of the key defined in the relationship.
For example, you could have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

Most environment variable names are derived from the relationship and service names.
But some are defined based on Symfony conventions, such as [`MAILER_DSN`](#emails).

**Note**: 

Environment variables aren’t exposed when the build hook script is running
as services aren’t available during the [build process](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#the-build).

###### Emails

The configuration is exposed via the following environment variables:

- `MAILER_ENABLED`: 1 if outgoing emails are enabled, 0 otherwise

- `MAILER_USER`: The SMTP server user
- `MAILER_PASSWORD`: The SMTP server password

Symfony Mailer automatically uses the value of `MAILER_DSN`.

###### HTTP

To override them, use the ``DATABASE_VERSION`` and ``DATABASE_CHARSET`` environment variables respectively.

###### PostgreSQL

The [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md) configuration is exposed via the following environment variables

### Workers

Workers (or consumers) are a great way to off-load processing in the background
to make an app as fast as possible.
You can implement workers in Symfony smoothly thanks to the [Messenger component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.md).

To deploy a worker, add an entry under the ``workers`` section [in your app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  mails:
    commands:
      start: symfony console messenger:consume --time-limit=60 --memory-limit=128M
```

Note that the `symfony` binary is available when you use the [Symfony
integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/integration.md) in your Upsun Fixed app configuration.

On Upsun Fixed, worker containers run the exact same code as the web container.
The container image is built only once and deployed multiple times in its own container alongside the web container.
The *build* hook and dependencies might not vary but,
as these containers are independent, they can be customized the same way using common properties.
The values defined for the main container are used as default values.

**Tip**: 

When the container is running in the context of a worker, the
``SYMFONY_IS_WORKER`` environment variable is defined and set to ``1``.

The ``commands.start`` key is required.
It specifies the command you can use to launch the application worker.
If the command specified by the ``start`` key terminates, it's restarted automatically.

For more information, see [Workers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers).

**Warning**: 

Web and worker containers don’t share mounts targets.
So you can’t share files between those containers using the filesystem.
To share data between containers, use [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).

### Cron Jobs

Cron jobs allow you to run scheduled tasks at specified times or intervals.
To set up a cron job, add a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  snapshot:
    spec: 0 5 * * *
    commands:
      start: croncape symfony ...
```

To run a command in a cron hook for specific environment types,
use the `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` environment variable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  snapshot:
    spec: 0 5 * * *
    commands:
      start: |
        # only run for the production environment, aka main branch
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = "production" ]; then
          croncape symfony ...
        fi
```

##### Use croncape

When using the [Symfony integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/integration),
you can use `croncape` to get feedback through emails when something goes wrong.

To specify which email address `croncape` must send the feedback emails to,
add a `MAILTO` environment variable.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
symfony var:create -y --level=project --name=env:MAILTO --value=sysadmin@example.com
```

To ensure better reliability, `croncape` sends the emails using:

- `project-id@cron.noreply.platformsh.site` as the sender address (`project-id+branch@cron.noreply.platformsh.site` for non-main environments)
- the provided [Upsun Fixed SMTP service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/environment-variables.md#emails), even if you define your own `MAILER_*` environment variables

To use a custom SMTP and/or custom sender address, follow these steps:

1. To specify a sender address, define a [`MAILFROM` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/environment-variables.md#symfony-environment-variables).

2. Define the mandatory [environment variables to use your own email service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/symfony/environment-variables.md#emails).
   Note that only SMTP connections are supported.

3. To disable the provided SMTP service, run `symfony cloud:env:info enable_smtp false`.

**Note**: 

To use ``croncape``, SMTP must be enabled on the environment, where the [PLATFORM_SMTP_HOST](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) environment variable is accessible.
This variable is available, and SMTP enabled, by default on all production environments.

This is not the case for preview (non-production) environments, where it must be enabled with the command ``symfony cloud:env:info enable_smtp true``.

### Continous Observability with Blackfire

[Blackfire.io](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/blackfire.md) is the recommended solution
for monitoring and profiling web sites and apps.
Blackfire works seamlessly with any app built with Symfony.

Blackfire PHP SDK provides the following [integrations with
Symfony](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/symfony/index):

- [Symfony HTTPClient](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/symfony/http-client)
- [Symfony Messenger](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/symfony/messenger)
- [Symfony CLI Commands Monitoring](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/symfony/cli-commands-monitoring)
- [Symfony Functional Tests Production](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/symfony/functional-tests)

A `.blackfire.yaml` file is provided within the [Symfony Templates](https://github.com/symfonycorp/platformsh-symfony-template/blob/7.2/.blackfire.yaml)
to help you bootstrap the writing of custom [performance tests](https://blackfire.io/docs/testing-cookbooks/index)
and automated [builds](https://blackfire.io/docs/builds-cookbooks/index).

### Local development

When you develop a Symfony project, a significant amount of work takes place
locally rather than on an active Upsun Fixed environment. You want to ensure
that the process of local development is as close as possible to a deployed
environment.

You can achieve this through various approaches. For example, you can use
Symfony Server with tethered data

To do so, when testing changes locally, you can connect your locally running
Symfony Server to service containers on an active Upsun Fixed environment.

This methodology has several advantages:

- It avoids installing anything on your local machine but PHP;
- It ensures that you are using the same versions of all services on your local
  machine and in production.

**Warning**: 

Never use this method on the **main** environment as changes made on your local
machine will impact production data.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- A local copy of the repository for a  project running on Upsun Fixed.

  You can clone an integrated source repository and set the remote branch.
  To do so, run ``symfony cloud:project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
``.
- The [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)

##### 1. Start your Symfony Server

To start your [Symfony
Server](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html) locally and
display your Symfony app, run the following command:

```bash
symfony server:start -d
symfony open:local
```

This starts the Symfony Server and opens the app in your local browser.

##### 2. Create the tethered connection

1.  Create a new environment off of production:

    ```bash
    symfony branch new-feature main
    ```

2.  Open an SSH tunnel to the new environment's services:

    ```bash
    symfony tunnel:open
    ````
    This command returns the addresses for SSH tunnels to all of your services:

    ```bash
    symfony tunnel:open
        SSH tunnel opened to rediscache at: redis://127.0.0.1:30000
        SSH tunnel opened to database at: pgsql://main:main@127.0.0.1:30001/main

        Logs are written to: /Users/acmeUser/.platformsh/tunnels.log

        List tunnels with: symfony tunnels
        View tunnel details with: symfony tunnel:info
        Close tunnels with: symfony tunnel:close

        Save encoded tunnel details to the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable using:
        export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(symfony tunnel:info --encode)"
    ```

3.  To expose Upsun Fixed services to your Symfony app, run the following
    command:

    ```bash
    symfony var:expose-from-tunnel
    ```

    This automatically configures your local Symfony app to use all your
    remote Upsun Fixed services (remote database, remote Redis component, etc.).

    To check that you're now using remote data and components from Upsun Fixed,
    reload your local app within your browser.

4.  When you've finished your work,
    close the tunnels to your services by running the following command:

    ```bash
    symfony var:expose-from-tunnel --off
    symfony tunnel:close --all -y
    ```

### FAQ

##### Why is `DATABASE_URL` not defined during the build hook?

During the build hook, services are not available to avoid breaking the
application that is still live. That is why the Symfony integration does not
expose environment variables during the build hook.

The `cache:clear` command does not need to connect to the database by default,
except if you are using the Doctrine ORM and the database engine version is not
set in your configuration.

The version information can be set in your `.env` file or in the
`doctrine.yaml` configuration file. The only important pieces of information there are
the database engine and the version; everything else will be ignored.

Note that the environment variables are available in the deploy hook.

##### How can I access my application logs?

To display the application log file (`/var/log/app.log` file), run the following command:

```bash
symfony log app --tail
```

All the log messages generated by your app are sent to this `app.log` file.
This includes language errors such as PHP errors, warnings, notices,
as well as uncaught exceptions.
The file also contains your application logs if you log on `stderr`.

Note that Upsun Fixed manages the `app.log` file for you.
This is to prevent disks from getting filled and using very fast local drives instead of slower network disks.
Make sure your apps always output their logs to `stderr`.

If you use Monolog, add the following configuration to your `config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml` file:

```gitignore
--- a/config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml
+++ b/config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml
@@ -11,7 +11,7 @@ monolog:
            members: [nested, buffer]
        nested:
            type: stream
-            path: "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"
+            path: php://stderr
            level: debug
        buffer:
            type: buffer
```

**Warning**: 

If you log deprecations, make sure you **also** log them on ``stderr``.

##### What's this "Oops! An Error Occurred" message about?

The *Oops! An Error Occurred* message comes from your app and is automatically generated based on the Symfony error template.

###### The server returned a "500 Internal Server Error"

![A 500 error page in production mode](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/symfony/production-error-500.png "0.35")

If your app's working as expected locally but you see the previous error message on Upsun Fixed,
it usually means you have a configuration error or a missing dependency.

To fix this issue, search your application logs.
They likely contain an error message describing the root cause:

```bash
symfony logs all
  [app] [14-Aug-2020 10:52:27 UTC] [critical] Uncaught PHP Exception Exception: [...]
  [app]
  [php.access] 2020-08-14T10:52:27Z GET 500 2.386 ms 2048 kB 419.11% /
  [access] 78.247.136.119 - - [14/Aug/2020:10:52:27 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 843 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.125 Safari/537.36"
```

If the error occurs on a preview environment,
or on the main environment of a non-production project,
you can also enable Symfony's dev/debug mode to inspect the cause of the error:

```bash
# Enable debug mode
symfony env:debug
# Disable debug mode
symfony env:debug --off
```

###### The server returned a "404 Not Found"

By default, new Symfony apps come without controllers, which means there's no homepage to show.
As a result, when you run your project locally, the following welcome page is displayed:

![The default Symfony welcome page in development mode](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/symfony/new-symfony-welcome-page.png "0.45")

But when you run your project on Upsun Fixed, the following error is displayed instead:

![A 404 error page in production mode](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/symfony/production-error-404.png "0.35")

This is because Upsun Fixed runs in production mode, leading Symfony to show a generic 404 error.
To fix this issue, [create your first Symfony page](https://symfony.com/doc/current/page_creation.md).

If you've already created a custom homepage, make sure you perform the following actions:

1. Commit all your files.
2. Run the `symfony push` command and check that the deployment is successful.

##### Other issues

For other issues unrelated to Symfony, see [Troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

### Deploy Laravel on Upsun Fixed

[Laravel](https://laravel.com) is an open-source PHP Framework.

To get Laravel running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Laravel site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Laravel site.

    -   Use a ready-made [Laravel template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/laravel).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Laravel template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure Laravel](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/laravel/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Laravel for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Laravel in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Laravel requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}

```

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure  to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` and `cache` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Laravel app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://www.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "app:http"
"https://{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://www.{default}/"

```

Now that you have Laravel configured, connect it with Laravel Bridge.

#### Laravel Bridge

Connect your Laravel-based app to Upsun Fixed with the `platformsh/laravel-bridge` library.

Laravel expects all configuration to come in through environment variables with specific names in a specific format.
Upsun Fixed provides configuration information as environment variables in a different specific format.
This library handles mapping the Upsun Fixed variables to the format Laravel expects for common values.

###### Usage

Require this package using Composer.
When Composer's autoload is included, this library is activated and the environment variables set.

```bash
composer require platformsh/laravel-bridge
```

Make sure to clear the cache on relevant Upsun Fixed environments afterwards.

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

###### What is mapped

* If an Upsun Fixed relationship named `database` is defined,
  it is taken as an SQL database and mapped to the `DB_*` environment variables for Laravel.
* If an Upsun Fixed relationship named `rediscache` is defined,
  it is mapped to the `REDIS_*` environment variables for Laravel.
  The `CACHE_DRIVER` variable is also set to `redis` to activate it automatically.
* If an Upsun Fixed relationship named `redissession` is defined,
  the `SESSION_DRIVER` is set to `redis` and the `REDIS_*` variables set based on that relationship.
  NOTE: This means you _*must*_ set 2 relationships to the same Redis service and endpoint,
  as Laravel reuses the same backend connection.
* The Laravel `APP_KEY` is set based on the `PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY` variable,
  which is provided for exactly this purpose.
* The Laravel `APP_URL` variable is set based on the current route, when possible.
* The `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` variable is set to `true` if it's not already defined.
  An Upsun Fixed environment is by default encrypted-always,
  so there's no reason to allow unencrypted cookies.
  Overwrite this by setting the Upsun Fixed variable `env:SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` to 0.
* The `MAIL_DRIVER`, `MAIL_HOST`, and `MAIL_PORT` variables are set
  to support sending email through the Upsun Fixed mail gateway. 
  The `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value is also set to `0` to disable TLS,
  as it isn't needed or supported within Upsun Fixed's network.
  Note that doing so is only supported on Laravel 6.0.4 and later.
  On earlier versions, you *must* manually modify `mail.php` and set `encryption` to `null`:

  ```php
      'encryption' => null,
  ```

###### Common environment variables not set

Laravel provides reasonable defaults for many environment variables already
and this library doesn't override those.
Customize them by setting an Upsun Fixed variable named `env:ENV_NAME`.
(Note the `env:` prefix.)

The variables you are most likely to want to override are:

* `env:APP_NAME`: The human-friendly name of the app.
* `env:APP_ENV`: Whether the app is in `production` or `development` mode.
* `env:APP_DEBUG`: Set `true` to enable verbose error messages.

Now that your Laravel app is connected to Upsun Fixed, deploy it to see it in action.

#### Workers, cron jobs, and task scheduling

**Note**: 

The use of workers requires a [Medium plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#multiple-apps-in-a-single-project)
or greater.

Laravel offers a very convenient and flexible way of scheduling tasks. A large set of [helper functions](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling#schedule-frequency-options) help you schedule commands and jobs.

Once the scheduled tasks are defined, they need to be effectively executed at the right time and pace.
The recommended way is a cron configuration entry running the `artisan schedule:run` command schedule for every minute.
However, on Upsun Fixed the [minimum time between cron jobs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#cron-job-timing)
depends on your plan. Task scheduling may then be contradicted by the cron minimum frequency. Schedules outside the
specified cron frequency are ignored and the related tasks aren't triggered.

Due to this conflict, we suggest utilizing [workers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/workers.md) to run both the scheduler and the queue
systems (the [Laravel template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/laravel) utilizes this method). In order to have
enough resources to support these workers as well as services (e.g. MariaDB, Redis, etc), a
**[Medium plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#multiple-apps-in-a-single-project) _or greater_ is required**.

To use workers to handle scheduling and queues add the following to your .platform.app.yaml file:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue:
    size: S
    commands:
      # To minimize leakage, the queue worker will stop every hour
      # and get restarted automatically.
      start: |
        php artisan queue:work --max-time=3600
    disk: 256
  scheduler:
    size: S
    commands:
      start: php artisan schedule:work
    disk: 256
```

**Note**: 

By default, [workers inherit all top level properties](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/workers.md#inheritance) from the parent application.
You may need to override certain properties in the worker configuration above depending on your application.

#### Continous observability with Blackfire

[Blackfire.io](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/blackfire.md) is the recommended solution for monitoring and profiling web sites and applications. Blackfire works seamlessly with any application built with Laravel, like any PHP application.

For advanced cases, the Blackfire PHP SDK provides the following integrations with Laravel:
- [Laravel Artisan](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/artisan)
- [Laravel Horizon and other queue services](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/horizon)
- [Laravel Tests](https://blackfire.io/docs/php/integrations/laravel/tests)

A `.blackfire.yaml` file is provided within the [Laravel Template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/laravel/blob/master/.blackfire.yaml) to help you bootstrap the writing of custom [performance tests](https://blackfire.io/docs/testing-cookbooks/index) and automated [builds](https://blackfire.io/docs/builds-cookbooks/index).

#### Laravel Octane

[Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane) aims at improving the performance of Laravel applications by serving them using high-powered application servers, including [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src), [Open Swoole](https://openswoole.com/), and [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/).

**Note**: 

Laravel Octane requires PHP 8.0+.

###### Install

Install the PHP extension for Swoole or Open Swoole during the build.

Take advantage of an [installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install_swoole.sh).
You need to pass 2 parameters:

* Which Swoole project to use: `openswoole` or `swoole`
* Which version to install

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
    build: |
        set -e
        ...
        curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install_swoole.sh | { bash /dev/fd/3 openswoole 4.11.0 ; } 3<&0
```

###### Use

Require Laravel Octane using Composer.

```bash
composer require laravel/octane
```

Then make sure to clear the cache on all relevant Upsun Fixed environments.

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

Override the default web server with a [custom start command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#alternate-start-commands).
Octane should listen on a TCP socket.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: tcp
    protocol: http
  commands:
    start: php artisan octane:start --server=swoole --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT
  locations:
    "/":
      passthru: true
      scripts: false
      allow: false
```

#### Deploy Laravel


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and deploy (even on Friday)!

### Run a Laravel app on your local machine

Upsun Fixed provides support for locally running a Laravel app
that has been deployed on Upsun Fixed, including its services.
Once you've downloaded the code of the Laravel app you deployed on Upsun Fixed,
you can make changes to the project without pushing to Upsun Fixed each time to test them.

You can build your app locally using the Upsun Fixed CLI,
even when the app functionality depends on a number of services.
You can run your Laravel app locally with all of its services
by following the steps for your chosen development platform:
#### Develop locally with DDEV

[DDEV](https://ddev.com/) is a tool for local PHP development environments based on Docker containers.

To learn more about how to run your Laravel app in a local DDEV-managed environment,
see the [official integration documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/platform/).
#### Develop locally with Lando

[Lando](https://lando.dev/) is a development tool based on Docker containers,
which dramatically simplifies local development.

To learn more about how to run your Laravel app in a local Lando-managed environment,
see the [official integration documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/).

### Deploy TYPO3 on Upsun Fixed

TYPO3 is an Open Source Enterprise PHP-based CMS framework. The recommended way to deploy TYPO3 on Upsun Fixed is by using Composer, the PHP package management suite.

This guide assumes you are using the well-supported Composer flavor of TYPO3.

**Note**: 

If you have a TYPO3 site that’s not using Composer,
there’s a useful guide in the TYPO3 documentation for [migrating a TYPO3 project to composer](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/master/en-us/MigrateToComposer/Index.md).

To get TYPO3 running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a [Composer-flavored TYPO3](https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS.BaseDistribution) site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic [Composer-flavored TYPO3](https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS.BaseDistribution) site.
        See an example for doing this under initializing a project.

    -   Use a ready-made [TYPO3 template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/typo3).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a TYPO3 template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.
        If you don’t have code, create a new TYPO3 project from scratch.
The following commands create a brand new TYPO3 project using Composer.

```bash {}
composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution <PROJECT_NAME> ^10
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
git init
git add . && git commit -m "Init TYPO3 from upstream."
```

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/typo3/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure TYPO3 for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for TYPO3 in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why TYPO3 requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

Note that the command ``php vendor/bin/typo3cms install:generatepackagestate`` is run during the build hook.
The command ensures all installed extensions are enabled.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
# in the same project.

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

We recommend the latest [MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) version for TYPO3,
although you can also use Oracle MySQL or [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md) if you prefer.
We also strongly recommend using [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md) for TYPO3 caching.
Our TYPO3 template comes [pre-configured to use Redis](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/typo3#user-content-customizations) for caching.

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure TYPO3 to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` and `cache` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# This file describes an application's services. You can define as many services as your
# application requires, subject to your plan's resource restrictions.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/.

# MariaDB/MySQL 10.4 service with 2048MB of allocated disk.
# The service name `db` is used in defining the `database` relationship in the
# `.platform.app.yaml` file.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/mysql/.
db:
    type: mysql:10.4
    disk: 2048

# Redis 5.0 service definition.
# The service name `cache` is used in defining the `rediscache` relationship in the
# `.platform.app.yaml` file.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/redis/.
cache:
    type: redis:5.0
```

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.
Generally, you want the user session cookie, which is included in the example for TYPO3.
You may need to add other cookies depending on what additional modules you have installed.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a TYPO3 app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# This file describes an application's routes. You can define as many routes as your
# application requires.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/

# URL template for the main route, where `{default}` is replaced by
# the Upsun Fixed generated environment URL or the configured domain.
"https://{default}/":
    # This route serves an application (upstream).
    type: upstream

    # Defines the upstream according to the form `:http`,
    # where the `name` attribute from `.platform.app.yaml` is used.
    upstream: "app:http"

    # Optional route identifier; constant across all environments.
    #
    # For TYPO3, the id "main" is used within `public/typo3conf/PlatformshConfig.php`
    # to set the `base` attribute for the site (in `config/sites/main/config.yaml`) from the
    # Upsun Fixed environment variable `PLATFORM_ROUTES`.
    id: "main"

    # HTTP cache configuration.
    cache:
        # Enabled (default `true`, but only if `cache` attribute is unspecified).
        enabled: true

        # List of allowed cookie names, all others are ignored.
        cookies:
          # Used to identify a backend session when Backend User logged in.
          - 'be_typo_user'
          # Used to identify session ID when logged into TYPO3 Frontend.
          - 'fe_typo_user'
          # Default PHP session cookie.
          - 'PHPSESSID'
          # Validates sessions for System Maintenance Area.
          - 'Typo3InstallTool'

```

#### Customize TYPO3 for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed,
it’s time to make your TYPO3 site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment.
There are a number of additional steps that are either required or recommended,
depending on how well you want to optimize your site.

###### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

The following examples use it, so install it through Composer if you haven't already.

```bash
composer require platformsh/config-reader
```

###### Avoiding deadlock with the Local Page Error Handler

A default TYPO3 installation has a risk of deadlocks when run on low-worker PHP-FPM configurations.
Specifically, TYPO3 handles 403 and 404 error pages by issuing a full HTTP request back to itself with no timeout,
which can lead to process starvation.
There are two required steps to avoid this problem.

First, you need to install the [Local Page Error Handler](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/pxa_lpeh/) extension for TYPO3 with the command:

```bash
composer require pixelant/pxa-lpeh
```

Second, you need to add a timeout that sets an HTTP timeout of at least 3 seconds instead of the default several minutes to a new `public/typo3conf/PlatformshConfiguration.php`.
You can see this line in context of the full file in the [configuration](#environment) section below.

```php
<?php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']['timeout'] = 3;
```

**Note**: 

The suggested timeout of three seconds above may end up being too short
if your TYPO3 instance performs external requests other than to itself as described here.
If the instance makes long requests,
such as when synchronizing data as a part of a TYPO3 Scheduler task with an external API,
it’s best instead to place these operations in workers.

You still need to enable the `pixelant/pxa-lpeh` extension,
which you can do by running the command:

```bash
php vendor/bin/typo3 extension:activate pxa_lpeh
```

###### TYPO3 CMS's `web-dir`

Upsun Fixed recommends serving TYPO3 from its default subdirectory `public`.
`public` can be seen already throughout your `.platform.app.yaml` file in `web.locations.root`, `mounts`
and within your `build` and `deploy` hooks.
You need to assign `public` to the `cms.web-dir` attribute in your `composer.json` file,
and it's a good idea to `update` dependencies once you have done so:

```bash
composer config extra.typo3/cms.web-dir public && composer update --no-scripts
```

###### Site

You have to locate the site configuration files (`config.yaml`) in your repository's `config/sites/<SITEID>` subdirectories.
For the purposes of this guide, you need to set the `base` attribute to an environment variable called `PLATFORM_ROUTES_MAIN`.
You can also add the definition to your existing `baseVariant` attribute for production if desired.

```yaml
# TYPO3 Site Handling configuration YAML.
# 
# See https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/9.5/en-us/ApiOverview/SiteHandling/Basics.html.
rootPageId: 1

# The base domain used to run the TYPO3 site. Here, the environment variable `PLATFORM_ROUTES_MAIN` set in 
# `public/typo3/conf/PlatformshConfiguration.php` is used. 
base: '%env(PLATFORM_ROUTES_MAIN)%'

errorHandling:
    -
        errorCode: '404'

        errorContentSource: 't3://page?uid=5'

# Environment-specific `base` configuration.

# 
# See https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/9.5/en-us/ApiOverview/SiteHandling/StaticRoutes.html#sitehandling-staticroutes.
routes:
    -
        route: robots.txt
        type: staticText
        content: "User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /typo3/"
```

You define this environment variable in the next section,
but its purpose is to retrieve the root domain
(since you haven't yet registered a domain name on the Upsun Fixed project,
this is a hashed placeholder domain generated from the environment)
from the environment variable `PLATFORM_ROUTES`.

**Note**: 

The above ``base`` configuration only includes the production case (running on Upsun Fixed)
or at least exporting a ``PLATFORM_ROUTES_MAIN`` environment variable to match during local development.
Alternatively, you can place the above definition within a ``baseVariant`` definition for the production environment
alongside another development environment ``condition`` for local.

```yaml {}
baseVariants:
  -
    base: '%env(VIRTUAL_HOST)%'
    condition: 'applicationContext == "Development/local"'
  -
    base: '%env(PLATFORM_ROUTES_MAIN)%'
    condition: 'applicationContext == "Production"'
```

###### Environment

Finally, you can start using the Upsun Fixed Configuration Reader library
to starting reading from the environment from within your application.
In a `public/typo3conf/PlatformshConfiguration.php` file, you can use the library to:

- Verify the deployment is occurring on an Upsun Fixed project (`if (!$platformConfig->isValidPlatform())`)
- Verify that it's not running during build,
  when services aren't yet available (`if ($platformConfig->inBuild())`)
- Set the `PLATFORM_ROUTES_MAIN` environment variable used in `config/sites/main/config.yaml`)
- Configure TYPO3's database (`TYPO3_CONF_VARS.DB.Connections.Default`) using credentials from the `database` relationship
  (`$databaseConfig = $platformConfig->credentials('database')`)
- Configure TYPO3's `cacheConfigurations` to use Redis via your `rediscache` relationship
- Configure the HTTP timeout to 3 seconds
  to avoid the PHP-FPM-related [deadlock described above](#avoiding-deadlock-with-the-local-page-error-handler).

Then include the `require_once()` function within your `public/typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php` file to load the Upsun Fixed-specific configuration into the site if present.

```php
<?php

/**

// Include the Upsun Fixed-specific configuration.
// This file will no-op on its own if not on Upsun Fixed.
$platformshFile = __DIR__ . '/PlatformshConfiguration.php';
if (file_exists($platformshFile)) {
    require_once($platformshFile);
}
```

#### Deploy TYPO3


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Post-install (new site)

The following section is only relevant when deploying the TYPO3 template
or creating a new site from scratch locally using Composer.
If you're migrating an existing site, you can move on to the next step.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  # The deploy hook runs after your application has been deployed and started.
  # Code can't be modified at this point but the database is available.
  # The site isn't accepting requests while this script runs so keep it
  # fast.
  deploy: |
    # Exit hook immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
    set -e

    # Set TYPO3 site defaults on first deploy.
    if [ ! -f var/platformsh.installed ]; then
      # Copy the created LocalConfiguration into the writable location.
      cp public/typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.FromSource.php var/LocalConfiguration.php

      # On first install, create an inital admin user with a default password.
      # *CHANGE THIS VALUE IMMEDIATELY AFTER INSTALLATION*
      php vendor/bin/typo3cms install:setup \
        --install-steps-config=src/SetupDatabase.yaml \
        --site-setup-type=no \
        \
        --admin-user-name=admin \
        --admin-password=password \
        --skip-extension-setup \
        --no-interaction

      # Sets up all extensions that are marked as active in the system.
      php vendor/bin/typo3cms extension:setupactive || true

      # Create file that indicates first deploy and installation has been completed.
      touch var/platformsh.installed
    fi;
```

The template is designed to run the TYPO3 installer only on the first deploy
by creating a placeholder `platformsh.installed` on the `var` mount.
You should not remove this file unless you want the next deployment to run through the installer again.

Next, when the deploy hook ran through the installer, it set an initial username and password for the TYPO3 site,
which you should update immediately.
Visit `/typo3` on the generated URL for the environment and login with those temporary `admin` credentials.
Then click on the user icon in the top right of the page and go to User Settings > Password to update.

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

###### Adding extensions

All TYPO3 extensions can be installed and managed using Composer. Install them locally to update and commit changes to your `composer-lock.json` file. The build process will download the correct version on the committed `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files, which should be committed to Git.

```bash
composer require friendsoftypo3/headless
```

###### Updating TYPO3 and extensions

Since TYPO3 is fully managed via Composer, you can run `composer update` periodically to get new versions of both TYPO3 and any extensions you have installed via Composer.
Commit the resulting changes to your `composer.lock` file and push again.

The [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) has more information on options to update individual modules or perform other tasks.

Note that updating modules or core through the TYPO3 backend isn't possible, as the file system is read-only.
All updates should be done through composer to update the lock file, and then pushed to Git.

###### Why are there warnings in the install tool?

The TYPO3 install tool doesn't yet fully understand when you are working on a cloud environment and may warn you that some folders aren't writable.

Don't worry, your TYPO3 installation is fully functional.

### Deploy WordPress on Upsun Fixed

WordPress is a popular Content Management System written in PHP. The recommended way to deploy WordPress on Upsun Fixed is by using Composer, the PHP package management suite. The most popular and supported way to do so is with the [John Bloch](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) Composer fork script. This guide assumes from the beginning that you're migrating a Composer-flavored WordPress repository.

**Note**: 

With some caveats, it’s possible to deploy WordPress to Upsun Fixed without using Composer, [though not recommended](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer.md). You can consult the [“WordPress without Composer on Upsun Fixed”](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla.md) guide to set that up, but do consider [upgrading to use Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer/migrate.md).

To get WordPress running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a [Composer-flavored WordPress](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic [Composer-flavored WordPress](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) site.
        See an example for doing this under initializing a project.

    -   Use a ready-made [WordPress template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-composer).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a WordPress template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

**Note**: 

All of the examples in this deployment guide use the [wordpress-composer](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-composer) template maintained by the Upsun Fixed team. That template is built using the [John Bloch Composer fork](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) of WordPress, which is meant to facilitate managing WordPress with Composer, but the template comes with its own assumptions. One is that WordPress core is downloaded by default into a ``wordpress`` subdirectory when installed, but other teams would rather specify another subdirectory along with many more assumptions.

An alternative approach is shown in Upsun Fixed’s [Bedrock template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-bedrock), which installs core into ``web/wp``, exports environment customization to a separate ``config/environments`` directory, and largely depends on setting environment variables to configure the database. Your are free to follow that template as an example with this guide, though there are slight differences. For its ease of use, the Bedrock approach is often used as a substitute starting point in some of the other WordPress guides in this documentation.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.
        If you don’t have code, create a new WordPress project from scratch.
The following command creates a brand new WordPress project.

```bash {}
git clone https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress && cd wordpress
```

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure WordPress for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for WordPress in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why WordPress requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

Notice that the build ``flavor`` is set to ``composer``, which will automatically download WordPress core, as well as your plugins, themes, and dependencies during the build step as defined in your ``composer.json`` file. Since WordPress’s caching and uploads require write access at runtime, they’ve been given corresponding [mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) defined for them at the bottom of the file. MariaDB is accessible to WordPress internally at ``database.internal`` thanks to the relationship definition ``database``. The [WordPress CLI](https://packagist.org/packages/wp-cli/wp-cli) is added as a build dependency, but we will still need to add some additional dependencies in the next step so that it can be used by the application and via SSH.

```

**Note**: 

During the template’s build hook above, you see an ``rsync`` command that allows you to commit and use plugins that aren’t accessible via Composer. The command moves all non-Composer plugins in a committed ``plugins`` directory to the final ``wp-content/plugins`` destination so that they can be enabled through the administration panel.

If you are migrating WordPress or starting from scratch, you should copy this line for your committed non-Composer plugins and, if needed, modify it to move committed ``themes`` to ``wp-content/themes`` in the same way.

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

We recommend the latest [MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) version for WordPress.

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure  to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

```yaml
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/
# Full list of available services: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/services/available/
db:
    type: mariadb:10.4
    disk: 2048
```

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.
Generally, you want the user session cookie, which is included in the example for WordPress.
You may need to add other cookies depending on what additional modules you have installed.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a WordPress app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/
"https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "app:http"
    # Upsun Fixed supports HTTP caching at the server level. Caching is enabled by default, but is only applied to
    # GET and HEAD requests.
    # More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/cache/
    cache:
        # All possible cache configuration options: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/cache/configuration-properties/
        enabled: true
        # Base the cache on the session cookies. Ignore all other cookies.
        cookies:
            - '/^wordpress_logged_in_/'
            - '/^wordpress_sec_/'
            - 'wordpress_test_cookie'
            - '/^wp-settings-/'
            - '/^wp-postpass/'
            - '/^wp-resetpass-/'

# A basic redirect definition
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/examples/redirect/
"https://www.{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://{default}/"

```

#### Customize WordPress for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed, it’s time to make your WordPress site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment.

###### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

The following examples use it, so install it through Composer if you haven't already.

```bash
composer require platformsh/config-reader
```

###### `wp-config.php`

With the Configuration Reader library installed, add or update a `wp-config.php` file in the root of your repository to match the code below. In this file, the library's `Config` object is used to:

- Retrieve connection credentials for MariaDB through the `database` relationship to configure the WordPress database. This will set up the database automatically and avoid you having to set the connection yourself during the installer.
- Use the project's [routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) to set `WP_HOME` and `WP_SITEURL` settings.
- Set all of WordPress's security and authentication keys to the Upsun Fixed-provided `PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY` - a hashed variable specific to your repository consistent across environments.

Many other WordPress settings are pre-defined in this file for you, so consult the inline comments for more information.

```php
<?php

use Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config;

require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

// Create a new config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
// You can alternatively use getenv() yourself.
$config = new Config();

			session_save_path("/tmp");
		}

		// Get the database credentials
		$credentials = $config->credentials('database');

		// We are using the first relationship called "database" found in your

		// Check whether a route is defined for this application in the Upsun Fixed
		// routes. Use it as the site hostname if so (it is not ideal to trust HTTP_HOST).
		if ($config->routes()) {

			$routes = $config->routes();

			foreach ($routes as $url => $route) {
				if ($route['type'] === 'upstream' && $route['upstream'] === $config->applicationName) {

					// Pick the first hostname, or the first HTTPS hostname if one exists.
					$host = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);
					$scheme = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_SCHEME);
					if ($host !== false && (!isset($site_host) || ($site_scheme === 'http' && $scheme === 'https'))) {
						$site_host = $host;
						$site_scheme = $scheme ?: 'http';
					}
				}
			}
		}

		// Debug mode should be disabled on Upsun Fixed. Set this constant to true
		// in a wp-config-local.php file to skip this setting on local development.
		if (!defined( 'WP_DEBUG' )) {
			define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
		}

		// Set all of the necessary keys to unique values, based on the Upsun Fixed
		// entropy value.
		if ($config->projectEntropy) {

			}
		}
	}
}
else {

```

###### Setting up Composer

Through this guide you will set up your WordPress repository to install everything during it's build using Composer. That includes themes, plugins, and even WordPress Core itself. Any new plugins you want to use or migrate from your existing application can be committed as dependencies using Composer, but there are a few changes we need to make to the `composer.json` file to prepare it for the final Upsun Fixed environment.

First, the John Bloch script has a default `wordpress` installation directory, so the `composer.json` file needs to know that all new themes and plugins have a destination within that subdirectory.

```json
  "extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
      "wordpress/wp-content/plugins/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-plugin"
      ],
      "wordpress/wp-content/themes/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-theme"
      ],
      "wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
        "type:wordpress-muplugin"
      ]
    }
  }
```

Next, having placed `wp-config.php` in the root of your repository, you need to add a `post-install-cmd` to move the file into `wordpress` after `composer install` has finished.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "copywpconfig": [
      "cp wp-config.php wordpress/"
    ],
    "post-install-cmd": "@copywpconfig"
  },
```

Since you're likely using [WPPackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) to download plugins and themes with Composer, you also need to add `wpackagist.org` as a repository in `composer.json`.

```json
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
    }
  ]
```

Lastly, to prevent committing WordPress Core when it is installed via Composer, and to otherwise setup your local development environment, make sure that your `.gitignore` file includes everything in `wordpress`, as [shown in the template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-composer/blob/master/.gitignore).

###### Additional packages

Finally, install `wp-cli` and `psy/psysh` using Composer.
With these packages included, the WordPress CLI is available when you SSH into the application container.

```bash
composer require wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle psy/psysh --ignore-platform-reqs
```

If you've installed the WordPress CLI as a dependency as in the [previous step](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/deploy/configure.md#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml),
you can use it directly.
(As long as you have only `wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle` as a dependency and not `wp-cli/wp-cli`.)

Otherwise, commit the changes from composer and push.
Then you can use the WordPress CLI within an application container from the `vendor` directory:

```bash
./vendor/bin/wp plugin list
```

If you receive an error stating `This doesn't seem to be a WordPress installation.`,
try providing the `--path` flag and point to your WordPress install path.

#### Deploy WordPress


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your uploaded files to your local `wordpress/wp-content/uploads` directory
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount wordpress/wp-content/uploads --source ./wordpress/wp-content/uploads
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

###### Adding plugins and themes without Composer

As previously mentioned, Composer is strongly recommended,
but it's possible to use some non-Composer plugins and themes in your site,
provided that they don't require write access at runtime.
In your build hook, include:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    rsync -a plugins/* wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
```

Here, you can commit plugins to the repository in a `plugins` subdirectory,
which are placed into the WordPress installation during the build.
It's assumed that these packages stick to best practices and don't write to the file system at runtime and when enabling them.
You can get around this issue by defining a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) where a plugin requires write access,
but you need to remember that the contents at that mount location are wiped when deployment begins,
so you need to copy and re-copy accordingly.

###### Adding public plugins and themes via Composer

Adding a plugin or theme from WPPackagist is the same as downloading a package through Composer:

```bash
# Plugin
$ composer require wpackagist-plugin/cache-control
# Theme
$ composer require wpackagist-theme/neve
```

This updates your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.
Once you push the change to Upsun Fixed, the package is downloaded during the WordPress build.
All that's left is to sign in to the administration dashboard on your deployed site
and enable plugins and themes from the Plugins and Appearance settings, respectively.

###### Set up a WooCommerce site

Upsun Fixed maintains a [WooCommerce template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-woocommerce)
that you can deploy quickly from the button in its README,
but using Composer you can quickly install WooCommerce yourself:

```bash
composer require woocommerce/woocommerce
```

Push those changes on a new environment and configure your store through the administration panel.

###### Adding private plugins and themes via Composer

If your plugins aren't accessible from WPPackagist or Packagist, but are still valid packages,
you can use them in your project by defining local `repositories` for them in your `composer.json` file.

```json
"repositories":[
    {
       "type":"composer",
       "url":"https://wpackagist.org"
    },
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "custom/themes/*",
      "options": {
        "symlink": false
        }
    },
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "custom/plugins/*",
      "options": {
        "symlink": false
        }
    }
]
```

In the snippet above, other packages can still be downloaded from WPPackagist,
but now two custom `path` repositories have been defined from `/custom/[themes|plugins]` locally.
Adding packages from these sources then only requires `composer require author/custom_plugin`
to ensure that the plugin at `/custom/plugin/author/custom_plugin` is installed by Upsun Fixed when WordPress is built.

###### Updating WordPress, plugins, and themes

Your WordPress site is fully managed by Composer,
which means so are updates to WordPress core itself.
Run `composer update` periodically to get new versions of WordPress core, as well as any plugins or themes your have installed.
Commit the resulting changes to your `composer.lock` file and push again to Upsun Fixed.

The [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) has more information on options to update individual modules or perform other tasks.

Note that updating modules or core through the WordPress UI isn't possible, as the file system is read-only.
All updates should be done through Composer to update the lock file, and then push to Git.

###### Local development with Lando

[Lando](https://github.com/lando/lando) is a local development tool.
Lando can read your Upsun Fixed configuration files for WordPress
and produce an approximately equivalent configuration using Docker
See a guide on [using Lando with Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/lando.md).

Templates come configured for use already with a base [Landofile](https://docs.lando.dev/landofile/),
as in the following example.
It can be helpful getting started with Lando without the need to have a project on Upsun Fixed.
This file sets up good defaults for Lando and Upsun Fixed-configured codebases,
most notably through the `recipe` attribute.

This Landofile is also where you can configure access to tools
that would normally be available within a Upsun Fixed app container (such as the WordPress CLI)
and that you also want to access locally.

You can replicate this file or follow the guide on [using Lando with Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/lando.md).
Once you have completed the configuration, you can start your local environment by running:

```bash
lando start
```

### Why you should manage WordPress with Composer


Using Composer isn't traditionally the norm for WordPress development, but it is strongly recommended when deploying on Upsun Fixed. This guide is intended to provide an overview of why using Composer - including adding modules and themes locally as packages, as well as updating WordPress itself - is recommended.

##### Why use Composer

Like any other application, your WordPress site is most secure when you can ensure repeatable builds and committable updates for both your code and its dependencies. This is a priority at Upsun Fixed, and that's why you can control your infrastructure in the same way. Your infrastructure is committed through a set of configuration files that specify which version of PHP and MariaDB you want to use, because that's the best way to ensure that your project remains reproducible when developing new features.

WordPress core, as well as its themes and plugins, should ideally work the same way, but very often this isn't the case. WordPress's administration panel provides one-click buttons to update all of these components when they're out of date, or otherwise expects write access to the file system to make configuration changes at runtime. Developing this way has its consequences, however.

First off, you aren't always going to have write access to the file system at runtime (which is the case for Upsun Fixed), so depending on this mechanism for updates and configuration changes is entirely restricted for many hosting solutions. On the other hand, if you *do* have write access at runtime where you're hosting currently, installing a new module or theme presents a nontrivial security risk when the source is unknown.

But, perhaps most importantly, updating WordPress at runtime decouples the state of your site from the code in your repository. A colleague working on a new feature on their local clone of the project could very well be a full major version behind the live site, introducing bugs with unknown (and more importantly, untested) consequences completely as a result of this workflow.

##### Advantages of using Composer

Given the points raised above, managing your WordPress site with Composer has clear advantages. First, it allows you to explicitly define your dependencies in a committed file (`composer.lock`). This lock file is generated from a more descriptive list of dependency constraints (`composer.json`) when your dependencies are installed, and it becomes a part of your project's commit history. From then on, any new branch will work from the identical collection of dependencies, down to the exact commit hash. It doesn't matter at that point who contributes to the project or even where it is deployed - it's the same code for everyone everywhere.

Composer also removes the need to commit lots of external code to your repository. In the case of WordPress, *not* using Composer often requires you to commit all of the code for a theme, and even for WordPress core itself, to your own project. Besides making the repository unnecessarily large and slow to clone, updating these copies becomes a juggling act that nobody needs to deal with.

Through Composer you can add and update dependencies to your project, and then lock their exact versions so that each new branch gets that same update. Had the update been performed on the deployed site at runtime, you would have to remember to `git pull` first.

###### Adding themes and modules with Composer

Through Composer, themes and modules are then treated the same as any other PHP dependency. You can, for example, add the [Neve](https://wordpress.org/themes/neve/) theme to your project by using `composer require`

```bash
composer require wpackagist-theme/neve
```

or add the [cache-control](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-control-by-cacholong/) plugin:

```bash
composer require wpackagist-plugin/cache-control
```

These commands will add the packages to your `composer.json` file, and then lock the exact version to `composer.lock`. Just push those updates to your project on Upsun Fixed, and enable them through the administration panel as you would normally.

**Note**: 

Typically, Composer dependencies install to a ``vendor`` directory in the project root, but themes and plugins need to install to ``wp-content`` instead. There is an ``installer-paths`` attribute that is added to ``composer.json`` to accomplish this, which is explained in more detail in the [How to Deploy WordPress on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/deploy.md) guide (which uses Composer from the start), as well as the [How to update your WordPress site to use Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer/migrate.md) guide.

For more information, see the following Upsun Fixed community post: [How to install custom/private WordPress plugins and themes with Composer](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439636140306).

###### Installing WordPress core with Composer

In the same way, using Composer makes it unnecessary for you to commit all of WordPress to your repository, since you can add it as a dependency. There are several ways to do this (i.e. [Bedrock](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-bedrock)) depending on how many assumptions you want to be made for your configuration and project structure. The simplest one uses the [John Bloch Composer fork](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) to add an installer to your builds for WordPress:

```bash
composer require johnpbloch/wordpress-core-installer
composer require johnpbloch/wordpress-core
```

###### Updates

Now that WordPress core, your themes and your plugins have been added as dependencies with Composer, updates become easier.

```bash
composer update
```

This command will update everything in your project locally, after which you can push to Upsun Fixed on a new environment. After you are satisfied with the changes merge into your production site.

##### Resources

Upsun Fixed has written several guides for WordPress alongside the Composer recommendation:

- [How to Deploy WordPress on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/deploy/_index.md): From here, you can create a Composer-based version of WordPress from scratch and deploy to Upsun Fixed.
- [How to update your WordPress site to use Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer/migrate.md): This guide will take you through the steps of updating your fully committed *vanilla* WordPress repository into one that uses Composer and deploy it to Upsun Fixed.
- [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/redis.md): This guide will show you how to add a Redis container to your configuration and add it to your deployed WordPress site.
- [How to Deploy WordPress without Composer on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla/_index.md): If you do not want to switch to using Composer and you are willing to work around some of Upsun Fixed runtime constraints, this guide will show you how to deploy a fully committed *vanilla* WordPress site to Upsun Fixed
#### Upgrade your WordPress site to use Composer

Composer helps you declare, manage, and install all the dependencies needed to run your project.
It allows you to make your WordPress site [more stable, more secure, and easier to maintain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer.md).

With Composer, you don't need to commit all of WordPress core, its themes and plugins to your project's Git repository.
You also don't need to manage any of these elements as Git submodules.

###### Before you begin

To update your WordPress site to use Composer, check that:

- You already have a [vanilla version of WordPress installed locally](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla.md).
- Your project has been set up for deployment on Upsun Fixed.
  If you don't have Upsun Fixed configuration files in your repository,
  [deploy WordPress without Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla.md) before upgrading to a Composer-based site.
- You have [downloaded and installed Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

###### 1. Install WordPress with Composer

To install WordPress with Composer, complete the following steps:

1. Switch to a new Git branch.

   To safely make changes to your repository and Upsun Fixed environment, run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b composer
   ```

2. Turn your repository into a Composer repository.

   To use Composer, you need:

   - A `composer.json` file listing all the dependencies needed for your project to run
     (WordPress itself, its plugins, and its themes).
   - A `composer.lock` file listing the exact versions of all the dependencies installed on your project.
     Generated from the `composer.json` file, it ensures repeatable builds until you update.

   To turn your repository into a Composer repository and generate those files, run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ composer init
   ```

   When prompted, set metadata attributes for your project,
   such as its name and license information.
   When you get to the part about installing dependencies, type `no`,
   as you add them in step 5.

3. Clean up WordPress core.

   If you've been managing WordPress and its dependencies as Git submodules, [remove the submodules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md#removing-submodules).

   Otherwise, your existing installation of WordPress core is assumed to be in a subdirectory of your repository (often named `wordpress`).
   For Composer to manage WordPress, remove this subdirectory:

   ```bash
   $ rm -rf wordpress
   ```

   Then, at the end of your existing `.gitignore` file,
   add the content of Upsun Fixed’s [template `.gitignore` file](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-composer/blob/master/.gitignore).

   This adds the `wordpress` subdirectory to the resulting `.gitignore` file.
   This way, after Composer reinstalls WordPress, the `wordpress` subdirectory is ignored in commits.

   Now remove WordPress from the repository:

   ```bash
   $ git rm -rf --cached wordpress && rm -rf wordpress
   $ git add . && git commit -m "Remove WordPress"
   ```

4. Launch the installation of WordPress with Composer.

   Now that you have made your WordPress site into a Composer project, you can download packages via Composer.

   To download WordPress itself, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   $ composer require johnpbloch/wordpress-core-installer
   $ composer require johnpbloch/wordpress-core
   ```

   The two dependencies are now listed in your `composer.json` file:

   ```json
    {
        "require": {
            "johnpbloch/wordpress-core-installer": "^2.0",
            "johnpbloch/wordpress-core": "^6.0"
        }
    }
   ```

5. Complete the installation:

   ```bash
   $ composer install
   ```

   Composer reinstalls WordPress into the `wordpress` subdirectory.

###### 2. Install WordPress themes and plugins with Composer

Just like with WordPress core, you can install themes and plugins with the `composer require` command.
To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Configure the WPackagist repository.

   By default, when you download dependencies using Composer, you retrieve them through [Packagist](https://packagist.org),
   which is the primary Composer repository for public PHP packages.
   Some themes and plugins for WordPress are also on Packagist,
   but most of them are accessible through a similar service specific to WordPress called [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org).

   To allow Composer to download packages from the WPackagist repository, run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ composer config repositories.wppackagist composer https://wpackagist.org
   ```

   WPackagist is now listed in your `composer.json` file:

   ```json
    {
        "repositories": {
            "wppackagist": {
                "type": "composer",
                "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
            }
        }
    }
   ```

2. Optional: Configure theme and plugin destination.

   By default, Composer places installed dependencies in a `vendor` subdirectory.

   You can configure a different destination for your themes and plugins.
   For instance, to install them into `wp-content`, add the following configuration:

   ```json  {location="composer.json"}
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
            "wordpress/wp-content/plugins/{$name}": [
                "type:wordpress-plugin"
            ],
            "wordpress/wp-content/themes/{$name}": [
                "type:wordpress-theme"
            ],
            "wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
                "type:wordpress-muplugin"
            ]
        }
    }
   ```

   Make sure you add the new destination subdirectories to your `.gitignore` file.

   After inspecting package metadata, Composer now installs plugins with a `type` of `wordpress-plugin` into `wordpress/wp-content/plugins/` instead of `vendor`.
   And similarly for themes and must-use plugins.

3. Launch the installation of plugins and themes with Composer.

   To search for themes and plugins in [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org) and install them through Composer, run a `composer require` command:

   ```bash
   # Plugin
   $ composer require wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo

   # Theme
   $ composer require wpackagist-theme/hueman
   ```

   The two dependencies are now listed in your `composer.json` file.

4. Complete the installation:

   ```bash
   $ composer install
   ````

   Each dependency is now installed.

###### 3. Deploy to Upsun Fixed

Switching to a Composer-based installation doesn't require any modifications to the Upsun Fixed configuration files
created when [you deployed your vanilla version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla.md).
Make sure that your project contains those three files.
You can then commit all your changes
and deploy your new Composer-based WordPress site to Upsun Fixed:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Composerify plugins and themes."
git push platform composer
```

###### 4. Update your Composer-based WordPress site

####### Perform a standard update with Composer

Updating WordPress, your themes and plugins becomes a lot simpler with Composer.
When a new version becomes available, create a new branch and launch the update:

```bash
git checkout -b updates
composer update
```

####### Automate your updates with a source operation

  **Tier availability**
  This feature is available for
  **Elite and Enterprise** customers. [Compare the  tiers](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) on our pricing page, or [contact our sales team](https://upsun.com/contact-us/

[Source operations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md) allow you to automate the maintenance of your Composer-based WordPress site.
For instance, you can [update all the dependencies in your project with a single command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/dependency-updates.md).
### How to Deploy WordPress without Composer on Upsun Fixed

WordPress is a popular Content Management System written in PHP. The recommended way to deploy WordPress on Upsun Fixed is by using [Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/deploy.md), the PHP package management suite. This guide will take you through the steps of setting up "vanilla" WordPress - that is, WordPress not managed through Composer, but rather by either fully committing WordPress, themes, and plugins or defining them with submodules - on Upsun Fixed. It should be noted that this approach comes with certain limitations based on the way Upsun Fixed works, and for this reason is [not recommended](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer.md). Instead, consider using the ["Upgrade to use Composer"](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer/migrate.md) guide to modify your project into one that uses Composer. 

To get WordPress running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a WordPress site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic WordPress site.
        See an example for doing this under initializing a project.

    -   Use a ready-made [WordPress template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-vanilla).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a WordPress template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.
        If you don’t have code, create a new WordPress project from scratch.
It’s best to place WordPress core into a subdirectory rather than at the project root.
The following commands create a fresh Git repository with WordPress as a subdirectory:

```bash {}
mkdir wordpress-psh && cd wordpress-psh
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress.git wordpress && rm -rf wordpress/.git
git init
```

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla/configure.md)

#### Configure WordPress for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for WordPress in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why WordPress requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

There are a few things to notice in this file specific to running non-Composer variants of WordPress on Upsun Fixed. Defined in the ``dependencies`` block, all of the packages needed to run the WordPress CLI in both the application container and via SSH are installed in the first stages of the build process using Composer. Also, the ``web.locations`` block will expose ``wordpress/index.php`` under the primary route.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}

# in the same project.

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.

                git add --all
                confirm=$(git status --porcelain=1);
                if [ -z "${confirm}" ]; then
                    echo "No changes to commit."
                else
                    git commit -m "Auto updated via source operations" 
                fi

```

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

We recommend the latest [MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) version for WordPress.

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure  to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

```yaml
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.

db:
    type: mariadb:10.4
    disk: 2048
```

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.
Generally, you want the user session cookie, which is included in the example for WordPress.
You may need to add other cookies depending on what additional modules you have installed.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a WordPress app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "app:http"
    cache:
        enabled: true
        # Base the cache on the session cookies. Ignore all other cookies.
        cookies:
            - '/^wordpress_logged_in_/'
            - '/^wordpress_sec_/'
            - 'wordpress_test_cookie'

    [Customize WordPress](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/vanilla/customize.md)

#### Customize WordPress for Upsun Fixed

Deploying WordPress without Composer on Upsun Fixed isn't recommended,
but should you wish to do so there are a few additional modifications you need to make to your repository.

###### Place WordPress core into a subdirectory

**Note**: 

If starting from scratch, you can skip to the section covering [wp-config.php](#wp-configphp) below.

Keeping WordPress core up-to-date is made much easier when it resides in a subdirectory of your repository
and it makes the recommended transition to using Composer simpler.
It also makes defining WordPress as a submodule possible if you choose to do so.

Place all code for WordPress core into a subdirectory called `wordpress`, including your `wp-config.php` file.

**Note**: 

You can name the WordPress core subdirectory whatever you would like - the most common being ``wp``, ``web``, and ``wordpress``. ``wordpress`` has been chosen for Upsun Fixed templates and guides because it is often the default install location for [composer-flavored versions of WordPress](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/deploy.md), and naming it ``wordpress`` now in your project will make [migrating to use Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer/migrate.md) later on straightforward. If naming the directory something other than ``wordpress``, make sure to update the ``web.locations["/"].root`` attribute to match in your ``.platform.app.yaml`` file, as well as any other ``root`` attribute there.

####### Core, themes, and plugins can also be submodules

Upsun Fixed validates and retrieves submodules in the first stages of its build process,
so it's possible to manage your code entirely this way.
This modifies the update steps from what's listed below,
so visit the [Git submodules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md) documentation for more information.

###### `.environment`

Upsun Fixed provides multiple *environments* for your projects, that can be customized (with different values for staging and development), but that inherit features from the production environment. One clear case where this can be useful is environment variables. Each environment on Upsun Fixed comes with a set of [pre-defined variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) that provide information about the branch you are working on, the application's configuration, and the credentials to connect to each service defined in `.platform/services.yaml`.

Service credentials reside in a base64 encoded JSON object variable called `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`,
which you can use to define your database connection to the MariaDB container.
To make each property (username, password, and so on) more accessible to `wp-config.php`,
you can use the pre-installed `jq` package to clean the object into individual variables.

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export DB_NAME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].path')"
export DB_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].host')"
export DB_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].port')"
export DB_USER="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].username')"
export DB_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].password')"

export WP_HOME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_ROUTES" | base64 --decode | jq -r 'to_entries[] | select(.value.primary == true) | .key')"
export WP_SITEURL="${WP_HOME}wp"
export WP_DEBUG_LOG="/var/log/app.log"
if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ] ; then
    export WP_ENV='development'
else
    export WP_ENV='production'
fi
```

As you can see above, you can define a number of environment-specific or project-wide variable settings in this file
that are applied when deployed on Upsun Fixed but not locally.

###### `wp-config.php`

Now that your database credentials have been cleaned up and `WP_HOME` defined, you can pull these values into `wp-config.php` to configure WordPress for deployment on an Upsun Fixed environment.

Below is the `wp-config.php` file from the [WordPress template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress-vanilla) using the variables defined in the previous section. Many other WordPress settings are pre-defined in this file for you, so consult the inline comments for more information.

```php
<?php

// Set default scheme and hostname.
$site_scheme = 'http';
$site_host = 'localhost';

// Update scheme and hostname for the requested page.
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])) {
  $site_host = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
  $site_scheme = !empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ? 'https' : 'http';
}

if (getenv('PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS')) {
	if(getenv('DB_NAME')){

		// Avoid PHP notices on CLI requests.
		if (php_sapi_name() === 'cli') {
			session_save_path("/tmp");
		}

		// We are using the first relationship called "database" found in your
		// relationships. Note that you can call this relationship as you wish
		// in your `.platform.app.yaml` file, but 'database' is a good name.
		define( 'DB_NAME', getenv('DB_NAME'));
		define( 'DB_USER', getenv('DB_USER'));
		define( 'DB_PASSWORD', getenv('DB_PASSWORD'));
		define( 'DB_HOST', getenv('DB_HOST'));
		define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );
		define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );

		// Debug mode should be disabled on Upsun Fixed. Set this constant to true
		// in a wp-config-local.php file to skip this setting on local development.
		if (!defined( 'WP_DEBUG' )) {
			define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
		}

		// Set all of the necessary keys to unique values, based on the Upsun Fixed
		// entropy value.
		if (getenv('PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY')) {
			$keys = [
				'AUTH_KEY',
				'SECURE_AUTH_KEY',
				'LOGGED_IN_KEY',
				'NONCE_KEY',
				'AUTH_SALT',
				'SECURE_AUTH_SALT',
				'LOGGED_IN_SALT',
				'NONCE_SALT',
			];
			$entropy = getenv('PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY');
			foreach ($keys as $key) {
				if (!defined($key)) {
					define( $key, $entropy . $key );
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
else {
  // Local configuration file should be in project root.
  if (file_exists(dirname(__FILE__, 2) . '/wp-config-local.php')) {
    include(dirname(__FILE__, 2) . '/wp-config-local.php');
  }
}

// Do not put a slash "/" at the end.
// https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WP_HOME
// define( 'WP_HOME', $site_scheme . '://' . $site_host );
define( 'WP_HOME', getenv('WP_HOME'));
// Do not put a slash "/" at the end.
// https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WP_SITEURL
define( 'WP_SITEURL', WP_HOME );
define( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR', dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wp-content' );
define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', WP_HOME . 'wp-content' );

// Disable WordPress from running automatic updates
define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', false );

// Since you can have multiple installations in one database, you need a unique
// prefix.
$table_prefix  = 'wp_';

/** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
  define( 'ABSPATH', dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/' );
}

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');
```

Up to this point, this guide should give you the following project structure:

```txt
.
├── .platform
│   ├── services.yaml
│   └── routes.yaml
├── wordpress
│   ├── wp-admin
│   ├── wp-content
│   ├── wp-includes
│   ├── ...
│   ├── wp-cli.yml
│   └── wp-config.php
└── .platform.app.yaml
```

#### Deploy WordPress


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your uploaded files to your local `wordpress/wp-content/uploads` directory
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount wordpress/wp-content/uploads --source ./wordpress/wp-content/uploads
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

###### Updating WordPress, plugins, and themes

There is an important caveat to keep in mind when maintaining WordPress on Upsun Fixed,
namely that after the build process has completed your site is left with a read-only file system.
This makes updating WordPress core, themes, and plugins not possible at runtime through the administration panel like you may be used to. 

Keeping WordPress up-to-date in environments like this is the primary reason that [managing WordPress with Composer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/composer.md) is recommended.
Keeping a vanilla WordPress up-to-date on Upsun Fixed requires you to clone the repository locally
and subsequently remove and re-download WordPress core, themes, and plugins to their updated version.
Perform this on a new branch, and push to Upsun Fixed to test the updates before merging. 

If you choose to keep themes, plugins, and core defined as submodules in your project,
consult the [submodule documentation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md) and `git pull` for the latest version.

###### Local development with Lando

[Lando](https://github.com/lando/lando) is a local development tool.
Lando can read your Upsun Fixed configuration files for WordPress
and produce an approximately equivalent configuration using Docker
See a guide on [using Lando with Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/lando.md).

Templates come configured for use already with a base [Landofile](https://docs.lando.dev/landofile/),
as in the following example.
It can be helpful getting started with Lando without the need to have a project on Upsun Fixed.
This file sets up good defaults for Lando and Upsun Fixed-configured codebases,
most notably through the `recipe` attribute.

This Landofile is also where you can configure access to tools
that would normally be available within a Upsun Fixed app container (such as the WordPress CLI)
and that you also want to access locally.

You can replicate this file or follow the guide on [using Lando with Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/lando.md).
Once you have completed the configuration, you can start your local environment by running:

```bash
lando start
```

### Using Redis with WordPress

There are a number of Redis plugins for WordPress, only some of which are compatible with Upsun Fixed.
We've tested and recommend [WP Redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/)
and [Redis Object Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/),
both of which require a minimal amount of configuration.

##### Requirements

###### 1. Add a Redis service

To create a Redis service, add the following to your [services configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
rediscache:
  type: redis:6.0
```

That creates a service named `rediscache` with the type `redis`, specifically version `6.0`.

###### 2. Expose the Redis service to your application

Next open a connection to the new Redis service.
In the `relationships` section of your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md),
add the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  redis: "rediscache:redis"
```

The key (left side) is the name that's exposed to the application in the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
The value (right side) is the name of the service you specified in step 1 (`rediscache`) and the endpoint (`redis`).
If you named the service something different in step 1, change `rediscache` to that.

###### 3. Add the Redis PHP extension

Add the Redis extension for PHP in one of two ways:

* In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#extensions) (for extension versions tied to the PHP version)
* Using a [builder script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/redis.md) (if you need more control over the extension version)

###### 4. Add the Redis library

If you're using Composer to build WordPress,
install your chosen Redis plugin with a Composer command depending on the plugin:

```bash {}

composer require "wpackagist-plugin/redis-cache":"^2.0.23"

```

Then commit the resulting changes to your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.

##### Configuration

To enable the Redis cache to work with WordPress,
the `object-cache.php` file needs to be copied from the plugin's directory to the `wp-content` directory.
Add the following line to the bottom of your `build` hook in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#hooks),
adjusting the paths based on where your plugins are located:

```yaml {}
hooks:
  build: |
    ...
    if [ -f wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-redis/object-cache.php ]; then
        cp wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-redis/object-cache.php wordpress/wp-content/object-cache.php
    fi    
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  build: |
    ...
    if [ -f wordpress/wp-content/plugins/redis-cache/includes/object-cache.php ]; then
        cp wordpress/wp-content/plugins/redis-cache/includes/object-cache.php wordpress/wp-content/object-cache.php
    fi    
```

It should now look something like:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    bash .platform-scripts/install-redis.sh 6.0.12
    # Copy manually-provided plugins into the plugins directory.
    # This allows manually-provided and composer-provided plugins to coexist.
    rsync -a plugins/* wordpress/wp-content/plugins/

    if [ -f wordpress/wp-content/plugins/redis-cache/includes/object-cache.php ]; then
      cp wordpress/wp-content/plugins/redis-cache/includes/object-cache.php wordpress/wp-content/object-cache.php
    fi
```

Each plugin requires slightly different configuration.
Place the code for your chosen plugin in the `wp-config.php` file,
somewhere before the final `require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');` line.

**Note**: 

The following examples assume you are using the [Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

```php {}
<?php

if ($config->hasRelationship('redis') && extension_loaded('redis')) {
    $credentials = $config->credentials('redis');
    $redis_server = array(
        'host'     => $credentials['host'],
        'port'     => $credentials['port'],
        'auth'     => $credentials['password'],
    );
}
```

    wp-config.php

```php {}
<?php

if ($config->hasRelationship('redis') && extension_loaded('redis')) {
    $credentials = $config->credentials('redis');

    define('WP_REDIS_CLIENT', 'phpredis');
    define('WP_REDIS_HOST', $credentials['host']);
    define('WP_REDIS_PORT', $credentials['port']);
}
```

These sections set up the parameters the plugins look for to connect to the Redis server.
If you used a different name for the relationship above, change it accordingly.
This code has no impact when run on a local development environment.

Once you have committed the above changes and pushed, you need to activate the plugins.

###### Verifying Redis is running

Run this command in a SSH session in your environment: `platform redis info`.
You should run it before you push all this new code to your repository.

This should give you a baseline of activity on your Redis installation.
There should be very little memory allocated to the Redis cache.

After you push this code, you should run the command and notice that allocated memory starts jumping.

To verify the plugins are working, add a `redis` command to the WP CLI tool.
While in a SSH session in your environment,
you can run `wp help redis` to see the available commands your chosen plugin has added.



### Deploy Gatsby on Upsun Fixed

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is an open source framework based on React that specializes in generating static websites from a variety of content sources.

To get Gatsby running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Gatsby site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Gatsby site.

    -   Use a ready-made [Gatsby template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Gatsby template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Gatsby for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Gatsby in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Gatsby requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

In the template, ``yarn`` is run during the build hook to install all of Gatsby’s dependencies, and then ``yarn build`` is run to build the site and output to the ``public`` subdirectory. If you would rather use ``npm`` to manage your dependencies, you can:

 - delete ``yarn`` from the build hook
 - update ``yarn build`` to ``npm run build`` in the build hook
 - delete the ``build.flavor`` block, which tells Upsun Fixed to rely solely on the build hook to define the build process for your project when set to ``none``. By default, Node.js containers run ``npm install`` prior to the build hook, so this block can be removed entirely from the configuration.
 - delete the ``dependencies`` block, which includes ``yarn``, since it is no longer needed.

All traffic is then directed to the ``public`` subdirectory once the deployment has completed via the ``web.locations`` section.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# Complete list of all available properties: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

Gatsby doesn't require services to deploy, so you don't need a `.platform/services.yaml` file for now.
You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Gatsby to use those services once they're enabled.

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Gatsby app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"

```

#### Deploy Gatsby

###### Deployment

Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Additional changes

A standard Gatsby site - either one created interactively through npm (`npm init gatsby`) or through a starter such as the [Blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) used in the Upsun Fixed template - will generate a static site without the use of any external services. If this is your starting point you have all of the configuration necessary to deploy your project, but below are a few modifications that may help you develop your site more efficiently going forward.

####### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

Install the package with your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install platformsh-config

# Or for Yarn
yarn add platformsh-config
```

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

Upsun Fixed supports [multi-app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) on projects - that is, including code for two separate sites that are deployed on their own containers within a single project cluster.

These days, an increasingly common pattern is to decouple content resources from a frontend Gatsby site. Decoupled sites use Gatsby's source plugin ecosystem to pull external content resources into the build, where those resources (a headless CMS, for example) are typically located on a server elsewhere.

Upsun Fixed's multi-app configuration gets around this, placing both frontend and backend sites on the same server by keeping the code for both sites in the same repository. Gatsby would reside in a subdirectory alongside another that contains the code for the backend resource. For example, a Gatsby site pulling content from a Drupal site could be kept in a single repository that looks like the snippet below:

```bash
.
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── drupal
│   ├── 
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── 
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE.md
└── README.md
```

This pattern can be replicated for a number of backend applications, and you can consult the [Gatsby Headless](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/headless.md) guide for some common examples.

  [Back](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy/deploy.md)

### Gatsby multi-app projects

##### Background

A common pattern for Gatsby sites is to decouple services from the main site, pulling in external data at build time. Supported by Gatsby's source plugin ecosystem, data from conventional (or headless) content management systems can be collected into a common [Data Layer](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/), with that CMS typically located on a server elsewhere, and that data then used to fill out content on the frontend.

The location of an external CMS is usually hard coded into Gatsby's configuration, so when you're developing your site every branch points to the same backend resource. Should the location of that resource change, you would need to commit the new URL to update the configuration.

The decoupled pattern can work differently on Upsun Fixed due to support for [multi-app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) on your projects. Consider the following project structure:

```bash
.
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── drupal
│   ├── 
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── 
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
└── README.md
```

Above is the repository structure for a Decoupled Drupal (Gatsby sourcing Drupal content) project on Upsun Fixed. Here, Gatsby and Drupal reside in their own subdirectories within the same repository. They are deployed to the same project from separate application containers, and from this cluster Gatsby can read data from Drupal internally. Their commit histories are tied together, such that each new pull request environment can test changes to either the frontend or backend freely from the same place.

Drupal is just one example of a backend CMS that can be used with this pattern, and at the bottom of this page are a few additional guides for alternatives that work well on Upsun Fixed.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Signing up

In each of the backend guides below, there is a "Deploy on Upsun Fixed" button that will not only deploy the guide's project for you, but also sign you up for a trial account. If you are planning on deploying a template and following along with these guides for greater context, feel free to move onto the next section.

If however you are planning on using the templates and guides to deploy your existing codebase to Upsun Fixed,
you first need to [register for a trial Upsun account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
If you don't want to sign up initially with your e-mail address,
you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
If you choose one of these options, you can set a password for your Upsun account later.

After creating an account, you are prompted to create your first project. Since you're providing your own code, use the "Blank project" option. You can give the project a title and choose a region closest to the visitors of your site. You also have the option to select more resources for your project. This is especially important with multi-application projects, so make sure to consult the [**Plan size**](#plan-size) note below for more details.

##### Plan size

There are a few important points you need to keep in mind when deploying this pattern if you have already [deployed Gatsby by itself](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md) on Upsun Fixed, which are relevant to each backend example. After following the steps below, you may find that Gatsby fails to bundle assets during its build on projects of the "Development" plan size. This is a factor of both the size and number of Gatsby's dependencies on the frontend, as well as the amount of data being pulled from the backend.

Multi-application projects generally require more resources to run on Upsun Fixed, and so the trial's default `development` plan may not be enough to run your existing site. You are free to either proceed with a smaller plan to test or increase the resources at this point for the project. Otherwise, it may be best to initially deploy the templates listed in each backend guide to start out, and later modify that project to include your own code with more resources as you get used to developing on Upsun Fixed.

##### Headless backends

Upsun Fixed maintains a number of [multi-application templates](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/?q=gatsby&type=&language=) for Gatsby, that generally have very similar configuration changes on the Gatsby side. Below are a few of those written as short guides for different backend content management systems.
#### How to deploy Gatsby with Drupal (Decoupled Drupal) on Upsun Fixed

Upsun Fixed maintains a [template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-drupal) that you can quickly deploy, and then use this guide as a reference for the Upsun Fixed specific changes that have been made to Gatsby and Drupal to make it work. 

###### Shared configuration

Your local clone of the template has the following project structure:

```bash
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── drupal
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
└── README.md
```

From this repository, you deploy a Gatsby app and a Drupal app.
The code for each of them resides in their own directories.
When deploying a single app project [such as Gatsby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md),
the repository needs three configuration files that describe its infrastructure, described below in detail.
For [multi-app projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md),
two of those files remain in the project root and are shared between Gatsby and Drupal.
Each app keeps its own app configuration file (`.platform.app.yaml`) in its subdirectory.

####### Service configuration

This file describes which [service containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) (such as a database) your project should include.
Gatsby does not require services to deploy, but Drupal does.
So the following examples shows these service configurations:

```yaml {}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.

db:
    type: mariadb:10.4
    disk: 2048

cache:
    type: redis:5.0

files:
  type: network-storage:1.0
  disk: 256

```

####### Routes configuration

This [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) file defines how requests are handled by Upsun Fixed.
The following example shows Gatsby being served from the primary domain
and Drupal being accessible from the `backend` subdomain.

```yaml {}
https://api.{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: "drupal:http"
  id: "api"
  cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ['/^SS?ESS/', '/^Drupal.visitor/']
https://www.api.{default}/:
  type: redirect
  to: "https://api.{default}/"

"https://www.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "gatsby:http"
    primary: true

"https://{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://www.{default}/"

```

###### Drupal

The multi-app template has a single modification to Upsun Fixed's [standard Drupal template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal9):
the `name` attribute in Drupal's `.platform/services.yaml` has been updated to `drupal`.
This value is used to define the [relationship between Gatsby and Drupal](#gatsby)
and in the [routes configuration](#routes-configuration).

The only setup required to prepare the backend is to install a few additional modules that will configure the JSON API for consumption. In your Drupal directory, add the following dependencies.

```bash
composer require drupal/gatsby drupal/jsonapi_extras drupal/pathauto
```

The [Pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto) module helps you assign alias paths for each piece of content on your Drupal site that can then be replicated on the frontend Gatsby site. For example, the Drupal alias `/article/some-new-article` is the same path you find that article at on Gatsby.

###### Gatsby

The frontend Gatsby app has a slightly different configuration from the basic [Gatsby deployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md).
Below is the `gatsby/.platform.app.yaml` file that configures the app.

```yaml {}
# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: gatsby

type: 'nodejs:14'

variables:
    env:
        NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=1536
        GENERATED_VARS: 'deploy/platformsh.environment'

resources:
    base_memory: 1024
    memory_ratio: 1024

dependencies:
    nodejs:
        # yarn: "1.22.17"
        pm2: "5.2.0"

hooks:
    post_deploy: |
        # Verify the connection to the backend can be made with those variables.
        if [ -f "$GENERATED_VARS" ]; then
            # Source environment variables, build the frontend, and start the server.
            . $GENERATED_VARS
        else 
              printf "In %s, %s is not available, therefore I could not source" "web:commands:start" "${GENERATED_VARS}"
        fi
        # Gatsby clean on a RO-filesystem
        rm -rf .cache/* && rm -rf public/*
        npm run build -- --no-color        

web:
    commands:
        start: |
            # npm run serve -- -p $PORT --no-color

            if [ -f "$GENERATED_VARS" ]; then
                # Source environment variables, build the frontend, and start the server.
                . $GENERATED_VARS            
            else 
              printf "In %s, %s is not available, therefore I could not source" "web:commands:start" "${GENERATED_VARS}"
            fi
            APP=$(cat package.json | jq -r '.name')
            pm2 start npm --no-daemon --watch --name $APP -- run serve -- -p $PORT --no-color
            #pm2 start npm --no-daemon --watch --name $APP -- run develop -- -p $PORT --no-color

            # Maybe since we're foregoing the first deploy, yarn start is good enough.
            # if [ -f "$GENERATED_VARS" ]; then
            #     # Source environment variables, build the frontend, and start the server.
            #     # . $GENERATED_VARS
            #     npm run clean
            #     npm run build
            #     npm run serve
            #     # APP=$(cat package.json | jq -r '.name')
            #     # pm2 start npm --no-daemon --watch --name $APP -- preview -- -p $PORT
            # else
            #     # On the first deploy, display next steps page.
            #     node first_deploy.js
            # fi

mounts:
    /.cache:
        source: local
        source_path: 'cache'
    /.config:
        source: local
        source_path: 'config'
    /.pm2:
        source: local
        source_path: 'pm2'
    public:
        source: local
        source_path: 'public'
    deploy:
        source: service
        service: files
        source_path: deploy

```

In particular, notice:

- `relationships`

  Access to another service or app container in the cluster is given through [`relationships`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).
  In this case, one has been defined to the backend Drupal container using it's `name`.

- `post_deploy`

  Upsun Fixed containers reside in separate build containers at build time,
  before their images are moved to the final app container at deploy time.
  These build containers are isolated and so Gatsby can't access Drupal during the build hook,
  where you would normally run the [`gatsby build` command](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml#L21).
  Drupal isn't available until after the deploy hook.
  So the Gatsby build is postponed until the [`post_deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook).

  To run `gatsby build` on-demand, or to trigger a rebuild from the backend when content is updated,
  define a [runtime operation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/runtime-operations.md#build-your-app-when-using-a-static-site-generator).

- `mounts`

  There are consequences to postponing the Gatsby build,
  as you don't generally have write access to the container this late in the pipeline.
  To allow Gatsby to write to `public`, that directory has been defined as a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#mounts).

Additionally, there has been a change to Gatsby’s start command,``web.commands.start``. In the generic Gatsby template, the static files in ``public`` are served via the [web.locations](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby/blob/c764ed717752eacc3c3f3322b7e5415e276d02df/.platform.app.yaml#L29), but that attribute is removed in the file below. Instead, two separate start commands are defined depending on which branch you are developing on. This has been included to support [Live Preview and Incremental Builds](https://www.drupal.org/project/gatsby). It isn’t required, but you can consult the [section below](#live-preview-and-incremental-builds) for more information about enabling it.
You can then modify [gatsby-config.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) to read from the backend Drupal container through the ``drupal`` relationship defined above to configure the ``baseUrl`` attribute for ``gatsby-source-drupal``.

This is facilitated by Upsun Fixed's [Config Reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs).
So be sure to install this to the Gatsby dependencies first when replicating.
When used, Gatsby pulls the information to communicate with the Drupal container *on the current branch*.

Lastly, the Gatsby app itself needs to include [GraphQL queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/)
to handle the data coming from Drupal and create content pages.
The most important files in the template you should consult are:

- [`gatsby/gatsby-node.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-drupal/blob/master/client/gatsby-node.js) 

    Dynamically creates individual pages from the data source using Gatsby's [Node API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/). It retrieves all of Drupal's articles (see [post-install below](#deploy-and-post-install)) using the GraphQL query `allNodeArticle`. A page is created (`createPage`) with formatting described by the template file `article.js` below (`component`). A `path` is also defined for each article, in this case using an `alias` you will define within Drupal using the Pathauto module.

- [`gatsby/src/templates/article.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-drupal/blob/master/client/src/templates/article.js)

    The template file that defines how a single Drupal article should be formatted on Gatsby, retrieving the data from that article using the `nodeArticle` GraphQL query.

- [`gatsby/src/pages/articles.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-drupal/blob/master/client/src/components/articlePreview.js)

    Generates previews of articles at `/articles` on the Gatsby site using the `allNodeArticle` GraphQL query.

###### Deploy and post-install

When you first deploy the template, the frontend Gatsby site will fail with a 403 error.
Visit the `backend` subdomain of your site and finish the installation of Drupal.
You don't need to set database credentials as they're already provided.

After you have completed the installation, you need to enable the JSON API and Gatsby related modules
and then set up aliases for your articles using ``pathauto``.
For detailed instructions, see the template’s [post-installation instructions](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-drupal#user-content-post-install).

Once you've finished, redeploy the project with the CLI command `platform redeploy` to view your Gatsby site,
It's now pulling its content from a backend Drupal container in the same project.

###### Next steps

With Gatsby now deployed and pulling content from a backend Drupal application, there are a few things you may wish to change about your project going forward.

####### Shared application configuration

You can optionally combine the application configuration (`.platform/services.yaml`) for Gatsby
and Drupal into a [single configuration file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#unified-app-configuration).
Like `.platform/services.yaml` and `.platform/routes.yaml`, this file is shared across the project and resides in the `.platform` subdirectory.
You need to explicitly define the source of each application.

####### Multiple content sources

Gatsby supports pulling multiple sources into its build.
This includes external services like Stripe and additional backend CMSs for different sets of content.
As in this example with Drupal,
you can branch off your repository and add an additional directory that contains the codebase for [another backend](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/headless.md#headless-backends).
Then add the source plugin for that backend to `gatsby-config.js`.

####### Plan size

As mentioned previously, you should have at least a Medium
 plan for your multi-app projects.
This size gives the project enough resources for all of your containers
as well as the memory necessary to actually pull content from Drupal into Gatsby during its build.

Keep in mind that the increased plan size applies only to your production environment,
and not to preview environments (which default to Standard
).
As you continue to work with Gatsby and a backend headless CMS,
you may want to [upsize your preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#preview-environments).

####### Live preview and incremental builds

If you replicate the `web.commands.start` block in Gatsby's `.platform.app.yaml` file above, you can enable incremental builds on your projects. Once you save an update to a piece of Drupal content on a preview branch, Drupal places a request to a dedicated `/__refresh` endpoint on Gatsby. Since Gatsby is running a development server on this non-production environment, this call causes Gatsby to retrieve content from Drupal once again, resulting in a near instantly updated article on the frontend.

To see how to enable this feature, consult the [template's README](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-drupal#user-content-enabling-gatsby-live-preview-manual-configuration).
#### How to deploy Gatsby with Strapi on Upsun Fixed

Upsun Fixed maintains a [template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi) that you can quickly deploy, and then use this guide as a reference for the Upsun Fixed specific changes that have been made to Gatsby and Strapi to make it work. 

###### Shared configuration

Your local clone of the template has the following project structure:

```bash
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── strapi
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
└── README.md
```

From this repository, you deploy a Gatsby app and a Strapi app.
The code for each of them resides in their own directories.
When deploying a single app project [such as Gatsby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md),
the repository needs three configuration files that describe its infrastructure, described below in detail.
For [multi-app projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md),
two of those files remain in the project root and are shared between Gatsby and Strapi.
Each app keeps its own app configuration file (`.platform.app.yaml`) in its subdirectory.

####### Service configuration

This file describes which [service containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) (such as a database) your project should include.
Gatsby does not require services to deploy, but Strapi does.
So the following examples shows these service configurations:

```yaml {}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.

dbpostgres:
    type: postgresql:12
    disk: 256

```

####### Routes configuration

This [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) file defines how requests are handled by Upsun Fixed.
The following example shows Gatsby being served from the primary domain
and Strapi being accessible from the `backend` subdomain.

```yaml {}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://www.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "gatsby:http"

"https://{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://www.{default}/"

"https://www.backend.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "strapi:http"

"https://backend.{default}/":
    type: redirect
    id: 'strapi'
    to: "https://www.backend.{default}/"

```

###### Strapi

The multi-app template has a single modification to Upsun Fixed's [standard Strapi template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/strapi):
the `name` attribute in Strapi's `.platform/services.yaml` has been updated to `strapi`.
This value is used to define the [relationship between Gatsby and Strapi](#gatsby)
and in the [routes configuration](#routes-configuration).

The only additional setup required to prepare the backend is to install a package that will enable GraphQL on Strapi. In your Strapi directory, add the dependency: 

```bash
yarn add strapi-plugin-graphql
```

###### Gatsby

The frontend Gatsby app has a slightly different configuration from the basic [Gatsby deployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md).
Below is the `gatsby/.platform.app.yaml` file that configures the app.

```yaml {}
# .platform.app.yaml

# The name of this application, which must be unique within a project.
name: gatsby

# The type key specifies the language and version for your application.
type: 'nodejs:14'

# The hooks that will be triggered when the package is deployed.
hooks:
    # Build hooks can modify the application files on disk but not access any services like databases.
    post_deploy: |
      npm run build      
# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 1024

relationships:
   strapi: "strapi:http"

# The configuration of the application when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    locations:
        '/':
            # The public directory of the application relative to its root.
            root: 'public'
            index: ['index.html']
            scripts: false
            allow: true

mounts:
  '/.cache':
      source: local
      source_path: cache
  '/.config':
      source: local
      source_path: config
  'public':
      source: local
      source_path: public

```

In particular, notice:

- `relationships`

  Access to another service or app container in the cluster is given through [`relationships`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).
  In this case, one has been defined to the backend Strapi container using it's `name`.

- `post_deploy`

  Upsun Fixed containers reside in separate build containers at build time,
  before their images are moved to the final app container at deploy time.
  These build containers are isolated and so Gatsby can't access Strapi during the build hook,
  where you would normally run the [`gatsby build` command](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml#L21).
  Strapi isn't available until after the deploy hook.
  So the Gatsby build is postponed until the [`post_deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook).

  To run `gatsby build` on-demand, or to trigger a rebuild from the backend when content is updated,
  define a [runtime operation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/runtime-operations.md#build-your-app-when-using-a-static-site-generator).

- `mounts`

  There are consequences to postponing the Gatsby build,
  as you don't generally have write access to the container this late in the pipeline.
  To allow Gatsby to write to `public`, that directory has been defined as a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#mounts).

You can then modify [gatsby-config.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/)
to read from the backend Strapi container through the ``strapi`` relationship defined above
to configure the ``apiURL`` attribute for ``gatsby-source-strapi``.
Note that the source plugin requires that you explicitly define the ``contentTypes`` to retrieve from Strapi.
At this point, you haven’t yet built out the API.
So the ``article`` and ``category`` content types are included for what you need to do [after installing](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi#user-content-post-install).
If you’re migrating an existing Strapi repository, adjust these values to fit your current API.

This is facilitated by Upsun Fixed's [Config Reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs).
So be sure to install this to the Gatsby dependencies first when replicating.
When used, Gatsby pulls the information to communicate with the Strapi container *on the current branch*.

Lastly, the Gatsby app itself needs to include [GraphQL queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/)
to handle the data coming from Strapi and create content pages.
The most important files in the template you should consult are:

- [`gatsby/gatsby-node.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/gatsby-node.js) 

    Dynamically creates individual pages from the data source using Gatsby's [Node API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/). It retrieves all of Strapi's articles and categories (see [post-install below](#deploy-and-post-install)) using the GraphQL queries `allStrapiArticle` and `allStrapiCategory` respectively. For each, a page is created (`createPage`) with an assigned `path` and formatting described by one of the template files below (`component`).

- [`gatsby/src/templates/article.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/src/templates/article.js)

    The template file that defines how a single Strapi article should be formatted on Gatsby, retrieving the data from that article using the `strapiArticle` GraphQL query.

- [`gatsby/src/templates/category.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/src/templates/category.js)

    The template file that defines how a list of articles that belong to a single Category are formatted by Gatsby. It uses the `Category` query, and then filters a specific category `id` on `allStrapiArticle`.

- [`gatsby/src/pages/index.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/src/pages/index.js)

    Retrieves all of Strapi's content to generate a list of articles on the homepage using the `allStrapiArticle` GraphQL query. 

###### Deploy and post-install

When you first deploy the template, the frontend Gatsby site will fail with a 403 error.
Visit the `backend` subdomain of your site and finish the installation of Strapi.
You don't need to set database credentials as they're already provided.

After you have deployed, you need to set up Strapi’s Admin Panel and some initial content endpoints for the Gatsby frontend to consume. Create your admin user at the ``backend`` subdomain for Strapi. You can then follow the [template’s post-install instructions](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi#user-content-post-install) to setup up some initial ``Article`` and ``Category`` content endpoints. The API you develop there is only accessible by admins by default, so be sure to adjust the permissions to public so Gatsby can access it.

Once you've finished, redeploy the project with the CLI command `platform redeploy` to view your Gatsby site,
It's now pulling its content from a backend Strapi container in the same project.

###### Next steps

With Gatsby now deployed and pulling content from a backend Strapi application, there are a few things you may wish to change about your project going forward.

####### Shared application configuration

You can optionally combine the application configuration (`.platform/services.yaml`) for Gatsby
and Strapi into a [single configuration file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#unified-app-configuration).
Like `.platform/services.yaml` and `.platform/routes.yaml`, this file is shared across the project and resides in the `.platform` subdirectory.
You need to explicitly define the source of each application.

####### Multiple content sources

Gatsby supports pulling multiple sources into its build.
This includes external services like Stripe and additional backend CMSs for different sets of content.
As in this example with Strapi,
you can branch off your repository and add an additional directory that contains the codebase for [another backend](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/headless.md#headless-backends).
Then add the source plugin for that backend to `gatsby-config.js`.

####### Plan size

As mentioned previously, you should have at least a Medium
 plan for your multi-app projects.
This size gives the project enough resources for all of your containers
as well as the memory necessary to actually pull content from Strapi into Gatsby during its build.

Keep in mind that the increased plan size applies only to your production environment,
and not to preview environments (which default to Standard
).
As you continue to work with Gatsby and a backend headless CMS,
you may want to [upsize your preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#preview-environments).

#### How to deploy Gatsby with WordPress on Upsun Fixed


Upsun Fixed maintains a [template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-wordpress) that you can quickly deploy, and then use this guide as a reference for the Upsun Fixed specific changes that have been made to Gatsby and WordPress to make it work. 

###### Shared configuration

Your local clone of the template has the following project structure:

```bash
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── wordpress
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
└── README.md
```

From this repository, you deploy a Gatsby app and a WordPress app.
The code for each of them resides in their own directories.
When deploying a single app project [such as Gatsby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md),
the repository needs three configuration files that describe its infrastructure, described below in detail.
For [multi-app projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md),
two of those files remain in the project root and are shared between Gatsby and WordPress.
Each app keeps its own app configuration file (`.platform.app.yaml`) in its subdirectory.

####### Service configuration

This file describes which [service containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) (such as a database) your project should include.
Gatsby does not require services to deploy, but WordPress does.
So the following examples shows these service configurations:

```yaml {}
db:
    type: mariadb:10.4
    disk: 512

```

####### Routes configuration

This [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) file defines how requests are handled by Upsun Fixed.
The following example shows Gatsby being served from the primary domain
and WordPress being accessible from the `backend` subdomain.

```yaml {}
"https://www.{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "gatsby:http"

"https://{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://www.{default}/"

"https://backend.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "wordpress:http"
    cache:
        enabled: true
        # Base the cache on the session cookies. Ignore all other cookies.
        cookies:
            - '/^wordpress_logged_in_/'
            - '/^wordpress_sec_/'
            - 'wordpress_test_cookie'
            - '/^wp-settings-/'
            - '/^wp-postpass/'
            - '/^wp-resetpass-/'

```

###### WordPress

The multi-app template has a single modification to Upsun Fixed's [standard WordPress template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/wordpress):
the `name` attribute in WordPress's `.platform/services.yaml` has been updated to `wordpress`.
This value is used to define the [relationship between Gatsby and WordPress](#gatsby)
and in the [routes configuration](#routes-configuration).

###### Gatsby

The frontend Gatsby app has a slightly different configuration from the basic [Gatsby deployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md).
Below is the `gatsby/.platform.app.yaml` file that configures the app.

```yaml {}
# .platform.app.yaml

# The name of this application, which must be unique within a project.
name: 'gatsby'

# The type key specifies the language and version for your application.
type: 'nodejs:14'

# Restrict Yarn memory use when running during post deploy hook.
variables:
    env:
        NODE_OPTIONS: --max_old_space_size=1536

# The hooks that will be triggered when the package is deployed.
hooks:
    # Post deploy hook builds Gatsby frontend now that backend content is available.
    post_deploy: |
        npm run build        

relationships:
    wordpress: "wordpress:http"

# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 1280

# The configuration of the application when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    locations:
        '/':
            # The public directory of the application relative to its root.
            root: 'public'
            index: ['index.html']
            scripts: false
            allow: true

mounts:
  '/.cache':
      source: local
      source_path: cache
  '/.config':
      source: local
      source_path: config
  'public':
      source: local
      source_path: public

```

In particular, notice:

- `relationships`

  Access to another service or app container in the cluster is given through [`relationships`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).
  In this case, one has been defined to the backend WordPress container using it's `name`.

- `post_deploy`

  Upsun Fixed containers reside in separate build containers at build time,
  before their images are moved to the final app container at deploy time.
  These build containers are isolated and so Gatsby can't access WordPress during the build hook,
  where you would normally run the [`gatsby build` command](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml#L21).

  There are consequences to postponing the Gatsby build,
  as you don't generally have write access to the container this late in the pipeline.
  To allow Gatsby to write to `public`, that directory has been defined as a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#mounts).

You can then modify [gatsby-config.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/)
to read from the backend WordPress container through the ``wordpress`` relationship defined above
to configure the ``baseUrl`` attribute for ``gatsby-source-wordpress``.
The plugin requires you to define the ``protocol``,
which in this case is ``http`` because WordPress content is retrieved through an internal request to the backend container.
Also, you need to declare ``hostingWPCOM: false`` as you don’t pull data from a WordPress site hosted at wordpress.com.

This is facilitated by Upsun Fixed's [Config Reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs).
So be sure to install this to the Gatsby dependencies first when replicating.
When used, Gatsby pulls the information to communicate with the WordPress container *on the current branch*.

Lastly, the Gatsby app itself needs to include [GraphQL queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/)

    Dynamically creates individual pages from the data source using Gatsby's [Node API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/). It retrieves all of WordPress's posts using the GraphQL query `allWordpressPost`. A page is created (`createPage`) with an assigned `path` and formatting described by the `blog-post.js` template file below (`component`).

- [`gatsby/src/templates/blog-post.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-wordpress/blob/master/gatsby/src/templates/blog-post.js)

    The template file that defines how a single WordPress post should be formatted on Gatsby, retrieving the data from that post using the `allWordpressPost` GraphQL query and filtering for its `slug`.

- [`gatsby/src/pages/index.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-wordpress/blob/master/gatsby/src/pages/index.js)

    Retrieves all of WordPress's content to generate a list of posts on the homepage using the `allWordpressPost` GraphQL query. 

###### Deploy and post-install

When you first deploy the template, the frontend Gatsby site will fail with a 403 error.
Visit the `backend` subdomain of your site and finish the installation of WordPress.
You don't need to set database credentials as they're already provided.

WordPress comes with an initial “Hello world” article, and it isn’t necessary to add any more content to the site.

Once you've finished, redeploy the project with the CLI command `platform redeploy` to view your Gatsby site,
It's now pulling its content from a backend WordPress container in the same project.

###### Next steps

With Gatsby now deployed and pulling content from a backend WordPress application, there are a few things you may wish to change about your project going forward.

####### Shared application configuration

You can optionally combine the application configuration (`.platform/services.yaml`) for Gatsby
and WordPress into a [single configuration file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#unified-app-configuration).

### Deploy Next.js on Upsun Fixed

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework for building websites and web apps,
with server-side rendering and static site generation.

See an example Next.js project in the official [Upsun Fixed Next.js template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs).
You can use it as a starting point for your own project.

If you already have a Next.js project ready to deploy,
see the template's [example app configuration](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml)
and other [example Upsun Fixed files](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs/tree/master/.platform).
These files let you [configure your app](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md),
[add services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), and [define routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

### Deploy Strapi on Upsun Fixed

[Strapi](https://strapi.io) is an open-source headless CMS for building fast and manageable APIs written in JavaScript.

To get Strapi running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Strapi site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Strapi site.

    -   Use a ready-made [Strapi template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/strapi4).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Strapi template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure Strapi](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/strapi/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Strapi for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml && touch .platform.app.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Strapi in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Strapi requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

In the Strapi template, ``yarn`` is run during the build hook to install all of Strapi’s dependencies, and then ``yarn build`` is run to build the site.
If you would rather use npm to manage your dependencies, you can:

 - Delete ``yarn`` from the build hook.
 - Replace ``yarn build`` in the build hook with ``npm run build``.
 - Delete the ``build.flavor`` block.
When this is set to ``none``, Upsun Fixed to rely solely on the build hook to define the build process.
By default, Node.js containers run ``npm install`` prior to the build hook,
so this block can be removed entirely from the configuration.
 - Delete the ``dependencies`` block, which includes yarn.

The relationships block is responsible for providing access to the data sources (services) that the Strapi application needs.
Since Upsun Fixed is read-only during build, mainly for security purposes, certain folders need to be mounted.
Upsun Fixed allows you to mount directories that need write access during the deploy phase with the ``mounts`` key.
In this case, the following folders are mounted for Strapi.

 - ``.cache`` file
 - ``.tmp`` file

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

Strapi requires a database to deploy.
By default, it uses a SQLite database but other database types are also supported.
These other database types are Oracle MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB (available only in Strapi v3 and below).
The Strapi template defines a PostgreSQL database service.
To use another service, replace ``postgresql:12`` in the example below with the name and version of the database you want.

You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure  to use those services once they're enabled.

Each service entry has a name (`db` in the example)
and a `type` that specifies the service and version to use.
Services that store persistent data have a `disk` key, to specify the amount of storage.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The services of the project.

# Each service listed is deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.

db:
  type: postgresql:12
  disk: 256

# Uncomment the line below to use a MySQL database
# dbmysql:
#   type: oracle-mysql:8.0
#   disk: 256
```

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Strapi app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/
"https://www.{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"

# A basic redirect definition
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/routes/examples/redirect/
"https://{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://www.{default}/"

```

#### Deploy Strapi


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Additional changes

A standard Strapi site
(one created either interactively through `npx create-strapi-app@latest my-project` or through a template)
generates a basic Strapi instance with access to the admin panel without any external services.
If this is your starting point, you have all of the configuration necessary to deploy your project.
Below are a few modifications that may help you develop your site more efficiently going forward.

####### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

Install the package with your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install platformsh-config

# Or for Yarn
yarn add platformsh-config
```

Go forth and deploy (even on Friday)!

### Configuring Database Services for Strapi on Upsun Fixed

Strapi requires a database in order for it to run successfully. It currently has support for the following database types:

- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle MySQL/MariaDB
- MongoDB (only Strapi v3)
#### Configure SQLite for Strapi on Upsun Fixed

Strapi uses SQLite database by default when it's run on a local machine.
When you create a new Strapi project, you can use SQLite or a custom database installation (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL).
Since Strapi uses SQLite by default, you don't need much configuration, just follow these steps:

1. In your Strapi project, install the [config reader](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

   ```bash
   npm install platformsh-config

   # or for Yarn
   yarn add platformsh-config
   ```

1. Create a new Strapi project and select Quickstart as the installation type.
   This automatically configures Strapi for SQLite

   ```bash
   npx create-strapi-app <APP_NAME>
   ```

1. In the `config` folder, locate the `database.js` file, and replace its content with the following:

   ```js
   const config = require("platformsh-config").config();
   const path = require("path");

   let dbRelationship = "pg";

   // Strapi default sqlite settings.
   let pool = {};
   let connection = {
   connection: {
   client: 'sqlite',
   connection: {
   filename: path.join(\_\_dirname, '..', process.env.DATABASE_FILENAME || '.tmp/data.db'),
   },
   useNullAsDefault: true,
     },
   };

   if (config.isValidPlatform() && !config.inBuild()) {
   // Upsun Fixed database configuration.
   try {
   const credentials = config.credentials(dbRelationship);
   console.log(`Using Upsun Fixed configuration with relationship ${dbRelationship}.`);

       pool = {
         min: 0,
         max: 10,
         acquireTimeoutMillis: 600000,
         createTimeoutMillis: 30000,
         idleTimeoutMillis: 20000,
         reapIntervalMillis: 20000,
         createRetryIntervalMillis: 200,
       };

       connection = {
         connection: {
           client: "postgres",
           connection: {
             host: credentials.ip,
             port: credentials.port,
             database: credentials.path,
             user: credentials.username,
             password: credentials.password,
             ssl: false
           },
           debug: false,
           pool
         },
       };

   }
   catch (e) {
   // Do nothing if 'pg' relationship isn't found.
   // Database configuration falls back on the SQLite defaults.
     }
   } else {
   if (config.isValidPlatform()) {
   // Build hook configuration message.
   console.log('Using default configuration during Upsun Fixed build hook until relationships are available.');
   } else {
   // Strapi default local configuration.
   console.log('Not in an Upsun Fixed Environment. Using default local sqlite configuration.');
    }
   }

   // strapi-api/config/database.js
   module.exports = ({ env }) => ( connection );
   ```

This setting deploys your Strapi application with an SQLite database.
#### Configure PostgreSQL for Strapi on Upsun Fixed

Strapi can be configured to use PostgreSQL as its default database.
You can choose PostgreSQL when installing your app by selecting custom and PostgreSQL when asked for the installation type
or you can just configure your existing Strapi application to use PostgreSQL.
To configure a PostgreSQL database for Strapi on Upsun Fixed, follow these steps.

1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your machine
   and [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) in your Strapi project.
   Pg comes installed with a fresh Strapi installation.

1. In your `.platform/services.yaml` file, add the following:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
   	postgres:
      type: postgresql:13
        disk: 512
   ```

1. In your `.platform.app.yaml` file, replace the relationship name to match the PostgreSQL database you added:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   relationships:
     postgresdatabase: "postgres:postgresql"
   ```

1. In the `config` folder, locate the `database.js` file, and replace its content with the following:

   ```js
   const path = require("path");
   const config = require("platformsh-config").config();

   let dbRelationship = "postgresdatabase";

   // Strapi default sqlite settings.
   let connection = {
     connection: {
       client: "sqlite",
       connection: {
         filename: path.join(
           __dirname,
           "..",
           process.env.DATABASE_FILENAME || ".tmp/data.db"
         ),
       },
       useNullAsDefault: true,
     },
   };

   if (config.isValidPlatform() && !config.inBuild()) {
     // Upsun Fixed database configuration.
     const credentials = config.credentials(dbRelationship);
     console.log(
       `Using Upsun Fixed configuration with relationship ${dbRelationship}.`
     );

     let pool = {
       min: 0,
       max: 10,
       acquireTimeoutMillis: 600000,
       createTimeoutMillis: 30000,
       idleTimeoutMillis: 20000,
       reapIntervalMillis: 20000,
       createRetryIntervalMillis: 200,
     };

     connection = {
       connection: {
         client: "postgres",
         connection: {
           host: credentials.ip,
           port: credentials.port,
           database: credentials.path,
           user: credentials.username,
           password: credentials.password,
           ssl: false,
         },
         debug: false,
         pool,
       },
     };
   } else {
     if (config.isValidPlatform()) {
       // Build hook configuration message.
       console.log(
         "Using default configuration during Upsun Fixed build hook until relationships are available."
       );
     } else {
       // Strapi default local configuration.
       console.log(
         "Not in an Upsun Fixed Environment. Using default local sqlite configuration."
       );
     }
   }

   console.log(connection);

   // export strapi database connection
   module.exports = ({ env }) => connection;
   ```

This setting deploys your Strapi application with a PostgreSQL database.
If you don't specify a PostgreSQL service in your `.platform/services.yaml` file or the Strapi application is run on a local machine
the default SQLite database is used.
#### Configure MySQL for Strapi on Upsun Fixed

Strapi can be configured to use MySQL as its default database.
You can choose MySQL when installing your app by selecting custom and MySQL when asked for the installation type.
Or you can just configure your existing Strapi application to use MySQL.
To configure a MySQL database for Strapi on Upsun Fixed, follow these steps.

1. Install the Node.js [MySQL driver](https://yarnpkg.com/package/mysql)

   ```bash
   yarn add mysql
   ```

2. Replace the PostgreSQL configuration in your `.platform/services.yaml` file with the following:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
   mysql:
     type: oracle-mysql:8.0
     disk: 256
   ```

   **_Note that the minimum disk size for MySQL/Oracle MySQL is 256MB._**

3. In your `.platform.app.yaml` file, replace the relationship name to match the MySQL database you added:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   relationships:
     mysqldatabase:
       service: "mysql"
       endpoint: "mysql"
   ```

4. In the `config` folder, locate the `database.js` file, and replace its content with the following:

   ```js
   const config = require("platformsh-config").config();
   const path = require("path");

   let dbRelationship = "mysqldatabase";

   // Strapi default sqlite settings.
   let pool = {};
   let connection = {
     connection: {
       client: "sqlite",
       connection: {
         filename: path.join(
           __dirname,
           "..",
           process.env.DATABASE_FILENAME || ".tmp/data.db"
         ),
       },
       useNullAsDefault: true,
     },
   };

   if (config.isValidPlatform() && !config.inBuild()) {
     // Upsun Fixed database configuration.
     try {
       const credentials = config.credentials(dbRelationship);
       console.log(
         `Using Upsun Fixed configuration with relationship ${dbRelationship}.`
       );

       pool = {
         min: 0,
         max: 10,
         acquireTimeoutMillis: 600000,
         createTimeoutMillis: 30000,
         idleTimeoutMillis: 20000,
         reapIntervalMillis: 20000,
         createRetryIntervalMillis: 200,
       };

       connection = {
         connection: {
           client: "mysql",
           connection: {
             host: credentials.ip,
             port: credentials.port,
             database: credentials.path,
             user: credentials.username,
             password: credentials.password,
             ssl: false,
           },
           debug: false,
           pool,
         },
       };
     } catch (e) {
       // Do nothing if 'pg' relationship isn't found.
       // Database configuration will fall back on the SQLite defaults.
     }
   } else {
     if (config.isValidPlatform()) {
       // Build hook configuration message.
       console.log(
         "Using default configuration during Upsun Fixed build hook until relationships are available."
       );
     } else {
       // Strapi default local configuration.

       console.log(
         "Not in an Upsun Fixed Environment. Using default local sqlite configuration."
       );
     }
   }
   // strapi-api/config/database.js
   module.exports = ({ env }) => connection;
   ```

This setting deploys your Strapi application with a MySQL database.
If you don't specify a MySQL service in your `.platform/services.yaml` file or the Strapi application is run on a local machine
the default SQLite database is used.
#### Configure MongoDB for Strapi on Upsun Fixed

Strapi can also be configured to use MongoDB as its default database,
although due to compatibility issues this database type is only available in Strapi v3 and [not supported in Strapi v4](https://forum.strapi.io/t/mongodb-compatibility-delayed-on-v4/4549).
To use MongoDB with a Strapi v3 application on Upsun Fixed, follow these steps.

1. Install the [Strapi mongoose connector](https://yarnpkg.com/package/strapi-connector-mongoose)

   ```bash
   yarn add strapi-connector-mongoose
   ```

1. Replace the PostgreSQL configuration in your `.platform/services.yaml` file with the following:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
   mongodb:
     type: mongodb:3.6
     disk: 512
   ```

  **_Note that the minimum disk size for MongoDB is 512MB._**

1. In your `.platform.app.yaml` file, replace the relationship name to match the MongoDB database you added:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   relationships:
     mongodatabase:
       service: "mongodb"
       endpoint: "mongodb"
   ```

1. In the `config` folder, locate the `database.js` file, and replace its content with the following:

   ```js
   const config = require("platformsh-config").config();
   let dbRelationshipMongo = "mongodatabase";

   // Strapi default sqlite settings.
   let settings = {
     client: "sqlite",
     filename: process.env.DATABASE_FILENAME || ".tmp/data.db",
   };

   let options = {
     useNullAsDefault: true,
   };

   if (config.isValidPlatform() && !config.inBuild()) {
     // Upsun Fixed database configuration.
     const credentials = config.credentials(dbRelationshipMongo);

     console.log(
       `Using Upsun Fixed configuration with relationship ${dbRelationshipMongo}.`
     );

     settings = {
       client: "mongo",
       host: credentials.host,
       port: credentials.port,
       database: credentials.path,
       username: credentials.username,
       password: credentials.password,
     };

     options = {
       ssl: false,
       authenticationDatabase: "main",
     };
   } else {
     if (config.isValidPlatform()) {
       // Build hook configuration message.
       console.log(
         "Using default configuration during Upsun Fixed build hook until relationships are available."
       );
     } else {
       // Strapi default local configuration.
       console.log(
         "Not in an Upsun Fixed Environment. Using default local sqlite configuration."
       );
     }
   }

   module.exports = {
     defaultConnection: "default",
     connections: {
       default: {
         connector: "mongoose",
         settings: settings,
         options: options,
       },
     },
   };
   ```

This configuration instructs Upsun Fixed to deploy your Strapi v3 app with a MongoDB database.
### Local development: Running Strapi on your local machine with Upsun Fixed

Upsun Fixed provides support for locally running a Strapi application that has been deployed on Upsun Fixed including its services.
This means that once you download the code of the Strapi project you deployed on Upsun Fixed,
you can make changes to the project without pushing to Upsun Fixed each time to test them.
You can build your app locally using the Upsun Fixed CLI, even when its functionality depends on a number of services. You can run your Strapi application locally with all of it’s services by following the steps for your Strapi version:
#### Develop locally with Strapi v3

You can run your Strapi v3 app locally with all of its services.

First install the [config reader](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app) by running the following command:

```bash
npm install platformsh-config OR yarn add platformsh-config
```

It's also assumed that your `database.js` file in your `config` folder looks like this:

```js
const config = require("platformsh-config").config();

let dbRelationship = "postgresdatabase";

// Strapi default sqlite settings.
let settings = {
  client: "sqlite",
  filename: process.env.DATABASE_FILENAME || ".tmp/data.db",
};

let options = {
  useNullAsDefault: true,
};

if (config.isValidPlatform() && !config.inBuild()) {
  // Upsun Fixed database configuration.
  const credentials = config.credentials(dbRelationship);
  console.log(
    `Using Upsun Fixed configuration with relationship ${dbRelationship}.`
  );

  settings = {
    client: "postgres",
    host: credentials.ip,
    port: credentials.port,
    database: credentials.path,
    username: credentials.username,
    password: credentials.password,
  };

  options = {
    ssl: false,
    debug: false,
    acquireConnectionTimeout: 100000,
    pool: {
      min: 0,
      max: 10,
      createTimeoutMillis: 30000,
      acquireTimeoutMillis: 600000,
      idleTimeoutMillis: 20000,
      reapIntervalMillis: 20000,
      createRetryIntervalMillis: 200,
    },
  };
} else {
  if (config.isValidPlatform()) {
    // Build hook configuration message.
    console.log(
      "Using default configuration during Upsun Fixed build hook until relationships are available."
    );
  } else {
    // Strapi default local configuration.
    console.log(
      "Not in an Upsun Fixed Environment. Using default local sqlite configuration."
    );
  }
}

module.exports = {
  defaultConnection: "default",
  connections: {
    default: {
      connector: "bookshelf",
      settings: settings,
      options: options,
    },
  },
};
```

If it's similar to the above and you’re running a Strapi v3 application,
follow the [instructions for general local development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local.md).
#### Develop locally with Strapi v4

To run your Strapi v4 app locally with all of its services, follow these steps:

1. Download your deployed code by running the following command using the Upsun Fixed CLI:

   ```bash
   platform get <PROJECT_ID>
   ```

2. Create a new branch.
   Whenever you develop Upsun Fixed, you should develop in an isolated environment.
   This way you aren't opening SSH tunnels to your production environment.
   By creating a branch from your default environment,
   you create a new environment with copies of all production code and data.

   Create an isolated environment named `updates` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform environment:branch updates
   ```

   You can name the environment anything you want, just use the name you choose in later steps.

3. Assuming you're using a PostgreSQL or MySQL database,
   modify your database connection to look like the following:

   ```js  {location="config/database.js"}
   const path = require("path");
   let connection;
   let db_relationship = "postgresdatabase";
   // Helper function for decoding Upsun Fixed base64-encoded JSON variables.
   function decode(value) {
     return JSON.parse(Buffer.from(value, "base64"));
   }
   if (!process.env.PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS) {
     if (process.env.PLATFORM_PROJECT) {
       console.log(
         "In Upsun Fixed build hook. Using default SQLite configuration until services are available."
       );
     } else {
       console.log(
         'Configuring local SQLite connection. \n\nIf you meant to use a tunnel, be sure to run \n\n$ export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info --encode)"\n\nto connect to that service.\n'
       );
     }
     // Define the default SQLite connection.
     connection = {
       connection: {
         client: "sqlite",
         connection: {
           filename: path.join(
             __dirname,
             "..",
             process.env.DATABASE_FILENAME || ".tmp/data.db"
           ),
         },
         useNullAsDefault: true,
       },
     };
   } else {
     if (process.env.PLATFORM_PROJECT) {
       console.log(
         "In Upsun Fixed deploy hook. Using defined service configuration."
       );
     } else {
       console.log("Using tunnel for local development.");
     }
     // Define the managed service connection.
     let credentials = decode(process.env.PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS)[
       db_relationship
     ][0];
     // Option 1. PostgreSQL.
     // The PostgreSQL configuration assumes the following in your .platform/services.yaml file:
     //
     // dbpostgres:
     //    type: postgresql:12
     //    disk: 256
     //
     // And a relationship defined in your .platform.app.yaml file as follows:
     //
     // relationships:
     //    postgresdatabase: "dbpostgres:postgresql"
     if (credentials.scheme == "pgsql") {
       console.log("PostgreSQL detected.");
       let postgres_pool = {
         min: 0,
         max: 10,
         acquireTimeoutMillis: 600000,
         createTimeoutMillis: 30000,
         idleTimeoutMillis: 20000,
         reapIntervalMillis: 20000,
         createRetryIntervalMillis: 200,
       };
       connection = {
         connection: {
           client: "postgres",
           connection: {
             host: credentials.ip,
             port: credentials.port,
             database: credentials.path,
             user: credentials.username,
             password: credentials.password,
             ssl: false,
           },
           debug: false,
           postgres_pool,
         },
       };
       // Option 2. Oracle MySQL.
       // The Oracle MySQL configuration assumes the following in your .platform/services.yaml file:
       //
       // dbmysql:
       //    type: oracle-mysql:8.0
       //    disk: 256
       //
       // And a relationship defined in your .platform.app.yamlfile as follows:
       //
       // relationships:
       //    database: "dbmysql:mysql"
     } else if (credentials.scheme == "mysql") {
       console.log("MySQL detected.");
       connection = {
         connection: {
           client: "mysql",
           connection: {
             host: credentials.ip,
             port: credentials.port,
             database: credentials.path,
             user: credentials.username,
             password: credentials.password,
             ssl: false,
           },
           debug: false,
         },
       };
     }
   }
   // Export the connection to Strapi.
   module.exports = ({ env }) => connection;
   ```

   See the comments for explanations of individual sections.

   If you have defined the relationship to your service differently (in `.platform.app.yaml`)
   or are using a different service, use that name in place of `postgresdatabase`.

4. Open a SSH tunnel to the environment's database:

   ```bash
   platform tunnel:open -A <APP_NAME> -e updates
   ```

   Replace `<APP_NAME>` with your app's `name` in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.

   If you get the error `The pcntl PHP extension is required` error, use this command instead:

   ```bash
   platform tunnel:single -A <APP_NAME> -e updates
   ```

5. Add an environment variable that contains the service credentials:

   ```bash
   export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info -A <APP_NAME> -e updates --encode)"
   ```

6. Download all media uploads from the environment:

   ```bash
   platform mount:download -A <APP_NAME> -e updates -m public/uploads --target public/uploads -y
   ```

7. Build and start the Strapi server:

   ```bash
   yarn --frozen-lockfile
   yarn develop
   ```

Now your Strapi app should be running locally with a connection to a remote database
that's separate from your production database.
### Strapi multi-app projects

##### Background

A common pattern for Strapi applications is to serve as a backend or headless CMS for a frontend application.
This helps with serving external data to a frontend at build time.
Supported by Strapi's plugin ecosystem, data from Strapi (or headless) CMS can be served into a frontend application,
with that frontend typically located on a server elsewhere.

Upsun Fixed provides a platform for this architectural pattern through a [multi-app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md).

Consider the following project structure:

```bash

├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── strapi
│   ├── 
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── 
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
└── README.md
```

Above is the repository structure for a decoupled Strapi project (Gatsby sourcing content from Strapi).
Strapi and Gatsby reside in their own subdirectories within the same repository.
They're deployed to the same project from separate application containers,
and from this cluster Gatsby can read data from Strapi internally.
Their commit histories are tied together,
so each new pull request environment can test changes to either the frontend or backend from the same place.

Gatsby is just one example of a frontend that can be used with this pattern.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Signing up

Each of the frontend guides below has a **Deploy on Upsun Fixed** button that deploys the guide's project for you
and also signs you up for a trial account.
If you're planning on deploying a template and following along with these guides for greater context,
feel free to move onto the next section.

If you're planning on using the templates and guides to deploy your existing codebase to Upsun Fixed,
you first need to [register for a trial Upsun account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
If you don't want to sign up initially with your e-mail address,
you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
If you choose one of these options, you can set a password for your Upsun account later.

After creating an account, you're prompted to create your first project.
Since you are providing your own code, use the **Blank project** option.
Give the project a title and choose a region closest to your site visitors.
You can also select more resources for your project.
This is especially important with multi-application projects, so for more details see [plan size](#plan-size).

##### Plan size

There are a few important points to keep in mind when deploying this pattern if you've already [deployed Gatsby by itself](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md) on Upsun Fixed, which are relevant to each backend example.
After following the steps below,
you may find that Gatsby fails to bundle assets during its build if your plan size is Development.
This is a factor of both the size and number of Gatsby's dependencies on the frontend,
as well as the amount of data being pulled from the backend.

Multi-application projects generally require more resources to run on Upsun Fixed, and so the trial's default Development plan may not be enough to run your existing site.
You are free to either proceed with a smaller plan to test or increase the resources at this point for the project.
Otherwise, it may be best to initially deploy the templates listed in each backend guide to start out
and later modify that project to include your own code with more resources as you get used to developing on Upsun Fixed.

##### Frontends for Strapi

Upsun Fixed maintains a number of [multi-application templates](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/?q=strapi&type=&language=) for Strapi that generally have very similar configuration changes on the Strapi side.
Below are a few of those written as short guides for different frontends.
#### How to deploy Strapi with a Gatsby frontend on Upsun Fixed

Upsun Fixed maintains a [template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi) that you can quickly deploy, and then use this guide as a reference for the Upsun Fixed specific changes that have been made to Gatsby and Strapi to make it work. 

###### Shared configuration

Your local clone of the template has the following project structure:

```bash
├── .platform
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── strapi
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
├── gatsby
│   ├── # App code
│   └── .platform.app.yaml
└── README.md
```

From this repository, you deploy a Gatsby app and a Strapi app.
The code for each of them resides in their own directories.
When deploying a single app project [such as Gatsby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md),
the repository needs three configuration files that describe its infrastructure, described below in detail.
For [multi-app projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md),
two of those files remain in the project root and are shared between Gatsby and Strapi.
Each app keeps its own app configuration file (`.platform.app.yaml`) in its subdirectory.

####### Service configuration

This file describes which [service containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) (such as a database) your project should include.
Gatsby does not require services to deploy, but Strapi does.
So the following examples shows these service configurations:

```yaml {}
# The services of the project.
#
# Each service listed will be deployed
# to power your Upsun Fixed project.

dbpostgres:
    type: postgresql:12
    disk: 256

```

####### Routes configuration

This [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) file defines how requests are handled by Upsun Fixed.
The following example shows Gatsby being served from the primary domain
and Strapi being accessible from the `backend` subdomain.

```yaml {}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://www.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "gatsby:http"

"https://{default}/":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://www.{default}/"

"https://www.backend.{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "strapi:http"

"https://backend.{default}/":
    type: redirect
    id: 'strapi'
    to: "https://www.backend.{default}/"

```

###### Strapi

The multi-app template has a single modification to Upsun Fixed's [standard Strapi template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/strapi):
the `name` attribute in Strapi's `.platform/services.yaml` has been updated to `strapi`.
This value is used to define the [relationship between Gatsby and Strapi](#gatsby)
and in the [routes configuration](#routes-configuration).

The only additional setup required to prepare the backend is to install a package that enables GraphQL on Strapi.

In your Strapi directory, add the dependency:

```bash
yarn add strapi-plugin-graphql
```

###### Gatsby

The frontend Gatsby app has a slightly different configuration from the basic [Gatsby deployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/deploy.md).
Below is the `gatsby/.platform.app.yaml` file that configures the app.

```yaml {}
# .platform.app.yaml

# The name of this application, which must be unique within a project.
name: gatsby

# The type key specifies the language and version for your application.
type: 'nodejs:14'

# The hooks that will be triggered when the package is deployed.
hooks:
    # Build hooks can modify the application files on disk but not access any services like databases.
    post_deploy: |
      npm run build      
# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 1024

relationships:
   strapi: "strapi:http"

# The configuration of the application when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    locations:
        '/':
            # The public directory of the application relative to its root.
            root: 'public'
            index: ['index.html']
            scripts: false
            allow: true

mounts:
  '/.cache':
      source: local
      source_path: cache
  '/.config':
      source: local
      source_path: config
  'public':
      source: local
      source_path: public

```

In particular, notice:

- `relationships`

  Access to another service or app container in the cluster is given through [`relationships`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#relationships).
  In this case, one has been defined to the backend Strapi container using it's `name`.

- `post_deploy`

  Upsun Fixed containers reside in separate build containers at build time,
  before their images are moved to the final app container at deploy time.
  These build containers are isolated and so Gatsby can't access Strapi during the build hook,
  where you would normally run the [`gatsby build` command](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml#L21).
  Strapi isn't available until after the deploy hook.
  So the Gatsby build is postponed until the [`post_deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook).

  To run `gatsby build` on-demand, or to trigger a rebuild from the backend when content is updated,
  define a [runtime operation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/runtime-operations.md#build-your-app-when-using-a-static-site-generator).

- `mounts`

  There are consequences to postponing the Gatsby build,
  as you don't generally have write access to the container this late in the pipeline.
  To allow Gatsby to write to `public`, that directory has been defined as a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image#mounts).

You can then modify [gatsby-config.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) to read from the backend Strapi container through the ``strapi`` relationship defined above to configure the ``apiURL`` attribute for ``gatsby-source-strapi``. Notice that the source plugin requires that you explicitly define the ``contentTypes`` you would like to retrieve from Strapi. At this point you have not built out the API, and the Content Types ``article`` and ``category`` are included to support the [post-install instructions](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi#user-content-post-install) outlined in the template’s README. Adjust these values to fit your current API if your are planning on migrating an existing Strapi repository.

This is facilitated by Upsun Fixed's [Config Reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs).
So be sure to install this to the Gatsby dependencies first when replicating.
When used, Gatsby pulls the information to communicate with the Strapi container *on the current branch*.

Lastly, the Gatsby app itself needs to include [GraphQL queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/)
to handle the data coming from Strapi and create content pages.
The most important files in the template you should consult are:

- [`gatsby/gatsby-node.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/gatsby-node.js)

  Dynamically creates individual pages from the data source using Gatsby's [Node API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/). It retrieves all of Strapi's articles and categories (see [post-install below](#deploy-and-post-install)) using the GraphQL queries `allStrapiArticle` and `allStrapiCategory` respectively. For each, a page is created (`createPage`) with an assigned `path` and formatting described by one of the template files below (`component`).

- [`gatsby/src/templates/article.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/src/templates/article.js)

  The template file that defines how a single Strapi article should be formatted on Gatsby, retrieving the data from that article using the `strapiArticle` GraphQL query.

- [`gatsby/src/templates/category.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/src/templates/category.js)

  The template file that defines how a list of articles that belong to a single Category are formatted by Gatsby. It uses the `Category` query, and then filters a specific category `id` on `allStrapiArticle`.

- [`gatsby/src/pages/index.js`](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi/blob/master/gatsby/src/pages/index.js)

  Retrieves all of Strapi's content to generate a list of articles on the homepage using the `allStrapiArticle` GraphQL query.

###### Deploy and post-install

When you first deploy the template, the frontend Gatsby site will fail with a 403 error.
Visit the `backend` subdomain of your site and finish the installation of Strapi.
You don't need to set database credentials as they're already provided.

After you have deployed, you need to set up Strapi’s Admin Panel and some initial content endpoints for the Gatsby frontend to consume. Create your admin user at the ``backend`` subdomain for Strapi. You can then follow the [template’s post-install instructions](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gatsby-strapi#user-content-post-install) to setup up some initial ``Article`` and ``Category`` content endpoints. The API you develop there is only accessible to admins by default, so be sure to adjust the permissions to public so Gatsby can access it.

Once you've finished, redeploy the project with the CLI command `platform redeploy` to view your Gatsby site,
It's now pulling its content from a backend Strapi container in the same project.

###### Next steps

With Gatsby now deployed and pulling content from a backend Strapi application, there are a few things you may wish to change about your project going forward.

####### Shared application configuration

You can optionally combine the application configuration (`.platform/services.yaml`) for Gatsby
and Strapi into a [single configuration file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#unified-app-configuration).
Like `.platform/services.yaml` and `.platform/routes.yaml`, this file is shared across the project and resides in the `.platform` subdirectory.
You need to explicitly define the source of each application.

####### Multiple content sources

Gatsby supports pulling multiple sources into its build. This can include external services like Stripe, or additional backend CMSs for different sets of content. Like shown here with Strapi, you can branch off your repository and add an additional subdirectory that contains the codebase for another frontend.

####### Plan size

As mentioned previously, you should have at least a Medium
 plan for your multi-app projects.
This size gives the project enough resources for all of your containers
as well as the memory necessary to actually pull content from Strapi into Gatsby during its build.

Keep in mind that the increased plan size applies only to your production environment,
and not to preview environments (which default to Standard
).
As you continue to work with Gatsby and a backend headless CMS,
you may want to [upsize your preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#preview-environments).


### Deploy Hibernate ORM on Upsun Fixed

[Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/) is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate handles object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.

##### Services

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the[Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

Note that the Java configuration reader library is used in the following examples.

###### MySQL

[MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) is an open-source relational database technology. Define the driver for [MySQL](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java), and the Java dependencies. Then determine the SessionFactory client programmatically:

```java
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.Hibernate;

public class HibernateApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Config config = new Config();
        Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
        configuration.addAnnotatedClass(Address.class);
        final Hibernate credential = config.getCredential("database", Hibernate::new);
        final SessionFactory sessionFactory = credential.getMySQL(configuration);
        try (Session session = sessionFactory.openSession()) {
            Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();
            //...
            transaction.commit();
        }
    }
}
```

**Note**: 

You can use the same MySQL driver for MariaDB as well if you wish to do so.

###### MariaDB

[MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) is an open-source relational database technology. Define the driver for [MariaDB](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mariadb.jdbc/mariadb-java-client), and the Java dependencies. Then determine the SessionFactory client programmatically:

```java
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.Hibernate;

public class HibernateApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Config config = new Config();
        Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
        configuration.addAnnotatedClass(Address.class);
        final Hibernate credential = config.getCredential("database", Hibernate::new);
        final SessionFactory sessionFactory = credential.getMariaDB(configuration);
        try (Session session = sessionFactory.openSession()) {
            Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();
            //...
            transaction.commit();
        }
    }
}
```

###### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md) is an open-source relational database technology. Define the driver for [PostgreSQL](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/postgresql/postgresql), and the Java dependencies. Then determine the SessionFactory client programmatically:

```java
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.Hibernate;

public class HibernateApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Config config = new Config();
        Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
        configuration.addAnnotatedClass(Address.class);
        final Hibernate credential = config.getCredential("database", Hibernate::new);
        final SessionFactory sessionFactory = credential.getPostgreSQL(configuration);
        try (Session session = sessionFactory.openSession()) {
            Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();
            //...
            transaction.commit();
        }
    }
}
```

### Deploy Jakarta on Upsun Fixed

[Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) is a community dedicated to optimizing the Enterprise Java mission for microservice-based architectures. The goal is to define a microservices application platform that is portable across multiple runtimes. Currently, the leading players in this group are IBM, Red Hat, Tomitribe, Payara, the London Java Community (LJC), and SouJava.

Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is an umbrella that holds specifications and APIs with enterprise features, like distributed computing and web services. Widely used in Java, Java EE runs on reference runtimes that can be anything from microservices to application servers that handle transactions, security, scalability, concurrency, and management for the components it’s deploying. Now, Enterprise Java has been standardized under the Eclipse Foundation with the name [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/).

##### Services

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the[Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

Note that the Java configuration reader library is used in the following examples.

###### MongoDB

You can use [Jakarta NoSQL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.nosql)/[JNoSQL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jnosql) to use [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mongodb.md) with your application by first determining the MongoDB client programmatically.

    }

    public void destroy(@Disposes DocumentCollectionManager manager) {
        this.manager.close();
    }
}
```

###### Apache Solr

You can use [Jakarta NoSQL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.nosql)/[JNoSQL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jnosql) to use [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) with your application by first determining the Solr client programmatically.

    }

    public void destroy(@Disposes DocumentCollectionManager manager) {
        this.manager.close();
    }
}
```

###### Redis

You can use [Jakarta NoSQL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.nosql)/[JNoSQL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jnosql) to use [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md) with your application by first determining the Redis client programmatically.

```

###### MySQL

[MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) is an open-source relational database technology, and Jakarta EE supports a robust integration with it: [JPA](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jpa).

The first step is to choose the database that you would like to use in your project. Define the driver for [MySQL](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java) and the Java dependencies. Then determine the DataSource client programmatically:

```java
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.JPA;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Disposes;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory;

@ApplicationScoped
class EntityManagerConfiguration {

    private EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;

    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @PostConstruct
    void setUp() {
        Config config = new Config();
        final JPA credential = config.getCredential("postgresql", JPA::new);
        entityManagerFactory = credential.getMySQL("jpa-example");
        this.entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
    }

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    EntityManagerFactory getEntityManagerFactory() {
        return entityManagerFactory;
    }

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    EntityManager getEntityManager() {
        return entityManager;
    }

    void close(@Disposes EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory) {
        entityManagerFactory.close();
    }

    void close(@Disposes EntityManager entityManager) {
        entityManager.close();
    }

}
```

**Note**: 

You can use the same MySQL driver for MariaDB as well if you wish to do so.

###### MariaDB

[MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) is an open-source relational database technology, and Jakarta EE supports a robust integration with it: [JPA](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jpa).

The first step is to choose the database that you would like to use in your project. Define the driver for [MariaDB](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mariadb.jdbc/mariadb-java-client) and the Java dependencies. Then determine the DataSource client programmatically:

```java
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.JPA;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Disposes;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory;

@ApplicationScoped

        entityManagerFactory = credential.getMariaDB("jpa-example");
        this.entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
    }

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    EntityManagerFactory getEntityManagerFactory() {
        return entityManagerFactory;
    }

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    EntityManager getEntityManager() {

    }

    void close(@Disposes EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory) {
        entityManagerFactory.close();
    }

    void close(@Disposes EntityManager entityManager) {

}

```

###### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md) is an open-source relational database technology, and Jakarta EE supports a robust integration with it: [JPA](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jpa).

The first step is to choose the database that you would like to use in your project. Define the driver for [PostgreSQL](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/postgresql/postgresql) and the Java dependencies. Then determine the DataSource client programmatically:

    }

    void close(@Disposes EntityManager entityManager) {
        entityManager.close();
    }

}
```

##### Transaction

To any Eclipse MicroProfile or any non-JTA application is essential to point out, CDI doesn't provide transaction management implementation as part of its specs. Transaction management is left to be implemented by the programmer through the interceptors, such as the code below.

```java
import javax.annotation.Priority;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.interceptor.AroundInvoke;
import javax.interceptor.Interceptor;
import javax.interceptor.InvocationContext;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.EntityTransaction;
import javax.transaction.Transactional;

@Transactional
@Interceptor
@Priority(Interceptor.Priority.APPLICATION)
public class TransactionInterceptor {

    @Inject
    private EntityManager manager;

    @AroundInvoke
    public Object manageTransaction(InvocationContext context) throws Exception {
        final EntityTransaction transaction = manager.getTransaction();
        transaction.begin();
        try {
            Object result = context.proceed();
            transaction.commit();
            return result;
        } catch (Exception exp) {
            transaction.rollback();
            throw exp;
        }
    }
}
```

To treat this issue, see the [Apache Delta Spike docs](https://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/jpa.md#_extended_persistence_contexts).

### Deploy Micronaut on Upsun Fixed

[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) is an open-source, JVM-based framework for building full-stack, modular, testable microservice and serverless applications.

Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks that load and cache reflection data for every single field, method, and constructor in your code, with Micronaut, your application startup time and memory consumption aren't bound to the size of your codebase.

Micronaut's cloud support is built right in, including support for common discovery services, distributed tracing tools, and cloud runtimes.

To get Micronaut running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Micronaut site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Micronaut site.

    -   Use a ready-made [Micronaut template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/micronaut).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Micronaut template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Micronaut for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Micronaut in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Micronaut requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

Explaining the file line by line, notice the following settings:

 - ``name``: The application name.
 - ``type`` Where you’ll define the language, in this case, Java, and the version.
 - ``disk``: The disk space that the application needs in megabytes.
 - ``hooks.build``: The command to package the application.
 - ``web.commands``: The order to start the application,
where the port is overwritten using the ``PORT`` environment variable provided by Upsun Fixed to the application container.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
# in the same project.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/configure/

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: app

# The runtime the application uses.
type: "java:11"

disk: 1024

# The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application.
hooks:
    build: mvn clean package

# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
#
# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
# side is in the form `:`.
#relationships:
#    database: "db:mysql"

# The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    commands:
        start: java -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -jar target/micronaut-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

```

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

Micronaut doesn't require services to deploy, so you don't need a `.platform/services.yaml` file for now.
You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Micronaut to use those services once they're enabled.

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Micronaut app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"

"https://www.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://{default}/"

```

#### Customize Micronaut for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed, it's time to make your Micronaut site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment. There are a number of additional steps that are either required or recommended, depending on how well you want to optimize your site.

###### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

Below is an example of how to install the Config Reader for Java using Maven:

```xml

    sh.platform
    config
    2.2.2

```

and Gradle:

```txt
compile group: 'sh.platform', name: 'config', version: '2.2.2'
```

###### `.environment`

The `.platform.app.yaml` file on the [previous page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/deploy/configure.md#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml) has been pulled directly from the [Micronaut template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/micronaut/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml). It is sufficient to deploy Micronaut on it's own, but since Micronaut makes it possible to overwrite configurations without impacting the application itself, you might elect to rely more heavily on environment variables in it's place.

Consider this simplified `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: "java:11"

disk: 1024

hooks:
  build: mvn clean package

web:
  commands:
    start: java -jar $JAVA_OPTS $CREDENTIAL target/file.jar
```

On Upsun Fixed, we can set the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` by committing a `.environment` file to the repository's root. Upsun Fixed runs `source .environment` in the application root when a project starts, and when logging into the environment over SSH.
That gives you a place to do extra environment variable setup before the application runs, including modifying the system `$PATH` and other shell level customizations.
It allows us to define `JAVA_OPTS` when running on Upsun Fixed, but otherwise not be used during local development testing.

```shell
# .environment
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

To check the Garbage collector settings, please, check the [Java Performance tuning section.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/java/tuning.md)

#### Deploy Micronaut


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

This guide has hopefully helped you deploy a new Micronaut site, or migrate an existing one, to Upsun Fixed. It has made a few assumptions to provide the best information to do so, but is by no means a complete reference for your particular application. For this reason, the Upsun Fixed team maintains and adds to a number of Micronaut guides that can help you add services like Elasticsearch and MongoDB to your application, or how to start using JPA. 

Consult those guides below or in the sidebar for more information.

- [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/elasticsearch.md)
- [JPA](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/jpa.md)
- [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/mongodb.md)

### How to Deploy Micronaut on Upsun Fixed with Elasticsearch

Micronaut provides two ways of accessing Elasticsearch: via the lower level `RestClient` or via the `RestHighLevelClient`. To initialize Elasticsearch in your project's cluster so that it can be accessed by a Micronaut application, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Micronaut project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the Elasticsearch service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include Elasticsearch with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md):

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
elasticsearch:
    type: elasticsearch:8.5
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Add the Elasticsearch relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `searchelastic` to grant the application access to Elasticsearch via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    elasticsearch: "elasticsearch:elasticsearch"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for Elasticsearch, like any service, are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to Elasticsearch into it's own environment variables that can be used by Micronaut. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export ES_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.essearch[0].host')"
export ES_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.essearch[0].port')"
export ELASTICSEARCH_HTTPHOSTS="http://${ES_HOST}:${ES_PORT}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

Environment variable names are following the conversion rules of the [Micronaut Documentation](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.md).

##### 4. Connect to Elasticsearch

Commit that code and push. The Elasticsearch instance is ready to be connected from within the Micronaut application.
### How to Deploy Micronaut on Upsun Fixed with Micronaut Data

[Micronaut Data](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/) is a database access toolkit that uses Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces that are then executed by a thin, lightweight runtime layer.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Micronaut project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add a SQL database service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include a SQL database service. Make sure to visit the documentation for [that service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) to find a valid version. For PostgreSQL that would look like:

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
postgresql:
    type: postgresql:18
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Grant access to the service through a relationship

To access the new service, set a `relationship` in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    postgresql: "postgresql:postgresql"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for services are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to the database into it's own environment variables that can be used by Micronaut. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export JDBC_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].host')"
export JDBC_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].port')"
export DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].path')"
export DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].password')"
export DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_USERNAME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].username')"
export DATASOURCES_DEFAULT_URL="jdbc:postgresql://${JDBC_HOST}:${JDBC_PORT}/${DATABASE}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

Environment variable names are following the conversion rules of the [Micronaut Documentation](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.md).

##### 4. Connect to the service

Commit that code and push. The specified cluster will now always point to the PostgreSQL or any SQL service that you wish.
### How to Deploy Micronaut on Upsun Fixed with MongoDB

To activate MongoDB and then have it accessed by the Micronaut application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a MongoDB service configuration to an existing Micronaut project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the MongoDB service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include MongoDB with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mongodb.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
dbmongo:
  type: mongodb:3.6
  disk: 512
```

##### 2. Grant access to MongoDb through a relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `dbmongo` to grant the application access to MongoDB via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    mongodb: "mongodb:mongodb"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for services are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to the database into it's own environment variables that can be used by Micronaut. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export MONGO_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodb[0].port')"
export MONGO_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodb[0].host')"
export MONGO_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" |base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodb[0].password')"
export MONGO_USER="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodb[0].username')"
export MONGO_DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodb[0].path')"
export MONGO_URL="mongodb://${MONGO_USER}:${MONGO_PASSWORD}@${MONGO_HOST}:${MONGO_PORT}/${MONGO_DATABASE}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

Environment variable names are following the conversion rules of the [Micronaut Documentation](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.md).

##### 4. Connect to the service

Commit that code and push. The application is ready and connected to a MongoDB instance.
### How to Deploy Micronaut on Upsun Fixed with Redis

To activate Redis and then have it accessed by the Micronaut application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Micronaut project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the Redis service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include Persistent Redis with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#persistent-redis):

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
data:
    type: redis-persistent:8.0
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Add the Redis relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `redisdata` to grant the application access to Elasticsearch via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    redisdata: "data:redis"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for Redis, like any service, are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward.

### Deploy Quarkus on Upsun Fixed

[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is, in its own words, a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework for writing Java applications.

To get Quarkus running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Quarkus site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Quarkus site.

    -   Use a ready-made [Quarkus template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/quarkus).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Quarkus template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Quarkus for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Quarkus in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Quarkus requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

Explaining the file line by line, notice the following settings:

 - ``name``: The application name
 - ``type`` Where you’ll define the language, in this case, Java, and the version.
 - ``disk``: The disk space that the application needs in megabytes.
 - ``hooks.build``: The command to package the application
 - ``web.commands``: The order to start the application, where the port is overwritten with ``-Dquarkus.http.port=$PORT``,
using the ``PORT`` environment variable provided by Upsun Fixed to the application container.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
# in the same project.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/configure/

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: app

# The runtime the application uses.
type: "java:11"
disk: 1024

# The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application.
hooks:
    build: ./mvnw package -DskipTests

# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
#
# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
# side is in the form `:`.
#relationships:
#    database: "db:mysql"

# The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    commands:
        start: java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -Dquarkus.http.port=$PORT target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar

```

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

Quarkus doesn't require services to deploy, so you don't need a `.platform/services.yaml` file for now.
You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Quarkus to use those services once they're enabled.

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Quarkus app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}

#### Customize Quarkus for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed, it's time to make your Quarkus site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment. There are a number of additional steps that are either required or recommended, depending on how well you want to optimize your site.

###### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

Below is an example of how to install the Config Reader for Java using Maven:

```xml

    sh.platform
    config
    2.2.2

```

and Gradle:

```txt
compile group: 'sh.platform', name: 'config', version: '2.2.2'
```

###### `.environment`

The `.platform.app.yaml` file on the [previous page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/deploy/configure.md#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml) has been pulled directly from the [Quarkus template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/quarkus/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml). It is sufficient to deploy Quarkus on it's own, but since [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) makes it possible to overwrite configurations without impacting the application itself, you might elect to rely more heavily on environment variables in it's place.

Consider this simplified `.platform.app.yamll` file:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: "java:11"

disk: 1024

hooks:
  build: ./mvnw package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.package.uber-jar=true

web:
  commands:
    start: java -jar $JAVA_OPTS $CREDENTIAL -Dquarkus.http.port=$PORT target/file.jar
```

On Upsun Fixed, we can set the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` by committing a `.environment` file to the repository's root. Upsun Fixed runs `source .environment` in the application root when a project starts, and when logging into the environment over SSH.
That gives you a place to do extra environment variable setup before the application runs, including modifying the system `$PATH` and other shell level customizations.
It allows us to define `JAVA_OPTS` when running on Upsun Fixed, but otherwise not be used during local development testing.

```shell
# .environment
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

To check the Garbage collector settings, please, check the [Java Performance tuning section.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/java/tuning.md)

#### Deploy Quarkus


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

This guide has hopefully helped you deploy a new Quarkus site, or migrate an existing one, to Upsun Fixed. It has made a few assumptions to provide the best information to do so, but is by no means a complete reference for your particular application. For this reason, the Upsun Fixed team maintains and adds to a number of Quarkus guides that can help you add services like Elasticsearch and MongoDB to your application, or how to start using Panache and JPA. 

Consult those guides below or in the sidebar for more information.

- [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/elasticsearch.md)
- [JPA](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/jpa.md)
- [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/mongodb.md)

### How to Deploy Quarkus on Upsun Fixed with Elasticsearch

Quarkus provides two ways of accessing Elasticsearch: via the lower level `RestClient` or via the `RestHighLevelClient`. To initialize Elasticsearch in your project's cluster so that it can be accessed by a Quarkus application, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Quarkus project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the Elasticsearch service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include Elasticsearch with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md):

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
elasticsearch:
    type: elasticsearch:8.5
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Add the Elasticsearch relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `searchelastic` to grant the application access to Elasticsearch via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    elasticsearch: "elasticsearch:elasticsearch"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for Elasticsearch, like any service, are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to Elasticsearch into it's own environment variables that can be used by Quarkus. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export ES_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.essearch[0].host')"
export ES_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.essearch[0].port')"
export QUARKUS_HIBERNATE_SEARCH_ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS="${ES_HOST}:${ES_PORT}"
export QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT="${PORT}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#user-content-default-configsources).

##### 4. Connect to Elasticsearch

Commit that code and push. The Elasticsearch instance is ready to be connected from within the Quarkus application.
### How to Deploy Quarkus on Upsun Fixed with JPA

Hibernate ORM is a standard [JPA](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/) implementation. It offers you the full breadth of an Object Relational Mapper and it works well in Quarkus. To activate JPA and then have it accessed by the Quarkus application already configured for Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Quarkus project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add a SQL database service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include a SQL database service. Make sure to visit the documentation for [that service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) to find a valid version. For PostgreSQL that would look like:

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
postgresql:
    type: postgresql:18
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Grant access to the service through a relationship

To access the new service, set a `relationship` in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    postgresql: "postgresql:postgresql"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for services are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to the database into it's own environment variables that can be used by Quarkus. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].host')"
export DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].path')"
export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].password')"
export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].username')"
export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL="jdbc:postgresql://${HOST}/${DATABASE}"
export QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT="${PORT}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#user-content-default-configsources).

##### 4. Connect to the service

Commit that code and push. The specified cluster will now always point to the PostgreSQL or any SQL service that you wish.
### How to Deploy Quarkus on Upsun Fixed with MongoDB

MongoDB with Panache provides active record style entities (and repositories) like you have in [Hibernate ORM with Panache](https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache). It focuses on helping you write your entities in Quarkus.

To activate MongoDB and then have it accessed by the Quarkus application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a MongoDB service configuration to an existing Quarkus project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the MongoDB service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include MongoDB with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mongodb.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
dbmongo:
  type: mongodb:3.6
  disk: 512
```

##### 2. Grant access to MongoDb through a relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `dbmongo` to grant the application access to MongoDB via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    mongodb: "mongodb:mongodb"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for services are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to the database into it's own environment variables that can be used by Quarkus. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export MONGO_PORT="$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodatabase[0].port')"
export MONGO_HOST="$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodatabase[0].host')"
export QUARKUS_MONGODB_HOSTS="${MONGO_HOST}:${MONGO_PORT}"
export QUARKUS_MONGODB_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodatabase[0].password')"
export QUARKUS_MONGODB_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodatabase[0].username')"
export QUARKUS_MONGODB_DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.mongodatbase[0].path')"
export QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT="${PORT}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#user-content-default-configsources).

##### 4. Connect to the service

Commit that code and push. The application is ready and connected to a MongoDB instance.
### How to Deploy Quarkus on Upsun Fixed with Panache

Hibernate ORM is a JPA implementation and offers you the full breadth of an Object Relational Mapper. It makes complex mappings possible, but they can sometimes be difficult. Hibernate ORM with Panache focuses on helping you write your entities in Quarkus.

To activate Hibernate Panache and then have it accessed by the Quarkus application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Quarkus project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed.

Commit that code and push. The specified cluster will now always point to the PostgreSQL or any SQL service that you wish.
### How to Deploy Quarkus on Upsun Fixed with Redis

To activate Redis and then have it accessed by the Quarkus application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Quarkus project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the Redis service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include Persistent Redis with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#persistent-redis):

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
data:
    type: redis-persistent:8.0
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Add the Redis relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `searchelastic` to grant the application access to Elasticsearch via a relationship:

Commit that code and push. The Redis instance is ready to be connected from within the Quarkus application.

### Configure Spring with MariaDB/MySQL

[MariaDB/MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md) is an open-source relational database technology.
Spring has a robust integration with this technology: [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa).

The first step is to choose the database that you would like to use in your project.
Define the driver for [MariaDB](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mariadb.jdbc/mariadb-java-client)
or [MySQL](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java) and the Java dependencies.
Then determine the DataSource client using the [Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.MariaDB; // Or substitute "MySQL" for "MariaDB"

import javax.sql.DataSource;

@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {

    @Bean(name = "dataSource")
    public DataSource getDataSource() {
        Config config = new Config();
        MariaDB database = config.getCredential("database", MariaDB::new); // Or substitute "MySQL" for "MariaDB"
        return database.get();
    }
}
```
### Configure Spring with PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md) is an open-source relational database technology.
Spring has a robust integration with this technology: [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa).

The first step is to choose the database that you would like to use in your project.
Define the driver for [PostgreSQL](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/postgresql/postgresql) and the Java dependencies.
Then determine the DataSource client using the [Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.PostgreSQL;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {

    @Bean(name = "dataSource")
    public DataSource getDataSource() {
        Config config = new Config();
        PostgreSQL database = config.getCredential("database", PostgreSQL::new);
        return database.get();
    }
}
```
### Configure Spring with RabbitMQ

You can use [Spring JMS](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms/)
to use [RabbitMQ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/rabbitmq.md) with your app.
First, determine the MongoDB client using the [Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.jms.annotation.EnableJms;
import org.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactory;
import org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MappingJackson2MessageConverter;
import org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter;
import org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageType;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.RabbitMQ;

import javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;

@Configuration
@EnableJms
public class JMSConfig {

    private ConnectionFactory getConnectionFactory() {
        Config config = new Config();
        final RabbitMQ rabbitMQ = config.getCredential("rabbitmq", RabbitMQ::new);
        return rabbitMQ.get();
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageConverter getMessageConverter() {
        MappingJackson2MessageConverter converter = new MappingJackson2MessageConverter();
        converter.setTargetType(MessageType.TEXT);
        converter.setTypeIdPropertyName("_type");
        return converter;
    }

    @Bean
    public CachingConnectionFactory getCachingConnectionFactory() {
        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = getConnectionFactory();
        return new CachingConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
    }
}
```
### Configure Spring with Solr

You can use [Spring Data Solr](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/solr/docs/current/reference/html/#solr.repositories)
for [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) with your app.
First, determine the Solr client using the [Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).

```java
import org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.HttpSolrClient;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.solr.core.SolrTemplate;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.Solr;
@Configuration
public class SolrConfig {
    @Bean
    public HttpSolrClient elasticsearchTemplate() {
        Config config = new Config();
        final Solr credential = config.getCredential("solr", Solr::new);
        final HttpSolrClient httpSolrClient = credential.get();
        String url = httpSolrClient.getBaseURL();
        httpSolrClient.setBaseURL(url.substring(0, url.lastIndexOf('/')));
        return httpSolrClient;
    }
    @Bean
    public SolrTemplate solrTemplate(HttpSolrClient client) {
        return new SolrTemplate(client);
    }
}
```
### Deploy Spring on Upsun Fixed

[Spring](https://start.spring.io/) is, in its own words, a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework for writing Java applications.

To get Spring running on Upsun Fixed, you have two potential starting places:

-   You already have a Spring site you are trying to deploy.
    Go through this guide to make the recommended changes to your repository to prepare it for Upsun Fixed.

-   You have no code at this point.

    If you have no code, you have two choices:

    -   Generate a basic Spring site.

    -   Use a ready-made [Spring template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/spring-mvc-maven-mongodb).

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

<!--
To use a template, click the button below to create a Spring template project.

    ![Deploy on Upsun Fixed](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

-->

<!-- Once the template is deployed, you can follow the rest of this guide
to better understand the extra files and changes to the repository. -->

##### Before you begin

You need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Git is the primary tool to manage everything your app needs to run.
  Push commits to deploy changes and control configuration through YAML files.
  These files describe your infrastructure, making it transparent and version-controlled.
- A Upsun Fixed account.
  If you don't already have one, [register for a trial account](https://auth.upsun.com/register).
  You can sign up with an email address or an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.
  If you choose one of these accounts, you can set a password for your Upsun Fixed account later.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  This lets you interact with your project from the command line.
  You can also do most things through the [Web Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

##### Initialize a project

You can start with a basic code base or push a pre-existing project to Upsun Fixed.

     -         Create your first project by running the following command:

        ```bash {}
platform create --title <PROJECT_TITLE>
```

        Then choose the region you want to deploy to, such as the one closest to your site visitors.
        You can also select more resources for your project through additional flags,
        but a Development plan should be enough for you to get started.

        Copy the ID of the project you've created.

     -         Get your code ready locally.

        If your code lives in a remote repository, clone it to your computer.

        If your code isn't in a Git repository, initialize it by running ``git init``.

     -         Connect your Upsun Fixed project with Git.
        You can use Upsun Fixed as your Git repository or connect to a third-party provider:
        GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

That creates an upstream called ``platform`` for your Git repository.
When you choose to use a third-party Git hosting service
the Upsun Fixed Git repository becomes a read-only mirror of the third-party repository.
All your changes take place in the third-party repository.
Add an integration to your existing third party repository.
The process varies a bit for each supported service, so check the specific pages for each one.

 - [BitBucket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/bitbucket.md)
 - [GitHub](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/github.md)
 - [GitLab](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/gitlab.md)

Accept the default options or modify to fit your needs.
All of your existing branches are automatically synchronized to Upsun Fixed.
You get a deploy failure message because you haven’t provided configuration files yet.
You add them in the next step.
If you’re integrating a repository to Upsun Fixed that contains a number of open pull requests,
don’t use the default integration options.
Projects are limited to three* preview environments (active and deployed branches or pull requests)
and you would need to deactivate them individually to test this guide’s migration changes.
Instead, each service integration should be made with the following flag:
```bash {}
platform integration:add --type=<service> ... --build-pull-requests=false

```

You can then go through this guide and activate the environment when you’re ready to deploy
* You can purchase additional preview environments at any time in the Console.
Open your project and select **Edit plan**.
Add additional **Environments**, view a cost estimate, and confirm your changes.

Now you have a local Git repository, a Upsun Fixed project, and a way to push code to that project. Next you can configure your project to work with Upsun Fixed.

      [Configure repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/deploy/configure.md)

#### Configure Spring for Upsun Fixed


You now have a *project* running on Upsun Fixed.
In many ways, a project is just a collection of tools around a Git repository.
Just like a Git repository, a project has branches, called *environments*.
Each environment can then be activated.
*Active* environments are built and deployed,
giving you a fully isolated running site for each active environment.

Once an environment is activated, your app is deployed through a cluster of containers.
You can configure these containers in three ways, each corresponding to a [YAML file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml):

- **Configure apps** in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  This controls the configuration of the container where your app lives.
- **Add services** in a `.platform/services.yaml` file.
  This controls what additional services are created to support your app,
  such as databases or search servers.
  Each environment has its own independent copy of each service.
  If you're not using any services, you don't need this file.
- **Define routes** in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.
  This controls how incoming requests are routed to your app or apps.
  It also controls the built-in HTTP cache.
  If you're only using the single default route, you don't need this file.

Start by creating empty versions of each of these files in your repository:

```bash
# Create empty Upsun Fixed  configuration files
mkdir -p .platform && touch .platform/services.yaml && touch .platform/routes.yaml
```

Now that you've added these files to your project,
configure each one for Spring in the following sections.
Each section covers basic configuration options and presents a complete example
with comments on why Spring requires those values.

###### Configure apps in `.platform.app.yaml`

Your app configuration in a  `.platform.app.yaml` file is allows you to configure nearly any aspect of your app.
For all of the options, see a [complete reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
The following example shows a complete configuration with comments to explain the various settings.

Explaining the file line by line, notice the following settings:

 - ``name``: The application name.
 - ``type`` Where you define the language, in this case, Java, and the version.
 - ``disk``: The disk space that the application needs in megabytes.
 - ``hooks.build``: The command to package the application.
 - ``web.commands``: The order to start the application, where the port is overwritten with ``--server.port=$PORT``,
using the ``PORT`` environment variable provided by Upsun Fixed to the application container.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
# in the same project.
#
# See https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/configure/

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: app

# The runtime the application uses.
type: "java:11"

disk: 1024

# The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application.
hooks:
    build: mvn clean package

# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
#
# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
# side is in the form `:`.
relationships:
    database: "db:mongodb"

# The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    commands:
        start: java -jar $JAVA_OPTS target/spring-mvc-maven-mongodb.jar --server.port=$PORT

```

###### Add services in `.platform/services.yaml`

You can add the managed services you need for you app to run in the  `.platform/services.yaml` file.
You pick the major version of the service and security and minor updates are applied automatically,
so you always get the newest version when you deploy.
You should always try any upgrades on a development branch before pushing to production.

Spring doesn't require services to deploy, so you don't need a `.platform/services.yaml` file for now.
You can [add other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) if desired,
such as [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md).
You need to configure Spring to use those services once they're enabled.

###### Define routes

All HTTP requests sent to your app are controlled through the routing and caching you define in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

The two most important options are the main route and its caching rules.
A route can have a placeholder of `{default}`,
which is replaced by your domain name in production and environment-specific names for your preview environments.
The main route has an `upstream`, which is the name of the app container to forward requests to.

You can enable [HTTP cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
The router includes a basic HTTP cache.
By default, HTTP caches includes all cookies in the cache key.
So any cookies that you have bust the cache.
The `cookies` key allows you to select which cookies should matter for the cache.

You can also set up routes as [HTTP redirects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/redirects.md).
In the following example, all requests to `www.{default}` are redirected to the equivalent URL without `www`.
HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

If you don't include a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, a single default route is used.
This is equivalent to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: <APP_NAME>:http
```

Where `<APP_NAME>` is the `name` you've defined in your [app configuration](#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml).

The following example presents a complete definition of a main route for a Spring app:

```bash  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
# The routes of the project.
#
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going
# to be processed by Upsun Fixed.

"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "app:http"

"https://www.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://{default}/"

```

#### Customize Spring for Upsun Fixed

Now that your code contains all of the configuration to deploy on Upsun Fixed, it's time to make your Spring site itself ready to run on an Upsun Fixed environment. There are a number of additional steps that are either required or recommended, depending on how well you want to optimize your site.

###### Install the Config Reader

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

Below is an example of how to install the Config Reader for Java using Maven:

```xml

    sh.platform
    config
    2.2.2

```

and Gradle:

```txt
compile group: 'sh.platform', name: 'config', version: '2.2.2'
```

###### `.environment`

The `.platform.app.yaml` file in the [previous step](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/deploy/configure.md#configure-apps-in-platformappyaml)
has been pulled directly from the [Spring template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/spring-mvc-maven-mongodb/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml).
It is sufficient to deploy Spring on its own, but since [Spring Config](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.md#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables)
makes it possible to overwrite configurations without impacting the application itself,
you might elect to rely more heavily on environment variables in its place.

Consider this simplified `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: "java:11"
disk: 1024
hooks:
  build: mvn clean package
web:
  commands:
    start: java -jar $JAVA_OPTS target/file.jar --server.port=$PORT
```

On Upsun Fixed, we can set the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` by committing a `.environment` file to the repository's root. Upsun Fixed runs `source .environment` in the application root when a project starts, and when logging into the environment over SSH.
That gives you a place to do extra environment variable setup prior to the application running, including modifying the system `$PATH` and other shell level customizations.
It allows us to define `JAVA_OPTS` when running on Upsun Fixed, but otherwise not be used during local development testing.

```shell
# .environment
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

To check the Garbage collector settings, please, check the [Java Performance tuning section.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/java/tuning.md)

#### Deploy Spring


Now you have your configuration for deployment and your app set up to run on Upsun Fixed.
Make sure all your code is committed to Git
and run `git push` to your Upsun Fixed environment.

Your code is built, producing a read-only image that's deployed to a running cluster of containers.
If you aren't using a source integration, the log of the process is returned in your terminal.
If you're using a source integration, you can get the log by running `platform activity:log --type environment.push`.

When the build finished, you're given the URL of your deployed environment.
Click the URL to see your site.

If your environment wasn't active and so wasn't deployed, activate it by running the following command:

```bash
platform environment:activate
```

###### Migrate your data

If you are moving an existing site to Upsun Fixed, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data.
That means your database and your files.

####### Import the database

First, obtain a database dump from your current site,
such as using the
* [`pg_dump` command for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.md)
* [`mysqldump` command for MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqldump/)
* [`sqlite-dump` command for SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-dump/)

Next, import the database into your Upsun Fixed site by running the following command:

```bash
platform sql < dump.sql
```

That connects to the database service through an SSH tunnel and imports the SQL.

####### Import files

First, download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your host's documentation.

This guide assumes that you have already downloaded 
all of your user files to your local `files/user` directory and your public files to `files/public`
, but adjust accordingly for their actual locations.

Next, upload your files to your mounts
using the `platform mount:upload` command.
Run the following command from your local Git repository root,
modifying the `--source` path if needed.

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/user --source ./files/user
platform mount:upload --mount src/main/resources/files/public --source ./files/public
```

This uses an SSH tunnel and rsync to upload your files as efficiently as possible.
Note that rsync is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

You've now added your files and database to your Upsun Fixed environment.
When you make a new branch environment off of it,
all of your data is fully cloned to that new environment
so you can test with your complete dataset without impacting production.

Go forth and Deploy (even on Friday)!

#### Additional resources

This guide has hopefully helped you deploy a new Spring site, or migrate an existing one, to Upsun Fixed. It has made a few assumptions to provide the best information to do so, but is by no means a complete reference for your particular application. For this reason, the Upsun Fixed team maintains and adds to a number of Spring guides that can help you add services like Elasticsearch and MongoDB to your application, or how to start using Panache and JPA. 

Consult those guides below or in the sidebar for more information.

- [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/elasticsearch.md)
- [JPA](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/jpa.md)
- [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/mongodb.md)

### How to Deploy Spring on Upsun Fixed with Elasticsearch

To activate Elasticsearch and then have it accessed by the Spring application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Spring project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the Elasticsearch service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include Elasticsearch with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md):

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
elasticsearch:
    type: elasticsearch:8.5
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Add the Elasticsearch relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `searchelastic` to grant the application access to Elasticsearch via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    elasticsearch: "elasticsearch:elasticsearch"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for Elasticsearch, like any service, are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to Elasticsearch into it's own environment variables that can be used by Spring. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export ES_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.essearch[0].host')"
export ES_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.essearch[0].port')"
export SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_REST_URIS="http://${ES_HOST}:${ES_PORT}"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

For access to more credentials options, check [Spring common application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.md)
and [binding from environment variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.md#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables).

##### 4. Connect to Elasticsearch

Commit that code and push. The Elasticsearch instance is ready to be connected from within the Spring application.
### How to Deploy Spring on Upsun Fixed with JPA

To activate JPA and then have it accessed by the Spring application already configured for Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Spring project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add a SQL database service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include a SQL database service with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) to find a valid version. For PostgreSQL that would look like:

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
postgresql:
    type: postgresql:18
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Grant access to the service through a relationship

To access the new service, set a `relationship` in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    postgresql: "postgresql:postgresql"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for services are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to the database into it's own environment variables that can be used by Spring. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export DB_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 -d | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].port')"
export HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 -d | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].host')"
export DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 -d | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].path')"
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:mysql://${HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DATABASE}"
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 -d | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].username')"
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 -d | jq -r '.postgresdatabase[0].password')"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

For access to more credentials options, check [Spring common application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.md)
and [binding from environment variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.md#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables).

##### 4. Connect to the service

Commit that code and push.
The specified cluster now always points to the PostgreSQL or any SQL service that you wish.
### How to Deploy Spring on Upsun Fixed with MongoDB

To activate MongoDB and then have it accessed by the Spring application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a MongoDB service configuration to an existing Spring project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed. Please see the [deployment guide](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/deploy.md) for more detailed instructions for setting up app containers and initial projects.

##### 1. Add the MongoDB service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), include MongoDB with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mongodb.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
dbmongo:
  type: mongodb:3.6
  disk: 512
```

##### 2. Grant access to MongoDb through a relationship

In your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), use the service name `dbmongo` to grant the application access to MongoDB via a relationship:

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    mongodb: "mongodb:mongodb"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

Connection credentials for services are exposed to the application container through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable from the deploy hook onward. Since this variable is a base64 encoded JSON object of all of your project's services, you'll likely want a clean way to extract the information specific to the database into it's own environment variables that can be used by Spring. On Upsun Fixed, custom environment variables can be defined programmatically in a `.environment` file using `jq` to do just that:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_USERNAME="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.dbmongo[0].username')"
export SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.dbmongo[0].password')"
export SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.dbmongo[0].host')"
export SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.dbmongo[0].path')"
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

**Tip**: 

For access to more credentials options, check [Spring common application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.md)
and [binding from environment variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.md#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables).

##### 4. Connect to the service

Commit that code and push. The application is ready and connected to a MongoDB instance.

##### Use Spring Data for MongoDB

You can use [Spring Data MongoDB](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb) to use MongoDB with your app.
First, determine the MongoDB client using the [Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).

```java
import com.mongodb.MongoClient;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.config.AbstractMongoConfiguration;
import sh.platform.config.Config;
import sh.platform.config.MongoDB;

@Configuration
public class MongoConfig extends AbstractMongoConfiguration {

    private Config config = new Config();

    @Override
    @Bean
    public MongoClient mongoClient() {
        MongoDB mongoDB = config.getCredential("database", MongoDB::new);
        return mongoDB.get();
    }

    @Override
    protected String getDatabaseName() {
        return config.getCredential("database", MongoDB::new).getDatabase();
    }
}
```
### How to Deploy Spring on Upsun Fixed with Redis

To activate Redis and then have it accessed by the Spring application already in Upsun Fixed, it is necessary to modify two files.

**Note**: 

This guide only covers the addition of a service configuration to an existing Spring project already configured to deploy on Upsun Fixed.

##### 1. Add the Redis service

In your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md),
include persistent Redis with a [valid supported version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#persistent-redis):

      .platform/services.yaml

        ```yaml {}
data:
    type: redis-persistent:8.0
    disk: 256
```

##### 2. Add the Redis relationship

      .platform.app.yaml

        ```yaml {}
relationships:
    redisdata: "data:redis"
```

##### 3. Export connection credentials to the environment

@Configuration
public class RedisConfig {

    @Bean
    JedisConnectionFactory jedisConnectionFactory() {
        Config config = new Config();
        RedisSpring redis = config.getCredential("redis", RedisSpring::new);

        template.setConnectionFactory(jedisConnectionFactory());
        template.setValueSerializer(new GenericToStringSerializer(Object.class));
        return template;
    }

}
```

## Reference
### App reference

To define your app, you can either use one of Upsun Fixed's [single-runtime image](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md)
or its [composable image (BETA)](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

##### Single-runtime image

Upsun Fixed provides and maintains a list of single-runtime images you can use for each of your application containers. 
See [all of the options you can use](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md) to define your app using a single-runtime image.

##### Composable image (BETA)

The Upsun Fixed composable image provides more flexibility than single-runtime images.
When using a composable image, you can define a stack (or group of packages) for your application container to use.

There are over 80,000 packages available from the [Nix Packages collection](https://search.nixos.org/) that you can add to your stack.
You can add as many packages to your application container as you need.

**Note**: 

Upsun Fixed guarantees optimal user experience with the specific [set of packages](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#supported-nix-packages) it supports.
You can use any other package available from the [Nix Packages collection](https://search.nixos.org/),
but NixOs is responsible for their support.

See [all of the options you can use](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md) to define your app using the composable image.
#### Single-runtime image


See all of the options for controlling your apps and how they’re built and deployed on Upsun Fixed.

For single-app projects, the configuration is all done in a `.platform.app.yaml` file,
usually located at the root of your app folder in your Git repository.
[Multi-app projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) can be set up in various ways.

See a [comprehensive example](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md#comprehensive-example) of a configuration in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.

For reference, see a [log of changes to app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/upgrading.md).

###### Top-level properties

The following table presents all properties available at the top level of the YAML for the app.

The column _Set in instance?_ defines whether the given property can be overridden within a `web` or `workers` instance.
To override any part of a property, you have to provide the entire property.

| Name               | Type                                                                     | Required | Set in instance? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

###### Root directory

Some of the properties you can define are relative to your app's root directory.
The root defaults to the location of your `.platform.app.yaml` file.

That is, if a custom value for `source.root` is not provided in your configuration, the default behavior is equivalent to the above.

To specify another directory, for example for a [multi-app project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md),
use the [`source.root` property](#source).

###### Types

**Note**: 

You can now use the Upsun Fixed composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container.
If you’ve reached this section from another page, you may be interested in supported ``stacks`` where ``type`` was referenced.
See [supported Nix packages for the ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#supported-nix-packages) for more information.

The `type` defines the base container image used to run the application.
The version is the major (`X`) and sometimes minor (`X.Y`) version numbers,
depending on the service, as in the following table.
Security and other patches are taken care of for you automatically.

Available languages and their supported versions:

| **Language** | **``runtime``** | **Supported ``version``** |
| [C#/.Net Core](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/dotnet.md) | ``dotnet`` | 7.0, 6.0, 8.0 |
| [Elixir](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/elixir.md) | ``elixir`` | 1.18, 1.15, 1.14 |
| [Go](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/go.md) | ``golang`` | 1.25, 1.24, 1.23, 1.22, 1.21, 1.20 |
| [Java](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/java.md) | ``java`` | 21, 19, 18, 17, 11, 8 |
| [JavaScript/Node.js](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs.md) | ``nodejs`` | 24, 22, 20 |
| [PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md) | ``php`` | 8.5, 8.4, 8.3, 8.2, 8.1 |
| [Python](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/python.md) | ``python`` | 3.13, 3.12, 3.11, 3.10, 3.9, 3.8 |
| [Ruby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/ruby.md) | ``ruby`` | 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 |
| [Rust](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/rust.md) | ``rust`` | 1 |

####### Example configuration

These are used in the format `runtime:version`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'php:8.5'
```

###### Sizes

Resources are distributed across all containers in an environment from the total available from your [plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
So if you have more than just a single app, it doesn't get all of the resources available.
Each environment has its own resources and there are different [sizing rules for preview environments](#sizes-in-preview-environments).

By default, resource sizes (CPU and memory) are chosen automatically for an app
based on the plan size and the number of other containers in the cluster.
Most of the time, this automatic sizing is enough.

You can set sizing suggestions for production environments when you know a given container has specific needs.
Such as a worker that doesn't need much and can free up resources for other apps.
To do so, set `size` to one of the following values:

- `S`
- `M`
- `L`
- `XL`
- `2XL`
- `4XL`

The total resources allocated across all apps and services can't exceed what's in your plan.

####### Container profiles: CPU and memory

By default, Upsun Fixed allocates a container profile to each app and service depending on:

- The range of resources it’s expected to need
- Your [plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md), as resources are distributed across containers.
  Ideally you want to give databases the biggest part of your memory, and apps the biggest part of your CPU.

The container profile and the [size of the container](#sizes) determine
how much CPU and memory (in [MB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#mb)) the container gets.

There are three container profiles available: ``HIGH_CPU``, ``BALANCED``, and ``HIGH_MEMORY``.

######## ``HIGH_CPU`` container profile

| Size |  CPU  | MEMORY   |
| ---- | ----- | -------- |
| S    | 0.40  | 128 MB   |
| M    | 0.40  | 128 MB   |
| L    | 1.20  | 256 MB   |
| XL   | 2.50  | 384 MB   |

####### Sizes in preview environments

Containers in preview environments don't follow the `size` specification.
Application containers are set based on the plan's setting for **Environments application size**.
The default is size **S**, but you can increase it by editing your plan.
(Service containers in preview environments are always set to size **S**.)

###### Relationships

To allow containers in your project to communicate with one another,
you need to define relationships between them.
You can define a relationship between an app and a service, or [between two apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/relationships.md).

The quickest way to define a relationship between your app and a service
is to use the service's default endpoint. 
However, some services allow you to define multiple databases, cores, and/or permissions.
In these cases, you can't rely on default endpoints.
Instead, you can explicitly define multiple endpoints when setting up your relationships.

**Note**: 

App containers don’t have a default endpoint like services.
To connect your app to another app in your project,
you need to explicitly define the ``http`` endpoint as the endpoint to connect both apps. 
For more information, see how to [define relationships between your apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/relationships.md).

**Availability**: 

New syntax (default and explicit endpoints) described below is supported by most, but not all, image types
(``Relationship 'SERVICE_NAME' of application 'myapp' ... targets a service without a valid default endpoint configuration.``).
This syntax is currently being rolled out for all images.
If you encounter this error, use the “legacy” Upsun Fixed configuration noted at the bottom of this section.

To define a relationship between your app and a service:

```yaml {}
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

The ``SERVICE_NAME`` is the name of the service as defined in its [configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
It is used as the relationship name, and associated with a ``null`` value.
This instructs Upsun Fixed to use the service’s default endpoint to connect your app to the service.
For example, if you define the following configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  mariadb:
```

Upsun Fixed looks for a service named ``mariadb`` in your ``.platform/services.yaml`` file,
and connects your app to it through the service’s default endpoint.
For reference, the equivalent configuration using explicit endpoints would be the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  mariadb:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: mysql
```

You can define any number of relationships in this way:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  mariadb:
  redis:
  elasticsearch:
```

**Tip**: 

An even quicker way to define many relationships is to use the following single-line configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships: {<SERVICE_NAME_A>, <SERVICE_NAME_B>, <SERVICE_NAME_C>}
```

where

    .platform/services.yaml

```yaml {}
<SERVICE_NAME_A>:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 256
<SERVICE_NAME_B>:
  type: redis:8.0
  disk: 256
<SERVICE_NAME_C>:
  type: elasticsearch:8.5
  disk: 256
```

Use the following configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>
```

 - ``RELATIONSHIP_NAME`` is the name you want to give to the relationship.
 - ``SERVICE_NAME`` is the name of the service as defined in its [configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
 - ``ENDPOINT_NAME`` is the endpoint your app will use to connect to the service (refer to the service reference to know which value to use).

For example, to define a relationship named ``database`` that connects your app to a service called ``mariadb`` through the ``db1`` endpoint,
use the following configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  database: # The name of the relationship.
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: db1
```

For more information on how to handle multiple databases, multiple cores,
and/or different permissions with services that support such features,
see each service’s dedicated page:

 - [MariaDB/MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#multiple-databases) (multiple databases and permissions)
 - [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md#multiple-databases) (multiple databases and permissions)
 - [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#multiple-databases) (multiple databases)
 - [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md#solr-6-and-later) (multiple cores)
 - [Vault KMS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/vault.md#multiple-endpoints-configuration) (multiple permissions)

You can add as many relationships as you want to your app configuration,
using both default and explicit endpoints according to your needs:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  database1:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: admin
  database2:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: legacy
  cache:
    service: redis
  search:
    service: elasticsearch
```

**Legacy**: 

The following legacy syntax for specifying relationships is still supported by Upsun Fixed:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>: "<SERVICE_NAME>:<ENDPOINT_NAME>"
```

For example:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  database: "mariadb:mysql"
```

Feel free to use this until the default and explicit endpoint syntax is supported on all images.

###### Available disk space

The maximum total space available to all apps and services is set by the storage in your plan settings.
When deploying your project, the sum of all `disk` keys defined in app and service configurations
must be *equal or less* than the plan storage size.

So if your *plan storage size* is 5 GB, you can, for example, assign it in one of the following ways:

- 2 GB to your app, 3 GB to your database
- 1 GB to your app, 4 GB to your database
- 1 GB to your app, 1 GB to your database, 3 GB to your OpenSearch service

If you exceed the total space available, you receive an error on pushing your code.
You need to either increase your plan's storage or decrease the `disk` values you've assigned.

You configure the disk size in [MB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#mb). Your actual available disk space is slightly smaller with some space used for formatting and the filesystem journal. When checking available space, note whether it’s reported in MB or MiB.

####### Downsize a disk

You can decrease the size of an existing disk for an app. If you do so, be aware that:

- Backups from before the downsize are incompatible and can no longer be used. You need to [create new backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md).
- The downsize fails if there’s more data on the disk than the desired size.

###### Mounts

After your app is built, its file system is read-only.
To make changes to your app's code, you need to use Git.

For enhanced flexibility, Upsun Fixed allows you to define and use writable directories called "mounts".
Mounts give you write access to files generated by your app (such as cache and log files)
and uploaded files without going through Git.

When you define a mount, you are mounting an external directory to your app container,
much like you would plug a hard drive into your computer to transfer data.

**Note**: 

 - Mounts aren’t available during the build
 - When you [back up an environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md), the mounts on that environment are backed up too

####### Define a mount

To define a mount, use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '<MOUNT_PATH>':
    source: <MOUNT_TYPE>
    source_path: <SOURCE_PATH_LOCATION>
```

<MOUNT_PATH> is the path to your mount **within the app container** (relative to the app's root).
If you already have a directory with that name, you get a warning that it isn't accessible after the build.
See how to [troubleshoot the warning](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/troubleshoot-mounts.md#overlapping-folders).

| `source`      | `local`, `service`, or `tmp`  | Yes      | Specifies the type of the mount: - `local` mounts are unique to your app. They can be useful to store files that remain local to the app instance, such as application logs.  `local` mounts require disk space. To successfully set up a local mount, set the `disk` key in your app configuration. - `service` mounts point to [Network Storage](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/network-storage.md) services that can be shared between several apps. - `tmp` mounts are local ephemeral mounts, where an external directory is mounted to the `/tmp` directory of your app.  The content of a `tmp` mount **may be removed during infrastructure maintenance operations**. Therefore, `tmp` mounts allow you to **store files that you’re not afraid to lose**, such as your application cache that can be seamlessly rebuilt.  Note that the `/tmp` directory has **a maximum allocation of 8 GB**. |
| `source_path` | `string`                      | No    | Specifies where the mount points **inside the [external directory](#mounts)**. - If you explicitly set a `source_path`, your mount points to a specific subdirectory in the external directory.   - If the `source_path` is an empty string (`""`), your mount points to the entire external directory. - If you don't define a `source_path`, Upsun Fixed uses the <MOUNT_PATH> as default value, without leading or trailing slashes. For example, if your mount lives in the `/web/uploads/` directory in your app container, it will point to a directory named `web/uploads` in the external directory.     **WARNING:** Changing the name of your mount affects the `source_path` when it's undefined. See [how to ensure continuity](#ensure-continuity-when-changing-the-name-of-your-mount) and maintain access to your files.                       |
| `service`     | `string`                      |       | Only for `service` mounts: the name of the [Network Storage service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/network-storage.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The accessibility to the web of a mounted directory depends on the [`web.locations` configuration](#web).
Files can be all public, all private, or with different rules for different paths and file types.

Note that when you remove a `local` mount from your `.platform.app.yaml` file,
the mounted directory isn't deleted.
The files still exist on disk until manually removed
(or until the app container is moved to another host during a maintenance operation in the case of a `tmp` mount).

####### Example configuration

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  'web/uploads':
    source: local
    source_path: uploads
  '/.tmp_platformsh':
    source: tmp
    source_path: files/.tmp_platformsh
  '/build':
    source: local
    source_path: files/build
  '/.cache':
    source: tmp
    source_path: files/.cache
  '/node_modules/.cache':
    source: tmp
    source_path: files/node_modules/.cache
```

For examples of how to set up a `service` mount, see the dedicated [Network Storage page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/network-storage.md).

####### Ensure continuity when changing the name of your mount

Changing the name of your mount affects the default `source_path`.

Say you have a `/my/cache/` mount with an undefined `source_path`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '/my/cache/':
    source: tmp
```

If you rename the mount to `/cache/files/`, it will point to a new, empty `/cache/files/` directory.

To ensure continuity, you need to explicitly define the `source_path` as the previous name of the mount, without leading or trailing slashes:

 ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '/cache/files/':
    source: tmp
    source_path: my/cache
```

The `/cache/files/` mount will point to the original `/my/cache/` directory, maintaining access to all your existing files in that directory.

####### Overlapping mounts

The locations of mounts as they are visible to application containers can overlap somewhat.
For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
applications:
  myapp:
    # ...
    mounts:
      'var/cache_a':
        source: service
        service: ns_service
        source_path: cacheA
      'var/cache_b':
        source: tmp
        source_path: cacheB
      'var/cache_c':
        source: local
        source_path: cacheC
```

In this case, it does not matter that each mount is of a different `source` type.
Each mount is restricted to a subfolder within `var`, and all is well.

The following, however, is not allowed and will result in a failure:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
applications:
  myapp:
    # ...
    mounts:
      'var/':
        source: service
        service: ns_service
        source_path: cacheA
      'var/cache_b':
        source: tmp
        source_path: cacheB
      'var/cache_c':
        source: local
        source_path: cacheC
```

The `service` mount type specifically exists to share data between instances of the same application, whereas `tmp` and `instance` are meant to restrict data to build time and runtime of a single application instance, respectively.
These allowances are not compatible, and will result in an error if pushed.

###### Web

Use the `web` key to configure the web server running in front of your app.
Defaults may vary with a different [image `type`](#types).

| Name        | Type                                       | Required                      | Description                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `commands`  | A [web commands dictionary](#web-commands) | See [note](#required-command) | The command to launch your app.                      |
| `upstream`  | An [upstream dictionary](#upstream)        |                               | How the front server connects to your app.           |
| `locations` | A [locations dictionary](#locations)       |                               | How the app container responds to incoming requests. |

See some [examples of how to configure what's served](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/web.md).

####### Web commands

| Name         | Type     | Required                      | Description                                                                                         |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pre_start`  | `string` |                               | Command run just prior to `start`, which can be useful when you need to run _per-instance_ actions. |
| `start`      | `string` | See [note](#required-command) | The command to launch your app. If it terminates, it's restarted immediately.                       |
| `post_start` | `string` |                               | Command runs **before** adding the container to the router and **after** the `start` command.       |

**Note**: 

The ``pre_start`` feature is **not blocking**, which means the ``deploy`` hook may start running **before** the ``pre_start`` command finishes.
This can lead to unexpected behavior if ``pre_start`` performs setup tasks that ``deploy`` depends on.
To avoid issues, make sure any critical initialization in ``pre_start`` is either quick or safe to run concurrently with ``deploy``.

The ``post_start`` feature is experimental and may change. Please share your feedback in the
Upsun [Discord](https://discord.gg/upsun).

Example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  commands:
    start: 'uwsgi --ini conf/server.ini'
```

This command runs every time your app is restarted, regardless of whether or not new code is deployed.

**Note**: 

Never “background” a start process using ``&``.
That’s interpreted as the command terminating and the supervisor process starts a second copy,
creating an infinite loop until the container crashes.
Just run it as normal and allow the Upsun Fixed supervisor to manage it.

######## Required command

On all containers other than PHP, the value for `start` should be treated as required.

On PHP containers, it's optional and defaults to starting PHP-FPM (`/usr/bin/start-php-app`).
It can also be set explicitly on a PHP container to run a dedicated process,
such as [React PHP](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-reactphp)
or [Amp](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-amphp).
See how to set up [alternate start commands on PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#alternate-start-commands).

| Name            | Type                | Required | Description                                                       | Default                                                                                                |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `socket_family` | `tcp` or `unix`     |          | Whether your app listens on a Unix or TCP socket.                 | Defaults to `tcp` for all [image types](#types) except PHP; for PHP image types the default is `unix`. |
| `protocol`      | `http` or `fastcgi` |          | Whether your app receives incoming requests over HTTP or FastCGI. | Default varies based on [image `type`](#types).                                                        |

For PHP, the defaults are configured for PHP-FPM and shouldn't need adjustment.
For all other containers, the default for `protocol` is `http`.

The following example is the default on non-PHP containers:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: tcp
    protocol: http
```
######## Where to listen

Where to listen depends on your setting for `web.upstream.socket_family` (defaults to `tcp`).

| `socket_family`  | Where to listen                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tcp`            | The port specified by the [`PORT` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)               |
| `unix`           | The Unix socket file specified by the [`SOCKET` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) |

If your application isn't listening at the same place that the runtime is sending requests,
you see `502 Bad Gateway` errors when you try to connect to your website.

####### Locations

Each key in the `locations` dictionary is a path on your site with a leading `/`.
For `example.com`, a `/` matches `example.com/` and `/admin` matches `example.com/admin`.
When multiple keys match an incoming request, the most-specific applies.

The following table presents possible properties for each location:

| Name                | Type                                                 | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Must be an actual directory inside the root directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `passthru`          | `boolean` or  `string`                               | `false`   | Whether to forward disallowed and missing resources from this location to the app. A string is a path with a leading `/` to the controller, such as `/index.php`. <BR> <BR> If your app is in PHP, when setting `passthru` to `true`, you might want to set `scripts` to `false` for enhanced security. This prevents PHP scripts from being executed from the specified location. You might also want to set `allow` to `false` so that not only PHP scripts can't be executed, but their source code also can't be delivered. |
| `index`             | Array of `string`s or `null`                         |           | Files to consider when serving a request for a directory. When set, requires access to the files through the `allow` or `rules` keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `expires`           | `string`                                             | `-1`      | How long static assets are cached. The default means no caching. Setting it to a value enables the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers. Times can be suffixed with `ms` = milliseconds, `s` = seconds, `m` = minutes, `h` = hours, `d` = days, `w` = weeks, `M` = months/30d, or `y` = years/365d. If a `Cache-Control` appears on the `headers` configuration, `expires`, if set, will be ignored. Thus, make sure to set the `Cache-Control`'s `max-age` value when specifying a the header.                                |
| `allow`             | `boolean`                                            | `true`    | Whether to allow serving files which don't match a rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `rules`             | A [rules dictionary](#rules)                         |           | Specific overrides for specific locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

######## Rules

The rules dictionary can override most other keys according to a regular expression.
The key of each item is a regular expression to match paths exactly.
If an incoming request matches the rule, it's handled by the properties under the rule,
overriding any conflicting rules from the rest of the `locations` dictionary.

Under `rules`, you can set all the other possible [`locations` properties](#locations)
except `root`, `index`, `rules` and `request_buffering`.

In the following example, the `allow` key disallows requests for static files anywhere in the site.
This is overridden by a rule that explicitly allows common image file formats.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # Handle dynamic requests
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/index.php'
      # Disallow static files
      allow: false
      rules:
        # Allow common image files only.
        '\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|css|js|map|ico|bmp|eot|woff2?|otf|ttf)$':
          allow: true
```
######## Request buffering

Request buffering is enabled by default to handle chunked requests as most app servers don't support them.
The following table shows the keys in the `request_buffering` dictionary:

| Name               | Type      | Required | Default | Description                               |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`          | `boolean` | Yes      | `true`  | Whether request buffering is enabled.     |
| `max_request_size` | `string`  |          | `250m`  | The maximum size to allow in one request. |

The default configuration would look like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      passthru: true
      request_buffering:
        enabled: true
        max_request_size: 250m
```
###### Workers

Workers are exact copies of the code and compilation output as a `web` instance after a [`build` hook](#hooks).
They use the same container image.

Workers can't accept public requests and so are suitable only for background tasks.
If they exit, they're automatically restarted.

The keys of the `workers` definition are the names of the workers.
You can then define how each worker differs from the `web` instance using
the [top-level properties](#top-level-properties).

Each worker can differ from the `web` instance in all properties _except_ for:

- `build` and `dependencies` properties, which must be the same
- `crons` as cron jobs don't run on workers
- `hooks` as the `build` hook must be the same
  and the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks don't run on workers.

A worker named `queue` that was small and had a different start command could look like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue:
    size: S
  commands:
    start: |
      ./worker.sh
```

For resource allocation, using workers in your project requires a [Medium
 plan or larger](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).

###### Access

The `access` dictionary has one allowed key:

| Name  | Allowed values                      | Default       | Description                                                           |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ssh` | `admin`, `contributor`, or `viewer` | `contributor` | Defines the minimum role required to access app environments via SSH. |

In the following example, only users with `admin` permissions for the given [environment type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#environment-type-roles)
can access the deployed environment via SSH:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
access:
  ssh: admin
```
###### Variables

Upsun Fixed provides a number of ways to set [variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Variables set in your app configuration have the lowest precedence,
meaning they're overridden by any conflicting values provided elsewhere.

All variables set in your app configuration must have a prefix.
Some [prefixes have specific meanings](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-prefixes).

Variables with the prefix `env` are available as a separate environment variable.
All other variables are available in the [`PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

The following example sets two variables:

- A variable named `env:AUTHOR` with the value `Juan` that's available in the environment as `AUTHOR`
- A variable named `d8config:system.site:name` with the value `My site rocks`
  that's available in the `PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    AUTHOR: 'Juan'
  d8config:
    "system.site:name": 'My site rocks'
```

You can also define and access more [complex values](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-complex-values).

Set limits in outbound traffic from your app with no impact on inbound requests.

The `outbound` key is required and contains one or more rules.
The rules define what traffic is allowed; anything unspecified is blocked.

Each rule has the following properties where at least one is required and `ips` and `domains` can't be specified together:

| Name      | Type                | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ips`     | Array of `string`s  | `["0.0.0.0/0"]` | IP addresses in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). See a [CIDR format converter](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr).                                                      |
| `domains` | Array of `string`s  |                 | [Fully qualified domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) to specify specific destinations by hostname.                                                                                 |
| `ports`   | Array of `integer`s |                 | Ports from 1 to 65535 that are allowed. If any ports are specified, all unspecified ports are blocked. If no ports are specified, all ports are allowed. Port `25`, the SMTP port for sending email, is always blocked. |

The default settings would look like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
firewall:
  outbound:
    - ips: ["0.0.0.0/0"]
```

####### Support for rules

Where outbound rules for firewalls are supported in all environments.
For Dedicated Gen 2 projects, contact support for configuration.

####### Multiple rules

Multiple firewall rules can be specified.
In such cases, a given outbound request is allowed if it matches _any_ of the defined rules.

So in the following example requests to any IP on port 80 are allowed
and requests to 1.2.3.4 on either port 80 or 443 are allowed:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
firewall:
  outbound:
    - ips: ["1.2.3.4/32"]
      ports: [443]
    - ports: [80]
```

####### Outbound traffic to CDNs

Be aware that many services are behind a content delivery network (CDN).
For most CDNs, routing is done via domain name, not IP address,
so thousands of domain names may share the same public IP addresses at the CDN.
If you allow the IP address of a CDN, you are usually allowing many or all of the other customers hosted behind that
CDN.

####### Outbound traffic by domain

You can filter outbound traffic by domain.
Using domains in your rules rather than IP addresses is generally more specific and secure.
For example, if you use an IP address for a service with a CDN,
you have to allow the IP address for the CDN.
This means that you allow potentially hundreds or thousands of other servers also using the CDN.

An example rule filtering by domain:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
firewall:
  outbound:
    - protocol: tcp
      domains: ["api.stripe.com", "api.twilio.com"]
      ports: [80, 443]
    - protocol: tcp
      ips: ["1.2.3.4/29","2.3.4.5"]
      ports: [22]
```
######## Determine which domains to allow

To determine which domains to include in your filtering rules,
find the domains your site has requested the DNS to resolve.
Run the following command to parse your server’s `dns.log` file
and display all Fully Qualified Domain Names that have been requested:

```bash
awk '/query\[[^P]\]/ { print $6 | "sort -u" }' /var/log/dns.log
```

The output includes all DNS requests that were made, including those blocked by your filtering rules.
It doesn't include any requests made using an IP address.

Example output:

```bash
facebook.com
fastly.com
upsun.com
www.google.com
www.upsun.com
```

###### Build

The only property of the `build` dictionary is `flavor`, which specifies a default set of build tasks to run.
Flavors are language-specific.

See what the build flavor is for your language:

- [Node.js](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs.md#dependencies)
- [PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#dependencies)

In all languages, you can also specify a flavor of `none` to take no action at all
(which is the default for any language other than PHP and Node.js).

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
build:
  flavor: none
```
###### Dependencies

Installs global dependencies as part of the build process.
They're independent of your app's dependencies
and are available in the `PATH` during the build process and in the runtime environment.
They're installed before the `build` hook runs using a package manager for the language.

| Language | Key name              | Package manager                                                                                                    |
|----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHP      | `php`                 | [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)                                                                               |
| Python 2 | `python` or `python2` | [Pip 2](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)                                               |
| Python 3 | `python3`             | [Pip 3](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)                                               |
| Ruby     | `ruby`                | [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)                                                                                     |
| Node.js  | `nodejs`              | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (see [how to use yarn](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs.md#use-yarn-as-a-package-manager))   |

The format for package names and version constraints are defined by the specific package manager.

An example of dependencies in multiple languages:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
  php: # Specify one Composer package per line.
    drush/drush: '8.0.0'
    composer/composer: '^2'
  python2: # Specify one Python 2 package per line.
    behave: '*'
    requests: '*'
  python3: # Specify one Python 3 package per line.
    numpy: '*'
  ruby: # Specify one Bundler package per line.
    sass: '3.4.7'
  nodejs: # Specify one NPM package per line.
    pm2: '^4.5.0'
```

###### Hooks

There are three different hooks that run as part of the process of building and deploying your app.
These are places where you can run custom scripts.
They are: the `build` hook, the `deploy` hook, and the `post_deploy` hook.
Only the `build` hook is run for [worker instances](#workers), while [web instances](#web) run all three.

The process is ordered as:

1. Variables accessible at build time become available.
1. [Build flavor](#build) runs if applicable.
1. Any [dependencies](#dependencies) are installed.
1. The `build` hook is run.
1. The file system is changed to read only (except for any [mounts](#mounts)).
1. The app container starts. Variables accessible at runtime and services become available.
1. The `deploy` hook is run.
1. The app container begins accepting requests.
1. The `post_deploy` hook is run.

Note that if an environment changes by no code changes, only the last step is run.
If you want the entire process to run, see how
to [manually trigger builds](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#manually-trigger-builds).

####### Writable directories during build

During the `build` hook, there are three writeable directories:

- `PLATFORM_APP_DIR`:
  Where your code is checked out and the working directory when the `build` hook starts.
  Becomes the app that gets deployed.
- `PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR`:
  Persists between builds, but isn't deployed.
  Shared by all builds on all branches.
- `/tmp`:
  Isn't deployed and is wiped between each build.
  Note that `PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR` is mapped to `/tmp`
  and together they offer about 8GB of free space.

####### Hook failure

Each hook is executed as a single script, so they're considered to have failed only if the final command in them fails.
To cause them to fail on the first failed command, add `set -e` to the beginning of the hook.

If a `build` hook fails for any reason, the build is aborted and the deploy doesn't happen.
Note that this only works for `build` hooks --
if other hooks fail, the app is still deployed.

######## Automated testing

It’s preferable that you set up and run automated tests in a dedicated CI/CD tool.
Relying on Upsun Fixed hooks for such tasks can prove difficult.

During the `build` hook, you can halt the deployment on a test failure but the following limitations apply:

- Access to services such as databases, Redis, Vault KMS, and even writable mounts is disabled.
  So any testing that relies on it is sure to fail.
- If you haven’t made changes to your app, an existing build image is reused and the build hook isn’t run.
- Test results are written into your app container, so they might get exposed to a third party.

During the `deploy` hook, you can access services but **you can’t halt the deployment based on a test failure**.
Note that there are other downsides:

- Your app container is read-only during the deploy hook,
  so if your tests need to write reports and other information, you need to create a file mount for them.
- Your app can only be deployed once the deploy hook has been completed.
  Therefore, running automated testing via the deploy hook generates slower deployments.
- Your environment isn’t available externally during the deploy hook.
  Unit and integration testing might work without the environment being available,
  but you can’t typically perform end-to-end testing until after the environment is up and available.

###### Crons

The keys of the `crons` definition are the names of the cron jobs.
The names must be unique.

If an application defines both a `web` instance and `worker` instances, cron jobs run only on the `web` instance.

See how to [get cron logs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#container-logs).

The following table shows the properties for each job:

| Name               | Type                                         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

To prevent competition for resources that might hurt performance on **Grid** projects use `H` in definitions to indicate an unspecified but invariant time. For example, instead of using `0 * * * *` to indicate the cron job runs at the start of every hour, you can use `H * * * *` to indicate it runs every hour, but not necessarily at the start. This prevents multiple cron jobs from trying to start at the same time. **The `H` syntax isn't available on Dedicated Gen 2 projects.** |
| `commands`         | A [cron commands dictionary](#cron-commands) | Yes      | A definition of what commands to run when starting and stopping the cron job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Note that you can [cancel pending or running crons](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/cancel-activity.md).

**Note**: 

The use of the ``cmd`` key is now deprecated in favor of the ``commands``key. 
Make sure you set your new cron jobs using the ``commands`` key,
and update your existing cron jobs to ensure continuity.

####### Cron commands

| Name    | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start` | `string` | Yes      | The command that's run. It's run in [Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `stop`  | `string` | No       | The command that's issued to give the cron command a chance to shutdown gracefully, such as to finish an active item in a list of tasks. Issued when a cron task is interrupted by a user through the CLI or Console. If not specified, a `SIGTERM` signal is sent to the process. |

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  mycommand:
    spec: 'H * * * *'
    commands:
      start: sleep 60 && echo sleep-60-finished && date
      stop: killall sleep
    shutdown_timeout: 18
```
In this example configuration, the [cron specification](#crons) uses the `H` syntax.

Note that this syntax is only supported on Grid projects.
On Dedicated Gen 2 projects, use the [standard cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression).

####### Example cron jobs

```yaml {}
type: 'php:8.5'
crons:
  # Run Drupal's cron tasks every 19 minutes.
  drupal:
    spec: '*/19 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'cd web ; drush core-cron'
  # But also run pending queue tasks every 7 minutes.
  # Use an odd number to avoid running at the same time as the `drupal` cron.
  drush-queue:
    spec: '*/7 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'cd web ; drush queue-run aggregator_feeds'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'ruby:3.4'
crons:
  # Execute a rake script every 19 minutes.
  ruby:
    spec: '*/19 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'bundle exec rake some:task'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'php:8.5'
crons:
  # Run Laravel's scheduler every 5 minutes.
  scheduler:
    spec: '*/5 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'php artisan schedule:run'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'php:8.5'
crons:
  # Take a backup of the environment every day at 5:00 AM.
  snapshot:
    spec: 0 5 * * *
    commands:
      start: |
        # Only run for the production environment, aka main branch
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = "production" ]; then
            croncape symfony ...
        fi        
```

####### Conditional crons

If you want to set up customized cron schedules depending on the environment type,
define conditional crons.
To do so, use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  update:
    spec: '0 0 * * *'
    commands:
      start: |
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
          platform backup:create --yes --no-wait
          platform source-operation:run update --no-wait --yes
        fi
```
####### Cron job timing

Minimum time between cron jobs being triggered:

| Plan                | Time      |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Professional        | 5 minutes |
| Elite or Enterprise | 1 minute  |

For each app container, only one cron job can run at a time.
If a new job is triggered while another is running, the new job is paused until the other completes.

To minimize conflicts, a random offset is applied to all triggers.
The offset is a random number of seconds up to 20 minutes or the cron frequency, whichever is smaller.

Crons are also paused while activities such as [backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md) are running.
The crons are queued to run after the other activity finishes.

To run cron jobs in a timezone other than UTC, set the [timezone property](#top-level-properties).

####### Paused crons

[Preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#preview-environment) are often used for a limited time and then abandoned.
While it's useful for environments under active development to have scheduled tasks,
unused environments don't need to run cron jobs.
To minimize unnecessary resource use,
crons on environments with no deployments are paused.

This affects all environments that aren't live environments.
This means all environments on Development plans
and all preview environments on higher plans.

Such environments with deployments within 14 days have crons with the status `running`.
If there haven't been any deployments within 14 days, the status is `paused`.

You can see the status in the Console
or using the CLI by running `platform environment:info` and looking under `deployment_state`.

######## Restarting paused crons

If the crons on your preview environment are paused but you're still using them,
you can push changes to the environment or redeploy it.

To restart crons without changing anything:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform redeploy
```

###### Runtime

The following table presents the various possible modifications to your PHP runtime:

You can also set your [app's runtime timezone](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/timezone.md).

####### Extensions

**Note**: 

You can now use the Upsun Fixed composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container.
If you’ve reached this section from another page and are using the composable image, enabling/disabling extensions should be placed under the ``stack`` key instead of what is listed below.
See [how to configure extensions with the composable image](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#top-level-properties).

You can enable [PHP extensions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) just with a list of extensions:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
  extensions:
    - geoip
    - tidy
```

Alternatively, if you need to include configuration options, use a dictionary for that extension:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
  extensions:
    - geoip
    - name: blackfire
      configuration:
        server_id: foo
        server_token: bar
```

In this case, the `name` property is required.

####### Sizing hints

The following table shows the properties that can be set in `sizing_hints`:

| Name              | Type      | Default | Minimum | Description                                    |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `request_memory`  | `integer` | 45      | 10      | The average memory consumed per request in MB. |
| `reserved_memory` | `integer` | 70      | 70      | The amount of memory reserved in MB.           |

See more about [PHP-FPM workers and sizing](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/fpm.md).

###### Source

The following table shows the properties that can be set in `source`:

| Name         | Type                     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `operations` | An operations dictionary |          | Operations that can be applied to the source code. See [source operations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md)                                                                |
| `root`       | `string`                 |          | The path where the app code lives. Defaults to the directory of the `.platform.app.yaml` file. Useful for [multi-app setups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md). |

###### Additional hosts

If you're using a private network with specific IP addresses you need to connect to,
you might want to map those addresses to hostnames to better remember and organize them.
In such cases, you can add a map of those IP addresses to whatever hostnames you like.
Then when your app tries to access the hostname, it's sent to the proper IP address.

So in the following example, if your app tries to access `api.example.com`, it's sent to `192.0.2.23`.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
additional_hosts:
  api.example.com: "192.0.2.23"
  web.example.com: "203.0.113.42"
```

This is equivalent to adding the mapping to the `/etc/hosts` file for the container.
#### Composable image

The Upsun Fixed composable image provides enhanced flexibility when defining your app.
It allows you to install several runtimes and tools in your application container,
in a **"one image to rule them all"** approach.

The composable image is built on [Nix](https://nix.dev), which offers the following benefits:

- You can add as many packages to your application container as you need,
  choosing from over 120,000 packages from [the Nixpkgs collection](https://search.nixos.org/packages).
- The packages you add are built in total isolation, so you can install different versions of the same package.
- With [Nix](https://nix.dev/reference/glossary#term-Nix), there are no undeclared dependencies in your source code.
  What works on your local machine is guaranteed to work on any other machine.

This page introduces all the settings available to configure your composable image from your `.platform.app.yaml` file
(usually located at the root of your Git repository). 
Note that multi-app projects can be [set in various ways](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md).

If you're pressed for time, jump to this comprehensive [configuration example](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md#comprehensive-example).

###### Top-level properties

The following table presents all the properties you can use at the top level of your app's YAML configuration file.

The column _Set in instance?_ defines whether the given property can be overridden within a `web` or `workers` instance.
To override any part of a property, you have to provide the entire property.

**Note**: 

The ``build``, ``dependencies``, and ``runtime`` keys are only supported when using a [single-runtime image](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).
They are **not** supported when using the composable image.
They are replaced by the ``stack`` key.

###### Stack

Use the ``stack`` key to define which runtimes and binaries you want to install in your application container.
Define them as a YAML array as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  stack: [ "@" ]
  # OR
  stack:
    - "@"
```

To add a language to your stack, use the `@` format. 
To add a tool to your stack, use the `` format, as no version is needed.

**Warning**: 

While technically available during the build phase, ``nix`` commands aren’t supported at runtime as the image becomes read-only.

When using the Upsun Fixed composable image, you don’t need ``nix`` commands.
Everything you install using the ``stack`` key is readily available to you as the binaries are linked and included in ``$PATH``.
For instance, to [start a secondary runtime](#primary-runtime),
just issue the command (e.g. in the [start](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#web-commands)) instead of the ``nix run`` command.

######## Primary runtime

If you add multiple runtimes to your application container,
the first declared runtime becomes the primary runtime.
The primary runtime is the one that is automatically started.

To start other declared runtimes, you need to start them manually, using [web commands](#web-commands).
To find out which start command to use, go to the [Languages](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages.md) section,
and visit the documentation page dedicated to your runtime.

**Note**: 

If you use PHP, note that PHP-FPM is only started automatically if PHP is defined as the primary runtime.

####### Supported Nix channels

A Nix channel represents a curated, tested snapshot of the Nixpkgs repository, which contains a collection of Nix expressions (code for building packages and configuring systems).

Using the latest stable Nix channel ensures that you get stable, verified packages (not all `git` commits are heavily tested before being merged into the `master` branch).

The following channels are supported:

   - [25.05](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-25.05)

####### Deprecated Nix channels

The following channels are available but no longer supported.
They're available, but they no longer receive security updates from the Nix community and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future – consider migrating to a [supported Nix channel](#supported-nix-channels).

   - [24.05](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/release-notes#sec-release-24.05)

####### Configure Nix channels

The Nix channel can be configured with the [top-level property `type`](#top-level-properties).

For example, to use the Nix channel `25.05`, you would use the following syntax:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
type: "composable:25.05"
```

####### Supported Nix packages

**Note**: 

The Nix packages listed in the following table are officially supported by Upsun Fixed to provide optimal user experience. 
However, you can add any other packages from [the Nixpkgs collection](https://search.nixos.org/) to your ``stack``. 
While available for you to install, packages that aren’t listed in the following table are supported by Nix itself, not Upsun Fixed.

Depending on the Nix package, you can select only the major runtime version,

**Example:**

You want to add PHP version 8.5 and ``facedetect`` to your application container.
To do so, use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  stack: [ "php@8.5", "facedetect" ]
  # OR
  stack:
    - "php@8.5"
    - "facedetect"
```

####### PHP extensions and Python packages

When you add PHP or Python to your application container,
you can define which extensions (for PHP) or packages (for Python) you also want to add to your stack.

To find out which extensions you can install with your runtime,
follow these steps:

1. Go to the [NixOS search](https://search.nixos.org/).
2. Enter a runtime and click **Search**.
3. In the **Package sets** side bar, select the right set of extensions/packages for your runtime version. 
   You can choose the desired extensions/packages from the filtered results.

![Screenshot of the Nix package sets selection for PHP@8.3](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/nixos/nixos-packages.png "0.5")

######## Install PHP extensions

To enable [PHP extensions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md),
specify a list of `extensions` below the language definition. 
To disable [PHP extensions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md),
specify a list of `disabled_extensions` below the language definition. 
For instance:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  source:
    root: "/"
  stack:
    - "php@8.5":
        extensions:
          - apcu
          - sodium
          - xsl
          - pdo_sqlite
        disabled_extensions:
          - gd
```

**Note**: 

To help you find out the name of the PHP package you want to use,
some maintainers provide a ``PHP upstream extension`` value in the [NixOS search engine](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=php82Extensions.gd).

      ![Screenshot of an upstream extension value shown in the NixOS search](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/nixos/nixossearch-upstream-value.png)

If this information is not provided, note that PHP package names on NixOS always respect the ``<PHP><VERSION>Extensions.<EXTENSION-NAME>`` format. 
Therefore, you can copy the ``<EXTENSION-NAME>`` as shown in the NixOS search results, and use it in your configuration.

Note that you can use environment variables or your `php.ini` file to [include further configuration options](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#customize-php-settings) for your PHP extensions.

######## Install Python packages

To install Python packages, add them to your stack as new packages.
To do so, use the full name of the package.

For instance, to install [``python313Packages.yq``](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=python313Packages.yq),
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  stack:
    - "python@3.13"
    - "python313Packages.yq" # python package specific
```

Alternatively, if you need to include configuration options for your extensions, use either your ``php.ini`` file or [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md).

####### Example configuration

Here is a full composable image configuration example. Note the use of the `@` format.

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  stack:
    - "php@8.5":
        extensions:
          - apcu
          - sodium
          - xsl
          - pdo_sqlite
    - "python@3.13"
    - "python313Packages.yq" # python package specific
    - "yq"                   # tool
```

####### Combine single-runtime and composable images

In a [multiple application context](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md),
you can use a mix of [single-runtime images](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md)
and [composable images](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).
Here is an example configuration including a ``frontend`` app and a ``backend`` app:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
backend:
    stack:
      - "php@8.5":
          extensions:
            - apcu
            - sodium
            - xsl
            - pdo_sqlite
      - "python@3.13"
      - "python313Packages.yq" # python package specific
frontend:
    type: 'nodejs:24
```

**Note**: 

If you add multiple runtimes to your application container,
the first declared runtime becomes the primary runtime.
The primary runtime is the one that is automatically started.

To start other declared runtimes, you need to start them manually, using [web commands](#web-commands).
To find out which start command to use, go to the [Languages](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages.md) section,
and visit the documentation page dedicated to your language.
If you use PHP, note that PHP-FPM is only started automatically if PHP is defined as the primary runtime.

###### Sizes

Resources are distributed across all containers in an environment from the total available from your [plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
So if you have more than just a single app, it doesn't get all of the resources available.
Each environment has its own resources and there are different [sizing rules for preview environments](#sizes-in-preview-environments).

By default, resource sizes (CPU and memory) are chosen automatically for an app
based on the plan size and the number of other containers in the cluster.
Most of the time, this automatic sizing is enough.

You can set sizing suggestions for production environments when you know a given container has specific needs.
Such as a worker that doesn't need much and can free up resources for other apps.
To do so, set `size` to one of the following values:

- `S`
- `M`
- `L`
- `XL`
- `2XL`
- `4XL`

The total resources allocated across all apps and services can't exceed what's in your plan.

####### Container profiles: CPU and memory

By default, Upsun Fixed allocates a container profile to each app and service depending on:

- The range of resources it’s expected to need
- Your [plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md), as resources are distributed across containers.
  Ideally you want to give databases the biggest part of your memory, and apps the biggest part of your CPU.

The container profile and the [size of the container](#sizes) determine
how much CPU and memory (in [MB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#mb)) the container gets.

There are three container profiles available: ``HIGH_CPU``, ``BALANCED``, and ``HIGH_MEMORY``.

######## ``HIGH_CPU`` container profile

| Size | CPU   | MEMORY  |
|------|-------|---------|
| S    | 0.40  | 128 MB  |
| M    | 0.40  | 128 MB  |
| L    | 1.20  | 256 MB  |
| XL   | 2.50  | 384 MB  |
| 2XL  | 5.00  | 768 MB  |
| 4XL  | 10.00 | 1536 MB |

######## `BALANCED` container profile

| Size | CPU  | MEMORY  |
|------|------|---------|
| S    | 0.05 | 32 MB   |
| M    | 0.05 | 64 MB   |
| L    | 0.08 | 256 MB  |
| XL   | 0.10 | 512 MB  |
| 2XL  | 0.20 | 1024 MB |
| 4XL  | 0.40 | 2048 MB |

######## `HIGH_MEMORY` container profile

| Size | CPU  | MEMORY   |
|------|------|----------|
| S    | 0.25 | 128 MB   |
| M    | 0.25 | 288 MB   |
| L    | 0.40 | 1280 MB  |
| XL   | 0.75 | 2624 MB  |
| 2XL  | 1.50 | 5248 MB  |
| 4XL  | 3.00 | 10496 MB |

######## Container profile reference

The following table shows which container profiles Upsun Fixed applies when deploying your project.

####### Sizes in preview environments

Containers in preview environments don't follow the `size` specification.
Application containers are set based on the plan's setting for **Environments application size**.
The default is size **S**, but you can increase it by editing your plan.
(Service containers in preview environments are always set to size **S**.)

###### Relationships

To allow containers in your project to communicate with one another,
you need to define relationships between them.
You can define a relationship between an app and a service, or [between two apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/relationships.md).

The quickest way to define a relationship between your app and a service
is to use the service's default endpoint. 
However, some services allow you to define multiple databases, cores, and/or permissions.
In these cases, you can't rely on default endpoints.
Instead, you can explicitly define multiple endpoints when setting up your relationships.

**Note**: 

App containers don’t have a default endpoint like services.
To connect your app to another app in your project,
you need to explicitly define the ``http`` endpoint as the endpoint to connect both apps. 
For more information, see how to [define relationships between your apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/relationships.md).

**Availability**: 

New syntax (default and explicit endpoints) described below is supported by most, but not all, image types
(``Relationship 'SERVICE_NAME' of application 'myapp' ... targets a service without a valid default endpoint configuration.``).
This syntax is currently being rolled out for all images.
If you encounter this error, use the “legacy” Upsun Fixed configuration noted at the bottom of this section.

To define a relationship between your app and a service:

```yaml {}
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

The ``SERVICE_NAME`` is the name of the service as defined in its [configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
It is used as the relationship name, and associated with a ``null`` value.
This instructs Upsun Fixed to use the service’s default endpoint to connect your app to the service.
For example, if you define the following configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  mariadb:
```

Upsun Fixed looks for a service named ``mariadb`` in your ``.platform/services.yaml`` file,
and connects your app to it through the service’s default endpoint.
For reference, the equivalent configuration using explicit endpoints would be the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  mariadb:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: mysql
```

You can define any number of relationships in this way:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  mariadb:
  redis:
  elasticsearch:
```

**Tip**: 

An even quicker way to define many relationships is to use the following single-line configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships: {<SERVICE_NAME_A>, <SERVICE_NAME_B>, <SERVICE_NAME_C>}
```

where

    .platform/services.yaml

```yaml {}
<SERVICE_NAME_A>:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 256
<SERVICE_NAME_B>:
  type: redis:8.0
  disk: 256
<SERVICE_NAME_C>:
  type: elasticsearch:8.5
  disk: 256
```

Use the following configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>
```

 - ``RELATIONSHIP_NAME`` is the name you want to give to the relationship.
 - ``SERVICE_NAME`` is the name of the service as defined in its [configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
 - ``ENDPOINT_NAME`` is the endpoint your app will use to connect to the service (refer to the service reference to know which value to use).

For example, to define a relationship named ``database`` that connects your app to a service called ``mariadb`` through the ``db1`` endpoint,
use the following configuration:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  database: # The name of the relationship.
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: db1
```

For more information on how to handle multiple databases, multiple cores,
and/or different permissions with services that support such features,
see each service’s dedicated page:

 - [MariaDB/MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#multiple-databases) (multiple databases and permissions)
 - [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md#multiple-databases) (multiple databases and permissions)
 - [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md#multiple-databases) (multiple databases)
 - [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md#solr-6-and-later) (multiple cores)
 - [Vault KMS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/vault.md#multiple-endpoints-configuration) (multiple permissions)

You can add as many relationships as you want to your app configuration,
using both default and explicit endpoints according to your needs:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  database1:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: admin
  database2:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: legacy
  cache:
    service: redis
  search:
    service: elasticsearch
```

**Legacy**: 

The following legacy syntax for specifying relationships is still supported by Upsun Fixed:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>: "<SERVICE_NAME>:<ENDPOINT_NAME>"
```

For example:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  database: "mariadb:mysql"
```

Feel free to use this until the default and explicit endpoint syntax is supported on all images.

###### Available disk space

The maximum total space available to all apps and services is set by the storage in your plan settings.
When deploying your project, the sum of all `disk` keys defined in app and service configurations
must be *equal or less* than the plan storage size.

So if your *plan storage size* is 5 GB, you can, for example, assign it in one of the following ways:

- 2 GB to your app, 3 GB to your database
- 1 GB to your app, 4 GB to your database
- 1 GB to your app, 1 GB to your database, 3 GB to your OpenSearch service

If you exceed the total space available, you receive an error on pushing your code.
You need to either increase your plan's storage or decrease the `disk` values you've assigned.

You configure the disk size in [MB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#mb). Your actual available disk space is slightly smaller with some space used for formatting and the filesystem journal. When checking available space, note whether it’s reported in MB or MiB.

####### Downsize a disk

You can decrease the size of an existing disk for an app. If you do so, be aware that:

- The downsize fails if there's more data on the disk than the desired size.
- Backups from before the downsize can still be restored.

###### Mounts

After your app is built, its file system is read-only.
To make changes to your app's code, you need to use Git.

For enhanced flexibility, Upsun Fixed allows you to define and use writable directories called "mounts".
Mounts give you write access to files generated by your app (such as cache and log files)
and uploaded files without going through Git.

When you define a mount, you are mounting an external directory to your app container,
much like you would plug a hard drive into your computer to transfer data.

**Note**: 

 - Mounts aren’t available during the build
 - When you [back up an environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md), the mounts on that environment are backed up too

####### Define a mount

To define a mount, use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '<MOUNT_PATH>':
    source: <MOUNT_TYPE>
    source_path: <SOURCE_PATH_LOCATION>
```

<MOUNT_PATH> is the path to your mount **within the app container** (relative to the app's root).
If you already have a directory with that name, you get a warning that it isn't accessible after the build.
See how to [troubleshoot the warning](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/troubleshoot-mounts.md#overlapping-folders).

| `source`      | `local`, `service`, or `tmp` | Yes      | Specifies the type of the mount: - `local` mounts are unique to your app. They can be useful to store files that remain local to the app instance, such as application logs.  `local` mounts require disk space. To successfully set up a local mount, set the `disk` key in your app configuration. - `service` mounts point to [Network Storage](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/network-storage.md) services that can be shared between several apps. - `tmp` mounts are local ephemeral mounts, where an external directory is mounted to the `/tmp` directory of your app.  The content of a `tmp` mount **may be removed during infrastructure maintenance operations**. Therefore, `tmp` mounts allow you to **store files that you’re not afraid to lose**, such as your application cache that can be seamlessly rebuilt.  Note that the `/tmp` directory has **a maximum allocation of 8 GB**. |
| `source_path` | `string`                     | No       | Specifies where the mount points **inside the [external directory](#mounts)**. - If you explicitly set a `source_path`, your mount points to a specific subdirectory in the external directory.   - If the `source_path` is an empty string (`""`), your mount points to the entire external directory. - If you don't define a `source_path`, Upsun Fixed uses the <MOUNT_PATH> as default value, without leading or trailing slashes. For example, if your mount lives in the `/web/uploads/` directory in your app container, it will point to a directory named `web/uploads` in the external directory.     **WARNING:** Changing the name of your mount affects the `source_path` when it's undefined.

The accessibility to the web of a mounted directory depends on the [`web.locations` configuration](#web).
Files can be all public, all private, or with different rules for different paths and file types.

Note that when you remove a `local` mount from your `.platform.app.yaml` file,
the mounted directory isn't deleted.
The files still exist on disk until manually removed
(or until the app container is moved to another host during a maintenance operation in the case of a `tmp` mount).

####### Example configuration

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  'web/uploads':
    source: local
    source_path: uploads
  '/.tmp_platformsh':
    source: tmp
    source_path: files/.tmp_platformsh
  '/build':
    source: local
    source_path: files/build
  '/.cache':
    source: tmp
    source_path: files/.cache
  '/node_modules/.cache':
    source: tmp
    source_path: files/node_modules/.cache
```

For examples of how to set up a `service` mount, see the dedicated [Network Storage page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/network-storage.md).

####### Ensure continuity when changing the name of your mount

Changing the name of your mount affects the default `source_path`.

Say you have a `/my/cache/` mount with an undefined `source_path`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '/my/cache/':
    source: tmp
```

If you rename the mount to `/cache/files/`, it will point to a new, empty `/cache/files/` directory.

To ensure continuity, you need to explicitly define the `source_path` as the previous name of the mount, without leading or trailing slashes:

 ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '/cache/files/':
    source: tmp
    source_path: my/cache
```

The `/cache/files/` mount will point to the original `/my/cache/` directory, maintaining access to all your existing files in that directory.

####### Overlapping mounts

The locations of mounts as they are visible to application containers can overlap somewhat.
For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
applications:
  myapp:
    # ...
    mounts:
      'var/cache_a':
        source: service
        service: ns_service
        source_path: cacheA
      'var/cache_b':
        source: tmp
        source_path: cacheB
      'var/cache_c':
        source: local
        source_path: cacheC
```

In this case, it does not matter that each mount is of a different `source` type.
Each mount is restricted to a subfolder within `var`, and all is well.

The following, however, is not allowed and will result in a failure:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
applications:
  myapp:
    # ...
    mounts:
      'var/':
        source: service
        service: ns_service
        source_path: cacheA
      'var/cache_b':
        source: tmp
        source_path: cacheB
      'var/cache_c':
        source: local
        source_path: cacheC
```

The `service` mount type specifically exists to share data between instances of the same application, whereas `tmp` and `instance` are meant to restrict data to build time and runtime of a single application instance, respectively.
These allowances are not compatible, and will result in an error if pushed.

###### Web

Use the `web` key to configure the web server running in front of your app.

| Name        | Type                                       | Required                      | Description                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `commands`  | A [web commands dictionary](#web-commands) | See [note](#required-command) | The command to launch your app.                      |
| `upstream`  | An [upstream dictionary](#upstream)        |                               | How the front server connects to your app.           |
| `locations` | A [locations dictionary](#locations)       |                               | How the app container responds to incoming requests. |

See some [examples of how to configure what's served](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/web.md).

####### Web commands

| Name         | Type     | Required                      | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pre_start`  | `string` |                               | Command runs just prior to `start`, which can be useful when you need to run _per-instance_ actions. |
| `start`      | `string` | See [note](#required-command) | The command to launch your app. If it terminates, it's restarted immediately.                        |
| `post_start` | `string` |                               | Command runs **before** adding the container to the router and **after** the `start` command.        |

**Note**: 

The ``pre_start`` feature is **not blocking**, which means the ``deploy`` hook may start running **before** the ``pre_start`` command finishes.
This can lead to unexpected behavior if ``pre_start`` performs setup tasks that ``deploy`` depends on.
To avoid issues, make sure any critical initialization in ``pre_start`` is either quick or safe to run concurrently with ``deploy``.

The ``post_start`` feature is experimental and may change. Please share your feedback in the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/upsun).

Example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  commands:
    start: 'uwsgi --ini conf/server.ini'
```

This command runs every time your app is restarted, regardless of whether or not new code is deployed.

**Note**: 

Never “background” a start process using ``&``.
That’s interpreted as the command terminating and the supervisor process starts a second copy,
creating an infinite loop until the container crashes.
Just run it as normal and allow the Upsun Fixed supervisor to manage it.

######## Required command

On all containers other than PHP, the value for `start` should be treated as required.

On PHP containers, it's optional and defaults to starting PHP-FPM (`/usr/bin/start-php-app`).
It can also be set explicitly on a PHP container to run a dedicated process,
such as [React PHP](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-reactphp)
or [Amp](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-amphp).
See how to set up [alternate start commands on PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#alternate-start-commands).

####### Upstream

| Name            | Type                | Required | Description                                                       | Default                                                                                                   |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `socket_family` | `tcp` or `unix`     |          | Whether your app listens on a Unix or TCP socket.                 | Defaults to `tcp` for all [primary runtimes](#primary-runtime) except PHP; for PHP the default is `unix`. |
| `protocol`      | `http` or `fastcgi` |          | Whether your app receives incoming requests over HTTP or FastCGI. | Default varies based on the [primary runtimes](#primary-runtime).                                         |

For PHP, the defaults are configured for PHP-FPM and shouldn't need adjustment.
For all other containers, the default for `protocol` is `http`.

The following example is the default on non-PHP containers:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: tcp
    protocol: http
```

######## Where to listen

Where to listen depends on your setting for `web.upstream.socket_family` (defaults to `tcp`).

| `socket_family` | Where to listen                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tcp`           | The port specified by the [`PORT` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)               |
| `unix`          | The Unix socket file specified by the [`SOCKET` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) |

If your application isn't listening at the same place that the runtime is sending requests,
you see `502 Bad Gateway` errors when you try to connect to your website.

####### Locations

Each key in the `locations` dictionary is a path on your site with a leading `/`.
For `example.com`, a `/` matches `example.com/` and `/admin` matches `example.com/admin`.
When multiple keys match an incoming request, the most-specific applies.

The following table presents possible properties for each location:

| Name                | Type                                                 | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

######## Rules

The rules dictionary can override most other keys according to a regular expression.
The key of each item is a regular expression to match paths exactly.
If an incoming request matches the rule, it's handled by the properties under the rule,
overriding any conflicting rules from the rest of the `locations` dictionary.

Under `rules`, you can set all the other possible [`locations` properties](#locations)
except `root`, `index`, `rules` and `request_buffering`.

In the following example, the `allow` key disallows requests for static files anywhere in the site.
This is overridden by a rule that explicitly allows common image file formats.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # Handle dynamic requests
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/index.php'
      # Disallow static files
      allow: false
      rules:
        # Allow common image files only.
        '\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|css|js|map|ico|bmp|eot|woff2?|otf|ttf)$':
          allow: true
```

######## Request buffering

Request buffering is enabled by default to handle chunked requests as most app servers don't support them.
The following table shows the keys in the `request_buffering` dictionary:

| Name               | Type      | Required | Default | Description                               |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`          | `boolean` | Yes      | `true`  | Whether request buffering is enabled.     |
| `max_request_size` | `string`  |          | `250m`  | The maximum size to allow in one request. |

The default configuration would look like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      passthru: true
      request_buffering:
        enabled: true
        max_request_size: 250m
```

###### Workers

Workers are exact copies of the code and compilation output as a `web` instance after a [`build` hook](#hooks).
They use the same container image.

Workers can't accept public requests and so are suitable only for background tasks.
If they exit, they're automatically restarted.

The keys of the `workers` definition are the names of the workers.
You can then define how each worker differs from the `web` instance using
the [top-level properties](#top-level-properties).

Each worker can differ from the `web` instance in all properties _except_ for:

- `crons` as cron jobs don't run on workers
- `hooks` as the `build` hook must be the same
  and the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks don't run on workers.

A worker named `queue` that was small and had a different start command could look like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
workers:
  queue:
    size: S
    commands:
      start: |
        ./worker.sh
```

For resource allocation, using workers in your project requires a [Medium
 plan or larger](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).

###### Access

The `access` dictionary has one allowed key:

| Name  | Allowed values                      | Default       | Description                                                           |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ssh` | `admin`, `contributor`, or `viewer` | `contributor` | Defines the minimum role required to access app environments via SSH. |

In the following example, only users with `admin` permissions for the
given [environment type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#environment-type-roles)
can access the deployed environment via SSH:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
access:
  ssh: admin
```

###### Variables

Upsun Fixed provides a number of ways to set [variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Variables set in your app configuration have the lowest precedence,
meaning they're overridden by any conflicting values provided elsewhere.

All variables set in your app configuration must have a prefix.
Some [prefixes have specific meanings](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-prefixes).

Variables with the prefix `env` are available as a separate environment variable.
All other variables are available in
the [`PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

The following example sets two variables:

- A variable named `env:AUTHOR` with the value `Juan` that's available in the environment as `AUTHOR`
- A variable named `d8config:system.site:name` with the value `My site rocks`
  that's available in the `PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    AUTHOR: 'Juan'
  d8config:
    "system.site:name": 'My site rocks'
```

You can also define and access more [complex values](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-complex-values).

Set limits in outbound traffic from your app with no impact on inbound requests.

The `outbound` key is required and contains one or more rules.
The rules define what traffic is allowed; anything unspecified is blocked.

Each rule has the following properties where at least one is required and `ips` and `domains` can't be specified
together:

| Name      | Type                | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ips`     | Array of `string`s  | `["0.0.0.0/0"]` | IP addresses in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). See a [CIDR format converter](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr).                                                      |
| `domains` | Array of `string`s  |                 | [Fully qualified domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) to specify specific destinations by hostname.                                                                                 |
| `ports`   | Array of `integer`s |                 | Ports from 1 to 65535 that are allowed. If any ports are specified, all unspecified ports are blocked. If no ports are specified, all ports are allowed. Port `25`, the SMTP port for sending email, is always blocked. |

The default settings would look like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
firewall:
  outbound:
    - ips: [ "0.0.0.0/0" ]
```

####### Support for rules

Where outbound rules for firewalls are supported in all environments.
For Dedicated Gen 2 projects, contact support for configuration.

####### Multiple rules

Multiple firewall rules can be specified.
In such cases, a given outbound request is allowed if it matches _any_ of the defined rules.

So in the following example requests to any IP on port 80 are allowed
and requests to 1.2.3.4 on either port 80 or 443 are allowed:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
firewall:
  outbound:
    - ips: [ "1.2.3.4/32" ]
      ports: [ 443 ]
    - ports: [ 80 ]
```

####### Outbound traffic to CDNs

Be aware that many services are behind a content delivery network (CDN).
For most CDNs, routing is done via domain name, not IP address,
so thousands of domain names may share the same public IP addresses at the CDN.
If you allow the IP address of a CDN, you are usually allowing many or all of the other customers hosted behind that
CDN.

####### Outbound traffic by domain

You can filter outbound traffic by domain.
Using domains in your rules rather than IP addresses is generally more specific and secure.
For example, if you use an IP address for a service with a CDN,
you have to allow the IP address for the CDN.
This means that you allow potentially hundreds or thousands of other servers also using the CDN.

An example rule filtering by domain:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
firewall:
  outbound:
    - protocol: tcp
      domains: ["api.stripe.com", "api.twilio.com"]
      ports: [80, 443]
    - protocol: tcp
      ips: ["1.2.3.4/29","2.3.4.5"]
      ports: [22]
```

######## Determine which domains to allow

To determine which domains to include in your filtering rules,
find the domains your site has requested the DNS to resolve.
Run the following command to parse your server’s `dns.log` file
and display all Fully Qualified Domain Names that have been requested:

```bash
awk '/query\[[^P]\]/ { print $6 | "sort -u" }' /var/log/dns.log
```

The output includes all DNS requests that were made, including those blocked by your filtering rules.
It doesn't include any requests made using an IP address.

Example output:

```bash
facebook.com
fastly.com
upsun.com
www.google.com
www.upsun.com
```

###### Hooks

There are three different hooks that run as part of the process of building and deploying your app.
These are places where you can run custom scripts.
They are: the `build` hook, the `deploy` hook, and the `post_deploy` hook.
Only the `build` hook is run for [worker instances](#workers), while [web instances](#web) run all three.

The process is ordered as:

1. Variables accessible at build time become available.
1. The `build` hook is run.
1. The file system is changed to read only (except for any [mounts](#mounts)).
1. The app container starts. Variables accessible at runtime and services become available.
1. The `deploy` hook is run.
1. The app container begins accepting requests.
1. The `post_deploy` hook is run.

Note that if an environment changes by no code changes, only the last step is run.
If you want the entire process to run, see how to [manually trigger builds](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#manually-trigger-builds).

####### Writable directories during build

During the `build` hook, there are three writeable directories:

- `PLATFORM_APP_DIR`:
  Where your code is checked out and the working directory when the `build` hook starts.
  Becomes the app that gets deployed.
- `PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR`:
  Persists between builds, but isn't deployed.
  Shared by all builds on all branches.
- `/tmp`:
  Isn't deployed and is wiped between each build.
  Note that `PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR` is mapped to `/tmp`
  and together they offer about 8GB of free space.

####### Hook failure

Each hook is executed as a single script, so they're considered to have failed only if the final command in them fails.
To cause them to fail on the first failed command, add `set -e` to the beginning of the hook.

If a `build` hook fails for any reason, the build is aborted and the deploy doesn't happen.
Note that this only works for `build` hooks --
if other hooks fail, the app is still deployed.

######## Automated testing

It’s preferable that you set up and run automated tests in a dedicated CI/CD tool.
Relying on Upsun Fixed hooks for such tasks can prove difficult.

During the `build` hook, you can halt the deployment on a test failure but the following limitations apply:

- Access to services such as databases, Redis, Vault KMS, and even writable mounts is disabled.
  So any testing that relies on it is sure to fail.
- If you haven’t made changes to your app, an existing build image is reused and the build hook isn’t run.
- Test results are written into your app container, so they might get exposed to a third party.

During the `deploy` hook, you can access services but **you can’t halt the deployment based on a test failure**.
Note that there are other downsides:

- Your app container is read-only during the deploy hook,
  so if your tests need to write reports and other information, you need to create a file mount for them.
- Your app can only be deployed once the deploy hook has been completed.
  Therefore, running automated testing via the deploy hook generates slower deployments.
- Your environment isn’t available externally during the deploy hook.
  Unit and integration testing might work without the environment being available,
  but you can’t typically perform end-to-end testing until after the environment is up and available.

###### Crons

The keys of the `crons` definition are the names of the cron jobs.
The names must be unique.

If an application defines both a `web` instance and `worker` instances, cron jobs run only on the `web` instance.

See how to [get cron logs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#container-logs).

The following table shows the properties for each job:

| Name               | Type                                         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spec`             | `string`                                     | Yes      | The [cron specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression). To prevent competition for resources that might hurt performance, use `H` in definitions to indicate an unspecified but invariant time. For example, instead of using `0 * * * *` to indicate the cron job runs at the start of every hour, you can use `H * * * *` to indicate it runs every hour, but not necessarily at the start. This prevents multiple cron jobs from trying to start at the same time. |

Note that you can [cancel pending or running crons](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/cancel-activity.md).

**Note**: 

The use of the ``cmd`` key is now deprecated in favor of the ``commands``key. 
Make sure you set your new cron jobs using the ``commands`` key,
and update your existing cron jobs to ensure continuity.

It's run in [Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `stop`  | `string` | No       | The command that's issued to give the cron command a chance to shutdown gracefully, such as to finish an active item in a list of tasks. Issued when a cron task is interrupted by a user through the CLI or Console. If not specified, a `SIGTERM` signal is sent to the process. |

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  mycommand:
    spec: 'H * * * *'
    commands:
      start: sleep 60 && echo sleep-60-finished && date
      stop: killall sleep
    shutdown_timeout: 18
```

In this example configuration, the [cron specification](#crons) uses the `H` syntax.

Note that this syntax is only supported on Grid projects.
On Dedicated Gen 2 projects, use the [standard cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression).

####### Example cron jobs

```yaml {}
stack: [ "php@8.5" ]
crons:
  # Run Drupal's cron tasks every 19 minutes.
  drupal:
    spec: '*/19 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'cd web ; drush core-cron'
  # But also run pending queue tasks every 7 minutes.
  # Use an odd number to avoid running at the same time as the `drupal` cron.
  drush-queue:
    spec: '*/7 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'cd web ; drush queue-run aggregator_feeds'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
stack: [ "ruby@3.4" ]
crons:
  # Execute a rake script every 19 minutes.
  ruby:
    spec: '*/19 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'bundle exec rake some:task'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
stack: [ "php@8.5" ]
crons:
  # Run Laravel's scheduler every 5 minutes.
  scheduler:
    spec: '*/5 * * * *'
    commands:
      start: 'php artisan schedule:run'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
stack: [ "php@8.5" ]
crons:
  # Take a backup of the environment every day at 5:00 AM.
  snapshot:
    spec: 0 5 * * *
    commands:
      start: |
        # Only run for the production environment, aka main branch
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = "production" ]; then
            croncape symfony ...
        fi        
```

####### Conditional crons

If you want to set up customized cron schedules depending on the environment type,
define conditional crons.
To do so, use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  update:
    spec: '0 0 * * *'
    commands:
      start: |
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
          platform backup:create --yes --no-wait
          platform source-operation:run update --no-wait --yes
        fi
```

####### Cron job timing

Minimum time between cron jobs being triggered:

| Plan                | Time      |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Professional        | 5 minutes |
| Elite or Enterprise | 1 minute  |

For each app container, only one cron job can run at a time.
If a new job is triggered while another is running, the new job is paused until the other completes.

To minimize conflicts, a random offset is applied to all triggers.
The offset is a random number of seconds up to 20 minutes or the cron frequency, whichever is smaller.

Crons are also paused while activities such as [backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md) are running.
The crons are queued to run after the other activity finishes.

To run cron jobs in a timezone other than UTC, set the [timezone property](#top-level-properties).

####### Paused crons

[Preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#preview-environment) are often used for a limited time and then abandoned.
While it's useful for environments under active development to have scheduled tasks,
unused environments don't need to run cron jobs.
To minimize unnecessary resource use,
crons on environments with no deployments are paused.

This affects all environments that aren't live environments.
This means all environments on Development plans
and all preview environments on higher plans.

Such environments with deployments within 14 days have crons with the status `running`.
If there haven't been any deployments within 14 days, the status is `paused`.

You can see the status in the Console
or using the CLI by running `platform environment:info` and looking under `deployment_state`.

######## Restarting paused crons

If the crons on your preview environment are paused but you're still using them,
you can push changes to the environment or redeploy it.

To restart crons without changing anything:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform redeploy
```

####### Sizing hints

The following table shows the properties that can be set in `sizing_hints`:

| Name              | Type      | Default | Minimum | Description                                    |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `request_memory`  | `integer` | 45      | 10      | The average memory consumed per request in MB. |
| `reserved_memory` | `integer` | 70      | 70      | The amount of memory reserved in MB.           |

See more about [PHP-FPM workers and sizing](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/fpm.md).

###### Source

The following table shows the properties that can be set in `source`:

| Name         | Type                     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `operations` | An operations dictionary |          | Operations that can be applied to the source code. See [source operations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md)                               |
| `root`       | `string`                 |          | The path where the app code lives. Defaults to the root project directory. Useful for [multi-app setups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md). |

###### Additional hosts

If you're using a private network with specific IP addresses you need to connect to,
you might want to map those addresses to hostnames to better remember and organize them.
In such cases, you can add a map of those IP addresses to whatever hostnames you like.
Then when your app tries to access the hostname, it's sent to the proper IP address.

So in the following example, if your app tries to access `api.example.com`, it's sent to `192.0.2.23`.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
additional_hosts:
  api.example.com: "192.0.2.23"
  web.example.com: "203.0.113.42"
```

This is equivalent to adding the mapping to the `/etc/hosts` file for the container.
### Source operations

On Upsun Fixed, you can run automated code updates through a feature called **source operations**.
Defined in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md), source operations let you specify commands
that can commit changes to your project's repository when called.

For example, you can set up a source operation to [automatically update your application dependencies](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/dependency-updates.md),
[update a site from an upstream repository](#update-a-site-from-an-upstream-repository-or-template),
or [revert to the last commit](#revert-to-the-last-commit) pushed to your Git repository.

To run your source operations, you can use the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or the [Console](https://console.upsun.com).

If you want to run your source operations and update your code automatically,
you can also define [cron jobs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).

##### How source operations work

When you trigger a source operation, the following happens in order:

1. The current environment HEAD commit is checked out in Git.
   It doesn't have any remotes or tags defined in the project.
   It only has the current environment branch.

2. Sequentially, for each app that has an operation bearing [the name](#define-a-source-operation)
   of the triggered source operation in its configuration,
   the operation command is run in the app container.
   The container isn't part of the environment's runtime cluster
   and doesn't require that the environment is running.

   The environment has all of the variables normally available during the build phase.
   These may be optionally overridden by the variables specified when the operation is run.

3. If any new commits were created, they're pushed to the repository and the normal build process is triggered.

   If multiple apps in a single project both result in a new commit,
   there are two distinct commits in the Git history but only a single new build process.

##### Define a source operation

A source operation requires two things:

- A name that must be unique within the application.
  The name is the key of the block defined under `source.operations` in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#source).

- A `command` that defines what's run when the operation is triggered.

The syntax is similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    <SOURCE_OPERATION_NAME>:
      command: <COMMAND>
```
For example, to update a file from a remote location, you could define an operation like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    update-file:
      command: |
        set -e
        curl -O https://example.com/myfile.txt
        git add myfile.txt
        git commit -m "Update remote file"
```

The name of the source operation in this case is `update-file`.

For more possibilities, see other [source operation examples](#source-operation-examples).

##### Run a source operation

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform source-operation:run <SOURCE_OPERATION_NAME>
```

Replace <SOURCE_OPERATION_NAME> with the name of your operation, such as ``update-file`` in the [example above](#define-a-source-operation).

After running a source operation,
to apply the changes to your local development environment run the `git pull` command.

Note that you can [cancel pending or running source operations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/cancel-activity.md).

##### Use variables in your source operations

You can add [variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md) to the environment of the source operation.

Use the `env:` prefix to expose each of those variables as a Unix environment variable.
In this way, they're referenced by the source operation
and interpreted the same way as any other variable set in your project.

For example, you might want to have a `FILE` variable available with the value `example.txt`
to pass to a source operation similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    update-file:
      command: |
        set -e
        curl -O https://example.com/$FILE
        git add $FILE
        git commit -m "Update remote file"
```

Follow these steps to run the source operation:

```bash {}
platform source-operation:run update-file --variable env:FILE="example.txt"
```

##### Source integrations

If your project is using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
any new commits resulting from a source operation are first pushed to your external Git repository.
Then the source integration pushes those commits to Upsun Fixed and redeploys the environment.

When using a source integration,
you can't run source operations on environments created from pull or merge requests created on the external repository.

If you try running a source operation on a non-supported environment, you see the following error:

```text
[ApiFeatureMissingException]
This project doesn't support source operations.
```

##### Automated source operations using a cron job

You can use a cron to automatically run your source operations.

Note that it’s best not to run source operations on your production environment,
but rather on a dedicated environment where you can test changes.

Make sure you have the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) installed
and [an API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token)
so you can run a cron job in your app container.

1.  Set your API token as a top-level environment variable:

 - Open the environment where you want to add the variable.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Variables**.
 - Click **+ Add variable**.
 - In the **Variable name** field, enter ``env:PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN``.
 - In the **Value** field, enter your API token.
 - Make sure the **Available at runtime** and **Sensitive variable** options are selected.
 - Click **Add variable**.

**Note**: 

Once you add the API token as an environment variable,
anyone with [SSH access](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md) can read its value.
Make sure you carefully check your [user access on this project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#manage-project-users).

2.  Add a build hook to your app configuration to install the CLI as part of the build process:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    echo "Installing Upsun Fixed CLI"
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/cli/main/installer.sh | bash

    echo "Testing Upsun Fixed CLI"
    platform
```

3.  Then, to configure a cron job to automatically run a source operation once a day,
    use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  update:
    # Run the code below every day at midnight.
    spec: '0 0 * * *'
    commands:
      start: |
        set -e
        platform sync -e development code data --no-wait --yes
        platform source-operation:run update-file --no-wait --yes
```

The example above synchronizes the `development` environment with its parent
and then runs the `update-file` source operation defined [previously](#define-a-source-operation).

##### Source operation examples

  **Tier availability**
  This feature is available for
  **Enterprise and Elite** customers. [Compare the  tiers](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) on our pricing page, or [contact our sales team](https://upsun.com/contact-us/
  ) for more information.

###### Update your application dependencies

You can set up a source operation and a cron job to [automate your dependency updates](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/dependency-updates.md).

###### Update a site from an upstream repository or template

The following source operation syncronizes your branch with an upstream Git repository.

1. [Add a project-level variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-project-variables)
   named `env:UPSTREAM_REMOTE` with the Git URL of the upstream repository.
   That makes that repository available as a Unix environment variable in all environments,
   including in the source operation's environment.

   - Variable name: `env:UPSTREAM_REMOTE`
   - Variable example value: `https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs`

2. In your app configuration, define a source operation to fetch from that upstream repository:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    upstream-update:
      command: |
        set -e
        git remote add upstream $UPSTREAM_REMOTE
        git fetch --all
        git merge upstream/main
```

3. Now every time you run the `upstream-update` operation on a given branch,
   the branch fetches all changes from the upstream git repository
   and then merges the latest changes from the default branch in the upstream repository.
   If there’s a conflict merging from the upstream repository,
   the source operation fails and doesn't update from the upstream repository.

Run the `upstream-update` operation on a preview environment rather than directly on Production.

###### Revert to the last commit

The following source operation reverts the last commit pushed to the Git repository.
This can be useful if you didn't properly test the changes of another operation
and you need to quickly revert to the previous state.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    revert:
      command: |
        git reset --hard HEAD~
```

Now every time you run the `revert` operation on a given branch,
the operation reverts to the last commit pushed to that branch.

###### Update Drupal Core

The following source operation uses Composer to update Drupal Core:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    update-drupal-core:
      command: |
        set -e
        composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies
        git add composer.lock
        git commit -m "Automated Drupal Core update."
```

`--with-dependencies` is used to also update Drupal Core dependencies.
Read more on how to [update Drupal Core via Composer on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/updating-drupal/updating-drupal-core-via-composer).

Now every time you run the `update-drupal-core` operation, it updates Drupal Core.

###### Download a Drupal extension

The following source operation downloads a Drupal extension.
You can define the Drupal extension by setting an `EXTENSION` variable
or [overriding it](#use-variables-in-your-source-operations) when running the source operation.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    download-drupal-extension:
      command: |
        set -e
        composer require $EXTENSION
        git add composer.json
        git commit -am "Automated install of: $EXTENSION via Composer."
```

Now every time you run the `download-drupal-extension` operation, it downloads the defined extension.

If it's a new extension, after the source operation finishes,
you need to enable the new extension via the Drupal management interface or using Drush.

###### Update Git submodules

The following source operation updates all Git submodules recursively:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
source:
  operations:
    rebuild:
      command: |
        set -e
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        git submodule update --remote --checkout
        SHA=$(git submodule | awk -F' ' '{print $1}' | sed -s 's/+//g')
        echo -n "$SHA" > .sha
        git add uppler .sha
        git commit -m "Updating submodule to commit '$SHA'"
```

Now every time you run the `rebuild` operation, it updates the Git submodules.
### Runtime operations

Runtime operations allow you to trigger one-off commands or scripts on your project.
Similar to [crons](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons), they run in the app container but not on a specific schedule.
You can [define runtime operations](#define-a-runtime-operation) in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md)
and [trigger them](#run-a-runtime-operation) at any time through the Upsun Fixed CLI.

For example, if you have a static website,
you may want to set up a runtime operation to occasionally fetch content from a backend system
without having to rebuild your whole app.

You can use runtime operations if you have a Grid environment.

##### Define a runtime operation

To define a runtime operation, add a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
operations:
  <RUNTIME_OPERATION_NAME>:
    role: <USER_ROLE>
    commands:
      start: <COMMAND>
```

When you define a runtime operation,
you can specify which users can trigger it according to their user `role`:

- `viewer`
- `contributor`
- `admin`

If you don't set the `role` option when configuring your runtime operation,
by default all users with the `contributor` role can trigger it.

For example, to allow admin users to clear the cache of a Drupal site,
you could define an operation like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
operations:
  clear-rebuild:
    role: admin
    commands:
      start: drush cache:rebuild
```
The name of the runtime operation in this case is `clear-rebuild`.

For more possibilities, see other [runtime operation examples](#runtime-operation-examples).

##### Run a runtime operation

A runtime operation can be triggered through the Upsun Fixed CLI once it has been [defined](#define-a-runtime-operation).
Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform operation:run <RUNTIME_OPERATION_NAME> --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

You can only trigger a runtime operation if you have permission to do so.
Permissions are granted through the ``role`` option specified in the [runtime operation configuration](#define-a-runtime-operation). This can only be done if a [runtime operation has been defined](#define-a-runtime-operation).
For example, to trigger the runtime operation [defined previously](#define-a-runtime-operation),
you could run the following command:

```bash {}
platform operation:run clear-rebuild --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

##### List your runtime operations

To list all the runtime operations available on an environment,
run the following command:

```bash
platform operation:list --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

##### Runtime operation examples

###### Build your app when using a static site generator

During every Upsun Fixed deployment, a standard [build](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#the-build) is run.
When you use a static site generator like [Gatsby](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby.md)
or [Next.js](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/nextjs.md) with [a headless backend](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/gatsby/headless.md),
you need to run a second ``build`` step to get your app ready for production.

This is because, as its framework is being built,
your frontend needs to pull content-related data from your backend’s API
(to generate all the static HTML pages your site is to serve).
To accomplish this on Upsun Fixed, where each app goes through a build-deploy pipeline in parallel,
your frontend’s build must be delayed _until after_ your backend has fully deployed.
It's often delayed up until the [`post_deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook) stage,
when the filesystem is read-only.

You can use a runtime operation to trigger the second `build` step
after the initial deployment of your app or after a redeployment.
You can also trigger it when you need to fetch content from your backend
but want to avoid going through the whole Upsun Fixed [build and deploy processes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md) again.

**Note**: 

The following examples assume that the frontend and backend containers are included in the same environment.
This isn’t necessary for the commands to run successfully.<BR>
What is necessary is that the build destination for your frontend **is  writable at runtime**
(meaning, you must [define a mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) for it).
If you don’t want to include a build within a mount (especially if your data source **isn’t** on Upsun Fixed),
you can use [source operations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md) to achieve a similar effect,
but through generating a new commit.

```yaml {}
operations:
  gatsby-build:
    role: viewer
    commands:
      start: gatsby build
```

To trigger your runtime operation, run a command similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform operation:run gatsby-build --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

To run the [Next.js build](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#nextjs-build-api) step,
define a runtime operation similar to the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
operations:
  next-build:
    role: admin
    commands:
      # All below are valid, depending on your setup
      start: next build
      # start: npx next build
      # start: npm run build
```

To trigger your runtime operation, run a command similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform operation:run next-build --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

###### Execute actions on your Node.js app

You can define runtime operations for common [pm2](https://pm2.io/docs/runtime/overview/) process manager tasks.

```yaml {}
operations:
  pm2-ping:
    role: admin
    commands:
      start: |
        # Assuming pm2 start npm --no-daemon --watch --name $APP -- start -- -p $PORT
        APP=$(cat package.json | jq -r '.name')
        pm2 ping $APP        
```

To trigger your runtime operation, run a command similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform operation:run pm2-ping --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

To reload your Node.js app, define a runtime operation similar to the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
operations:
  pm2-reload:
    role: admin
    commands:
      start: |
        # Assuming pm2 start npm --no-daemon --watch --name $APP -- start -- -p $PORT
        APP=$(cat package.json | jq -r '.name')
        pm2 reload $APP        
```

To trigger your runtime operation, run a command similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform operation:run pm2-reload --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

To restart your Node.js app, define a runtime operation similar to the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
operations:
  pm2-restart:
    role: admin
    commands:
      start: |
        # Assuming pm2 start npm --no-daemon --watch --name $APP -- start -- -p $PORT
        APP=$(cat package.json | jq -r '.name')
        pm2 restart $APP        
```

To trigger your runtime operation, run a command similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform operation:run pm2-restart --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

###### Define management commands on your Django project

On a Django project, you can [define custom `django-admin` commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/custom-management-commands/), for example to run a one-off management command (`manual migration` in the example above) outside of the Django ORM migration framework.
To do so, define a runtime operation similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: python:3.13

operations:
  manual-migration:
    role: admin
    commands:
      start: python manage.py manual_migration
```
To trigger your runtime operation, run a command similar to the following:

```bash
platform operation:run manual-migration --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```
### Configure what's served

How you should configure your web server depends a lot on what you want to serve.
The following examples show how in specific scenarios you might define [your web server](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web).
#### Create a basic PHP app with a front controller

To handle dynamic requests to your PHP app, you might want to use a [front controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller).
The following example shows how for such an app you might start defining [your web server](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web).

###### Define a document root

Start by defining your document root (where all your publicly visible pages are).

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'public'
```

###### Define a front controller

Define where all requests that don't match a file in the document root are sent.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/index.php'
      index:
        - index.php
```

In this case, `/index.php` acts as a front controller and handles dynamic requests.

Because it handles dynamic requests, you want to ensure that scripts are enabled
and responses aren't cached.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      #...
      scripts: true
      # No caching for static files.
      # (Dynamic pages use whatever cache headers are generated by the program.)
      expires: -1
```

###### Define rules

You might want to define specific rules for the location.
For example, you might want to allow all kinds of files except mp4 files.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      ...
      # Allow all file types generally
      allow: true
      rules:
        # Disallow .mp4 files specifically.
        \.mp4$:
          allow: false
```

###### Set different rules for specific locations

You might want to set specific rules for specific locations.
For example, you might have files in your `/public/images` directory that are served at `/images`.
You could define a specific cache time for them and limit them to only static image files.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      #...
    # Set a 5 min expiration time for static files in this location.
    # Missing files are sent to front controller
    # through the '/' location above.
    '/images':
      expires: 300
      passthru: true
      # Do not execute PHP scripts from this location and do not
      # deliver their source code (for enhanced security).
      scripts: false
      allow: false
      rules:
        # Only allow static image files in this location
        '\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|ico|bmp)$':
          allow: true
```

###### Complete example

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/index.php'
      index:
          - index.php
      scripts: true
      # No caching for static files.
      # (Dynamic pages use whatever cache headers are generated by the program.)
      expires: -1
      # Allow all file types generally
      allow: true
      rules:
        # Disallow .mp4 files specifically.
        \.mp4$:
          allow: false
    # Set a 5 min expiration time for static files in this location.
    # Missing files are sent to front controller
    # through the '/' location above.
    '/images':
      expires: 300
      passthru: true
      # Do not execute PHP scripts from this location and do not
      # deliver their source code (for enhanced security).
      scripts: false
      allow: false
      rules:
        # Only allow static image files in this location
        '\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|ico|bmp)$':
          allow: true
```
#### Rewrite requests without redirects

You might want to rewrite requests so they're served by specific sections of your app
without having to redirect users.
For example, you might want to make URLs seem semantic to users without having to rewrite your app architecture.

In such a case, you might want requests to `/shoes/great-shoe/` to be served
as if they were requests to `/?category=shoes&product=great-shoe`.
If so, add a [rule](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#rules) similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      ...
      rules:
        '^/(?[^/]+)/(?[^/]+)/$':
          passthru: '/?category=$category&product=$product'
```

Or you might organize your images by file type, but don't want to expose the organization externally.
You could rewrite requests to do that behind the scenes:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      ...
      rules:
        '^/img/(?.*)\.(?.*)$':
          passthru: '/$type/$name.$type'
```

Now a request to `/img/image.png` returns the file found at `/png/image.png`.

###### Query parameters

Query parameters in the request are untouched by rules and will be passed to the app.
For example, if you have the category and product rule from previously, a request to `/shoes/great-shoe/?product=terrible-shoe`
is rewritten to `?category=shoes&product=great-shoe&product=terrible-shoe`.
In that case, the `product` query parameter sent to the app will contain the value `terrible-shoe`.
#### Serve directories at different paths

In some cases you might want to depart from the common practice of serving directories directly.
You might want to create a URL structure different than the structure on your disk.

For example, in Git you might have a folder for your app and another folder that builds your documentation.
Your entire Git repository might look like the following:

```text
.platform/
  routes.yaml
  services.yaml
  applications.yaml
application/
  [app-code-files]
docs-src/
  [docs-code-files]
```

And your build process might build the documentation with an output folder such as `docs-public`.

If so, you can serve all requests by your app code except for those that start with `/docs`,
which you serve with your generated docs.
Use a [`web` configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web) similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
        passthru: true
    '/docs':
      root: 'docs-public'
      index:
        - "index.html"
      expires: 24h
      scripts: false
      allow: true
```

This way, your app can safely coexist with static files as if it were a single site hierarchy.
And you can keep the static pages separate from your app code.
#### Serve static sites

Static site generators are a popular way to create fast sites.
Because there's no need to wait for responses from servers, the sites may load faster.

As an example, this documentation is built using a tool called Hugo and served by Upsun Fixed as a static site.
You can see the [entire repository on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs),
including its [app configuration](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs/blob/main/.platform/applications.yaml).

To learn how to serve your static site using Upsun Fixed,
you can start with the required [minimal app configuration](#minimal-app-configuration) and build on it,
or jump straight to an [example of a complete configuration](#complete-example-configuration).

###### Minimal app configuration

To successfully serve a static site using Upsun Fixed,
you need to set up a minimal app configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
# The type of the application to build.
type: "nodejs:24"

# The web key configures the web server running in front of your app.
web:
  locations:
    /:
      # Static site generators usually output built static files to a specific directory.
      # Define this directory (must be an actual directory inside the root directory of your app)
      # as the root for your static site.
      root: "public"
      # Files to consider when serving a request for a directory.
      index:
        - index.html
```

See more information on the required minimal settings:
- [Top-level properties](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#top-level-properties).
- [`web` property](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web).
- [`locations` properties](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

###### Add more features

####### Allow static files but not dynamic files on PHP containers

If you have a PHP container,
you might want to enable client-side scripts but disable server-side scripts.

To enable static files that don't match any rule while disabling server-side scripts on a PHP container,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # ...
      scripts: false
      allow: true
```

See more information on [`locations` properties](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

####### Create cache rules

You can create sensible cache rules to improve performance.
For example, if you publish new content regularly without updating images or site files much,
you might want to cache text files for a day but all image files for longer.

To do so, use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # ...
      expires: 24h
      rules:
        \.(css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|svg)$:
          expires: 4w
```

You can also set a `Cache-Control` header in your rules.
```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # ...
      expires: 24h
      rules:
        \.(css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|svg)$:
          headers:
            Cache-Control: "public, max-age=2419200, immutable"
```
If `expires` and a `Cache-Control` header are set, the rule ignores the `expires` and sets only the `Cache-Control` header. For this reason, make sure
to add a `max-age` value, in seconds, for the `Cache-Control` header.

####### Conserve the server

Because your site is completely static, it doesn't need the server to be running.
To set a background process that blocks the server and conserves resources,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  commands:
    start: sleep infinity
```

You can also use this place to start small programs,
such as a [script to handle 404 errors](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439636723474).

###### Complete example configuration

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: 'python:3.11'

web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # The public directory of the application relative to its root
      root: 'public'
      # The files to look for when serving a directory
      index:
        - 'index.html'
      # Disable server-side scripts
      scripts: false
      allow: true
      # Set caching policy
      expires: 24h
      rules:
        \.(css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|svg)$:
          expires: 4w

  commands:
    # Run a no-op process that uses no CPU resources since this is a static site
    start: sleep infinity
```
#### Set custom headers on static content

When your app responds to dynamic requests, it can generate headers on the fly.
To set headers for static content, add them in [your `web` configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web).

You might want to do so to add custom content-type headers, limit what other sites can embed your content,
or allow cross origin requests.

Say you want to limit most files to be embedded only on your site, but you want an exception for Markdown files.
And you want to serve both Markdown and [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) files with the
correct content types to avoid
[MIME sniffing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#mime_sniffing).

Start by defining a header for files in general:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      ...
      # Apply rules to all static files (dynamic files get rules from your app)
      headers:
        X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

This sets the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` for all static files.
Now your files can only be embedded within your site.

Now set up an exception for Markdown (`*.md`) files using a [rule](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#rules):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      #...
      rules:
        \.md$:
          headers:
            Content-Type: "text/markdown; charset=UTF-8"
```

This rule sets an explicit content type for files that end in `.md`.  Because specific rules override the general
heading configuration, Markdown files don't get the `X-Frame-Options` header set before.

**Setting charset**: 

By default, [HTTP charset parameters](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/http-charset/index.en) are not sent to the response.
If not set, modern browsers will detect ``ISO-8859-1`` and likely default to ``windows-1252`` as this has 32 more international characters.

To set the HTTP charset parameters to your desired charset, you can add ``; charset=UTF-8`` in the ``Content-Type`` parameters.

Now set a rule for AAC files.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      ...
      rules:
        \.aac$:
          headers:
            X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
            Content-Type: audio/aac
```

This rule sets an explicit content type for files that end in `.aac`. It repeats the rule for `X-Frame-Options` because
the `headers` block here overrides the more general configuration.

So now you have three header configurations:

* `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` **and** `Content-Type: audio/aac` for AAC files
* Only `Content-Type: text/markdown` for Markdown files
* Only `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` for everything else

###### Cross origin requests

To allow cross origin requests, add a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to responses.
You can do so for specific origins or for all origins with a wildcard.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      ...
      # Apply rules to all static files (dynamic files get rules from your app)
      headers:
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*"
```

If you use the wildcard value, the headers are modified for each request in the following ways:

* The value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set to the value of the `Origin` request header.
* The `Vary` header is included with a value of `Origin`. See why in the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#access-control-allow-origin).

This is done so that credentialed requests can be supported.
They would otherwise fail CORS checks if the wildcard value is used.

###### `Strict_Transport_Security` header

The `Strict_Transport_Security` header returns a value of `max-age=0`
unless you enable [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#enable-http-strict-transport-security-hsts)
in your [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

Note that once HSTS is enabled, configuration capabilities depend
on the [HSTS properties](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#enable-http-strict-transport-security-hsts)
set in your routes configuration.
For example, the `max-age` value is set to `31536000` by Upsun Fixed and can't be customized.
### Set up multiple apps in a single project


You can create multiple apps within a single project so they can share data.
This can be useful if you have several apps that are closely related,
such as a backend-only CMS and a frontend system for content delivery and display.

No matter how many apps you have in one project, they're all served by a single [router for the project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/routes.md).
To allow your apps to communicate with each other, [create relationships](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/relationships.md).
Each app separately defines its relationships to [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md),
so apps can share services or have their own.
#### Choose a project structure

How you structure a project with multiple apps depends on how your code is organized
and what you want to accomplish.
For example, there are various ways you could set up the following multiple apps:

![Diagram of a project containing multiple apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/config-diagrams/multiple-app.png "0.5")

Here are some example use cases and potential ways to organize the project:

| Use case                                                                                | Structure                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

###### Unified app configuration

You can configure all your apps from a single file.
To do so, create a `.platform/applications.yaml` and define each app as a key.

For example, if you have an API Platform backend with a Symfony API,
a Mercure Rocks server, and a Gatsby frontend,
you can organize your repository like this:

```txt
├── .platform
│   ├── applications.yaml   <- Unified app configuration
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── admin
│   └── ...                 <- API Platform Admin app code
├── api-app
│   └── ...                 <- Bigfoot app code
├── gatsby
│   └── ...                 <- Gatsby app code
└── mercure
    └── ...                 <- Mercure Rocks app code
```

The `api` app is built from the `api-app` directory. 
The `admin` app is built from the `admin` directory. 
The `gatsby` app is built from the `gatsby` directory. 
The `mercure` app is built from the `mercure` directory. 
They all have different configurations for how they serve the files. For more details, see the [complete example file](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp/blob/multiapp-monolith/.platform/applications.yaml).

**Note**: 

The ``.platform`` directory is located at the root, separate from your apps.
It contains all the needed configuration files to set up the routing, services and behavior of each app.
Since the code bases of your apps live in a different directory,
you need to [change the source root of each app](#change-the-source-root-of-your-app).

To build multiple apps from the repository root, set ``source.root`` to ``/``.
This allows you to control all your apps in one place and even build multiple apps from the same source code.

To allow your apps to communicate with each other, define [relationships](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/relationships.md).

Note that with this setup, when you amend the code of one of your apps,
the build image for your other apps can still be reused.

Once your repository is organized, you can use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}

    database:
      service: "database"

###### Nested directories

When code bases are separate, changes to one app don't necessarily mean that the other apps in the project get rebuilt.
You might have a situation where app `main` depends on app `languagetool`, but `languagetool` doesn't depend on `main`.

In such cases, you can nest the dependency so the parent (`main`) gets rebuilt on changes to it or its children,
but the child (`languagetool`) is only rebuilt on changes to itself.

For example, you might have a Python app (`main`) that runs a script that requires Java code to be up to date.
But the Java app (`languagetool`) doesn't require updating when the Python app (`main`) is updated.
In that case, you can nest the Java app within the Python app:

```txt
├── .platform
│   ├── applications.yaml
│   └── .platform/routes.yaml
├── languagetool
│   └── main.java           <- Java app code
└── main.py                 <- Python app code
```

The Python app's code base includes all of the files at the top level (excluding the `.platform` directory)
*and* all of the files within the `languagetool` directory.
The Java app's code base includes only the files within the `languagetool` directory.

In this case, your `.platform/applications.yaml` file must contain 2 entries, one for the `main` app and second one for the `languagetool` app.

**Note**: 

The ``.platform`` directory is located at the root, separate from your apps.
It contains all the needed configuration files to set up the routing, services and behavior of each app.
Since the code base of the ``languagetool`` app lives in a different directory (``languagetool/``),
you need to [change the source root](#change-the-source-root-of-your-app) of the ``languagetool`` app.

Once your repository is organized, you can use a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
main:
  type: 'python:3.11'
  ...

languagetool:
  type: 'java:17'
  source:
    root: 'languagetool'
  ...
```

###### Split your code source into multiple Git submodule repositories

If you have different teams working on different code with different processes,
you might want each app to have its own repository.
Then you can build them together in another repository using [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

With this setup, your apps are kept separate from the top application.
Each app has its own [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) containing its code base.
All your apps are configured in a single `.platform/applications.yaml` file.
So you could organize your [project repository](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp/tree/submodules-root-app-yaml) like this:

```text
├── .platform
│   ├── applications.yaml
│   ├── routes.yaml
│   └── services.yaml
├── @admin      <-- API Platform Admin submodule
├── @api        <-- Bigfoot submodule
├── @gatsby     <-- Gatsby submodule
├── @mercure    <-- Mercure rocks submodule
└── .gitmodules
```

[Add the submodules using the Git CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md#clone-submodules-during-deployment).

Your `.gitmodules` file would define all the submodules like this:

```txt  {location=".gitmodules"}
[submodule "admin"]
	path = admin
	url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin.git
[submodule "api"]
	path = api
	url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-api.git
[submodule "gatsby"]
	path = gatsby
	url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-gatsby.git
[submodule "mercure"]
	path = mercure
	url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-mercure.git
```

**Note**: 

In this case, and any other case where your app configuration files are kept outside of the app directory,
make sure you [change the source root](#change-the-source-root-of-your-app) for each of your apps.

###### Change the source root of your app

When your app's code base and configuration file aren't located at the same directory level in your project repository,
you need to [define a root directory](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory) for your app.

To do so, add a new `source.root` property in your app configuration.

For example, to change the source root of the `admin` app
from the [unified app configuration](#unified-app-configuration) example project,
you could add the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
admin:
  source:
    root: admin
```

The `source.root` path is relative to the repository root.
In this example, the `admin` app now treats the `admin` directory as its root when building.

If `source.root` isn't specified, it defaults to the same directory as the `.platform/applications.yaml` (or `.platform.app.yaml`) file itself.
#### Define routes for your multiple apps

When you set up a project containing multiple applications,
all of your apps are served by a single [router for the project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).
Each of your apps must have a `name` that's unique within the project.
To define specific routes for one of your apps, use this `name`.

There are various ways you can define routes for multiple app projects.

![Diagram of a project containing multiple apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/config-diagrams/multiple-app.png "0.5")

In this project, you have a CMS app, two frontend apps (one using Symfony and another using Gatsby),
and a Mercure Rocks server app, defined as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
admin:
  type: nodejs:16
  source:
    root: admin
  ...
api:
  type: php:8.2
  source:
    root: api
  ...
gatsby:
  type: nodejs:18
  source:
    root: gatsby
  ...
mercure:
  type: golang:1.18
  source:
    root: mercure/.config
  ...
```

**Note**: 

You don’t need to define a route for each app in the repository.
If an app isn’t specified, then it isn’t accessible to the web.
One good example of defining an app with no route is when you [use Git submodules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#split-your-code-source-into-multiple-git-submodule-repositories) and want to [use a source operation to update your submodules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md#update-submodules).

You can also achieve the same thing by defining the app as a [worker](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers).

Depending on your needs, you could configure the router container
[using subdomains](#define-routes-using-subdomains) or using [subdirectories](#define-routes-using-subdirectories).

####### Define routes using subdomains

You could define routes for your apps as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://mercure.{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "mercure:http"
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "api:http"
```

So if your default domain is `example.com`, that means:

- `https://mercure.example.com/` is served by your Mercure Rocks app (`mercure`).
- `https://example.com/` is served by your Symfony frontend app (`api`).

**Note**: 

Using a subdomain might [double your network traffic](https://www.nickolinger.com/blog/2021-08-04-you-dont-need-that-cors-request/),
so consider using a path like ``https://{default}/api`` instead.

####### Define routes using subdirectories

Alternatively, you could define your routes as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "api:http"
"https://{default}/admin":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "admin:http"
```

Then you would need to configure each app's `web.locations` property to match these paths:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
api:
  type: php:8.2
  source:
    root: api
  ...
  web:
    locations:
      "/":
        passthru: "/index.php"
        root: "public"
        index:
          - index.php
admin:
  type: nodejs:16
  source:
    root: admin
  ...
  web:
    locations:
      '/admin':
        passthru: '/admin/index.html'
        root: 'build'
        index:
          - 'index.html'
```

So if your default domain is `example.com`, that means:

- `https://example.com/` is served by your Symfony frontend app (`api`).
- `https://example.com/admin` is served by your Admin app (`admin`).

Note that in this example, for the configuration of your `admin` app,
you need to add the URL suffix `/admin` as both an index in the `web.locations` and a value for the `passhtru` setting.

For a complete example, [go to this project on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp/tree/submodules-root-subfolders-applications).
#### Define relationships between your multiple apps

When you set up a project containing multiple applications,
by default your apps can't communicate with each other.
To enable connections, define relationships between apps using the `http` endpoint.

You can't define circular relationships.
If `app1` has a relationship to `app2`, then `app2` can't have a relationship to `app1`.
If you need data to go both ways, consider coordinating through a shared data store,
like a database or [RabbitMQ server](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/rabbitmq.md).

Relationships between apps use HTTP, not HTTPS.
This is still secure because they're internal and not exposed to the outside world.

###### Relationships example

You have two apps, `app1` and `app2`, and `app1` needs data from `app2`.

In your app configuration for `app1`, define a relationship to `app2`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
app1:
  relationships:
    api:
      service: "app2"
      endpoint: "http"
```

Once they're both built, `app1` can access `app2` at the following URL: `http://api.internal`.
The specific URL is always available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables):

```bash
$ echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq '.api[0].host'
api.internal
```
### Timezones

On Upsun Fixed, there are several timezones you might want to keep in mind.
All timezones default to UTC time.
You can customize some of them, but in most cases,
it's best if you leave them in UTC
and store user data with an associated timezone instead.

The different timezones on Upsun Fixed are the following:

| Timezone             | Description                                  |Customizable  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Container timezone   | The timezone for all Upsun Fixed containers (UTC). |No            |
| App runtime timezone | [Set an app runtime timezone](#set-an-app-runtime-timezone) if you want your app runtime to use a specific timezone instead of the container timezone.<BR>The app runtime timezone only affects your app itself.                | Yes         |
| Cron timezone        | [Set a cron timezone](#set-a-cron-timezone) if you want your crons to run in a specific timezone instead of the app runtime timezone (or instead of the container timezone if no app runtime timezone is set on your project). <BR>The cron timezone only affects your cron jobs.                          | Yes         |
| Log timezone         | The timezone for all Upsun Fixed logs (UTC).      | No           |

**Note**: 

Each Upsun Fixed project also has a **project timezone** that only affects [automated backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md#use-automated-backups).
By default, the project timezone is based on the [region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md) where your project is hosted.
You can [change it from the Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/projects/change-project-timezone.md) at any time.

##### Set an app runtime timezone

How you can set an app runtime timezone depends on your actual app runtime:

```yaml {}
variables:
  php:
    "date.timezone": "Europe/Paris"
```

Start the server with ``env TZ=’<TIMEZONE>’ node server.js``.Start the server with ``env TZ=’<TIMEZONE>’ python server.py``.
 - Start the server with ``env TZ=’<TIMEZONE>’ java -jar …`` OR.
 - Set the Java virtual machine argument ``user.timezone``.
This Java virtual machine argument takes precedence over the environment variable TZ.
For example, you can use the flag ``-D`` when running the application:
``java -jar -D user.timezone=GMT`` or ``java -jar -D user.timezone="Asia/Kolkata"``

##### Set a cron timezone

You can set a specific timezone for your crons so they don't run in your app runtime timezone (or container timezone if no app runtime timezone is set on your project).
To do so, [set the `timezone` top-level property](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#top-level-properties) in your app configuration.
### Troubleshoot disks

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

##### Exceeding plan storage limit

Professional plans come with a default amount of storage that you can [change with your plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
The storage is allocated among your services and applications using the `disk` parameter in their configuration files.

You might accidentally set the sum of all `disk` parameters in the files to exceed your plans storage limit.
For example, by setting `disk: 4096` for a MySQL service in `.platform/services.yaml`
and `disk: 4096` in `.platform.app.yaml` for a plan with a 5 GB storage limit.

In such cases, you get an error like the following:

```text
Error: Resources exceeding plan limit; disk: 8192.00MB > 5120.00MB; try removing a service, or add more storage to your plan
```

To fix the error, do one of the following:

* Lower the `disk` parameters to a value within your plan's storage limits.
  Note the [limits to downsizing disks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#downsize-a-disk).
* Increase your plan's storage limits.
  This can only be done by people with the [manage plans permission](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

##### Low disk space

If you have set up [health notifications](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/notifications.md),
you may receive a notification of low disk space.

To solve this issue:

* [Check mount usage](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/troubleshoot-mounts.md#disk-space-issues)
* [Check your database disk space](#check-your-database-disk-space) (if applicable)
* [Increase the available disk space](#increase-available-disk-space) (if necessary)

###### Check your database disk space

To get approximate disk usage for a database, run the command `platform db:size`.
This returns an estimate such as the following:

```text
+----------------+-----------------+--------+
| Allocated disk | Estimated usage | % used |
+----------------+-----------------+--------+
| 1.0 GiB        | 520.3 MiB       | ~ 51%  |
+----------------+-----------------+--------+
```

Keep in mind that this estimate doesn't represent the exact real size on disk.
But if you notice that the usage percentage is high, you may need to increase the available space.

###### Increase available disk space

If you find that your application or service is running out of disk space,
you can increase the available storage.

To increase the space available for applications and services,
use the `disk` keys in your `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/services.yaml` files.
The sum of all `disk` keys can't exceed the available storage in your plan.

If you need more storage to fit the sum of all `disk` keys, increase your plan's storage limits.
This can only be done by people with the [manage plans permission](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

##### No space left on device

During the `build` hook, you may see the following error:

```text
W: [Errno 28] No space left on device: ...
```

This is caused by the amount of disk provided to the build container before deployment.
Application images are restricted to 8 GB during build, no matter how much writable disk has been set aside for the deployed application.

Some build tools (yarn/npm) store cache for different versions of their modules.
This can cause the build cache to grow over time beyond the maximum.
Try [clearing the build cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#clear-the-build-cache) and [triggering a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

If for some reason your application absolutely requires more than 8 GB during build,
you can open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) to have this limit increased.
### Troubleshoot mounts

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

##### Overlapping folders

If you have a mount with the same name as a directory you've committed to Git or you create such a directory during the build,
you get a message like the following:

```bash
W: The mount '/example' has a path that overlaps with a non-empty folder.
The content of the non-empty folder either comes from:
- your git repository (you may have accidentally committed files).
- or from the build hook.
Please be aware that this content isn't accessible at runtime.
```

This shows that the files in Git or from your build aren't available after the build.
The only files that are available are those in your mount.

To make the files available in the mount, move them away and then copy them into the mount:

1. In the `build` hook, use `mv` to move the files to another location.

   ```bash
   mv example tmp/example
   ```

2. In the `deploy` hook, use `cp` to copy the files into the mount.

   ```bash
   cp -r tmp/example example
   ```

To see the files without copying them, temporarily remove the mount from your app configuration.
Then SSH into your app and view the files.
You can then put the mount back in place.

##### Mounted files not publicly accessible

If you've set up mounts to handle files like user uploads, you want to make sure the files are accessible.
Do so by managing their [location](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

This example defines two mounts, one named `private` and one `upload`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  'private':
    source: local
    source_path: private
  'uploads':
    source: local
    source_path: uploads
```

With only this definition, their behavior is the same.
To make `uploads` accessible, define a location with different rules as in the following example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      # Handle dynamic requests
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/app.php'
    # Allow uploaded files to be served, but don't run scripts.
    '/uploads':
      root: 'uploads'
      expires: 300s
      scripts: false
      allow: true
```

##### Mounts starting with a dot ignored

Upsun Fixed ignores YAML keys that start with a dot.
This causes a mount like `.myhiddenfolder` to be ignored.
To mount a directory starting with a dot, put a `/` at the start of its definition:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
mounts:
  '/.myhiddenfolder':
    source: local
    source_path: 'myhiddenfolder'
```

##### Disk space issues

If you are worried about how much disk your mounts are using, check the size with the following command:

```bash
platform mount:size
```

You see the total size and what's available for each directory:

```text
Checking disk usage for all mounts on abcdefg123456-main-abcd123--app@ssh.eu.platform.sh...
+-------------------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-----------+----------+
| Mount(s)                | Size(s)   | Disk    | Used      | Available | Capacity |
+-------------------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-----------+----------+
| private                 | 55.2 MiB  | 1.9 GiB | 301.5 MiB | 1.6 GiB   | 15.5%    |
| tmp                     | 8.3 GiB   | 8.9 GiB | 8.8 GiB   | 93.0 MiB  | 98.8%    |
| web/sites/default/files | 212.2 MiB | 9.6 GiB | 1.9 GiB   | 7.6 GiB   | 20.3%    |
+-------------------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-----------+----------+
```
### Upgrading

##### Changes in version 2022.02

* The cron `cmd` syntax is now deprecated in favor of `commands`.
  Previous cron job definitions looked like this:

  ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
  crons:
    sendemails:
      spec: '*/7 * * * *'
      cmd: cd public && send-pending-emails.sh
  ```

  They should now be written like this:

  ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
  crons:
    sendemails:
      spec: '*/7 * * * *'
      commands:
        start: cd public && send-pending-emails.sh
  ```

  The new syntax offers greater flexibility and configuration.
  For more details, see the [full specification for cron jobs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).

##### Changes in version 2019.05

* The `!archive` tag in YAML has been un-deprecated, and is now favored over the `!include` option. `!include` is still available for other include types (`yaml`, `binary`, and `string`).

##### Changes in version 2017.11 (2017-11-09)

* The `!archive` tag in YAML files is now deprecated in favor of the more generic [`!include`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/yaml.md).
For example, the following `.platform/services.yaml` snippet:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
    mysearch:
      type: solr:6.3
      disk: 1024
      configuration:
        core_config: !archive "myconfdir"
    ```

    Can now be written as:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
    mysearch:
      type: solr:6.3
      disk: 1024
      configuration:
        core_config: !include
          type: archive
          path: "myconfdir"
    ```

* The syntax for the `mounts` key in `.platform.app.yaml` has changed.
Rather than a parsed string, the value of each mount is a [multi-key definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).
That is, the following example:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    mounts:
      "tmp": "shared:files/tmp"
      "logs": "shared:files/logs"
     ```

    Can now be written as:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    mounts:
      tmp:
        source: local
        source_path: tmp
      logs:
        source: local
        source_path: logs

    ```

##### Changes in version 2016.6 (2016-11-18)

* Application containers now include the latest LTS version of Node.js, 6.9.1. The previously included version was 4.6.1.
* Composer was briefly called with `--no-dev`, but as of 2016-11-21 this change has been reverted, because of the unintended effect it had on projects using the Symfony framework.

##### Changes in version 2016.5

As of October 2016, the default behaviour of the `expires` key, which controls
client-side caching of static files, has changed. Previously, if the key was
unset, the `Expires` and `Cache-Control` HTTP headers were left unset in the
response, which meant that client side caching behaviour was left undefined.

To ensure consistent behaviour that doesn't depend on which browser the client
is using, the new default behaviour is to set these headers to values that
disable client-side caching. This change only affects static files served
directly by the web server. Responses served from `passthru` URLs continue to use
whatever caching headers were set by the application.

To enable caching on your static files, make sure you include an `expires` key in your [web configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), as shown below:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      root: "public"
      passthru: "/index.php"
      index:
        - index.php
      expires: 300
      scripts: true
      allow: true
      rules:
        \.mp4$:
          allow: false
          expires: -1
    "/sites/default/files":
      expires: 300
      passthru: true
      allow: true
```

##### Changes in version 2016.4

As of July 2016, we no longer create default configuration files if one isn't provided.
The defaults we used to provide were tailored specifically for Drupal 7, which is now a legacy-support version with the release of Drupal 8 and not especially useful for non-Drupal or non-PHP sites.
They also defaulted to software versions that are no longer current and recommended.
Instead, you must provide your own `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/routes.yaml`, and `.platform/services.yaml` files.

Additionally, a version for a language or service should always be specified as well. That allows you to control when you upgrade from one version to another without relying on a network default.

The previous default files, for reference, are:

###### Application

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: php
type: "php:5.4"
build:
  flavor: "drupal"
access:
  ssh: contributor
relationships:
  database: "mysql:mysql"
  solr: "solr:solr"
  redis: "redis:redis"
web:
  document_root: "/"
  passthru: "/index.php"
disk: 2048
mounts:
  "public/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"
  "tmp": "shared:files/tmp"
  "private": "shared:files/private"
crons:
  drupal:
    spec: "*/20 * * * *"
    cmd: "cd public ; drush core-cron"
```

###### Routes

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"http://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "php:http"
  cache:
    enabled: true
  ssi:
    enabled: false

"http://www.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "http://{default}/"
```

###### Services

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mysql:
  type: mysql:5.5
  disk: 2048

redis:
  type: redis:2.8

solr:
  type: solr:3.6
  disk: 1024
 ```

##### Changes in version 2016.3

As we are aiming to always provide you more control and flexibility on how to deploy your applications, the `.platform.app.yaml` format has been greatly improved. It is now way more flexible, and also much more explicit to describe what you want to do.

The `web` key is now a set of `locations` where you can define very precisely the behavior of each URL prefix.

Note, we no longer move your application from "/" to "public/" automatically if the new format is adopted.
If you are using Drupal, move all of your Drupal files into "public/" in the Git repository.

Old format:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  document_root: "/"
  passthru: "/index.php"
  index_files:
    - "index.php"
  expires: 300
  whitelist:
    - \.html$
```

New format:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      root: "public"
      passthru: "/index.php"
      index:
        - index.php
      expires: 300
      scripts: true
      allow: true
      rules:
        \.mp4$:
          allow: false
          expires: -1
    "/sites/default/files":
      expires: 300
      passthru: true
      allow: true
```

###### Backward compatibility

We generally try to keep backward compatibility with previous configuration formats. Here is what happens if you don't upgrade your configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  # The following parameters are automatically moved as a "/" block in the
  # "locations" object, and are invalid if there is a valid "locations" block.
  document_root: "/public"      # Converted to [locations][/][root]
  passthru: "/index.php"        # Converted to [locations][/][passthru]
  index_files:
      - index.php               # Converted to [locations][/][index]
  whitelist: [ ]                # Converted to [locations][/][rules]
  blacklist: [ ]                # Converted to [locations][/][rules]
  expires: 3d                   # Converted to [locations][/][expires]
```

##### Changes in version 2015.7

The `.platform.app.yaml` configuration file now allows for a much clearer syntax, which you can (and should) start using now.

The old format had a single string to identify the `toolstack` you use:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
toolstack: "php:drupal"
```

The new syntax allows to separate the concerns of what language you are running
and the build process that is going to happen on deployment:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: php
build:
  flavor: drupal
```
Currently we only support `php` in the 'type' key. Current supported build
flavors are `drupal`, `composer` and `symfony`.

##### Changes in version 2014.9

This version introduces changes in
the configuration files format. Most of the old configuration format is
still supported, but customers are invited to move to the new format.

For an example upgrade path, see the [Drupal 7.x branch of the
`platformsh-examples`
repository](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal7/blob/master/.platform.app.yaml)
on GitHub.

Configuration items for PHP that previously was part of
`.platform/services.yaml` are now moved into `.platform.app.yaml`, which
gains the following top-level items:

-   `name`: should be `"php"`
-   `relationships`, `access` and `disk`: should be the same as the
    `relationships` key of PHP in `.platform/services.yaml`

Note that there is now a sane default for `access` (SSH access to PHP is
granted to all users that have role "collaborator" and above on the
environment) so most customers can now just omit this key in
`.platform.app.yaml`.

In addition, version 1.7.0 now has consistency checks for configuration
files and rejects `git push` operations that contain configuration
files that are invalid. In this case, just fix the issues as they are
reported, commit and push again.
### Use build and deploy hooks

As your app goes through the [build and deploy process](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md),
you might want to run custom commands.
These might include compiling the app, setting the configuration for services based on variables, and rebuilding search indexes.
Do these tasks using one of [three hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md).

The following example goes through each of these hooks for the [Next.js Drupal template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal).
This template uses [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) as the headless CMS backend
and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend.
It's largely based on the [Next.js for Drupal project](https://next-drupal.org/)

The example commands are somewhat simplified, but you can find them all in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal).

In this case, you have [two apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) and so two [`.platform.app.yaml` configuration files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).
Each file is in the folder for that app: `api` for Drupal and `client` for Next.js.
You run one hook for Drupal and two hooks for Next.js.

##### Build dependencies

The Next.js app uses Yarn for dependencies, which need to be installed.
Installing dependencies requires writing to disk and doesn't need any relationships with other services.
This makes it perfect for a `build` hook.

In this case, the app has two sets of dependencies:

* For the main app
* For a script to test connections between the apps

Create your `build` hook to install them all:

1. Create a `build` hook in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md):

   ```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml" }
   hooks:
     build: |
       set -e
   ```

   The hook has two parts so far:

   * The `|` means the lines that follow can contain a series of commands.
     They aren't interpreted as new YAML properties.
   * Adding `set -e` means that the hook fails if _any_ of the commands in it fails.
     Without this setting, the hook fails only if its _final_ command fails.

     If a `build` hook fails for any reason, the build is aborted and the deploy doesn't happen.
     Note that this only works for `build` hooks.
     If other hooks fail, the deploy still happens.
2. Install your top-level dependencies inside this `build` hook:

  ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     build: |
       set -e
       yarn --frozen-lockfile
   ```

   This installs all the dependencies for the main app.

3. Copy the [testing script from the template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal/tree/master/client/platformsh-scripts/test/next-drupal-debug).
   Copy the files in this directory into a `client/platformsh-scripts/test` directory.
   This script debugs the connection between Next.js and Drupal.
4. In the hook, switch to the directory with the testing script.
   Each hook starts in the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
   In this case, the app root is `client`.
   To run commands from a different directory, you need to change directories (relative to the app root):

   ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     build: |
       set -e
       yarn --frozen-lockfile

       cd platformsh-scripts/test
   ```

5. Install the dependencies for the testing script:

   ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     build: |
       set -e
       yarn --frozen-lockfile

       cd platformsh-scripts/test
       yarn --frozen-lockfile
   ```

Now all your Next.js dependencies are installed.

##### Configure Drush and Drupal

The example uses [Drush](https://www.drush.org/latest/) to handle routine tasks.
For its configuration, Drush needs the URL of the site.
That means the configuration can't be done in the `build` hook.
During the `build` hook, the site isn't yet deployed and so there is no URL to use in the configuration.
(The [`PLATFORM_ROUTES` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) isn't available.)

Add the configuration during the `deploy` hook.
This way you can access the URL before the site accepts requests (unlike in the `post_deploy` hook).

The script also prepares your environment to handle requests,
such as by [rebuilding the cache](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/cache_rebuild/)
and [updating the database](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/updatedb/).
Because these steps should be done before the site accepts request, they should be in the `deploy` hook.

All of this configuration and preparation can be handled in a bash script.

1. Copy the [preparation script from the Upsun Fixed template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal/blob/master/api/platformsh-scripts/hooks.deploy.sh)
   into a file called `hooks.deploy.sh` in a `api/platformsh-scripts` directory.
   Note that hooks are executed using the dash shell, not the bash shell used by SSH logins.
2. Copy the [Drush configuration script from the template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal/blob/master/api/drush/platformsh_generate_drush_yml.php)
   into a `drush/platformsh_generate_drush_yml.php` file.
3. Set a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).
   Unlike in the `build` hook, in the `deploy` hook the system is generally read-only.
   So create a mount where you can write the Drush configuration:

   ```yaml  {location="api/.platform.app.yaml"}
   mounts:
     /.drush:
       source: storage
       source_path: 'drush'
   ```

4. Add a `deploy` hook that runs the preparation script:

   ```yaml  {location="api/.platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     deploy: !include
       type: string
       path: platformsh-scripts/hooks.deploy.sh
   ```

   This `!include` syntax tells the hook to process the script as if it were included in the YAML file directly.
   This helps with longer and more complicated scripts.

##### Get data from Drupal to Next.js

This Next.js app generates a static site.
Often, you would generate the site for Next.js in a `build` hook.
In this case, you first need to get data from Drupal to Next.js.

This means you need to wait until Drupal is accepting requests
and there is a relationship between the two apps.
So the `post_deploy` hook is the perfect place to build your Next.js site.

You can also redeploy the site every time content changes in Drupal.
On redeploys, only the `post_deploy` hook runs,
meaning the Drupal build is reused and Next.js is built again.
So you don't have to rebuild Drupal but you still get fresh content.

1. Set a relationship for Next.js with Drupal.
   This allows the Next.js app to make requests and receive data from the Drupal app.

   ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   relationships:
     api:
       service: 'api'
       endpoint: 'http'
   ```

2. Set [mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).
   Like the [`deploy` hook](#configure-drush-and-drupal), the `post_deploy` hook has a read-only file system.
   Create mounts for your Next.js files:

   ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   mounts:
     /.cache:
       source: local
       source_path: 'cache'
     /.next:
       source: local
       source_path: 'next'
     /.pm2:
       source: local
       source_path: 'pm2'
     deploy:
       source: service
       service: files
       source_path: deploy
   ```

3. Add a `post_deploy` hook that first tests the connection between the apps:

   ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     post_deploy: |
       . deploy/platformsh.environment
       cd platformsh-scripts/test && yarn debug
   ```

   Note that you could add `set -e` here, but even if the job fails, the build/deployment itself can still be counted as successful.

4. Then build the Next.js site:

   ```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     post_deploy: |
       . deploy/platformsh.environment
       cd platformsh-scripts/test && yarn debug

       cd $PLATFORM_APP_DIR && yarn build
   ```

   The `$PLATFORM_APP_DIR` variable represents the app root and can always get you back there.

##### Final hooks

You can find the complete [Drupal configuration](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal/blob/master/api/.platform.app.yaml)
and [Next.js configuration](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/nextjs-drupal/blob/master/client/.platform.app.yaml)
on GitHub.
The following shows only the parts necessary for the hooks.

###### Drupal

```yaml  {location="api/.platform.app.yaml"}
# The name of this app. Must be unique within the project.
name: 'drupal'

# The runtime the app uses.
type: 'php:8.1'

dependencies:
  php:
    composer/composer: '^2'

# The relationships of the app with services or other apps.
relationships:
  database:
    service: 'db'
    endpoint: 'mysql'
  redis:
    service: 'cache'
    endpoint: 'redis'

# The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the app.
hooks:
  deploy: !include
    type: string
    path: platformsh-scripts/hooks.deploy.sh

# The size of the persistent disk of the app (in MB).
disk: 2048

# The 'mounts' describe writable, persistent filesystem mounts in the app.
mounts:
  /.drush:
    source: local
    source_path: 'drush'
  /drush-backups:
    source: local
    source_path: 'drush-backups'
  deploy:
    source: service
    service: files
    source_path: deploy
```

###### Next.js

```yaml  {location="client/.platform.app.yaml"}
# The name of this app, which must be unique within the project.
name: 'nextjs'

# The type key specifies the language and version for your app.
type: 'nodejs:14'

dependencies:
  nodejs:
    yarn: "1.22.17"
    pm2: "5.2.0"

build:
  flavor: none

relationships:
  api:
    service: 'api'
    endpoint: 'http'

# The hooks that are triggered when the package is deployed.
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    yarn --frozen-lockfile # Install dependencies for the main app

    cd platformsh-scripts/test
    yarn --frozen-lockfile # Install dependencies for the testing script
    # Next.js's build is delayed to the post_deploy hook, when Drupal is available for requests.
  post_deploy: |
    . deploy/platformsh.environment
    cd platformsh-scripts/test && yarn debug

    cd $PLATFORM_APP_DIR && yarn build

# The size of the persistent disk of the app (in MB).
disk: 512

mounts:
  /.cache:
    source: local
    source_path: 'cache'
  /.next:
    source: local
    source_path: 'next'
  /.pm2:
    source: local
    source_path: 'pm2'
  deploy:
    source: service
    service: files
    source_path: deploy
```
#### Change hooks in different environments

You might have certain commands you want to run only in certain environments.
For example enabling detailed logging in preview environments
or purging your CDN cache for production environments.

The `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks can access all [runtime environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
Use this to vary those hooks based on the environment.

Check the `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` variable to see if it's in a production environment:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  deploy: |
    if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
      # Run commands only when deploying to production
    else
      # Run commands only when deploying to development or staging environments
    fi
    # Commands to run regardless of the environment
```
#### Comparison of hooks

The following table presents the main differences among the three available hooks:

| Hook name     | Failures stop build | Variables available | Services available | Timeout | Run on `worker` instances | Writable directories | Blocks requests | Runs on all redeploys\* |
| ------------- | ------------------- |-------------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `build`       | Yes                 | Build variables     | No                 | 1 hour  | Yes                       | `$PLATFORM_APP_DIR`, `$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR`, and `/tmp` | No  | No  |
| `deploy`      | No                  | Runtime variables   | Yes                | None    | No                        | [Mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts)                   | Yes | No  |
| `post_deploy` | No                  | Runtime variables   | Yes                | None    | No                        | [Mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts)                   | No  | Yes |

\* All of the hooks run with changes to the code or environment.
This column indicates which hooks run on a redeploy without any code changes.

###### Build hook

The `build` hook is run after any [build flavor](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#build).
During this hook, no services (such as a database) or any persistent file mounts are available
as the application hasn't yet been deployed.

The `build` hook can access only the variables that are available at build time: 
  - Variables provided by Upsun Fixed, as listed in [this table](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) (see the **Build** column) 
  - User-defined project-level or environment-specific build-time variables (**Available during buildtime** is set in the console or the `--visible-build=true` option was set by using the CLI)  

During the `build` hook, there are three writeable directories:

- `$PLATFORM_APP_DIR`:
  This is where your code is checked out and is the working directory when the `build` hook starts.
  The contents of this directory after the build hook is the application that gets deployed.
- `$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR`:
  This directory persists between builds, but isn't deployed as part of your application.
  It's a good place for temporary build artifacts that can be reused between builds.
  It's shared by all builds on all branches.
- `/tmp`:
  The temp directory is also useful for writing files that aren't needed in the final application,
  but it's wiped between each build.
  Note that `$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR` is mapped to `/tmp`
  and together they offer about 8GB of free space.

The only constraint on what can be downloaded during a `build` hook is the disk space available for builds.

This is _not_ the `disk` specified in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#top-level-properties).

If you exceed this limit, you receive a `No space left on device` error.
See how to [troubleshoot this error](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/troubleshoot-disks.md#no-space-left-on-device).

The `build` hook runs only when the app or its runtime (variables and such) have changed.
Redeploys with no changes trigger only the `post_deploy` hook.
If you need the `build` hook to run, [manually trigger a build](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#manually-trigger-builds).

Each hook is executed as a single script, so they're considered to have failed only if the final command in them fails.
To cause them to fail on the first failed command, add `set -e` to the beginning of the hook.
If a `build` hook fails for any reason, the build is aborted and the deploy doesn't happen.
Note that this only works for `build` hooks.
If other hooks fail, the deploy still happens.

####### Timeout

Build hooks automatically time out if they run for 1 hour.
So if you accidentally add an unbroken loop, it gets cut off and you can continue with other activities.

###### Deploy hook

The `deploy` hook is run after the app container has been started but before it has started accepting requests.
Note that the deploy hook only runs on [`web` instances](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web),
not [`worker` instances](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers).

You can access other services at this stage (such as MySQL, Solr, Redis).
The disk where the application lives is read-only at this point.

This hook should be used when something needs to run once when new code is deployed.
It isn't run when a host is restarted (such as during region maintenance),
so anything that needs to run each time an instance of an app starts (regardless of whether there's new code)
should go in the `pre_start` key in [your `web` configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web-commands).
For example, clearing the cache.

Be aware: The deploy hook blocks the site accepting new requests.
If your `deploy` hook is only a few seconds,
incoming requests in that time are paused and continue when the hook is finished.
So it effectively appears as if the site just took a few extra seconds to respond.
If the hook takes too long, requests can't be held and appear as dropped connections.
Only run tasks in your deploy hook that have to be run exclusively,
such as database schema updates or some types of cache clear (those where the code must match what's on the disk).
A task that can safely run concurrently with new incoming requests should be run as a `post_deploy` hook instead.

After a Git push, in addition to the log shown in the activity log,
the execution of the `deploy` hook is logged in the [deploy log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#container-logs).
For example:

```bash
[2022-03-01 08:27:25.495579] Launching command 'bash export-config.sh'.

🔥 Successfully cleared configuration
🚀 Added new configuration details
```

Your `deploy` hook is tied to commits in the same way as your builds.
Once a commit has been pushed and a new build image has been created,
the result of both the `build` and `deploy` hooks are reused until there is a new git commit.
Redeploys with no changes trigger only the `post_deploy` hook.
If you need the `deploy` hook to run, [manually trigger a build](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#manually-trigger-builds).

###### Post-deploy hook

The `post_deploy` hook functions exactly the same as the `deploy` hook,
but after the container is accepting connections.
It runs concurrently with normal incoming traffic.
That makes it well suited to any updates that don't require exclusive database access.

What's "safe" to run in a `post_deploy` hook vs. in a `deploy` hook varies by the application.
Often times content imports, some types of cache warmups, and other such tasks are good candidates for a `post_deploy` hook.

In addition to the activity log, the `post_deploy` hook logs to the [post-deploy log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#container-logs).

The `post_deploy` hook is the only hook that runs during a redeploy.
#### Use hooks with dependencies

If you use a specific package in a hook, you may want to manage dependencies for it.
For example, you may want to compile Sass files as part of your build process.
You can set dependencies along with hooks in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#dependencies).

The following example assumes you have some Sass source files, such as a `index.scss` file.
You also need a script to compile the files, such as the following:

```json  {location="package.json"}
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-css": "sass index.scss css/index.css"
  },
}
```

Set your app configuration to have Sass available globally and use it:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# Ensure sass is available globally
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    sass: "^1.47.0"

hooks:
  # Run the script defined in package.json
  build: |
    npm run build-css
```
### Work with workers

Workers are instances of your code that aren't open to connections from other apps or services or the outside world.
They're good for handling background tasks.
See how to [configure a worker](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers) for your app.

Note that to have enough resources to support a worker and a service, you need at least a [Medium
 plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#multiple-apps-in-a-single-project).

##### Access the worker container

Like with any other application container,
Upsun Fixed allows you to connect to the worker instance through SSH to inspect logs and interact with it.

Use the `--worker` switch in the Upsun Fixed CLI, like so:

```bash
platform ssh --worker=queue
```

##### Stopping a worker

If a worker instance needs to be updated during a new deployment,
a `SIGTERM` signal is first sent to the worker process to allow it to shut down gracefully.
If your worker process can't be interrupted mid-task, make sure it reacts to `SIGTERM` to pause its work gracefully.

If the process is still running after 15 seconds, a `SIGKILL` message is sent that force-terminates the worker process,
allowing the container to be shut down and restarted.

To restart a worker manually, [access the container](#access-the-worker-container) and run the following commands:

```bash
sv stop app
sv start app
```

##### Workers vs cron jobs

Worker instances don't run cron jobs.
Instead, both worker instances and cron tasks address similar use cases.
They both address out-of-band work that an application needs to do
but that shouldn't or can't be done as part of a normal web request.
They do so in different ways and so are fit for different use cases.

A cron job is well suited for tasks when:

* They need to happen on a fixed schedule, not continually.
* The task itself isn't especially long, as a running cron job blocks a new deployment.
* It's long but can be divided into many small queued tasks.
* A delay between when a task is registered and when it actually happens is acceptable.

A dedicated worker instance is a better fit if:

* Tasks should happen "now", but not block a web request.
* Tasks are large enough that they risk blocking a deploy, even if they're subdivided.
* The task in question is a continually running process rather than a stream of discrete units of work.

The appropriateness of one approach over the other also varies by language;
single-threaded languages would benefit more from either cron or workers than a language with native multi-threading, for instance.
If a given task seems like it would run equally well as a worker or as a cron,
cron is generally more efficient as it doesn't require its own container.

##### Commands

The `commands` key defines the command to launch the worker application.
For now there is only a single command, `start`, but more will be added in the future.
The `commands.start` property is required.

The `start` key specifies the command to use to launch your worker application.
It may be any valid shell command, although most often it runs a command in your application in the language of your application.
If the command specified by the `start` key terminates, it's restarted automatically.

Note that [`deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md) as well as [`cron` commands](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons)
run only on the [`web`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web) container, not on workers.

##### Inheritance

Any top-level definitions for [`size`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#sizes), [`relationships`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships),
[`access`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#access), [`disk`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), [`mount`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts), and [`variables`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#variables)
are inherited by every worker, unless overridden explicitly.

That means, for example, that the following two `.platform.app.yaml` definitions produce identical workers.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: python:3.13
disk: 256
mounts:
  test:
    source: local
    source_path: test
relationships:
  mysql:
workers:
  queue:
    commands:
      start: |
        python queue-worker.py
  mail:
    commands:
      start: |
        python mail-worker.py
```
```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: python:3.13
workers:
  queue:
    commands:
      start: |
        python queue-worker.py
    disk: 256
    mounts:
      test:
        source: local
        source_path: test
    relationships:
      mysql:
  mail:
    commands:
      start: |
        python mail-worker.py
    disk: 256
    mounts:
      test:
        source: local
        source_path: test
    relationships:
      mysql:
```

In both cases, there are two worker instances named `queue` and `mail`.
Both have access to a MySQL/MariaDB service defined in `.platform/services.yaml` named `mysqldb` through the `database` relationship.
Both also have their own separate, independent local disk mount at `/app/test` with 256 MB of allowed space.

##### Customizing a worker

The most common properties to set in a worker to override the top-level settings are `size` and `variables`.
`size` lets you allocate fewer resources to a container that is running only a single background process
(unlike the web site which is handling many requests at once),
while `variables` lets you instruct the application to run differently as a worker than as a web site.

For example, consider the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mysql:
  type: "mariadb:11.8"
  disk: 2048
rabbitmq:
  type: rabbitmq:4.1
  disk: 512
```
```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: "python:3.13"
disk: 2048
hooks:
  build: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    pip install gunicorn
relationships:
  mysql:
  rabbitmq:
variables:
  env:
    type: 'none'
web:
  commands:
    start: "gunicorn -b $PORT project.wsgi:application"
  variables:
    env:
      type: 'web'
  mounts:
    uploads:
      source: local
      source_path: uploads
  locations:
    "/":
      root: ""
      passthru: true
      allow: false
    "/static":
      root: "static/"
      allow: true
workers:
  queue:
    size: 'M'
    commands:
      start: |
        python queue-worker.py
    variables:
      env:
        type: 'worker'
    disk: 512
    mounts:
      scratch:
        source: local
        source_path: scratch
  mail:
    size: 'S'
    commands:
      start: |
        python mail-worker.py
    variables:
      env:
        type: 'worker'
    disk: 256
    mounts: {}
    relationships:
      rabbitmq:
```

There's a lot going on here, but it's all reasonably straightforward.
The configuration in `.platform.app.yaml` takes a single Python 3.13 code base from your repository,
downloads all dependencies in `requirements.txt`, and then installs Gunicorn.
That artifact (your code plus the downloaded dependencies) is deployed as three separate container instances, all running Python 3.13.

The `web` instance starts a Gunicorn process to serve a web application.

- It runs the Gunicorn process to serve web requests, defined by the `project/wsgi.py` file which contains an `application` definition.
- It has an environment variable named `TYPE` with value `web`.
- It has a writable mount at `/app/uploads` with a maximum space of 2048 MB.
- It has access to both a MySQL database and a RabbitMQ server, both of which are defined in `.platform/services.yaml`.
- Upsun Fixed automatically allocates resources to it as available on the plan, once all fixed-size containers are allocated.

The `queue` instance is a worker that isn't web-accessible.

- It runs the `queue-worker.py` script, and restart it automatically if it ever terminates.
- It has an environment variable named `TYPE` with value `worker`.
- It has a writable mount at `/app/scratch` with a maximum space of 512 MB.
- It has access to both a MySQL database and a RabbitMQ server,
  both of which are defined in `.platform/services.yaml` (because it doesn't specify otherwise).
- It has "Medium" levels of CPU and RAM allocated to it, always.

The `mail` instance is a worker that isn't web-accessible.

- It runs the `mail-worker.py` script, and restart it automatically if it ever terminates.
- It has an environment variable named `TYPE` with value `worker`.
- It has no writable file mounts at all.
- It has access only to the RabbitMQ server, through a different relationship name than on the `web` instance.
  It has no access to MySQL.
- It has "Small" levels of CPU and RAM allocated to it, always.

This way, the web instance has a large upload space, the queue instance has a small amount of scratch space for temporary files,
and the mail instance has no persistent writable disk space at all as it doesn't need it.
The mail instance also doesn't need any access to the SQL database so for security reasons it has none.
The workers have known fixed sizes, while web can scale to as large as the plan allows.
Each instance can also check the `TYPE` environment variable to detect how it's running
and, if appropriate, vary its behavior accordingly.

### Elasticsearch (Search service)

Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud.

See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.md) for more information.

##### Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Drupal](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/elasticsearch.md)
- [Jakarta EE](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/jakarta/deploy.md#elasticsearch)
- [Micronaut](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/elasticsearch.md)
- [Quarkus](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/elasticsearch.md)
- [Spring](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/elasticsearch.md)

##### Supported versions

**Premium Service**: 

Elasticsearch versions 7.11 or later are no longer included in any Upsun Fixed plan.
You need to add it separately at an additional cost.
To add Elasticsearch, [contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us).

The following premium versions are supported:

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 8.5

   - 7.17

   - 7.2

   - 7.5

   - 7.6

   - 7.7

   - 7.9

   - 7.10

   - 7.17

   - 8.5

   - 8.8

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like.
When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

##### Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects for free,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 7.10

   - 7.9

   - 7.7

   - 7.5

   - 7.2

   - 6.8

   - 6.8

   - 6.5

   - 5.6

   - 5.2

   - 2.4

   - 1.7

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to [a premium version](#supported-versions).

Alternatively, you can switch to one of the latest, free versions of [OpenSearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/opensearch.md).
To do so, follow the same procedure as for [upgrading](#upgrading).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": null,
  "scheme": "http",
  "service": "elasticsearch",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.elasticsearch.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 9200,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "elasticsearch.internal",
  "rel": "elasticsearch",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "type": "elasticsearch:8.5",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

For [premium versions](#supported-versions), the service type is `elasticsearch-enterprise`.

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `elasticsearch` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: elasticsearch:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

If you’re using a [premium version](add-services/elasticsearch.md#supported-versions), use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type instead.

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: elasticsearch
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
elasticsearch:
  type: elasticsearch:8.5
  disk: 256
```

If you're using a [premium version](add-services/elasticsearch.md#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type in the service definition.

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  elasticsearch:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  elasticsearch:
    service: elasticsearch
    endpoint: elasticsearch
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

Note that configuration for [premium versions](#supported-versions) may differ slightly.

```js {}
const elasticsearch = require("elasticsearch");
const config = require("platformsh-config").config();

exports.usageExample = async function () {
    const credentials = config.credentials("elasticsearch");

    const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
        host: `${credentials.host}:${credentials.port}`,
    });

    const index = "my_index";
    const type = "People";

    // Index a few document.
    const names = ["Ada Lovelace", "Alonzo Church", "Barbara Liskov"];

    const message = {
        refresh: "wait_for",
        body: names.flatMap((name) => [
            { index: { _index: index, _type: type } },
            { name },
        ]),
    };

    await client.bulk(message);

    // Search for documents.
    const response = await client.search({
        index,
        q: "name:Barbara Liskov",
    });

    const outputRows = response.hits.hits
        .map(
            ({ _id: id, _source: { name } }) =>
                `<tr><td>${id}</td><td>${name}</td></tr>\n`
        )
        .join("\n");

    // Clean up after ourselves.
    await Promise.allSettled(
        response.hits.hits.map(({ _id: id }) =>
            client.delete({
                index: index,

                id,
            })
        )
    );

    return `

**Note**: 

When you create an index on Elasticsearch,
don’t specify the ``number_of_shards`` or ``number_of_replicas`` settings in your Elasticsearch API call.
These values are set automatically based on available resources.

##### Authentication

By default, Elasticsearch has no authentication.
No username or password is required to connect to it.

Starting with Elasticsearch 7.2 you may optionally enable HTTP Basic authentication.
To do so, include the following in your `.platform/services.yaml` configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
elasticsearch:
  type: elasticsearch:8.5
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    authentication:
      enabled: true
```

If you're using a [premium version](#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type.

That enables mandatory HTTP Basic auth on all requests.
The credentials are available in any relationships that point at that service,
in the `username` and `password` properties.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

This functionality is generally not required if Elasticsearch isn't exposed on its own public HTTP route.
However, certain applications may require it, or it allows you to safely expose Elasticsearch directly to the web.
To do so, add a route to `.platform/routes.yaml` that has `elasticsearch:elasticsearch` as its upstream
(where `elasticsearch` is whatever you named the service).

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://es.{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "elasticsearch:elasticsearch"
```

##### Plugins

Elasticsearch offers a number of plugins.
To enable them, list them under the `configuration.plugins` key in your `.platform/services.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
elasticsearch:
  type: elasticsearch:8.5
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    plugins:
      - analysis-icu
```

If you're using a [premium version](#supported-versions),
use the `elasticsearch-enterprise` type.

In this example you'd have the ICU analysis plugin and Python script support plugin.

If there is a publicly available plugin you need that isn't listed here, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

###### Plugin removal

Removing plugins previously added in your `.platform/services.yaml` file doesn't automatically uninstall them from your Elasticsearch instances.
This is deliberate, as removing a plugin may result in data loss or corruption of existing data that relied on that plugin.
Removing a plugin usually requires reindexing.

To permanently remove a previously enabled plugin,
[upgrade the service](#upgrading) to create a new instance of Elasticsearch and migrate to it.
In most cases it isn't necessary as an unused plugin has no appreciable impact on the server.

##### Upgrading

The Elasticsearch data format sometimes changes between versions in incompatible ways.
Elasticsearch doesn't include a data upgrade mechanism as it's expected that all indexes can be regenerated from stable data if needed.
To upgrade (or downgrade) Elasticsearch, use a new service from scratch.

There are two ways to do so.

###### Destructive

In your `.platform/services.yaml` file, change the version *and* name of your Elasticsearch service.
Be sure to also update the reference to the now changed service name in its corresponding application's `relationship` block.

When you push that to Upsun Fixed, the old service is deleted and a new one with the new name is created with no data.
You can then have your application reindex data as appropriate.

This approach has the downsides of temporarily having an empty Elasticsearch instance,
which your application may or may not handle gracefully, and needing to rebuild your index afterward.
Depending on the size of your data that could take a while.

###### Transitional

With a transitional approach, you temporarily have two Elasticsearch services.
Add a second Elasticsearch service with the new version, a new name, and give it a new relationship in `.platform.app.yaml`.
You can optionally run in that configuration for a while to allow your application to populate indexes in the new service as well.

Once you're ready to switch over, remove the old Elasticsearch service and relationship.
You may optionally have the new Elasticsearch service use the old relationship name if that's easier for your app to handle.
Your application is now using the new Elasticsearch service.

This approach has the benefit of never being without a working Elasticsearch instance.
On the downside, it requires two running Elasticsearch servers temporarily,
each of which consumes resources and needs adequate disk space.
Depending on the size of your data, that may be a lot of disk space.

### Gotenberg

Gotenberg is a stateless API for converting various document formats into PDF files.
For more information, see the [Gotenberg documentation](https://gotenberg.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction).

##### Supported versions

- 8

You can select the major version. But the latest compatible minor version is applied automatically and can’t be overridden.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like.
When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

```json
{
  "host": "gotenberg.internal",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.gotenberg.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "service": "gotenberg",
  "rel": "http",
  "scheme": "http",
  "port": "3000",
  "type": "gotenberg:8",
  "instance_ips": [
    "123.456.78.90"
  ],
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "url": "http://gotenberg.internal:3000"
}
```

Here is an example of how to gather [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) information
in a [`.environment` file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#use-env-files):

```bash  {location=".environment"}
# Decode the built-in credentials object variable.
export RELATIONSHIPS_JSON="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode)"

# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
export APP_GOTENBERG_HOST=="$(echo "$RELATIONSHIPS_JSON" | jq -r '.gotenberg[0].host')"
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `gotenberg` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: gotenberg:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost. Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the ``http`` endpoint:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
With the above definition, Upsun Fixed uses the ``http`` endpoint,
providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of the service.
The application has access to the service via this relationship and its corresponding ``PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`` [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: http
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

The `http` endpoint uses port `3000` by default.

###### Example configuration

####### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
gotenberg:
  type: gotenberg:8
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
relationships:
  gotenberg:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  gotenberg:
    service: gotenberg
    endpoint: http
```

##### Generate a PDF using Gotenberg

As an example, to generate a PDF file of the Upsun Fixed website, run the following cURL command:

```bash  {location="Terminal"}
curl \
--request POST http://yduimhaby523ase4lju3qhimre.gotenberg8.service._.eu-3.platformsh.site/forms/chromium/convert/url \
--form url=https://upsun.com \
--form landscape=true \
--form marginTop=1 \
--form marginBottom=1 \
-o my.pdf
```
### Headless Chrome

Headless Chrome is a headless browser that can be configured on projects like any other service on Upsun Fixed.

You can interact with the `chrome-headless` service container using Puppeteer, a Node.js library that provides an API to control Chrome over the DevTools Protocol.

Puppeteer can be used to generate PDFs and screenshots of web pages, automate form submission, and test your project's UI. You can find out more information about using Puppeteer on [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) or in their [documentation](https://pptr.dev/).

##### Supported versions

You can select the major version. But the latest compatible minor version is applied automatically and can’t be overridden.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like.
When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |

##### Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream.

   - 73

   - 80

   - 81

   - 83

   - 84

   - 86

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to a [supported version](#supported-versions).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "service": "chrome-headless",
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.chrome-headless.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiop-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "chrome-headless.internal",
  "rel": "http",
  "scheme": "http",
  "type": "chrome-headless:120",
  "port": 9222
}
```

##### Requirements

Puppeteer requires at least Node.js version 6.4.0, while using the async and await examples below requires Node 7.6.0 or greater.

If your app container uses a language other than Node.js, upgrade the Node.js version before using Puppeteer.
See how to [manage your Node.js version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs/node-version.md).

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `chrome-headless` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: chrome-headless:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: http
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).

relationships:
  chrome-headless:
    service: chrome-headless
    endpoint: http
```

###### Use in app

After configuration, include [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) as a dependency:

```bash {}
pnpm add puppeteer
```

```bash {}
yarn add puppeteer
```

Using the [Node.js Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app), you can retrieve formatted credentials for connecting to headless Chrome with Puppeteer:

```js
const platformsh = require('platformsh-config');

const config = platformsh.config();
const credentials = config.credentials('chromeheadless');
```

and use them to define the `browserURL` parameter of `puppeteer.connect()` within an `async` function:

```js
exports.getBrowser = async function (url) {
  try {
    // Connect to chrome-headless using pre-formatted puppeteer credentials
    const formattedURL = config.formattedCredentials('chromeheadless', 'puppeteer');
    const browser = await puppeteer.connect({browserURL: formattedURL});

    ...

    return browser

  } catch (error) {
    console.error({ error }, 'Something happened!');
    browser.close();
  }
};
```

Puppeteer allows your application to [create screenshots](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v13.0.1&show=api-pagescreenshotoptions), [emulate a mobile device](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v13.0.1&show=api-pageemulateoptions), [generate PDFs](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v13.0.1&show=api-pagepdfoptions), and much more.

You can find some useful examples of using headless Chrome and Puppeteer on Upsun Fixed on the Community Portal:

{
  "host": "influxdb.internal",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.influxdb.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-bvxea6i",
  "service": "influxdb",
  "type": "influxdb:2.7",
  "rel": "influxdb",
  "scheme": "http",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "port": 8086,
  "path": null,
  "query": {
    "org": "main",
    "bucket": "main",
    "api_token": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm1234567890"
  },
  "fragment": null,
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false,
  "instance_ips": [
    "123.456.78.90"
  ],
  "ip": "123.456.78.90"
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `influxdb` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: influxdb:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: influxdb
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
influxdb:
  type: influxdb:2.7
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  influxdb:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  influxdb:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: influxdb
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```yaml {}
# The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
  influxdb:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  influxdb:
    service: influxdb
    endpoint: influxdb
```

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
influxdb:
  type: influxdb:2.7
```

This configuration defines a single application (`myapp`), whose source code exists in the `<PROJECT_ROOT>/myapp` directory. 
`myapp` has access to the `influxdb` service, via a relationship whose name is [identical to the service name](#2-define-the-relationship)
(as per [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships).

From this, `myapp` can retrieve access credentials to the service through the environment variable `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`. That variable is a base64-encoded JSON object, but can be decoded at runtime (using the built-in tool `jq`) to provide more accessible environment variables to use within the application itself:

```bash  {location="myapp/.environment"}
# Decode the built-in credentials object variable.
export RELATIONSHIPS_JSON=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode)

# Set environment variables for common InfluxDB credentials.
export INFLUX_USER=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".influxdb[0].username")
export INFLUX_HOST=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".influxdb[0].host")
export INFLUX_ORG=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".influxdb[0].query.org")
export INFLUX_TOKEN=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".influxdb[0].query.api_token")
export INFLUX_BUCKET=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".influxdb[0].query.bucket")
```

The above file — `.environment` in the `myapp` directory — is automatically sourced by Upsun Fixed into the runtime environment, so that the variable `INFLUX_HOST` can be used within the application to connect to the service.

Note that `INFLUX_HOST` and all Upsun Fixed-provided environment variables like `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`, are environment-dependent. Unlike the build produced for a given commit, they can't be reused across environments and only allow your app to connect to a single service instance on a single environment.

A file very similar to this is generated automatically for your when using the `platform ify` command to [migrate a codebase to Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/get-started.md).

##### Export data

To export your data from InfluxDB, follow these steps:

1. Install and set up the [`influx` CLI](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/tools/influx-cli/).
2. Connect to your InfluxDB service with the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/_index.md):

   ```bash
   platform tunnel:single
   ```

   This opens an SSH tunnel to your InfluxDB service on your current environment and produces output like the following:

   ```bash
   SSH tunnel opened to <RELATIONSHIP_NAME> at: http://127.0.0.1:30000
   ```

3. Get the username, password and token from the [relationship](#relationship-reference) by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform relationships -P <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>
   ```

4. Adapt and run [InfluxDB's CLI export command](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.3/reference/cli/influx/backup/).

    ```bash
    influx backup --host <URL_FROM_STEP_2> --token <API_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_3>
    ```

##### Upgrade to version 2.3 or later

###### From a previous 2.x version

From version 2.3 onward, the structure of relationships changes.

If you're using a prior 2.x version, your app might currently rely on pulling the `bucket`, `org`, `api_token`,
or `user` values available in the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

If so, to ensure your upgrade is successful, make the following changes to your connection logic:

- Rename the `user` key to `username`.
- Move the `org`, `bucket` and `api_token` keys so they're contained in a dictionary under the `query` key.

If you're relying on any other attributes connecting to InfluxDB, they remain accessible as top-level keys from the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables), aside from those addressed above:

```json
{
  "host": "influxdb.internal",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.influxdb.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-bvxea6i",
  "service": "influxdb",
  "type": "influxdb:2.7",
  "rel": "influxdb",
  "scheme": "http",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "port": 8086,
  "path": null,
  "query": {
    "org": "main",
    "bucket": "main",
    "api_token": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm1234567890"
  },
  "fragment": null,
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90"
}
```

###### From a 1.x version

From version 2.3 onward, InfluxDB includes an upgrade utility that can convert databases from previous versions to version 2.3 or later.

To upgrade from a 1.x version to 2.3 or later,
change the service version in your `.platform/services.yaml` file and push your project.
Any existing data you had in your 1.x system is automatically upgraded for you into the 2.3+ system.

**Note**: 

During an upgrade from a 1.x version to a 2.3 version or later,
a new admin password and a new admin API token are automatically generated.
Previous credentials can’t be retained.

You can retrieve your new credentials through the [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) or by running ``platform relationships``.

### Kafka (Message queue service)

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform.

It is a framework for storing, reading and analyzing streaming data. See the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) for more information.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 3.7

   - 3.6

   - 3.4

   - 3.2

  None available

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "service": "kafka",
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.kafka.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiop-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "kafka.internal",
  "rel": "kafka",
  "scheme": "kafka",
  "type": "kafka:3.7",
  "port": 9092
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `kafka` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: kafka:<VERSION>
  disk: 512
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: kafka
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```python {}
from json import dumps
from json import loads
from kafka import KafkaConsumer, KafkaProducer
from platformshconfig import Config

def usage_example():
    # Create a new Config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
    # You can alternatively use os.environ yourself.
    config = Config()
    # Get the credentials to connect to the Kafka service.
    credentials = config.credentials('kafka')

    try:
        kafka_server = '{}:{}'.format(credentials['host'], credentials['port'])

        # Producer
        producer = KafkaProducer(
            bootstrap_servers=[kafka_server],
            value_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8')
        )
        for e in range(10):
            data = {'number' : e}
            producer.send('numtest', value=data)

        # Consumer
        consumer = KafkaConsumer(
            bootstrap_servers=[kafka_server],
            auto_offset_reset='earliest'
        )

        consumer.subscribe(['numtest'])

        output = ''
        # For demonstration purposes so it doesn't block.
        for e in range(10):
            message = next(consumer)
            output += str(loads(message.value.decode('UTF-8'))["number"]) + ', '

        # What a real implementation would do instead.
        # for message in consumer:
        #     output += loads(message.value.decode('UTF-8'))["number"]

        return output

    except Exception as e:
        return e

```
```ruby {}

##### With the ruby-kafka gem

# Producer
require "kafka"
kafka = Kafka.new(["kafka.internal:9092"], client_id: "my-application")
kafka.deliver_message("Hello, World!", topic: "greetings")

# Consumer
kafka.each_message(topic: "greetings") do |message|
  puts message.offset, message.key, message.value
end

```

The specific way to inject configuration into your application varies.
Consult your application or framework's documentation.
### MariaDB/MySQL (database service)

Upsun Fixed supports both MariaDB and Oracle MySQL to manage your relational databases.
Their infrastructure setup is nearly identical, though they differ in some features.
See the [MariaDB documentation](https://mariadb.org/documentation/)
or the Oracle [MySQL Server documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/) for more information.

**MariaDB note**: 

The [example](#mariadb-example) provided later in this topic is specific to using only a **primary** MariaDB database. For details about using read-only replicas to improve performance of read-heavy applications, see the [MariaDB read-only replication](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/mysql-readonly-replication.md) topic.

##### Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Hibernate](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/hibernate/deploy.md#mysql)
- [Jakarta EE](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/jakarta/deploy.md#mysql)
- [Spring](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/mysql.md)

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

**Note**: 

 - The service types ``mariadb`` and ``mysql`` both refer to MariaDB.
Aside from their ``type`` value, MySQL and MariaDB have the same behavior and information on this page applies to both of them.
 - The service type ``oracle-mysql`` refers to MySQL as released by Oracle, Inc.

| **`mariadb` / `mysql`** | **`oracle-mysql`** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
|  

   - 11.8

   - 11.4

   - 10.11

   - 10.6

 | 

   - 8.0

   - 5.7

 |

###### Supported versions on Dedicated environments

`oracle-mysql` is not yet available for Dedicated Gen 2 environments.

On Dedicated environments, MariaDB is available with Galera for replication.
Supported versions are the following:

| Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 11.4 Galera

   - 10.11 Galera

   - 10.6 Galera

   - 10.5 Galera

   - 10.4 Galera

Dedicated environments only support the InnoDB storage engine.
Tables created on Dedicated environments using the MyISAM storage engine don't replicate between all hosts in the cluster.
See how to [convert tables to the InnoDB engine](#storage-engine).

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they don't receive security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future – consider migrating to a [supported version](#supported-versions).

| **`mariadb` / `mysql`** | **`oracle-mysql`** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
|  

   - 11.2

   - 11.0

   - 10.5

   - 10.4

   - 10.3

   - 10.2

   - 10.1

   - 10.0

   - 5.5

###### Upgrade

When upgrading your service, skipping versions may result in data loss.
Upgrade sequentially from one supported version to another (10.6 -> 10.11 -> 11.4),
and check that each upgrade commit translates into an actual deployment.

To upgrade, update the service version in your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).

###### Change the service type

To change the service type:

1. [Export your data](#exporting-data).
   **Note**: 

Changing the service type, especially when done repeatedly, may result in data loss.
Backing up your data is therefore crucial.

2. Remove the old service from your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
3. Specify a new service type.
4. [Import your data](#importing-data) into the new service.

###### Downgrade

You can't downgrade to a previous version and retain your data.
To downgrade your database, follow these steps:

1. [Export your data](#exporting-data).
1. Remove the old service from your [service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
1. Add a new service with a different name and your desired version.
1. [Import your data](#importing-data) into the new service.

##### Usage example

Configure your service with at least 256 MB in disk space.

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `mariadb` or `mysql` type for MariaDB or the `oracle-mysql` type for Oracle MySQL:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: mariadb:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: mysql
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### MariaDB example

**Note**: 

Use the steps and sample code below if your application will connect to a **primary** MariaDB database. For details about using read-only replicas to improve performance of read-heavy applications, see the [MariaDB read-only replication](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/mysql-readonly-replication.md) topic.

####### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:

```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app,
add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```java {}

```

###### Configure connections

There may be cases where you want to configure a database connection manually.

To get the URL to connect to the database, run the following command:

```bash
platform relationships
```

The result is the complete [information for all relationships](#relationship-reference) with an additional `url` property.
Use the `url` property as your connection.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

You can also see a guide on how to [convert the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable to a different form](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439596373010).

##### Configuration options

You can configure your MySQL service in the [services configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) with the following options:

| Name               | Type                       | Version                            | Description |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `schemas`          | An array of `string`s      | 10.0+                              | All databases to be created. Defaults to a single `main` database. |
| `endpoints`        | An endpoints dictionary    | 10.0+                              | Endpoints with their permissions. See [multiple databases](#multiple-databases). |
| `properties`       | A properties dictionary    | MariaDB: 10.1+; Oracle MySQL: 8.0+ | Additional properties for the database. Equivalent to using a `my.cnf` file. See [property options](#configure-the-database). |
| `rotate_passwords` | A boolean                  | 10.3+                              | Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, [password rotation](#password-rotation) is disabled. |

Example configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    schemas:
      - main
    endpoints:
      mysql:
        default_schema: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
    properties:
      max_allowed_packet: 64
```

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

###### MariaDB reference

```json
{
  "username": "user",
  "scheme": "mysql",
  "service": "mariadb",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.mariadb.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 3306,
  "cluster": "azertyuiop-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "mariadb.internal",
  "rel": "mysql",
  "path": "main",
  "query": {
    "is_master": true
  },
  "password": "",
  "type": "mariadb:11.8",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

###### Oracle MySQL reference

```json
{
  "username": "user",
  "scheme": "mysql",
  "service": "oracle-mysql",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.oracle-mysql.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 3306,
  "cluster": "azertyuiop-main-afdwftq",
  "host": "oraclemysql.internal",
  "rel": "mysql",
  "path": "main",
  "query": {
    "is_master": true
  },
  "password": "",
  "type": "oracle-mysql:8.0",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

##### Access the service directly

You can access the service using the Upsun Fixed CLI by running `platform sql`.

You can also access it from you app container via [SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md).
From your [relationship data](#relationship-reference), you need: `host`, `port`, `user`, `path`.
Then run the following command:

```bash
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u <USER> <PATH>
```

Assuming the values from the [MariaDB reference](#mariadb-reference), that would be:

```bash
mysql -h mariadb.internal -P 3306 -u user main
```

If your database relationship has a password, pass the `-p` switch and enter the password when prompted:

```bash
mysql -p -h mariadb.internal -P 3306 -u user main
```

##### Define permissions

With version `10.0` or later, you can define multiple users with different permissions for your database.
To do so, define multiple endpoints in your [service configuration](#configuration-options).

For each endpoint you add, you can define the following properties:

| Name             | Type                     | Required | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `default_schema` | `string`                 |          | Which of the defined schemas to default to. If not specified, the `path` property of the relationship is `null` and so tools such as the Upsun Fixed CLI can't access the relationship. |
| `privileges`     | A permissions dictionary |          | For each of the defined schemas, what permissions the given endpoint has. |

Available permissions:

| Name              | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read-only         | `ro`                | Can select, create temporary tables, and see views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Read-write        | `rw`                | In addition to read-only permissions, can also insert, update, delete, manage and execute events, execute routines, create and drop indexes, manage and execute triggers, and lock tables.                                                                                 |
| Admin             | `admin`             | In addition to read-write permissions, can also create, drop, and alter tables; create views; and create and alter routines.                                                                                                                                               |
| Replication       | `replication`       | For [replicating databases](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/mysql-replication.md). In addition to read-only permissions, can also lock tables.                                                                                                                                         |
| Replication admin | `replication-admin` | For managing replicas across projects; can run statements such as SHOW REPLICA STATUS, CHANGE MASTER TO, START REPLICA, and so on (see this related [Dev Center article](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/connect-multiple-projects-applications-or-services-together/)). |

###### Restrict access to database replicas only

  **Feature availability**

  This feature is available on Grid HA (High Availability) and Dedicated Gen 3 projects. For more information, [contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

Your main database lives on one of the three nodes provided on Grid HA.
The two other nodes can each accommodate a replica of your main database.

For security reasons, you can grant your app access to a replica instead of your main database.
To do so, when defining the relationship between your app and database,
make sure you do the following:

1. Use the [explicit endpoint syntax](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
2. Add the `-replica` suffix to the name of the endpoint you want to use.

This results in the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>-replica
```

For example, if you define a `mariadb` database as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
    endpoints:
      admin:
        default_schema: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
      reporter:
        privileges:
          main: ro
```

To create a replica of the `mariadb` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `admin` endpoint with admin permissions,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  mariadb:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: admin-replica
```

To create a replica of the `mariadb` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `reporter` endpoint with read-only permissions instead,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  mariadb:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: reporter-replica
```

###### Grant access to the main database and its replicas

  **Feature availability**

  This feature is available on Grid HA (High Availability) and Dedicated Gen 3 projects. For more information, [contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

Your main database lives on one of the three nodes provided on Grid HA.
The two other nodes can each accommodate a replica of your main database.

You may want to grant access to both your main database and its replicas.
To do so, when defining the relationship between your app and database,
make sure you do the following:

1. Use the [explicit endpoint syntax](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
2. Add the `-all` suffix to the name of the endpoint you want to use.

This results in the following configuration,
which creates a replica on each of the secondary nodes:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>-all
```

For example, if you define a `mariadb` database as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    schemas:
      - main
  endpoints:
    admin:
      default_schema: main
      privileges:
        main: admin
    reporter:
      privileges:
        main: ro
```

To allow your app to connect to your main database and both its replicas
through the `admin` endpoint with admin permissions,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  mariadb:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: admin-all
```

To allow your app to connect to your main database and both its replicas
through the `reporter` endpoint with read-only permissions,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  mariadb:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: reporter-all
```

##### Multiple databases

With version `10.0` or later, you can define multiple databases.

To do so, define multiple `schemas` in your [service configuration](#configuration-options).

You can also specify multiple `endpoints` for [permissions](#define-permissions).
If neither `schemas` nor `endpoints` is included, it's equivalent to the following default:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    schemas:
      - main
    endpoints:
      mysql:
        default_schema: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
```

If either `schemas` or `endpoints` are defined, no default is applied and you have to specify the full configuration.

**Note**: 

Removing a schema from the list of ``schemas`` on further deployments results in the deletion of the schema.

###### Multiple databases example

The following configuration example creates a single MariaDB service named `mariadb` with two databases, `main` and `legacy`.
Access to the database is defined through three endpoints:

* `admin` has full access to both databases.
* `reporter` has SELECT query access to `main` but no access to `legacy`.
* `importer` has SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (but not DDL) access to `legacy` but no access to `main`.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    schemas:
      - main
      - legacy
    endpoints:
      admin:
        default_schema: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
          legacy: admin
      reporter:
        privileges:
          main: ro
      importer:
        default_schema: legacy
        privileges:
          legacy: rw
```

Expose these endpoints to your app as relationships in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
  # Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
  # More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  database:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: admin
  reports:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: reporter
  imports:
    service: mariadb
    endpoint: importer
```

These relationships are then available in the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](#relationship-reference).
Each has its own credentials you can use to connect to the given database.

##### Configure the database

For MariaDB 10.1 and later and Oracle MySQL 8.0 and later, you can set some configuration properties
(equivalent to using a `my.cnf` file).

In your settings, add the `properties` key to the `configuration` key.
It offers the following properties:

| Name                                  | Type      | Default                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

An example of setting these properties:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    properties:
      max_allowed_packet: 64
      default_charset: utf8mb4
      default_collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

You can also change a table's character set and collation through `ALTER TABLE` commands:

```sql
-- To change defaults when creating new tables:
ALTER DATABASE main CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- To change defaults when creating new columns:
ALTER TABLE table_name CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- To convert existing data:
ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

For further details, see the [MariaDB documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/character-set-and-collation-overview/).

**Note**: 

MariaDB configuration properties like [max_connections](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#max_connections) and [innodb_buffer_pool_size](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-buffer-pool/#innodb_buffer_pool_size) are not directly configurable from ``configuration.properties`` in your services configuration.
They can, however, be set indirectly, which can be useful for solving ``Too many connection`` errors.
See [the troubleshooting documentation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/troubleshoot.md#too-many-connections) for more details.

##### Password generation

When you connect your app to a database,
an empty password is generated for the database by default.
This can cause issues with your app.

To generate real passwords for your database,
define custom endpoints in your [service configuration](#1-configure-the-service).
For each custom endpoint you create,
you get an automatically generated password,
similarly to when you create [multiple databases](#multiple-databases).
You cannot customize these generated passwords.

After your custom endpoints are exposed as relationships in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../create-apps.md),
you can retrieve the password for each endpoint
through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
 within your [application containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app). 

Using this method to retrieve password credentials is considered a best practice: passwords change automatically (or [_rotate_](#password-rotation)) over time, and using incorrect passwords results in application downtime. **Avoid using hard-coded passwords in your application (and code base), which can cause security issues.** 

When you switch from the default configuration with an empty password to custom endpoints,
make sure your service name remains unchanged.
**Changing the service name creates a new service,
which removes any existing data from your database.**

##### Password rotation {#password-rotation}
By default, password rotation is enabled (`rotate_passwords=true`), enabling Upsun Fixed to automatically change (or _rotate_) MariaDB passwords each time it updates the MariaDB image. Password rotation also occurs as defined by any password lifetime settings in MariaDB. 

Specific scenarios might warrant disabling password rotation (` rotate_passwords=false`): for example, choosing to accommodate users who access a database via an SSH tunnel and provide a password in their request because they cannot retrieve the database credentials stored in the [service or `$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` MariaDB environment variables](#mariadb-reference). 

Passwords do **not** rotate automatically when you reset this value to `true`. 

**Important**: 

Disabling password rotation can jeopardize compliance with security certifications - make sure you weigh this risk alongside the convenience of SSH-tunneling access.

##### Storage Engine

It's best to use the InnoDB storage engine wherever possible.
MyISAM is only properly supported in non-Dedicated environments.
In Dedicated environments, there is no replication of MyISAM tables.

If MyISAM tables have been inadvertently created or imported in a Dedicated environment
(if you see `ENGINE=MyISAM` in the response to `SHOW CREATE TABLE EXISTING_TABLE`),
convert them to use the InnoDB storage engine as follows:

1. Rename the existing table.

   ```text
   RENAME TABLE <EXISTING_TABLE> <OLD_TABLE>;
   ```

1. Create a new table from the data in the existing table.

   ```text
   CREATE TABLE <EXISTING_TABLE> SELECT * from <OLD_TABLE>;
   ```

Now when you run `SHOW CREATE TABLE <EXISTING_TABLE>`, you see `ENGINE=InnoDB`.

##### Service timezone

To change the timezone for a given connection, run `SET time_zone = <TIMEZONE>;`.

##### Exporting data

To download all data from your SQL database, use the Upsun Fixed CLI.
If you have a single SQL database, the following command exports all data to a local file:

```bash
platform db:dump
```

If you have multiple SQL databases, you are prompted for which one to export.
You can also specify a database by its relationship name:

```bash
platform db:dump --relationship <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>
```

###### Compression

By default, the file is uncompressed.
To compress it, use the `--gzip` (`-z`) option:

```bash
platform db:dump --gzip
```

###### Using the output in bash

To pipe the result to another command, use the `--stdout` option.
For example, to create a bzip2-compressed file, run:

```bash
platform db:dump --stdout | bzip2 > dump.sql.bz2
```

##### Importing data

To load data into a database, pipe an SQL dump through the `platform sql` command, like so:

```bash
platform sql < my_database_backup.sql
```

That runs the database backup against the SQL database on Upsun Fixed.
That works for any SQL file, so the usual caveats about importing an SQL dump apply
(for example, it's best to run against an empty database).

As with exporting, you can specify a specific environment and a specific database relationship to use:

```bash
platform sql --relationship <RELATIONSHIP_NAME> -e <BRANCH_NAME> < my_database_backup.sql
```

**Note**: 

Importing a database backup is a destructive operation.
It overwrites data already in your database.
It’s best to run it against an empty database.
If not, make a backup or do a database export before importing.

##### Sanitizing data

To ensure people who review code changes can't access personally identifiable information stored in your database,
[sanitize your preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/sanitize-db.md).

##### Replication

In non-Dedicated environments, there is no on-site primary/replica supports.
In Dedicated environments, it's provided automatically as part of the default configuration.

In rare cases (such as for certain backup purposes),
you can also enable [remote replication](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/mysql-replication.md) to your own replica data.
The replica isn't available to your application.

##### Troubleshoot

If you run into issues, [troubleshoot MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/troubleshoot.md).
#### MariaDB read-only replication

You can improve the performance of read-heavy applications by defining read-only replicas of your MariaDB database and then connecting your application to those replicas. 

Examples of read-heavy applications include: 
- Listing pages or dashboards
- Reporting or analytics jobs
- Background jobs that frequently query data

**Note**: 

 - **To prevent data loss or interruptions** during replication, you must configure the disk size for each replica. The replica service does not inherit the disk size of the primary database. The replica disk size must at least match the primary service’s disk capacity. See the example below.
 - **Replication is asynchronous**: Delays of a few milliseconds might occur between writes on the primary database and reads on the replica database.
 - **Replicas are read-only**: This restriction ensures data consistency and integrity. Attempts to modify data will result in an SQL error.

####### Read-only vs. external replicas
Read-only replicas are used primarily to improve application performance by distributing database read requests from read-heavy applications.  

Other common use cases for read-only replicas include: 
- Cross-region backup: Replicating data to different geographical regions
- Data warehousing: Extracting data from production to analytics projects

[External replicas](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/mysql-replication.md) reside on remote servers and have different use cases, including disaster recovery.

####### Replica scope and sharing services {#replica-scope-sharing-services}
MariaDB services (which provide access to databases and replicas) defined in a project cannot be accessed by or shared with applications in other projects. 

To share the MariaDB service among applications in different projects, you must complete the following high-level steps: 
1. Migrate the Upsun Fixed projects to Upsun Flex.  
1. Migrate the applications that are in those projects. 
1. Move the desired applications into one Flex project, rather than separate Flex projects. In Upsun Flex, multiple applications in one project can share the same services. 

For details, see [Converting from Upsun Fixed](https://docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/migrating/from-fixed.md) in the Upsun Flex product docs.

###### 1. Configure the primary and replica services

The following code fragment defines two MariaDB services: a primary and a replica. You can use this fragment as a template by copying it into your `services.yaml` or `application.yaml` file. 

Be sure to: 
- Replace `<VERSION>` with the [supported MariaDB version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#supported-versions) that you need. Use the same version number for the primary and replica services.
- Replace `<SIZE>` with a `disk` size in (MB) that is sufficient for the primary database's disk capacity.
- **Important:** Use `replicator` as the endpoint name when you define the replica service. This is a special endpoint name that the replica service uses to connect to the database.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
services:
  db:
    type: mariadb:<VERSION>
    disk: <SIZE>
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
      endpoints:
        main:
          default_schema: main
          privileges:
              main: admin
          replicator:
            privileges:
              main: replication

  db-replica1:
    type: mariadb-replica:<VERSION>
    disk: <SIZE>
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
      endpoints:
        main:
          default_schema: main
          privileges:
            main: admin
      relationships:
      primary: db:replicator # Do not change the name `primary`. The service expects to receive this name.

  db-replica2:
    type: mariadb-replica:<VERSION>
    disk: <SIZE>
    configuration:
      schemas:
        - main
      endpoints:
        main:
          default_schema: main
          privileges:
            main: admin
      relationships:
      primary: db:replicator # Do not change the name `primary`. The service expects to receive this name.
```

####### How it works

Using the sample code fragment above: 

1. The primary service (`db`) defines an additional `replicator` endpoint, granting the `replication` privilege. This enables a replica to connect and continuously replicate data from the primary database. 

    ```yaml
    replicator:
      privileges:
        main: replication
    ```

2. The replica services (`db-replica1` and `db-relica2`) use the `mariadb-replica` image type and connect back to the primary database service through the primary relationship. This establishes a replication link from `db` (the source) to `db-replica` (the target).

    ```yaml
    relationships:
      primary: db:replicator
    ```

The `db-replica1` and `db-replica2` replica services continuously stream data from the primary endpoint, maintaining a read-only copy of the primary database content. Write operations are not permitted on the replicas. 

###### 2. Define the relationship between the application and the replicas

Even if your application won't access the replication endpoint, you must expose the endpoint to an application as a relationship so that you can connect to it over SSH.

Add a new relationship to your application container, as shown below:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
  # More information: https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  database:
    service: db
    endpoint: main
  database-readonly:
    service: db-replica
```

#### MariaDB/MySQL external replication

In rare cases, it may be useful to maintain a replica instance of your MySQL/MariaDB database outside of Upsun Fixed on a remote server.

Typically, an automated backup is better for short-term usage and a `mysqldump` for longer term storage, but in some cases the data set is large enough that `mysqldump` is prohibitive.
In that case, you can enable external replication using an extra permission.

This guide explains replication on the Upsun Fixed side only; you must also set up and maintain your own replica instance. Consult the MySQL or MariaDB documentation for details.

###### Create a replication user

To set up replication you need to create a replication-enabled user.
For each database that you'd like to replicate, you need to assign a `replication` permission/role under a corresponding `endpoint`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    schemas:
      - main
    endpoints:
      # Restate the default user to be used by your application.
      mysql:
        default_schema: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
      replicator:
        privileges:
          main: replication
```
The preceding example:
- Creates a `replicator` user.
- Grants read-only and table locking rights on the `main` database (namely `Select_priv`, `Show_view_priv`, `Create_tmp_table_priv`, `Lock_tables_priv` privileges).
- Grants global replication rights (namely `Repl_slave_priv` and `Repl_client_priv` privileges).
- Grants flushing rights (`Reload_priv` used for flushing before reading the binary log position).
- If at least one `replication` permission is defined, the bin-logging is enabled on the primary server, which is essential for the replication.

###### Add a relationship for the new endpoint

Even if your application won't access the replication endpoint, you still need to expose the endpoint to an application as a relationship so that you can connect to it over SSH.
Add a new relationship to your application container:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
  # Please note: Legacy definition of the relationship is still supported:
  # More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  database:
    service: "mariadb"
    endpoint: "mysql"
  replication:
    service: "mariadb"
    endpoint: "replicator"
```

###### Get the primary's binary log co-ordinates

Open the MySQL CLI to the `replication` relationship, either by accessing the credentials while on the app container or using the following command:

```bash
platform sql -r replication
```

Now you need to prevent any changes to the data while you view the binary log position. You'll use this to tell the replica at exactly which point it should start replicating from. On the primary server, flush and lock all tables by running `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`. Keep this session running - exiting it releases the lock. Get the current position in the binary log by running `SHOW MASTER STATUS`:

```sql
mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.016 sec)

mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
+-----------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File            | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
+-----------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| binlogs.000002  |  1036    | dflt         |                  |
+-----------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
```

Record the `File` and `Position` details. If binary logging has just been enabled, these are blank. Now, with the lock still in place, copy the data from the primary to the replica.

Log in to the app container, then run:

```sh
# Dump the data from primary. Note that it dumps only the databases, which "replicator" user has access to.
$ mysqldump --all-databases --single-transaction -h database.internal -P 3306 -u replicator -p > /path/to/dump.sql
```

Download the dump file, then move it to the server where your replica lives so that the replica can import it.

```bash
# Copy the dump to your replica
$ mysql -u root < /path/to/dump.sql
```

Note for live databases: It is sufficient to make a local copy of the data; you don't need to keep the primary locked until the replica has imported the data.
Once the `mysqldump` has completed, you can release the lock on the primary by running `UNLOCK TABLES`.

```sql
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
```

###### Set up the replica

####### Configure the replica

As mentioned above you have to set up a replica on your own. Assuming that you have a running MariaDB/MySQL replica instance, give the replica a unique `server_id` (distinct from primary). You can find out primary's `server_id` by running:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'server_id';

+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| server_id     | 1     |
+---------------+-------+
```

Then set a distinct `server_id` number (e.g. server_id+1) in your replica config (e.g. `my.cnf`) under:

```
[mysqld]
server_id=2
```

Next, reload the replica instance for the changes to take effect.

####### Set up SSH tunneling

You need to set up an SSH tunnel from the replica server to the primary, tunneled through the application.

**Note**: 

The SSH tunnel is interrupted every time the environment redeploys. For replication to continue you must set up an auto-restart for the tunnel. There are many ways to do so that are out of the scope of this documentation.

You can set up an SSH tunnel using one of the following methods:
- Manually using SSH. Using this method makes it easier to set up an auto-restart for the tunnel. Consult the SSH documentation for details on setting up the tunnel and the auto-restart.

- Run the following Upsun Fixed CLI command
(replacing `<BRANCH_NAME>` with the name of your production branch):

  ```bash
    platform tunnel:open --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <BRANCH_NAME>
  ```
  This command opens local SSH tunnels to all services accessible from the application.

To configure an auto-restart, you need the project's SSH address, which you can retrieve by running:

  ```bash
  platform ssh --pipe --project <PROJECT_ID>
  ```
For details about this command, see the [Upsun Fixed CLI reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference.md#usage-54).

####### Binary log retention and cleanup
When replication is disabled, the MariaDB service stops managing the binary logs and they remain on the file system. **You must delete these logs manually**. If the remote replica has been unreachable for some time, these logs can consume a significant amount of storage.

####### Start the Replica

Once the data has been imported, you are ready to start replicating. Begin by running a `CHANGE MASTER TO`, making sure that `MASTER_LOG_FILE` matches the file and `MASTER_LOG_POS` the position returned by the earlier `SHOW MASTER STATUS` on the Upsun Fixed database. For example:

```sql
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='<HOST>',
  MASTER_USER='replicator',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='<REPLICATOR_PASSWORD>',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='binlogs.000002',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=1036,
  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;
```

Where `<HOST>` varies depending on the SSH tunneling configuration you have, and the `<REPLICATOR_PASSWORD>` can be obtained by running `platform relationships`.

Now start the replica with the `START SLAVE` command:

```sql
mysql> START SLAVE;
```

Check that the replication is working by running the `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` command:

```sql
mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G
```

If replication is working correctly, the values of both `Slave_IO_Running` and `Slave_SQL_Running` should be `Yes`:

```sql
Slave_IO_Running: Yes
Slave_SQL_Running: Yes
```

####### [Optional/Troubleshooting] Skipping invalid binary log queries

In some cases, after applying primary's dump to the replica and starting the replica, you might experience replication errors (`Slave_SQL_Running: No` and `Error:` in the output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G` above). Each of such errors needs a careful inspection, but you might be able to just skip some of them. For example:

```sql
mysql> STOP SLAVE; SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1; START SLAVE;
mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G
```

In case you have multiple errors you would need to repeat the steps above (preferred) or set `SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER` (which corresponds to skipping the next N events from the primary) to a larger value.
#### Troubleshoot MySQL

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

###### Lock wait timeout

If a process running in your application acquired a lock from MySQL for a long period of time,
you receive MySQL error messages like this:

```sql
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1205 Lock wait timeout exceeded;
```

This is typically caused by one of the following:

* There are multiple places acquiring locks in different order.
  For example, code path 1 first locks record A and then locks record B,
  while code path 2 first locks record B and then locks record A.
* There is a long running background process executed by your application that holds the lock until it ends.

If you're using [MariaDB 10+](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md), use the SQL query `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST \G` to list DB queries waiting for locks.
To determine where to debug, find output like the following:

```sql

Command: Query
Time: ...
State: Waiting for table metadata lock
Info: SELECT ...

```

To find active background processes, run `ps aufx` on your application container.

Make sure that locks are acquired in a pre-defined order and released as soon as possible.

###### Definer/invoker of view lack rights to use them

There is a single MySQL user, so you can not use "DEFINER" Access Control mechanism for Stored Programs and Views.

When creating a `VIEW`, you may need to explicitly set the `SECURITY` parameter to `INVOKER`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `view_name` AS
SELECT
```

###### Server has gone away

####### Disk space issues

Errors such as `PDO Exception 'MySQL server has gone away'` are usually the result of exhausting your available disk space.
Get an estimate of current disk usage using the CLI command `platform db:size`.
Just keep in mind it's an estimate and not exact.

Allocate more space to the service in [`.platform/services.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
As table space can grow rapidly,
it's usually advisable to make your database mount size twice the size reported by the `db:size` command.

You may want to add a [low-disk warning](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/notifications.md#low-disk-warning)
to learn about low disk space before it becomes an issue.

####### Packet size limitations

`MySQL server has gone away` errors may be caused by the size of the database packets.
If so, the logs may show warnings like `Error while sending QUERY packet` before the error.

One way to resolve the issue is to use the [`max_allowed_packet` parameter](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#configure-the-database).

####### Worker timeout

`MySQL server has gone away` errors may be caused by server timeouts.
MySQL has a built-in timeout for idle connections, which defaults to 10 minutes.
Most typical web connections end long before that's ever approached,
but a long-running worker may idle and not need the database for longer than the timeout, leading to a "server has gone away" message.

The best approach is to wrap your connection logic in code that detects a "server has gone away" exception
and tries to re-establish the connection.

Alternatively, if your worker is idle for too long it can self-terminate.
Upsun Fixed automatically restarts the worker process and the new process can establish a new database connection.

###### Too many connections

You may get the following [error message](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/e1040/): `Error 1040: Too many connections`.
A common way to solve this issue is to increase the `max_connections` property in your MariaDB service configuration.
However, on Upsun Fixed, you **cannot** configure `max_connections` directly.

####### Quick fix

**Note**: 

This information applies to DG3 and Professional/Grid Upsun Fixed projects. 
For DG2 projects, [contact Support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) to configure the ``max_connections`` property.

You cannot configure `max_connections` directly in Upsun Fixed service configurations.
However, to solve `Error 1040`, you can increase `max_connections` indirectly.

For example, in the following service configuration for MariaDB, `max_connections` is `188` as [set by Upsun Fixed](#how-it-works):

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
mariadb:
  type: mariadb:11.8
  disk: 2048
  size: L
  configuration:
    properties:
      max_allowed_packet: 16
```

To **increase** `max_connections`, you can **either**:

- **decrease** `max_allowed_packet` (for example, `16` → `15` results in `max_connections=201`)
- or **increase** `size` (for example, `L` → `XL` results in `max_connections=356`)

####### How it works

Behind the scenes, `max_connections` (for Professional and DG3 projects) is calculated from values that you _can_ change:

1. **`max_allowed_packet`**: `max_allowed_packet` is [directly configurable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#configure-the-database)
   in your `.platform/services.yaml` file with an integer value.
   The default value of `16` is shown below to illustrate:

   ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
   # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
   mariadb:
     type: mariadb:11.8
     disk: 2048
     configuration:
       properties:
          max_allowed_packet: 16
    ```

1. **The memory available to the service**: Resources are distributed across the containers
   in a cluster based on your Upsun Fixed [plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
   The _strategy_ for how resources are distributed can either be determined for you by Upsun Fixed (equivalent to setting `size: AUTO`) or by setting a container size explicitly:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
    # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
    mariadb:
      type: mariadb:11.8
      disk: 2048
      size: L
      configuration:
        properties:
          max_allowed_packet: 16
    ```

    The memory for a given container from its `size` depends on its [container profile***](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#container-profiles-cpu-and-memory).

    For example, [MariaDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#container-profile-reference) has a `HIGH_MEMORY` [container profile](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#high_memory-container-profile).
    For `size: L`, it means 0.40 CPU and 1280 MB of memory.

If we assume the configuration above, where:

- `mariadb.size: L`, which we know is 1280 MB, referred to below as `application_size`
- `mariadb.configuration.properties.max_allowed_packet: 16`

`max_allowed_packet` is `188`, which is determined by Upsun Fixed according to:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{max_connections} = \text{int}\Biggl[ \min \left( \frac{\texttt{FREE_MEMORY}}{\texttt{max_allowed_packet}}, 500 \right) \Biggr]
\end{aligned}

This calculation uses three additional calculations:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{FREE_MEMORY} = \texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} - \left( 50 + \texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} \right) \newline \newline
\texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} = (\texttt{application_size} * 2) + 512 \newline \newline
\texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} = \frac{\text{int}\left( 0.75 \cdot \texttt{application_size} \right)}{1024^{2}}
\end{aligned}

So for our current example, where:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{application_size} = 1280 \newline
\texttt{max_allowed_packet} = 16
\end{aligned}

You get:

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} = \frac{\text{int}\left( 0.75 \cdot \texttt{application_size} \right)}{1024^{2}} = \frac{\text{int}\left( 0.75 \cdot \texttt{1280} \right)}{1024^{2}} \approx 9.155 \times 10^{-4}
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} = (\texttt{application_size} * 2) + 512 = (1280 * 2) + 512 = 3072
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{FREE_MEMORY} = \texttt{AVAILABLE_MEMORY} - \left( 50 + \texttt{innodb_buffer_pool_size} \right) \newline \newline
\texttt{FREE_MEMORY} = 3072 - \left( 50 + 0.0009155... \right) = 3021.999084
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{max_connections} = \text{int}\Biggl[ \min \left( \frac{\texttt{FREE_MEMORY}}{\texttt{max_allowed_packet}}, 500 \right) \Biggr] = \text{int}\Biggl[ \min \left( \frac{3021.999084}{16}, 500 \right) \Biggr] = \text{int}\Biggl[ 188.87... \Biggr]
\end{aligned}

\begin{aligned}
\texttt{max_connections} = 188
\end{aligned}

The following table provides additional example calculations of `max_connections` for all `size` settings
and for a number of `max_allow_packet` settings.

            MariaDB ``max_connections``  for common combinations  of ``size`` &  ``max_allow_packet``
            ``application_size````size`` (memory in MB)

 S (128 MB) | M (288 MB) | L (1280 MB) | XL (2624 MB) | 2XL (5248 MB) | 4XL (10496 MB) |

 1(min) | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 |

 2 | 358 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 |

 8 | 89 | 129 | 377 | 500 | 500 | 500 |

 16(default) | 44 | 64 | 188 | 356 | 500 | 500 |

 32 | 22 | 32 | 94 | 178 | 342 | 500 |

 64 | 11 | 16 | 47 | 89 | 171 | 335 |

 100(max) | 7 | 10 | 30 | 57 | 109 | 214 |

**Note**: 

The maximum value for ``max_connections`` is 500, indicated with italicized integers in the table.

Also, you can **increase** ``max_connections`` in your environments by either:

 - **decreasing** the ``max_allow_packet`` value in your service configuration
 - or **increasing** your plan ``size``

### Memcached (Object cache)

Memcached is an in-memory object store well-suited for application level caching.

See the [Memcached documentation](https://memcached.org) for more information.

Both Memcached and Redis can be used for application caching. As a general rule, Memcached is simpler and thus more widely supported while Redis is more robust. Upsun Fixed recommends using Redis if possible but Memcached is fully supported if an application favors that cache service.

##### Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Drupal](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/memcached.md)

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "service": "memcached",
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.memcached.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-afdwftq",
  "host": "memcached.internal",
  "rel": "memcached",
  "scheme": "memcached",
  "type": "memcached:1.6",
  "port": 11211
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `memcached` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: memcached:<VERSION>
```

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: memcached
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
memcached:
  type: memcached:1.6
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  memcached:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  memcached:
    service: memcached
    endpoint: memcached
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```java {}
package sh.platform.languages.sample;

import net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;
import sh.platform.config.Config;

import java.util.function.Supplier;

import sh.platform.config.Memcached;

public class MemcachedSample implements Supplier<String> {

    @Override
    public String get() {
        StringBuilder logger = new StringBuilder();

        // Create a new config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
        // You can alternatively use getenv() yourself.
        Config config = new Config();

        // Get the credentials to connect to the Memcached service.
        Memcached memcached = config.getCredential("memcached", Memcached::new);

        final MemcachedClient client = memcached.get();

        String key = "cloud";
        String value = "platformsh";

        // Set a value.
        client.set(key, 0, value);

        // Read it back.
        Object test = client.get(key);

        logger.append("<p>");
        logger.append(String.format("Found value <code>%s</code> for key <code>%s</code>.", test, key));
        logger.append("</p>");

        return logger.toString();
    }
}

```
```js {}
const Memcached = require('memcached');
const config = require("platformsh-config").config();
const { promisify } = require('util');

exports.usageExample = async function() {
    const credentials = config.credentials('memcached');
    const client = new Memcached(`${credentials.host}:${credentials.port}`);

    // The MemcacheD client is not Promise-aware, so make it so.
    const memcachedGet = promisify(client.get).bind(client);
    const memcachedSet = promisify(client.set).bind(client);

    const key = 'Deploy-day';
    const value = 'Friday';

    // Set a value.
    await memcachedSet(key, value, 10);

    // Read it back.
    const test = await memcachedGet(key);

    return `Found value <strong>${test}</strong> for key <strong>${key}</strong>.`;
};

```
```php {}
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config;

// Create a new config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
// You can alternatively use getenv() yourself.
$config = new Config();

// Get the credentials to connect to the Memcached service.
$credentials = $config->credentials('memcached');

try {
    // Connecting to Memcached server.
    $memcached = new Memcached();
    $memcached->addServer($credentials['host'], $credentials['port']);
    $memcached->setOption(Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL, true);

    $key = "Deploy day";
    $value = "Friday";

    // Set a value.
    $memcached->set($key, $value);

    // Read it back.
    $test = $memcached->get($key);

    printf('Found value <strong>%s</strong> for key <strong>%s</strong>.', $test, $key);

} catch (Exception $e) {
    print $e->getMessage();
}

```
```python {}

import pymemcache
from platformshconfig import Config

def usage_example():

    # Create a new Config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
    # You can alternatively use os.environ yourself.
    config = Config()

    # Get the credentials to connect to the Memcached service.
    credentials = config.credentials('memcached')

    try:
        # Try connecting to Memached server.
        memcached = pymemcache.Client((credentials['host'], credentials['port']))
        memcached.set('Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL', True)

        key = "Deploy_day"
        value = "Friday"

        # Set a value.
        memcached.set(key, value)

        # Read it back.
        test = memcached.get(key)

        return 'Found value <strong>{0}</strong> for key <strong>{1}</strong>.'.format(test.decode("utf-8"), key)

    except Exception as e:
        return e

```

##### Accessing Memcached directly

To access the Memcached service directly you can use `netcat` as Memcached doesn't have a dedicated client tool.
Assuming your Memcached relationship is named `memcached`, the host name and port number obtained from `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` would be `memcached.internal` and `11211`.
Open an [SSH session](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md) and access the Memcached server as follows:

```bash  {location="Terminal"}
netcat memcached.internal 11211
```

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.
### MongoDB (Database service)

MongoDB is a cross-platform, document-oriented database.

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": "main",
  "scheme": "mongodb",
  "service": "mongodb",
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.mongodb.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "cluster": "azertyuiop-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "mongodb.internal",
  "rel": "mongodb",
  "query": {
    "is_master": true
  },
  "path": "main",
  "password": null,
  "type": "mongodb-enterprise:7.0",
  "port": 27017
}
```

##### Usage example

###### Enterprise edition example

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `mongodb-enterprise` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: mongodb-enterprise:<VERSION>
  disk: 512
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

####### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: mongodb
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - mongodb
```

####### Example configuration

######## [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.

  type: mongodb-enterprise:7.0
  disk: 512
```

######## [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}

###### Legacy edition example

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `mongodb` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: mongodb:<VERSION>
  disk: 512
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.

##### Access the service directly

You can access MongoDB from you app container via [SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md).
Get the `host` from your [relationship](#relationship-reference).
Then run the following command:

```bash
mongosh <MONGODB_HOST>
```

With the example value, that would be the following:

```bash
mongosh mongodb.internal
```

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

##### Exporting data

The most straightforward way to export data from a MongoDB database is to open an SSH tunnel to it
and export the data directly using MongoDB's tools.

First, open an SSH tunnel with the Upsun Fixed CLI:

```bash
platform tunnel:open
```

That opens an SSH tunnel to all services on your current environment and produce output like the following:

```bash
SSH tunnel opened on port 30000 to relationship: mongodb
```

The port may vary in your case.
You also need to obtain the user, password, and database name from the relationships array, as above.

Then, connect to that port locally using `mongodump` (or your favorite MongoDB tools) to export all data in that server:

```bash
mongodump --port 30000 -u main -p main --authenticationDatabase main --db main
```

(If necessary, vary the `-u`, `-p`, `--authenticationDatabase` and `--db` flags.)

As with any other shell command it can be piped to another command to compress the output or redirect it to a specific file.

For further references, see the [official `mongodump` documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/).

##### Upgrading

To upgrade to 6.0 from a version earlier than 5.0, you must successively upgrade major releases until you have upgraded to 5.0.
For example, if you are running a 4.2 image, you must upgrade first to 4.4 and then upgrade to 5.0 before you can upgrade to 6.0.

For more details on upgrading and how to handle potential application backward compatibility issues,
see the [MongoDB release notes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/).

**Note**: 

Make sure you first test your migration on a separate branch.

Also, be sure to take a backup of your production environment **before** you merge this change.

Downgrading isn't supported. If you want, for whatever reason, to downgrade you should create a mongodump, remove the service, recreate the service, and import your dump.
### Network Storage

Upsun Fixed supports internal "storage as a service" to provide a file store that can be shared between different application containers.

The network storage service enables a new kind of [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts)
that refers to a shared service rather than to a local directory.
Your apps can use any combination of `local` and `service` mounts.

**Note**: 

Writing to network mounts is slightly slower than to local mounts.
In most cases, you shouldn’t notice it.
It’s more significant when you employ high-volume sequential file creation
(create a large number of small files in rapid succession).
If your app does this regularly, a local mount is more effective.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 1.0

  None available

This service is the Upsun Fixed network storage implementation, not the version of a third-party application.

**Note**: 

It isn’t possible to upgrade or downgrade the network storage service version while keeping existing data in place.
Changing the service version requires that the service be reinitialized.
Any change to the service version results in existing data becoming inaccessible.

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future,
so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `network-storage` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: network-storage:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

`<SERVICE_NAME>` must be [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) compliant, and as such it must:

- Contain at most 63 characters
- Contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or `-` (underscores `_` are not allowed)
- Start with an alphanumeric character
- End with an alphanumeric character

This is due to the fact that `<SERVICE_NAME>` is used as hostname for the network storage.

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Add the mount

To define the mount accessible by your application, use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
mounts:
  <TARGET_PATH>:
    source: service
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    source_path: <SOURCE_PATH>
```

- `<TARGET_PATH>` is the path to your mount within the app container (relative to the app’s root).
- `<SERVICE_NAME>` is the name you [defined in step 1](#1-configure-the-service).
- `<SOURCE_PATH>` specifies where the mount points inside the service. 
  If the `source_path` is an empty string (`""`), your mount points to the entire service. 
  If you don’t define a `source_path`, Upsun Fixed uses the `MOUNT_PATH` as default value, without leading or trailing slashes.
  For example, if your mount lives in the `/my/files/` directory within your app container, it will point to a `my/files` directory within the service.

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
network-storage:
    type: network-storage:1.0
    disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
mounts:
  'my/files':
    source: service
    service: network-storage
    source_path: files
```

##### Multi-application usage

If your project contains [multiple apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md), they can all use the same network mounts.
If the `source_path` is the same for both apps,
the files are shared between the two applications even if the mount location is different.

It's also possible to have one app mount a `source_path` that's a subdirectory of another application's mount.
For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
# The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
app1:
  # The location of the application's code.
  source:
    root: "app1"

  [...]

  mounts:
    # The path to your mount within the app container (relative to the app's root).
    'web/uploads':
      # Specifies that the mount points to a network storage service that can be shared between apps.
      source: service
      # The name of the network storage service the mount points to.
      service: network-storage
      # Specifies where your mount points inside the external directory that is mounted to your app container.
      source_path: uploads

# The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
app2:
  # The location of the application's code.
  source:
    root: "app2"

  [...]

  mounts:
    # The path to your mount within the app container (relative to the app's root).
    'process':
      # Specifies that the mount points to a network storage service that can be shared between apps.
      source: service
      # The name of the network storage service the mount points to.
      service: network-storage
      # Specifies where your mount points inside the external directory that is mounted to your app container.
      # Since the target is the uploads directory app1's mount already points to,
      # the network storage service is effectively shared between app1 and app2.
      source_path: uploads/incoming

    # The path to your mount within the app container (relative to the app's root).
    'done':
      # Specifies that the mount points to a network storage service that can be shared between apps.
      source: service
      # The name of the network storage service the mount points to.
      service: network-storage
      # Specifies where your mount points inside the external directory that is mounted to your app container.
      # Since the target is the uploads directory app1's mount already points to,
      # the network storage service is effectively shared between app1 and app2.
      source_path: uploads/done
```

In this example, `app1` has access to the entire `uploads` directory by writing to `web/uploads`.
`app2` has two mounts that it can write to: `process` and `done`.
The `process` mount refers to the same directory as the `web/uploads/incoming` directory does on `app1`,
and the `done` mount refers to the same directory as the `web/uploads/done` directory on `app1`.

##### Worker instances

When defining a [worker](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers) instance,
keep in mind what mount behavior you want.

`local` mounts are a separate storage area for each instance,
while `service` mounts can be shared between instances.

For example, you can define a network storage service called `files`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the network storage service. Must be unique within a project.
files:
    type: network-storage:1.0
    disk: 2048
```

You can then use this service to  define a `network_dir` network mount and a `local_dir` local mount,
to be used by a `web` instance and a `queue` worker instance:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  # The type of the application to build.
  type: "nodejs:20"

  # Defines how much space is available to local mounts.
  disk: 512

  mounts:
    # Defines a network storage mount that can be shared by both worker instances.
    'network_dir':
      source: service
      service: files
      source_path: our_stuff

    # Defines a local mount that's available to each instance separately.
    'local_dir':
      source: local
      source_path: my_stuff

  # Defines a web instance.
  web:
    locations:
      "/":
        root: "public"
        passthru: true
        index: ['index.html']

  # Define a queue worker instance from the same code but with a different start.
  workers:
    queue:
      commands:
        start: ./start.sh
```

Both the web instance and the `queue` worker have two mount points:

- The `local_dir` mount on each is independent and not connected to each other at all
  and they *each* take 1024 MB of space.
- The `network_dir` mount on each points to the same network storage space on the `files` service.
  They can both read and write to it simultaneously.
  The amount of space it has available depends on the `disk` key specified for the service configuration (in this case, 2048 MB).

##### How do I give my workers access to my main application's files?

The most common use case for `network-storage` is to allow a CMS-driven site to use a worker that has access to the same file mounts as the web-serving application.
For that case, all that's needed is to set the necessary file mounts as `service` mounts.

For example, the following `.platform.app.yaml` file (fragment) keeps Drupal files directories shared between web and worker instances while keeping the Drush backup directory web-only (as it has no need to be shared).
(This assumes a Network Storage service named `files` has also been defined in `.platform/services.yaml`.)

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  # The type of the application to build.
  type: "php:8.5"

  relationships:
    mariadb:

  disk: 1024

  mounts:
    # The public and private files directories are
    # network mounts shared by web and workers.
    'web/sites/default/files':
      source: service
      service: files
      source_path: files
    'private':
      source: service
      service: files
      source_path: private
    # The backup, temp, and cache directories for
    # Drupal's CLI tools don't need to be shared.
    # It wouldn't hurt anything to make them network
    # shares, however.
    '/.drush':
      source: local
      source_path: drush
    'tmp':
      source: local
      source_path: tmp
    'drush-backups':
      source: local
      source_path: drush-backups
    '/.console':
      source: local
      source_path: console

  # Crons run on the web container, so they have the
  # same mounts as the web container.
  crons:
    drupal:
      spec: '*/20 * * * *'
      commands:
        start: 'cd web ; drush core-cron'

  # The worker defined here also has the same 6 mounts;
  # 2 of them are shared with the web container,
  # the other 4 are local to the worker.
  workers:
    queue:
      commands:
        start: |
          cd web && drush queue-run myqueue
```

##### How can I migrate a local storage to a network storage?

There is no automated way of transferring data from one storage type to another.
However, the process is fundamentally "just" moving files around on disk, so it's reasonably straightforward.

Suppose you have this mount configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
mounts:
  web/uploads:
    source: local
    source_path: uploads
```

And want to move that to a network storage mount.
The following approximate steps do so with a minimum of service interruption.

1. Add a new `network-storage` service, named `files`,
   that has at least enough space for your existing files with some buffer.

   ```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
   # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
   files:
       type: network-storage:1.0
       disk: 1024
   ```

2. Add a new mount (`new-uploads`) to the network storage service on a non-public directory.
   (Remember the `source_path` can be the same since they're on different storage services.)

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   mounts:
     web/uploads:
       source: local
       source_path: uploads
     new-uploads:
       source: service
       service: files
       source_path: uploads
   ```

3. Deploy these changes.
   Then use `rsync` to copy all files from the local mount to the network mount.
   (Be careful of the trailing `/`.)

    ```bash
    rsync -avz web/uploads/* new-uploads/
    ```

4. Reverse the mounts.
   Point the `web/uploads` directory to the network mount instead.
   Commit and push the change, testing to make sure the network files are accessible.

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   mounts:
     old-uploads:
       source: local
       source_path: uploads
     web/uploads:
       source: service
       service: files
       source_path: uploads
   ```

5. Clean up.
   First, run another `rsync` just to make sure any files uploaded during the transition aren't lost.
   (Note the command is different here.)

   ```bash
   rsync -avz old-uploads/* web/uploads/
   ```

   Once you're confident all the files are accounted for, delete the entire contents of `old-uploads`.
   If you don't, the files remain on disk but inaccessible, just eating up disk space needlessly.

   Once that's done you can remove the `old-uploads` mount and push again to finish the process
   You are also free to reduce the `disk` size in the `.platform.app.yaml` file if desired,
   but make sure to leave enough for any remaining local mounts.
### OpenSearch (search service)

OpenSearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud.

See the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/) for more information.

To switch from Elasticsearch, follow the same procedure as for [upgrading](#upgrading).

##### Supported versions

<!--
To update the versions in this table, use docs/data/registry.json

On Grid, from version 2, you only specify the major version. The latest compatible minor version and patches are applied automatically. On Grid, version 1 represents a rolling release - the latest minor version available from the upstream (starting with OpenSearch version 1.3).

You can see the latest versions of OpenSearch available [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/releases).

##### Deprecated versions

The following versions are still available in your projects,
but they're at their end of life and are no longer receiving security updates from upstream,
or are no longer the recommended way to configure the service on Upsun Fixed.

To ensure your project remains stable in the future,
switch to [a supported version](#supported-versions).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": null,
  "scheme": "http",
  "service": "opensearch",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "169.254.99.100",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.opensearch.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 9200,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "opensearch.internal",
  "rel": "opensearch",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "type": "opensearch:3",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `opensearch` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: opensearch:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: opensearch
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
opensearch:
  type: opensearch:3
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  opensearch:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  opensearch:
    service: opensearch
    endpoint: opensearch
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```yaml {}
name: myapp

[...]

relationships:
  opensearch:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp

[...]

relationships:
  opensearch:
    service: opensearch
    endpoint: opensearch
```

This configuration defines a single application (`myapp`), whose source code exists in the `<PROJECT_ROOT>/myapp` directory. 
`myapp` has access to the `opensearch` service, via a relationship whose name is [identical to the service name](#2-define-the-relationship)
(as per [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships).

From this, `myapp` can retrieve access credentials to the service through the environment variable `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`. That variable is a base64-encoded JSON object, but can be decoded at runtime (using the built-in tool `jq`) to provide more accessible environment variables to use within the application itself:

```bash  {location="myapp/.environment"}
# Decode the built-in credentials object variable.
export RELATIONSHIPS_JSON=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode)

# Set environment variables for individual credentials.
export OS_SCHEME=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".opensearch[0].scheme")
export OS_HOST=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".opensearch[0].host")
export OS_PORT=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".opensearch[0].port")

# Surface more common OpenSearch connection string variables for use in app.
export OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON | jq -r ".opensearch[0].username")
export OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=$(echo $RELATIONSHIPS_JSON  | jq -r ".opensearch[0].password")
export OPENSEARCH_HOSTS=[\"$OS_SCHEME://$OS_HOST:$OS_PORT\"]
```

The above file — `.environment` in the `myapp` directory — is automatically sourced by Upsun Fixed into the runtime environment, so that the variable `OPENSEARCH_HOSTS` can be used within the application to connect to the service.

Note that `OPENSEARCH_HOSTS` and all Upsun Fixed-provided environment variables like `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`, are environment-dependent. Unlike the build produced for a given commit, they can't be reused across environments and only allow your app to connect to a single service instance on a single environment.

A file very similar to this is generated automatically for your when using the `platform ify` command to [migrate a codebase to Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/get-started.md).

**Note**: 

When you create an index on OpenSearch,
don’t specify the ``number_of_shards`` or ``number_of_replicas`` settings in your OpenSearch API call.
These values are set automatically based on available resources.

##### Authentication

By default, OpenSearch has no authentication.
No username or password is required to connect to it.

You may optionally enable HTTP Basic authentication.
To do so, include the following in your `.platform/services.yaml` configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
opensearch:
  type: opensearch:3
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    authentication:
      enabled: true
```

That enables mandatory HTTP Basic auth on all requests.
The credentials are available in any relationships that point at that service,
in the `username` and `password` properties.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

This functionality is generally not required if OpenSearch isn't exposed on its own public HTTP route.
However, certain applications may require it, or it allows you to safely expose OpenSearch directly to the web.
To do so, add a route to `.platform/routes.yaml` that has `opensearch:opensearch` as its upstream
(where `opensearch` is whatever you named the service).

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://www.os.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://os.{default}/"
"https://os.{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "opensearch:opensearch"
```

##### Plugins

OpenSearch offers a number of plugins.
To enable them, list them under the `configuration.plugins` key in your `.platform/services.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
opensearch:
  type: "opensearch:3"
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    plugins:
      - analysis-icu
```

In this example you'd have the ICU analysis plugin and the size mapper plugin.

If there is a publicly available plugin you need that isn't listed here, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

###### Plugin removal

Removing plugins previously added in your `.platform/services.yaml` file doesn't automatically uninstall them from your OpenSearch instances.
This is deliberate, as removing a plugin may result in data loss or corruption of existing data that relied on that plugin.
Removing a plugin usually requires reindexing.

To permanently remove a previously enabled plugin,
[upgrade the service](#upgrading) to create a new instance of OpenSearch and migrate to it.
In most cases it isn't necessary as an unused plugin has no appreciable impact on the server.

##### Upgrading

The OpenSearch data format sometimes changes between versions in incompatible ways.
OpenSearch doesn't include a data upgrade mechanism as it's expected that all indexes can be regenerated from stable data if needed.
To upgrade (or downgrade) OpenSearch, use a new service from scratch.

There are two ways to do so.

###### Destructive

In your `.platform/services.yaml` file, change the version *and* name of your OpenSearch service.
Be sure to also update the reference to the now changed service name in it's corresponding application's `relationship` block.

When you push that to Upsun Fixed, the old service is deleted and a new one with the new name is created with no data.
You can then have your application reindex data as appropriate.

This approach has the downsides of temporarily having an empty OpenSearch instance,
which your application may or may not handle gracefully, and needing to rebuild your index afterward.
Depending on the size of your data that could take a while.

###### Transitional

With a transitional approach, you temporarily have two OpenSearch services.
Add a second OpenSearch service with the new version a new name and give it a new relationship in `.platform.app.yaml`.
You can optionally run in that configuration for a while to allow your application to populate indexes in the new service as well.

Once you're ready to switch over, remove the old OpenSearch service and relationship.
You may optionally have the new OpenSearch service use the old relationship name if that's easier for your app to handle.
Your application is now using the new OpenSearch service.

This approach has the benefit of never being without a working OpenSearch instance.
On the downside, it requires two running OpenSearch servers temporarily,
each of which consumes resources and needs adequate disk space.
Depending on the size of your data, that may be a lot of disk space.
### PostgreSQL (Database service)

PostgreSQL is a high-performance, standards-compliant relational SQL database.

See the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/index.md) for more information.

**Note**: 

The [example](#usage-example) provided later in this topic is specific to using only a **primary** database. For details about using read-only replicas to improve performance of read-heavy applications, see the [PostgreSQL read-only replication](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql/postgresql-readonly-replication.md) topic.

##### Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Hibernate](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/hibernate/deploy.md#postgresql)
- [Jakarta EE](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/jakarta/deploy.md#postgresql)
- [Spring](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/postgresql.md)

**Note**: 

You can’t upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the ``postgis`` extension enabled.
For more details, see how to [upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with ](#upgrade-to-postgresql-12-with-the-postgis-extension).

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future,
so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": "main",
  "scheme": "pgsql",
  "service": "postgresql",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.postgresql.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 5432,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-afdwftq",
  "host": "postgresql.internal",
  "rel": "postgresql",
  "path": "main",
  "query": {
    "is_master": true
  },
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "type": "postgresql:18",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

##### Usage example

**Note**: 

Use the steps and sample code below if your application will connect to a **primary** PostgreSQL database. For details about using read-only replicas to improve performance of read-heavy applications, see the [PostgreSQL read-only replication](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql/postgresql-readonly-replication.md) topic.

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `postgresql` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: postgresql:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: postgresql
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - pdo_pgsql
```

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
postgresql:
  type: postgresql:18
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  postgresql:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  postgresql:
    service: postgresql
    endpoint: postgresql
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```java {}

##### Access the service directly

Access the service using the Upsun Fixed CLI by running `platform sql`.

You can also access it from your app container via [SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md).
From your [relationship data](#relationship-reference), you need: `username`, `host`, and `port`.
Then run the following command:

```bash
psql -U <USERNAME> -h <HOST> -p <PORT>
```

Using the values from the [example](#relationship-reference), that would be:

```bash
psql -U main -h postgresql.internal -p 5432
```

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

##### Exporting data

The easiest way to download all data in a PostgreSQL instance is with the Upsun Fixed CLI. If you have a single SQL database, the following command exports all data using the `pg_dump` command to a local file:

```bash
platform db:dump
```

If you have multiple SQL databases it prompts you which one to export. You can also specify one by relationship name explicitly:

```bash
platform db:dump --relationship postgresql
```

By default the file is uncompressed. If you want to compress it, use the `--gzip` (`-z`) option:

```bash
platform db:dump --gzip
```

You can use the `--stdout` option to pipe the result to another command. For example, if you want to create a bzip2-compressed file, you can run:

```bash
platform db:dump --stdout | bzip2 > dump.sql.bz2
```

It is also possible to generate the dump locally if you have the `pg_dump` command installed with `platform tunnel:single`. The command will first ask for the service and then will provide a prompt for the URI string that you can use. For example:

```bash
pg_dump -d postgresql://REPLACE_URI_FROM_OUTPUT -f dump.sql
```

##### Importing data

Make sure that the imported file contains objects with cleared ownership and `IF EXISTS` clauses. For example, you can create a DB dump with following parameters:

```bash
pg_dump --no-owner --clean --if-exists
```

The easiest way to load data into a database is to pipe an SQL dump through the `platform sql` command, like so:

```bash
platform sql < my_database_backup.sql
```

That runs the database backup against the SQL database on Upsun Fixed.
That works for any SQL file, so the usual caveats about importing an SQL dump apply
(for example, it's best to run against an empty database).
As with exporting, you can also specify a specific environment to use and a specific database relationship to use, if there are multiple.

```bash
platform sql --relationship postgresql -e <BRANCH_NAME> < my_database_backup.sql
```

**Note**: 

Importing a database backup is a destructive operation. It overwrites data already in your database.
Taking a backup or a database export before doing so is strongly recommended.

##### Sanitizing data

To ensure people who review code changes can't access personally identifiable information stored in your database,
[sanitize your preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/sanitize-db/postgresql.md).

##### Set locale for database

You can choose your locale when a database is created by setting locale-related variables. There are three ways to set a locale option, as detailed in the table below:

| Name   | Type      | Default  | Description  |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `default_ctype` | `string`  | `C.UTF-8` | The default character classification. Affects any tables created after it's set.|
| `default_collation` | `string`|`C.UTF-8`| The default collation rules. Affects any tables created after it's set.|
| `default_charset` | `string`  | `UTF8` | The default encoding character set. Affects any tables created after it's set.|

##### Multiple databases

Support for defining multiple databases and multiple users with different permissions is available in versions `10` and later of this service. 
To do so requires defining multiple endpoints.
Under the `configuration` key of your service there are two additional keys:

* `databases`:  This is a YAML array listing the databases that should be created. If not specified, a single database named `main` is created.

  Note that removing a schema from the list of `schemas` on further deployments results in **the deletion of the schema.**
* `endpoints`: This is a nested YAML object defining different credentials. Each endpoint may have access to one or more schemas (databases), and may have different levels of permission for each. The valid permission levels are:
  * `ro`: Using this endpoint only `SELECT` queries are allowed.
  * `rw`: Using this endpoint `SELECT` queries as well as `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries are allowed.
  * `admin`: Using this endpoint all queries are allowed, including DDL queries (`CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, etc.).

Consider the following illustrative example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
postgresql:
  type: "postgresql:18"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - main
      - legacy
    endpoints:
      admin:
        privileges:
          main: admin
          legacy: admin
      reporter:
        default_database: main
        privileges:
          main: ro
      importer:
        default_database: legacy
        privileges:
          legacy: rw
```

This example creates a single PostgreSQL service named `postgresql`. The server has two databases, `main` and `legacy` with three endpoints created.

* `admin`: has full access to both databases.
* `reporter`: has `SELECT` query access to the `main` database, but no access to `legacy`.
* `importer`: has `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` access (but not DDL access) to the `legacy` database. It doesn't have access to `main`.

If a given endpoint has access to multiple databases you should also specify which is listed by default in the relationships array. If one isn't specified, the `path` property of the relationship is `null`. While that may be acceptable for an application that knows the name of the database it's connecting to, automated tools like the Upsun Fixed CLI can't access the database on that relationship. For that reason, defining the `default_database` property is always recommended.

Once these endpoints are defined, you need to expose them to your application as a relationship. Continuing with the above example, your `relationships` in `.platform.app.yaml` might look like:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  # Please note: Legacy definition of the relationship is still supported:
  # More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  database:
    service: postgresql
    endpoint: admin
  reports:
    service: postgresql
    endpoint: reporter
  imports:
    service: postgresql
    endpoint: importer
```

Each database is accessible to your application through the `database`, `reports`, and `imports` relationships.
They'll be available in the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable and all have the same structure documented above, but with different credentials. You can use those to connect to the appropriate database with the specified restrictions using whatever the SQL access tools are for your language and application.

A service configuration without the `configuration` block defined is equivalent to the following default values:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
postgresql:
  type: "postgresql:18"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - main
    endpoints:
      postgresql:
        default_database: main
        privileges:
          main: admin
```

If you do not define `database` but `endpoints` are defined, then the single database `main` is created with the following assumed configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
postgresql:
  type: "postgresql:18"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - main
    endpoints: 
```

Alternatively, if you define multiple databases but no endpoints, a single user `main` is created with `admin` access to each of your databases, equivalent to the configuration below:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
postgresql:
  type: "postgresql:18"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - firstdb
      - seconddb
      - thirddb
    endpoints:
      main:
        firstdb: admin
        seconddb: admin
        thirddb: admin
```

##### Password generation

When you connect your app to a database,
an empty password is generated for the database by default.
This can cause issues with your app.

To generate real passwords for your database,
define custom endpoints in your [service configuration](#1-configure-the-service).
For each custom endpoint you create,
you get an automatically generated password,
similarly to when you create [multiple databases](#multiple-databases).
Note that you can't customize these automatically generated passwords.

After your custom endpoints are exposed as relationships in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md),
you can retrieve the password for each endpoint
through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
within your [application containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).
The password value changes automatically over time, to avoid downtime its value has to be read dynamically by your app.
Globally speaking, having passwords hard-coded into your codebase can cause security issues and should be avoided.

When you switch from the default configuration with an empty password to custom endpoints,
make sure your service name remains unchanged.
Failure to do so results in the creation of a new service,
which removes any existing data from your database.

##### Restrict access to database replicas only

  **Feature availability**

  This feature is available on Grid HA (High Availability) and Dedicated Gen 3 projects. For more information, [contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

For security reasons, you can grant your app access to replicas instead of your actual database.
To do so, when defining the relationship between your app and database,
make sure you do the following:

1. Use the [explicit endpoint syntax](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
2. Add the `-replica` suffix to the name of the endpoint you want to use.

This results in the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>-replica
```

For example, if you define a `postgresql` database as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
postgresql:
  type: "postgresql:16"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - main
      - legacy
    endpoints:
      admin:
        privileges:
          main: admin
          legacy: admin
      reporter:
        default_database: main
        privileges:
          main: ro
```

To create a replica of the `postgresql` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `admin` endpoint with admin permissions,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  postgresql:
    service: postgresql
    endpoint: admin-replica
```

To create a replica of the `postgresql` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `reporter` endpoint with read-only permissions instead,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  postgresql:
    service: postgresql
    endpoint: reporter-replica
```

##### Service timezone

To change the timezone for the current session, run `SET TIME ZONE <TIMEZONE>;`.

##### Extensions

Upsun Fixed supports a number of PostgreSQL extensions. To enable them, list them under the `configuration.extensions` key in your `.platform/services.yaml` file, like so:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
postgresql:
  type: "postgresql:18"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    extensions:
      - pg_trgm
      - hstore
```

In this case, you have `pg_trgm` installed, providing functions to determine the similarity of text based on trigram matching, and `hstore` providing a key-value store.

**Note**: 

You can’t upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the ``postgis`` extension enabled.
For more details, see how to [upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with ](#upgrade-to-postgresql-12-with-the-postgis-extension).

##### Notes

###### Could not find driver

If you see this error: `Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'could not find driver'`, this means you are missing the `pdo_pgsql` PHP extension. You need to enable it in your `.platform.app.yaml` ([see above](#1-configure-the-service)).

##### Upgrading

PostgreSQL 10 and later include an upgrade utility that can convert databases from previous versions to version 10 or later. If you upgrade your service from a previous version of PostgreSQL to version 10 or above, it upgrades automatically.

The utility can't upgrade PostgreSQL 9 versions, so upgrades from PostgreSQL 9.3 to 9.6 aren't supported. Upgrade straight to version 11 instead.

**Note**: 

Make sure you first test your migration on a separate branch.

Also, be sure to take a backup of your production environment **before** you merge this change.

**Warning**: 

Downgrading isn’t supported. If you need to downgrade, dump to SQL, remove the service, recreate the service, and import your dump.

###### Upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the `postgis` extension

You can't upgrade to PostgreSQL 12 with the `postgis` extension enabled.
It involves a change to a major version that results in a failed deployment that requires support intervention to fix.
Upgrading from 12 to a higher version is possible.

If you need to upgrade to version 12, follow the same steps recommended for downgrading:

1. Dump the database.
2. Remove the service.
3. Create a new service with PostgreSQL 12.
4. Import the dump to that service.
#### PostgreSQL read-only replication

You can improve the performance of read-heavy applications by defining read-only replicas of your PostgreSQL database and then connecting your application to those replicas. 

Examples of read-heavy applications include: 
- Listing pages or dashboards
- Reporting or analytics jobs
- Background jobs that frequently query data

**Note**: 

 - **To prevent data loss or interruptions** during replication, you must configure the disk size for each replica. The replica service does not inherit the disk size of the primary database. The replica disk size must at least match the primary service’s disk capacity. See the example below.
 - **Replication is asynchronous**: Delays of a few milliseconds might occur between writes on the primary database and reads on the replica database.
 - **Replicas are read-only**: This restriction ensures data consistency and integrity. Attempts to modify data will result in an SQL error.

####### Replica scope and sharing services {#replica-scope-sharing-services}
PostgreSQL services (which provide access to databases and replicas) defined in a project cannot be accessed by or shared with applications in other projects. 

To share the PostgreSQL service among applications in different projects, you must complete the following high-level steps: 
1. Migrate the projects to Upsun Flex.  
1. Migrate the applications that are in those projects. 
1. Move the desired applications into one Flex project, rather than separate Flex projects. In Upsun Flex, multiple applications in one project can share the same services. 

For details, see [Converting from Upsun Fixed](https://docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/migrating/from-fixed.md) in the Upsun Flex product docs.

###### 1. Configure the primary and replica services

The following code fragment defines two MariaDB services: a primary and a replica. You can use this fragment as a template by copying it into your `services.yaml` or `application.yaml` file. 

Be sure to: 
- Replace `<VERSION>` with the [supported PostgreSQL version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md#supported-versions) that you need. Use the same version number for the primary and replica services.
- Replace `<SIZE>` with a `disk` size in (MB) that is sufficient for the primary database's disk capacity.
- **Important:** Use `replicator` as the endpoint name when you define the replica service. This is a special endpoint name that the replica service uses to connect to the database.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
services:
  db:
    type: postgresql:<VERSION>
    disk: <SIZE>
    configuration:
      extensions:
        - postgis
      endpoints:
        replicator:
          replication: true

  db-replica1:
    type: postgres-replica:<VERSION>
    disk: <SIZE>
    configuration:
      endpoints:
        postgresql:
          default_database: main
      extensions:
        - postgis
    relationships: 
      primary: db:replicator # Do not change the name `primary`. The service expects to receive this name.

  db-replica2:
    type: postgres-replica:<VERSION>
    disk: <SIZE>
    configuration:
      endpoints:
        postgresql:
          default_database: main
      extensions:
        - postgis
    relationships: 
      primary: db:replicator # Do not change the name `primary`. The service expects to receive this name.
```

####### How it works

Using the sample code fragment above: 

1. After you define the replicator endpoints, the primary service creates a `replicator` user that has permission to replicate the database. You must specify `replicator` as the endpoint name, as described at the start of this topic. 

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
      replicator:
        replication: true
    ```

2. In the replica services (in this example, db-replica1 and db-replica2), defining the relationship `primary: db:replicator` ensures that the service can connect to the primary database as the `replicator` user. 

    ```yaml
    relationships:
      primary: db:replicator
    ```

The `db-replica1` and `db-replica2` replica services continuously stream data from the primary endpoint, maintaining a read-only copy of the primary database content. Write operations are not permitted on the replicas. 

###### 2. Define the relationship between the application and the replicas

Even if your application won't access the replication endpoint, you must expose the endpoint to an application as a relationship so that you can connect to it over SSH.

Add a new relationship to your application container, as shown below:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

[...]

# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
relationships:
  # More information: https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  database:
    service: db
    endpoint: main
  database-readonly:
    service: db-replica
```

### RabbitMQ (message queue service)

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.md) is a message broker
that supports multiple messaging protocols, such as the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
It gives your apps a common platform to send and receive messages
and your messages a safe place to live until they're received.

##### Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Spring](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/rabbitmq.md)

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 4.1

   - 4.0

   - 3.13

   - 3.12

   - 4.1

   - 4.0

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future,
so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": "guest",
  "scheme": "amqp",
  "service": "rabbitmq",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.rabbitmq.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 5672,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-afdwftq",
  "host": "rabbitmq.internal",
  "rel": "rabbitmq",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "type": "rabbitmq:4.1",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `rabbitmq` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: rabbitmq:<VERSION>
  disk: 512
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: rabbitmq
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
rabbitmq:
  type: rabbitmq:4.1
  disk: 512
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  rabbitmq:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  rabbitmq:
    service: rabbitmq
    endpoint: rabbitmq
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```java {}

        Config config = new Config();
        try {
            // Get the credentials to connect to the RabbitMQ service.
            final RabbitMQ credential = config.getCredential("rabbitmq", RabbitMQ::new);
            final ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = credential.get();

            // Connect to the RabbitMQ server.
            final Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();

            Queue queue = session.createQueue("cloud");
            MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue);

            // Sending a message into the queue.
            TextMessage textMessage = session.createTextMessage("Upsun Fixed");
            textMessage.setJMSReplyTo(queue);
            MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);
            producer.send(textMessage);

            // Receive the message.
            TextMessage replyMsg = (TextMessage) consumer.receive(100);

            logger.append("<p>");
            logger.append("Message: ").append(replyMsg.getText());
            logger.append("</p>");

            // close connections.
            producer.close();
            consumer.close();
            session.close();
            connection.close();
            return logger.toString();
        } catch (Exception exp) {
            throw new RuntimeException("An error when execute RabbitMQ", exp);
        }
    }

##### Connect to RabbitMQ

When debugging, you may want to connect directly to your RabbitMQ service.
You can connect in multiple ways:

- An [SSH tunnel](#via-ssh)
- A [web interface](#access-the-management-ui)

In each case, you need the login credentials that you can obtain from the [relationship](#relationship-reference).

###### Via SSH

To connect directly to your RabbitMQ service in an environment,
open an SSH tunnel with the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).

To open an SSH tunnel to your service with port forwarding,
run the following command:

```bash
platform tunnel:single --gateway-ports
```

Then configure a RabbitMQ client to connect to this tunnel using the credentials from the [relationship](#relationship-reference).
See a [list of RabbitMQ client libraries](https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.md).

###### Access the management UI

RabbitMQ offers a [management plugin with a browser-based UI](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.md).
You can access this UI with an SSH tunnel.

To open a tunnel, follow these steps.

1.
   a) (On [grid environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#grid)) SSH into your app container with a flag for local port forwarding:

    ```bash
    ssh $(platform ssh --pipe) -L 15672:<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>.internal:15672
    ```

    <RELATIONSHIP_NAME> is the [name you defined](#2-define-the-relationship).

   b) (On [dedicated environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#dedicated-gen-2)) SSH into your cluster with a flag for local port forwarding:

    ```bash
    ssh $(platform ssh --pipe) -L 15672:localhost:15672
    ```

2.  Open `http://localhost:15672` in your browser.
    Log in using the username and password from the [relationship](#relationship-reference).

##### Configuration options

You can configure your RabbitMQ service in the [services configuration](#1-configure-the-service) with the following options:

| Name     | Type              | Required | Description                                          |
|----------|-------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `vhosts` | List of `string`s | No       | Virtual hosts used for logically grouping resources. |

You can configure additional [virtual hosts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.md),
which can be useful for separating resources, such as exchanges, queues, and bindings, into their own namespaces.
To create virtual hosts, add them to your configuration as in the following example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
rabbitmq:
  type: "rabbitmq:4.1"
  disk: 512
  configuration:
    vhosts:
      - host1
      - host2
```

##### Upgrading

When upgrading RabbitMQ, skipping major versions (e.g. 3.7 -> 3.11) [is not supported](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.md#rabbitmq-version-upgradability).
Make sure you upgrade sequentially (3.7 -> 3.8 -> 3.9 -> 3.10 -> 3.11) and that each upgrade commit translates into an actual deployment.
### Redis (Object cache)

[Redis](https://redis.io/documentation) is a multi-model database that allows you to store data in memory for high-performance data retrieval and key-value storage.

Upsun Fixed supports two different Redis configurations:

- [Persistent](#persistent-redis): to set up fast persistent storage for your application
- [Ephemeral](#ephemeral-redis): to set up a non-persistent cache for your application

##### Use a framework

If you use one of the following frameworks, follow its guide:

- [Drupal](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/redis.md)
- [Ibexa DXP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/ibexa/deploy.md#redis)
- [Jakarta EE](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/jakarta/deploy.md#redis)
- [Micronaut](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/micronaut/redis.md)
- [Quarkus](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/quarkus/redis.md)
- [Spring](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/spring/redis.md)
- [WordPress](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/wordpress/redis.md)

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 8.0

   - 7.2

   - 8.0

   - 7.4

   - 7.2

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future,
so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 7.0

   - 6.2

   - 6.0

   - 5.0

   - 4.0

   - 3.2

   - 3.0

   - 2.8

   - 7.0

   - 6.2

   - 6.0

   - 5.0

   - 3.2

Note that versions 3.0 and higher support up to 64 different databases per instance of the service,
while Redis 2.8 only supports a single database.

##### Service types

Depending on your needs,
you can set up Redis as [persistent](#persistent-redis) or [ephemeral](#ephemeral-redis).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": null,
  "scheme": "redis",
  "service": "redis",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.redis.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 6379,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "redis.internal",
  "rel": "redis",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": null,
  "type": "redis:8.0",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

The format of the relationship is identical whether your Redis service is [ephemeral](#ephemeral-redis) or [persistent](#persistent-redis).

##### Persistent Redis

By default, Redis is an ephemeral service that stores data in memory.
This allows for fast data retrieval,
but also means data can be lost when a container is moved or shut down.

To solve this issue, configure your Redis service as persistent.
Persistent Redis stores data on a disk,
restoring it if the container restarts.

To switch from persistent to ephemeral Redis,
set up a new service with a different name.

**Warning**: 

Upsun Fixed sets the maximum amount of memory (``maxmemory``) Redis can use for the data set,
and it cannot be amended.
It is defined by comparing the following values and keeping the lower of the two:

 - Disk size/6 (based on a [recommendation from Redis](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/installing-upgrading/install/plan-deployment/hardware-requirements/#productionenvironment))
 - The amount of memory allocated to the service container

For instance, if your Redis container has 3072 MB of disk space and 1024 MB of memory,
only 512 MB of RAM are actually available to the service (3072/6 = 512).
But if your Redis container has 3072 MB of disk space and 256 MB of memory,
only 256 MB of RAM are actually available to the service (as per the container limit).

###### Usage example

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `redis-persistent` endpoint:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: redis-persistent:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

####### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the `redis` endpoint :

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration, you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: redis
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - redis
```

###### Configuration example

####### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
redis:
  type: redis-persistent:8.0
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
relationships:
  redis:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  redis:
    service: redis
    endpoint: redis
```

###### Use in app

To use the configured service in your app, add a configuration file similar to the following to your project.

```js {}
const redis = require('redis');
const config = require("platformsh-config").config();
const { promisify } = require('util');

exports.usageExample = async function() {
    const credentials = config.credentials('redis');
    const client = redis.createClient(credentials.port, credentials.host);

    // The Redis client is not Promise-aware, so make it so.
    const redisGet = promisify(client.get).bind(client);
    const redisSet = promisify(client.set).bind(client);

    const key = 'Deploy day';
    const value = 'Friday';

    // Set a value.
    await redisSet(key, value);

    // Read it back.
    const test = await redisGet(key);

    return `Found value <strong>${test}</strong> for key <strong>${key}</strong>.`;
};

```
```php {}
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Platformsh\ConfigReader\Config;

// Create a new config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
// You can alternatively use getenv() yourself.
$config = new Config();

// Get the credentials to connect to the Redis service.
$credentials = $config->credentials('redis');

try {
    // Connecting to Redis server.
    $redis = new Redis();
    $redis->connect($credentials['host'], $credentials['port']);

    $key = "Deploy day";
    $value = "Friday";

    // Set a value.
    $redis->set($key, $value);

    // Read it back.
    $test = $redis->get($key);

    printf('Found value <strong>%s</strong> for key <strong>%s</strong>.', $test, $key);

} catch (Exception $e) {
    print $e->getMessage();
}

```
```python {}

def usage_example():

    # Create a new config object to ease reading the Upsun Fixed environment variables.
    # You can alternatively use os.environ yourself.
    config = Config()

    # Get the credentials to connect to the Redis service.
    credentials = config.credentials('redis')

    try:
        redis = Redis(credentials['host'], credentials['port'])

        key = "Deploy day"
        value = "Friday"

        # Set a value
        redis.set(key, value)

        # Read it back
        test = redis.get(key)

        return 'Found value <strong>{0}</strong> for key <strong>{1}</strong>.'.format(test.decode("utf-8"), key)

    except Exception as e:
        return e

```

##### Ephemeral Redis

By default, Redis is an ephemeral service that serves as a non-persistent cache.
Ephemeral Redis stores data only in memory and requires no disk space.
When the service reaches its memory limit, it triggers a cache cleanup.
To customize those cache cleanups, set up an [eviction policy](#eviction-policy).

Make sure your app doesn't rely on ephemeral Redis for persistent storage as it can cause issues.
For example, if a container is moved during region maintenance,
the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks don't run and an app that treats the cache as permanent shows errors.

To prevent data from getting lost when a container is moved or shut down,
you can use the [persistent Redis](#persistent-redis) configuration.
Persistent Redis provides a cache with persistent storage.

###### Usage example

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `redis` endpoint:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: redis:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

####### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.

        return 'Found value <strong>{0}</strong> for key <strong>{1}</strong>.'.format(test.decode("utf-8"), key)

    except Exception as e:
        return e

```

##### Multiple databases

Redis 3.0 and above support up to 64 databases.
But you can't set up different access rights to each database.
When you set up a relationship connection,
access to all of the databases is automatically granted.

The way to access a particular database depends on the [client library](https://redis.io/clients) you're using:

To manage [thread safety](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/blob/master/docs/advanced_features.rst#user-content-a-note-about-threading),
the Python library suggests using separate client instances for each database:

```python {}
import os
from redis import Redis

database0 = Redis(host=os.getenv('REDIS_HOST'), port=os.getenv('REDIS_PORT'), db=0)
database1 = Redis(host=os.getenv('REDIS_HOST'), port=os.getenv('REDIS_PORT'), db=1)
```

Use the Redis [select](https://redis.io/commands/select):

```javascript {}
const redis = require('redis');

const client = redis.createClient(process.env.CACHE_PORT, process.env.CACHE_HOST);

await client.SELECT(0);                  // switch to DB 0
await client.set('x', '42');             // write 42 to x
await client.MOVE('x', 1);               // move to DB 1
await client.SELECT(1);                  // switch to DB 1
const value = await client.get('x');     // returns 42

```

##### Restrict access to database replicas only

**Feature availability**: 

This feature is only available on Dedicated Gen 3 projects. For more information, contact [Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

For security reasons, you can grant your app access to replicas instead of your actual database.
To do so, when defining the relationship between your app and database,
make sure you do the following:

1. Use the [explicit endpoint syntax](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
2. Add the `-replica` suffix to the name of the endpoint you want to use.

This results in the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>-replica
```

For example, if you define a `redis-persistent` database as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
postgresql:
  type: "redis-persistent:16"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - main
      - legacy
    endpoints:
      admin:
        privileges:
          main: admin
          legacy: admin
      reporter:
        default_database: main
        privileges:
          main: ro
```

To create a replica of the `redis-persistent` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `admin` endpoint with admin permissions,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  redis-persistent:
    service: redis-persistent
    endpoint: admin-replica
```

To create a replica of the `redis-persistent` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `reporter` endpoint with read-only permissions instead,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  redis-persistent:
    service: redis-persistent
    endpoint: reporter-replica
```

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": null,
  "scheme": "redis",
  "service": "redis",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.redis.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 6379,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "redis.internal",
  "rel": "redis",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": null,
  "type": "redis:8.0",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

The format of the relationship is identical whether your Redis service is [ephemeral](#ephemeral-redis) or [persistent](#persistent-redis).

##### Eviction policy

When Redis reaches its memory limit,
it triggers a cache cleanup.
To customize those cache cleanups, set up an eviction policy such as the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
redis:
  type: "redis:8.0"
  configuration:
    maxmemory_policy: allkeys-lfu
```

The following table presents the possible values:

| Value             | Policy description                                                                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allkeys-lru`     | Removes the oldest cache items first. This is the default policy when `maxmemory_policy` isn't set.         |
| `noeviction`      | New items aren’t saved when the memory limit is reached.                                                    |
| `allkeys-lfu`     | Removes least frequently used cache items first.                                                            |
| `volatile-lru`    | Removes least recently used cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                              |
| `volatile-lfu`    | Removes least frequently used cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                            |
| `allkeys-random`  | Randomly removes cache items to make room for new data.                                                     |
| `volatile-random` | Randomly removes cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                                         |
| `volatile-ttl`    | Removes cache items with the `expire` field set to `true` and the shortest remaining `time-to -live` value. |

For more information on the different policies,
see the official [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/memory-performance/eviction-policy/).

##### Access your Redis service

After you've [configured your Redis service](#usage-example),
you can access it using either the Upsun Fixed CLI
or through the [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/).

###### Upsun Fixed CLI

Unlike the Redis CLI, connecting via the Upsun Fixed CLI does not require additional authentication steps if you are already authenticated in your terminal.

Access your Redis service by running the command:

```bash
platform redis
```

###### Redis CLI

Retrieve the hostname and port you can connect to
through the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
To do so, run the `platform relationships` command.

After you've retrieved the hostname and port, [open an SSH session](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md).
To access your Redis service, run the following command:

```bash
redis-cli -h <HOSTNAME> -p <PORT>
```

If you have a Grid project, note that the `CONFIG GET` and `CONFIG SET` admin commands are restricted.
To get the current configuration, run the following command:

```bash
redis-cli -h <HOSTNAME> -p <PORT> info
```

##### Use Redis as a handler for PHP sessions

A PHP session allows you to store different data for each user through a unique session ID.
By default, PHP handles sessions using files.
But you can use Redis as a session handler,
which means Redis stores and retrieves the data saved into sessions.

To set up Redis as your session handler, add a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
redissessions:
    type: "redis-persistent:8.0"
    disk: 256
```

```yaml {}
name: myapp
type: "php:8.5"

relationships:
  redissessions:

variables:
  php:
    session.save_handler: redis
    session.save_path: "tcp://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>"

web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'web'
        passthru: '/index.php'
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
name: myapp
type: "php:8.5"

relationships:
  redissessions:
    service: "redissessions"
    endpoint: "redis"

variables:
  php:
    session.save_handler: redis
    session.save_path: "tcp://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>"

web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'web'
      passthru: '/index.php'
```

### Valkey

[Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is an open source datastore that can be used high-performance data retrieval and key-value storage.

Upsun Fixed supports two different Valkey configurations:

- [Persistent](#persistent-valkey): to set up fast persistent storage for your application
- [Ephemeral](#ephemeral-valkey): to set up a non-persistent cache for your application

##### Use with Drupal

If you are using the Drupal framework, you can follow its guide for Valkey:

- [Drupal](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/drupal/valkey.md)

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 8.0

   - 8.0

<!-- uncomment this section when Upsun deprecates Valkey v8
###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they aren't receiving security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future,
so migrate to one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions).

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

-->

##### Service types

Depending on your needs,
you can set up Valkey as [persistent](#persistent-valkey) or [ephemeral](#ephemeral-valkey).

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": null,
  "scheme": "valkey",
  "service": "valkey",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.valkey.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 6379,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "valkey.internal",
  "rel": "valkey",
  "path": null,
  "query": [],
  "password": null,
  "type": "valkey:8.0",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

The format of the relationship is identical whether your Valkey service is [ephemeral](#ephemeral-valkey) or [persistent](#persistent-valkey).

**Database access**: 

It should be noted that when you set up a relationship connection, access to all of the databases is automatically granted.

##### Persistent Valkey

By default, Valkey is an ephemeral service that stores data in memory.
This allows for fast data retrieval,
but also means data can be lost when a container is moved or shut down.

To solve this issue, configure your Valkey service as persistent.
Persistent Valkey stores data on a disk,
restoring it if the container restarts.

To switch from persistent to ephemeral Valkey,
set up a new service with a different name.

**Warning**: 

Upsun Fixed sets the maximum amount of memory (``maxmemory``) Valkey can use for the data set,and it cannot be amended. It is defined by comparing the following values and keeping the lower of the two:

 - Disk size
 - The amount of memory allocated to the service container

For instance, if your Valkey container has 3072 MB of disk space and 1024 MB of memory, only 512 MB of RAM are actually available to the service (3072/6 = 512).
But if your Valkey container has 3072 MB of disk space and 256 MB of memory, only 256 MB of RAM are actually available to the service (as per the container limit).

###### Usage example

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `valkey-persistent` endpoint:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
services:
  # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
    type: valkey-persistent:<VERSION>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

####### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the `valkey` endpoint :

```yaml {}
applications:
  # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
  <APP_NAME>:
    # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
    # The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
    # (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
    # See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
    relationships:
      <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration, you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [service environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).

    .platform/services.yaml

```yaml {}
applications:
  # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
  <APP_NAME>:
    # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
    # The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
    # See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
    relationships:
      <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
        endpoint: valkey
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [service environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions) for the service:

```yaml {}
applications:
  # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
  <APP_NAME>:
    # PHP extensions.
    runtime:
      extensions:
        - redis
    # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
    # The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
    # (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
    # See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
    relationships:
      <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
applications:
  # The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
  <APP_NAME>:
    # PHP extensions.
    runtime:
      extensions:
          - redis
    # Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
    # The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
    # See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
    relationships:
      <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
        service: <SERVICE_NAME>
        endpoint: valkey
```

###### Configuration example

####### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
valkey:
  type: valkey-persistent:8.0
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
relationships:
  valkey:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  valkey:
    service: valkey
    endpoint: valkey
```

##### Ephemeral Valkey

By default, Valkey is an ephemeral service that serves as a non-persistent cache.
Ephemeral Valkey stores data only in memory and requires no disk space.
When the service reaches its memory limit, it triggers a cache cleanup.
To customize those cache cleanups, set up an [eviction policy](#eviction-policy).

Make sure your app doesn't rely on ephemeral Valkey for persistent storage as it can cause issues. For example, if a container is moved during region maintenance,the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks don't run and an app that treats the cache as permanent shows errors.

To prevent data from getting lost when a container is moved or shut down,
you can use the [persistent Valkey](#persistent-valkey) configuration.
Persistent Valkey provides a cache with persistent storage.

###### Usage example

####### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `valkey` endpoint:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: valkey:8.0
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

####### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships. That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) (the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration, you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: valkey
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

For PHP, enable the [extension](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions) for the service:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# PHP extensions.
runtime:
  extensions:
    - redis
```

###### Configuration example

####### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
valkey:
  type: valkey:8.0
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
relationships:
  valkey:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
relationships:
  valkey:
    service: valkey
    endpoint: valkey
```

##### Restrict access to database replicas only

**Feature availability**: 

This feature is only available on Dedicated Gen 3 projects. For more information, contact [Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

For security reasons, you can grant your app access to replicas instead of your actual database.
To do so, when defining the relationship between your app and database,
make sure you do the following:

1. Use the [explicit endpoint syntax](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
2. Add the `-replica` suffix to the name of the endpoint you want to use.

This results in the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_NAME>-replica
```

For example, if you define a `valkey-persistent` database as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
postgresql:
  type: "valkey-persistent:8.0"
  disk: 2048
  configuration:
    databases:
      - main
      - legacy
    endpoints:
      admin:
        privileges:
          main: admin
          legacy: admin
      reporter:
        default_database: main
        privileges:
          main: ro
```

To create a replica of the `valkey-persistent` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `admin` endpoint with admin permissions,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  valkey-persistent:
    service: valkey-persistent
    endpoint: admin-replica
```

To create a replica of the `valkey-persistent` database and allow your app to connect to it
through the `reporter` endpoint with read-only permissions instead,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  valkey-persistent:
    service: valkey-persistent
    endpoint: reporter-replica
```

##### Eviction policy

When Valkey reaches its memory limit, it triggers a cache cleanup.
To customize those cache cleanups, set up an eviction policy such as the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
services:
  # The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
  valkey:
    type: "valkey:8.0"
    configuration:
      maxmemory_policy: allkeys-lfu
```

The following table presents the possible values:

| Value             | Policy description                                                                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allkeys-lru`     | Removes the oldest cache items first. This is the default policy when `maxmemory_policy` isn't set.         |
| `noeviction`      | New items aren’t saved when the memory limit is reached.                                                    |
| `allkeys-lfu`     | Removes least frequently used cache items first.                                                            |
| `volatile-lru`    | Removes least recently used cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                              |
| `volatile-lfu`    | Removes least frequently used cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                            |
| `allkeys-random`  | Randomly removes cache items to make room for new data.                                                     |
| `volatile-random` | Randomly removes cache items with the `expire` field set to `true`.                                         |
| `volatile-ttl`    | Removes cache items with the `expire` field set to `true` and the shortest remaining `time-to -live` value. |

##### Migrate from Redis to Valkey
It is possible for a user to switch from `redis-persistent` to `valkey-persistent` without losing data. To make this switch, change the type of the service from `redis-persistent` to `valkey-persistent` (also note the version change), while keeping the same service name. For example, replace this:

```json
my_service_name:
  type: redis-persistent:7.2
  disk: 256

```

with the following:

```json
my_service_name:
  type: valkey-persistent:8.0
  disk: 256
```

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": null,
  "scheme": "solr",
  "service": "solr",
  "fragment": null,
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.solr.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 8080,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-afdwftq",
  "host": "solr.internal",
  "rel": "solr",
  "path": "solr\/collection1",
  "query": [],
  "password": null,
  "type": "solr:9.9",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `solr` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: solr:<VERSION>
  disk: 256
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <SERVICE_NAME>:
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [default endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
That is, it uses default endpoints behind-the-scenes, providing a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)
(the network address a service is accessible from) that is identical to the name of that service.
Depending on your needs, instead of default endpoint configuration,
you can use [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: solr
```

You can define ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` and ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like, so long as it’s unique between all defined services and relationships
and matches in both the application and services configuration.
The example above leverages [explicit endpoint](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) configuration for relationships.
Depending on your needs, instead of explicit endpoint configuration,
you can use [default endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
With the above definition, the application container now has [access to the service](#use-in-app) via the relationship ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` and its corresponding [PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: solr:9.9
  disk: 256
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  solr:
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
# Note that legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
# More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
relationships:
  solr:
    service: solr
    endpoint: solr
```

##### Solr 4

For Solr 4, Upsun Fixed supports only a single core per server called `collection1`.

You must provide your own Solr configuration via a `core_config` key in your `.platform/services.yaml`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: "solr:4.10"
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    core_config: !archive "<DIRECTORY>"
```

<DIRECTORY> points to a directory in the Git repository, in or below the `.platform/` folder. This directory needs to contain everything that Solr needs to start a core. At the minimum, `solrconfig.xml` and `schema.xml`.

For example, place them in `.platform/solr/conf/` such that the `schema.xml` file is located at `.platform/solr/conf/schema.xml`. You can then reference that path like this -

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: "solr:4.10"
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    core_config: !archive "solr/conf/"
```

##### Solr 6 and later

For Solr 6 and later Upsun Fixed supports multiple cores via different endpoints. Cores and endpoints are defined separately, with endpoints referencing cores. Each core may have its own configuration or share a configuration. It is best illustrated with an example.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: solr:9.9
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    cores:
      mainindex:
        conf_dir: !archive "core1-conf"
      extraindex:
        conf_dir: !archive "core2-conf"
    endpoints:
      main:
        core: mainindex
      extra:
        core: extraindex
```

The above definition defines a single Solr 9.9 server. That server has 2 cores defined:

- `mainindex` — the configuration for which is in the `.platform/core1-conf` directory
- `extraindex` — the configuration for which is in the `.platform/core2-conf` directory.

It then defines two endpoints: `main` is connected to the `mainindex` core while `extra` is connected to the `extraindex` core. Two endpoints may be connected to the same core but at this time there would be no reason to do so. Additional options may be defined in the future.

Each endpoint is then available in the relationships definition in `.platform.app.yaml`. For example, to allow an application to talk to both of the cores defined above its configuration should contain the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: "php:8.5"

[...]

relationships:
  solrsearch1: "solr:main"
  solrsearch2: "solr:extra"
```

That is, the application's environment would include a `solrsearch1` relationship that connects to the `main` endpoint, which is the `mainindex` core, and a `solrsearch2` relationship that connects to the `extra` endpoint, which is the `extraindex` core.

The relationships array would then look something like the following:

```json
{
  "solrsearch1": [
    {
      "path": "solr/mainindex",
      "host": "248.0.65.197",
      "scheme": "solr",
      "port": 8080
    }
  ],
  "solrsearch2": [
    {
      "path": "solr/extraindex",
      "host": "248.0.65.197",
      "scheme": "solr",
      "port": 8080
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Configsets

For even more customizability, it's also possible to define Solr configsets. For example, the following snippet would define one configset, which would be used by all cores. Specific details can then be overridden by individual cores using `core_properties`, which is equivalent to the Solr `core.properties` file.

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: solr:8.4
  disk: 1024
  configuration:
    configsets:
      mainconfig: !archive "configsets/solr8"
    cores:
      english_index:
        core_properties: |
          configSet=mainconfig
          schema=english/schema.xml
      arabic_index:
        core_properties: |
          configSet=mainconfig
          schema=arabic/schema.xml
    endpoints:
      english:
        core: english_index
      arabic:
        core: arabic_index
```

In this example, `.platform/configsets/solr8` contains the configuration definition for multiple cores. There are then two cores created:

- `english_index` uses the defined configset, but specifically the `.platform/configsets/solr8/english/schema.xml` file
- `arabic_index` is identical except for using the `.platform/configsets/solr8/arabic/schema.xml` file.

Each of those cores is then exposed as its own endpoint.

Note that not all core properties features make sense to specify in the `core_properties`. Some keys, such as `name` and `dataDir`, aren't supported, and may result in a `solrconfig` that fails to work as intended, or at all.

###### Default configuration

####### Default for version 9+

If you don't specify any configuration, the following default is used:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: solr:9.9
  configuration:
    cores:
      collection1:
        conf_dir: !archive "example"
    endpoints:
      solr:
        core: collection1
```

The example configuration directory is equivalent to the [Solr example configuration set](https://github.com/apache/solr/tree/main/solr/server/solr/configsets/sample_techproducts_configs/conf).
This default configuration is designed only for testing.
You are strongly recommended to define your own configuration with a custom core and endpoint.

####### Default for versions below 9

If you don't specify any configuration, the following default is used:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
solr:
  type: solr:9.9
  configuration:
    cores:
      collection1: {}
    endpoints:
      solr:
        core: collection1
```

The default configuration is based on an older version of the Drupal 8 Search API Solr module that is no longer in use.
You are strongly recommended to define your own configuration with a custom core and endpoint.

###### Limitations

The recommended maximum size for configuration directories (zipped) is 2MB. These need to be monitored to ensure they don't grow beyond that. If the zipped configuration directories grow beyond this, performance declines and deploys become longer. The directory archives are compressed and string encoded. You could use this bash pipeline

```bash
echo $(($(tar czf - . | base64 | wc -c )/(1024*1024))) Megabytes
```

inside the directory to get an idea of the archive size.

The configuration directory is a collection of configuration data, like a data dictionary, e.g. small collections of key/value sets. The best way to keep the size small is to restrict the directory context to plain configurations. Including binary data like plugin `.jar` files inflates the archive size, and isn't recommended.

##### Accessing the Solr server administrative interface

Because Solr uses HTTP for both its API and admin interface it's possible to access the admin interface over an SSH tunnel.

```bash
platform tunnel:single --relationship <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>
```

By default, this opens a tunnel at `127.0.0.1:30000`.

You can now open `http://localhost:30000/solr/` in a browser to access the Solr admin interface.
Note that you can't create indexes or users this way,
but you can browse the existing indexes and manipulate the stored data.

For Dedicated Gen 2 use `ssh -L 8888:localhost:8983 USER@CLUSTER_NAME.ent.platform.sh` to open a tunnel instead,
after which the Solr server administrative interface is available at `http://localhost:8888/solr/`.

##### Available plugins

This is the complete list of plugins that are available and loaded by default:

| Plugin                                                                             | Description                                            | 8.11 | 9.x |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------|-----|
| [JTS](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_1/spatial-search.md#jts-and-polygons-flat) | Library for creating and manipulating vector geometry. |*     |*    |
| [ICU4J](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_3/language-analysis.md)                  | Library providing Unicode and globalization support.                                                                                                                                      |*     |*    |

##### Upgrading

The Solr data format sometimes changes between versions in incompatible ways. Solr doesn't include a data upgrade mechanism as it is expected that all indexes can be regenerated from stable data if needed. To upgrade (or downgrade) Solr you need to use a new service from scratch.

There are two ways of doing that.

###### Destructive

In your `.platform/services.yaml` file, change the version of your Solr service *and* its name.
Be sure to also update the reference to the now changed service name in it's corresponding application's `relationship` block.

When you push that to Upsun Fixed, the old service is deleted and a new one with the name is created, with no data. You can then have your application re-index data as appropriate.

This approach has the downside of temporarily having an empty Solr instance, which your application may or may not handle gracefully, and needing to rebuild your index afterward. Depending on the size of your data that could take a while.

###### Transitional

For a transitional approach you temporarily have two Solr services. Add a second Solr service with the new version a new name and give it a new relationship in `.platform.app.yaml`. You can optionally run in that configuration for a while to allow your application to populate indexes in the new service as well.

Once you're ready to cut over, remove the old Solr service and relationship. You may optionally have the new Solr service use the old relationship name if that's easier for your application to handle. Your application is now using the new Solr service.

This approach has the benefit of never being without a working Solr instance. On the downside, it requires two running Solr servers temporarily, each of which consumes resources and need adequate disk space. Depending on the size of your data that may be a lot of disk space.
### Varnish

Varnish is a popular HTTP proxy server, often used for caching.
You usually don't need it with Upsun Fixed as the standard router includes HTTP cache
and a CDN would cover more advanced uses.
But you can include Varnish as a service.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

##### How it works

All incoming requests go through the [standard router](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).
The Varnish service sits between the router and all apps in the project.

```mermaid {no-copy="true"}
graph LR
  A(Request) -->B(Router)
  B --> C{Varnish}
  C -->D[App 1]
  C -->E[App 2]
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `varnish` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: varnish:<VERSION>
  relationships:
    <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>: '<APP_NAME>:http'
  configuration:
    vcl: !include
      type: string
      path: config.vcl
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

The `relationships` block defines the connection between Varnish and your app.
You can define ``<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>`` as you like.
``<APP_NAME>`` should match your app's `name` in the [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md).

The `configuration` block must reference a VCL file inside the `.platform` directory.
The `path` defines the file relative to the `.platform` directory.

###### Example configuration

######## [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
varnish:
  type: varnish:7.3
  relationships:
    application: 'myapp:http'
  configuration:
    vcl: !include
      type: string
      path: config.vcl
```

Notice the `relationship` (`application`) defined for the service `varnish` granting access to the application container `myapp`.

###### 2. Create a VCL template

To tell Varnish how to handle traffic, in the `.platform` directory
add a [Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) template](https://www.varnish-software.com/developers/tutorials/example-vcl-template/).

This template is supplemented by automatic additions from Upsun Fixed.
So you MUST NOT include certain features that you might elsewhere:

- A `vcl_init()` function:
   The function is automatically generated based on the relationships you defined in Step 1.
   Each defined relationship results in a backend with the same name.
- The VCL version at the start:
  This is automatically generated.
- Imports for `std` or `directors`:
  These are already imported.
  You can import other [modules](#include-modules).

The file MUST include:

- A definition of which backend to use in a  `vcl_recv()` subroutine.

The logic varies based on whether you have one or more apps.

**Note**: 

Misconfigured VCL files can result in incorrect and confusing behavior that’s hard to debug.
Upsun Fixed doesn’t help with VCL configuration options beyond the basic connection logic documented here.

You can see any compilation errors with the [stats endpoint](#stats-endpoint).

####### Example VCL template with one app

To serve one app, your VCL template needs at least the following function:

```bash {location="config.vcl" }
sub vcl_recv {
    set req.backend_hint = <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>.backend();
}
```

Where `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` is the name of the relationship you defined in [Step 1](#1-configure-the-service).
With the [example configuration](#example-configuration), that would be the following:

```bash  {location="true/config.vcl"}
sub vcl_recv {
    set req.backend_hint = application.backend();
}
```

####### Example VCL template with multiple apps

If you have multiple apps fronted by the same Varnish instance,
your VCL templates needs logic to determine where each request is forwarded.

For example, you might have the following configuration for two apps:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
varnish:
  type: varnish:7.6
  relationships:
    blog: 'blog:http'
    main: 'app:http'
  configuration:
    vcl: !include
      type: string
      path: config.vcl
```

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
blog:
  # The location of the application's code.
  source:
    root: "backends/blog"
  # The type of the application to build.
  type: "php:8.5"

app:
  # The location of the application's code.
  source:
    root: "backends/main"
  # The type of the application to build.
  type: "nodejs:24"
```

You could then define that all requests to `/blog/` go to the `blog` app and all other requests to the other app:

```bash  {location="true/config.vcl"}
sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.url ~ "^/blog/") {
        set req.backend_hint = blog.backend();
    } else {
        set req.backend_hint = main.backend();
    }
}
```

###### 3. Route incoming requests to Varnish

Edit your [route definitions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) to point to the Varnish service you just created.
Also disable the router cache as Varnish now provides caching.

To forward all incoming requests to Varnish rather than your app, you could have the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "varnish:http"
  cache:
    enabled: false
```

Varnish forwards requests to your app based on the specified VCL template.

##### Include modules

You can include the following optional modules in your VCL templates to add additional features:

- `cookie`
- `header`
- `saintmode`
- `softpurge`
- `tcp`
- `var`
- `vsthrottle`
- `xkey`

To use them, add an import to your template such as the following:

```bash  {location="true/config.vcl"}
import xkey;
```

##### Circular relationships

At this time, Upsun Fixed doesn't support circular relationships between services and apps.
That means you can't add a relationship from an app fronted by Varnish to the Varnish service.
If you do so, then one of the relationships is skipped and the connection doesn't work.

##### Rate limit connections

Sometimes you want to ensure that users, whether human or machine, can't overload your app with requests.
One tool to help is using Varnish to limit the rate at which connections can be made.

For example, say you want to make sure no one can make more than 20 requests within 10 seconds.
If they do, you want to block them from any more requests for 2 minutes.

To do so, [import the `vsthrottle` module](#include-modules)
and add logic similar to the following to your VCL template:

```bash  {location="true/config.vcl"}
import vsthrottle;

sub vcl_recv {
  # The Upsun Fixed router provides the real client IP as X-Client-IP
  # This replaces client.identity in other implementations
  if (vsthrottle.is_denied(req.http.X-Client-IP, 20, 10s, 120s)) {
    # Client has exceeded 20 requests in 10 seconds.
    # When this happens, block that IP for the next 120 seconds.
    return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
  }

  # Set the standard backend for handling requests that aren't limited
  set req.backend_hint = application.backend();
}
```

##### Clear cache with a push

You may want at times to clear a specific part of your cache when you know the content is outdated.
With Varnish, you can clear the content with [purging and banning](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/purging.md).

The following example shows how to set up purging.

1. Add an access control list to your VCL template:

   ```bash  {location="true/config.vcl"}
   acl purge {
       "localhost";
       "192.0.2.0"/24;
   }
   ```

   This list ensures that only requests from the listed IPs are accepted.
   Choose which IPs to allow.
   If you are sending requests from an app, checkout the [outbound IPs for the region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md#public-ip-addresses).

   Alternatively, you could code in a token that must be sent with the request.

2. Add purge handling:

   ```bash  {location="true/config.vcl"}
   sub vcl_recv {
       if (req.method == "PURGE") {
           # The Upsun Fixed router provides the real client IP as X-Client-IP
           # Use std.ip to convert the string to an IP for comparison
           if (!std.ip(req.http.X-Client-IP, "0.0.0.0") ~ purge) {
               # Deny all purge requests not from the allowed IPs
               return(synth(403,"Not allowed."));
           }
           # Purge cache for allowed requests
           return (purge);
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

  **Note**: 

The snippet above has been produced for Varnish 7.x. If using a different version, consult the [Varnish documentation](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/) for potential differences in syntax and required parameters.

3. Set up cache purging to suit your needs.
   The following cURL call gives an example of how this can work:

   ```bash
   curl -X PURGE "<URL_TO_PURGE>"
   ```

##### Stats endpoint

The Varnish service also offers an `http+stats` endpoint,
which provides access to some Varnish analysis and debugging tools.

You can't use it from an app fronted by Varnish because of the restriction with [circular relationships](#circular-relationships).
To access the stats, create a **separate app** (`stats-app`) with a relationship *to* Varnish, but not *from* it.
Define [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md) similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
# The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
stats-app:
  # The location of the application's code.
  source:
    root: "stats"
  # The type of the application to build.
  type: "python:3.13"
  # Unique relationship _to_ Varnish from 'stats-app', where no relationship
  #   is defined _from_ Varnish to the same app, to avoid circular relationships.
  relationships:
    varnishstats:
      service: varnish
      endpoint: "http+stats"
# The name of the app container. Must be unique within a project.
main-app:
  # The location of the application's code.
  source:
    root: "backends/main"
  # The type of the application to build.
  type: "nodejs:24"
```

```yaml {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
varnish:
  type: varnish:7.6
  # Unique relationship _from_ Varnish _to_ 'main-app', where no relationship
  #   is defined _to_ Varnish to the same app, to avoid circular relationships.
  relationships:
    main: "main-app:http"
  configuration:
    vcl: !include
      type: string
      path: config.vcl
```

You choose any valid name and type.
When the app is deployed, the app can access the Varnish service over HTTP to get diagnostic information.
The following paths are available:

- `/`: returns any error logged when generating the VCL template failed
- `/config`: returns the generated VCL template
- `/stats`: returns the output of `varnishstat`
- `/logs`: returns a streaming response of `varnishlog`

To access the Varnish stats endpoint from the command line:

1. Connect to your stats app [using SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/_index.md): `platform ssh --app stats-app`
   (replace `stats-app` with the name you gave the app).
2. Display the [relationships array](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) with `echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 -d | jq .`,
3. Query Varnish with `curl <HOST>:<PORT>/stats`, replacing `<HOST>` and `<PATH>` with the values from Step 2.
### Vault key management service

The Vault key management service (KMS) provides key management and access control for your secrets.
The Upsun Fixed Vault KMS offers the [transit secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/transit)
to sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt, and rewrap information.

Vault doesn't store the data sent to the transit secrets engine,
so it can be viewed as encryption as a service.
To store secrets such as API keys, create sensitive [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

##### Relationship reference

Example information available through the [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)
or by running `platform relationships`.

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed.
So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

```json
{
  "username": "",
  "scheme": "http",
  "service": "vault-kms",
  "fragment": "",
  "ip": "123.456.78.90",
  "instance_ips": [
    "123.456.78.90"
  ],
  "hostname": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm.vault-kms.service._.eu-1.platformsh.site",
  "port": 8200,
  "cluster": "azertyuiopqsdf-main-7rqtwti",
  "host": "vault_secret.internal",
  "rel": "sign",
  "path": "\/",
  "query": {
    "is_master": true
  },
  "password": "ChangeMe",
  "type": "vault-kms:1.12",
  "public": false,
  "host_mapped": false
}
```

##### Usage example

###### 1. Configure the service

To define the service, use the `vault-kms` type:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
<SERVICE_NAME>:
  type: vault-kms:<VERSION>
  disk: 512
  configuration:
    endpoints:
      <ENDPOINT_ID>:
        - policy: <POLICY>
          key: <KEY_NAME>
          type: <ENDPOINT_TYPE>
```

Note that changing the name of the service replaces it with a brand new service and all existing data is lost.
Back up your data before changing the service.

- ``<SERVICE_NAME>`` is the name you choose to identify the service.
- ``<VERSION>`` is a supported version of the service.
- ``<ENDPOINT_ID>`` is an identifier you choose for the endpoint.
- ``<KEY_NAME>`` is the name of the key to be stored in the Vault KMS.
- ``<POLICY>`` is one of the available [policies](#policies) based on what you want to accomplish.
- The `type` is one of:

  - `sign`: for signing payloads, with the type `ecdsa-p256`
  - `encrypt` (for encrypt`chacha20-poly1305`).

  The `type` can't be changed after creation.

You can create multiple endpoints, such as to have key management separate from key use.

512 MB is the minimum required disk space for the Vault KMS service.

###### 2. Define the relationship

To define the relationship, use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# Relationships enable access from this app to a given service.
# The example below shows configuration with an explicitly set service name and endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  <RELATIONSHIP_NAME>:
    service: <SERVICE_NAME>
    endpoint: <ENDPOINT_ID>
```

You can define `<SERVICE_NAME>` as you like, so long as it's unique between all defined services
and matches in both the application and services configuration.

The example above leverages [explicit endpoint configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) for relationships.
That is, it utilizes the `endpoint` key to explicitly connect an individually accessible `relationship` to a specific Vault endpoint.

With the above definition, the application container now has access to the service via the relationship `<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` and its corresponding [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

If you split the service into multiple endpoints, define multiple relationships.

###### Example configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
vault-kms:
  type: vault-kms:1.12
  disk: 512
  configuration:
    endpoints:
      manage_keys:
        - policy: admin
          key: vault-sign
          type: sign
        - policy: sign
          key: vault-sign
          type: sign
        - policy: verify
          key: vault-sign
          type: sign
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  # Please note: Legacy definition of the relationship is still supported:
  # More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  vault_secret:
    service: "vault-kms"
    endpoint: "manage_keys"
```

###### Multiple endpoints configuration

###### [Service definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
# The name of the service container. Must be unique within a project.
vault-kms:
  type: vault-kms:1.12
  disk: 512
  configuration:
    endpoints:
      management:
        - policy: admin
          key: admin-key
          type: sign
      sign_and_verify:
        - policy: sign
          key: signing-key
          type: sign
        - policy: verify
          key: signing-key
          type: sign
```

####### [App configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  # Please note: Legacy definition of the relationship is still supported.
  # More information: https://docs.upsun.com/anchors/fixed/app/reference/relationships/
  vault_manage:
    service: vault-kms
    endpoint: management
  vault_sign:
    service: vault-kms
    endpoint: sign_and_verify
```

##### Use Vault KMS

To connect your app to the Vault KMS, use a token that's defined in the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable.
With this token for authentication,
you can use any of the policies you [defined in your `.platform/services.yaml` file](#1-configure-the-service).

Note that the information about the relationship can change when an app is redeployed or restarted or the relationship is changed. So your apps should only rely on the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable directly rather than hard coding any values.

The following examples use cURL as an example, which you could do in a hook or after accessing your app with SSH.
Adapt the examples for your app's language.

###### Get the token

To make any calls to the Vault KMS, you need your token. Get it from the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable:

```bash
echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r ".<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>[0].password"
```

`<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` is the name you [defined in your `.platform.app.yaml` file](#2-define-the-relationship).

The `-r` flag returns the string itself, not wrapped in quotes.

You can also store this as a variable:

```bash
VAULT_TOKEN=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r ".<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>[0].password")
```

A given token is valid for one year from its creation.

###### Get the right URL

The `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable also contains the information you need to construct a URL for contacting the Vault KMS: the `host` and `port`.

Assign it to a variable as follows:

```bash
VAULT_URL=$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r ".<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>[0].host"):$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r ".<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>[0].port")
```

`<RELATIONSHIP_NAME>` is the name you [defined in your `.platform.app.yaml` file](#2-define-the-relationship).

###### Manage your keys

Your key names are [defined in your `.platform/services.yaml` file](#1-configure-the-service). You can manage them if you've set an [admin policy](#policies) for them.

To get information on a key, such as its expiration date, run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://"$VAULT_URL"/v1/transit/keys/"$KEY_NAME" | jq .
```

`$KEY_NAME` is the name in your `.platform/services.yaml` file.

To rotate the version of your key, run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://"$VAULT_URL"/v1/transit/keys/"$KEY_NAME">/rotate \
  --request POST
```

###### Sign and verify payloads

If you've set [sign and verify policies](#policies), you can use your keys to sign and verify various payloads, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication in your app. Note that all payloads (all plaintext data) must be base64-encoded.

To sign a specific payload, run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://$VAULT_URL/v1/transit/sign/"$KEY_NAME"/sha2-512 \
  --data "{\"input\": \"$(echo SECRET | base64)\"}"
```

The string at the end of the URL denotes the specific [hash algorithm used by the Vault KMS](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/secret/transit#hash_algorithm).

You get back a JSON object that includes the signature for the payload:

```json
{
  "request_id": "a58b549f-1356-4028-d191-4c9cd585ca25",
  ...
  "data": {
    "key_version": 1,
    "signature": "vault-kms:v1:MEUCIAiN4UtXh..."
  },
  ...
}
```

You can then use `data.signature` to sign things such as a JWT.

To verify a payload, run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://"$VAULT_URL"/v1/transit/verify/"$KEY_NAME"/sha2-512 \
  --data "
{
  \"input\": \"$(echo SECRET | base64)\",
  \"signature\": \"$SIGNATURE\"
}"
```

You get back a JSON object that includes whether or not the signature is valid:

```json
{
  "request_id": "5b624718-fd9d-37f6-8b95-b387379d2648",
  ...
  "data": {
    "valid": true
  },
  ...
}
```

A `true` value means the signature matches and a `false` value means it doesn't.

###### Encrypt and decrypt data

If you've set [encrypt and decrypt policies](#policies), you can use your keys to encrypt and decrypt any data you want. Note that all of plaintext data you work with must be base64-encoded.

To sign a specific payload, run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://$VAULT_URL/v1/transit/encrypt/"$KEY_NAME" \
  --data "{\"plaintext\": \"$(echo SECRET | base64)\"}"
```

You get back a JSON object that includes your encrypted data:

```json
{
  "request_id": "690d634a-a4fb-bdd6-9947-e895578b79d5",
  ...
  "data": {
    "ciphertext": "vault-kms:v1:LEtOWSwh3N...",
    "key_version": 1
  },
  ...
}
```

To decrypt data that you've already encrypted, run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://"$VAULT_URL"/v1/transit/decrypt/"$KEY_NAME" \
  --data "
{
  \"ciphertext\": \"$CIPHERTEXT\"
}"
```

You get back a JSON object that your decrypted data base64-encoded:

```json
{
  "request_id": "bbd411ca-6ed7-aa8b-8177-0f35055ce613",
  ...
  "data": {
    "plaintext": "U0VDUkVUCg=="
  },
  ...
}
```

To get the value un-encoded, add `| jq -r ".data.plaintext" | base64 -d` to the end of the `curl` command.

####### Rewrap encrypted data

If you have already encrypted data and you have [changed your key version](#manage-your-keys), you can rewrap the encrypted data with the new key.

Assuming `$CIPHERTEXT` stores your encrypted data (`vault:v1:LEtOWSwh3N...`), run the following command:

```bash
curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
  http://"$VAULT_URL"/v1/transit/rewrap/"$KEY_NAME" \
  --data "
{
  \"ciphertext\": \"$CIPHERTEXT\"
}"
```

In the JSON object that's returned, you can notice that the `ciphertext` is different (and now includes the new key version as a prefix) as is the `key_version`:
```json
{
  ...
  "data": {
    "ciphertext": "vault-kms:v2:ICRi0yAlH...",
    "key_version": 2
  },
  ...
}
```

##### Policies

| Policy    | Endpoint | Capabilities | Purpose |

### Server Side Includes (SSI)


SSI commands enable you to include files within other pages.

At its most basic, you can include files within other ones so as not to repeat yourself.

Start by enabling SSI:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"
  ssi:
    enabled: true
```

Then create a file you want to include elsewhere:

```html  {location="includes/example.html"}
This content can be reused
```

And include it in another file:

```html  {location="index.html"}

  This content is unique to this page.

```

And your final rendered page includes the other file:

```html  {location="index.html"}

  This content is unique to this page.
  This content can be reused

```

##### Caching and dynamic content

You can use SSI to have [caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md) and dynamic content in one.
So one file is cached, while another updates dynamically.

For example, you can activate SSI on one route with cache disabled and enable cache on another route:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"
  ssi:
    enabled: true
  cache:
    enabled: false

"https://{default}/cache":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"
  cache:
    enabled: true
```

Then create a page that displays the current date and time and is cached for 60 seconds
(the example uses PHP, but any server-side language would work):

```php  {location="cache/example.php"}
<?php
header("Cache-Control: max-age=60");
echo date(DATE_RFC2822);
```

Then you could have a page with dynamic content that includes this file:

```php  {location="index.php"}
<?php
echo date(DATE_RFC2822);
?>

```

Then you can visit `index.php` and refresh the page a few times.
You see the first number updating to the current time, while the second (included) one only changes every 60 seconds.

For more on SSI, see the [nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.md).
### HTTP cache


Upsun Fixed supports HTTP caching at the server level. Caching is enabled by default, but is only applied to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.

The cache can be controlled using the `cache` key in your `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

If a request can be cached, Upsun Fixed builds a cache key from several request properties and stores the response associated with this key.
When a request comes with the same cache key, the cached response is reused.

When caching is on...

* you can configure cache behavior for different location blocks in your `.platform.app.yaml`;
* the router respects whatever cache headers are sent by the application;
* cookies bypass the cache;
* responses with the `Cache-Control` header set to `Private`, `No-Cache`, or `No-Store` aren't cached.

You should _not_ use the Upsun Fixed HTTP cache if you're using [Varnish](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/varnish.md) or an external CDN
such as [Fastly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md) or [Cloudflare](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/cloudflare.md).
Mixing cache services together most likely results in caches that are stale and can't be cleared.
For more details, see [best practices on HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/bestpractices/http-caching.md).

##### Basic usage

The HTTP cache is enabled by default, however you may wish to override this behavior.

To configure the HTTP cache, add a `cache` key to your route. You may like to start with the defaults:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: myapp:http
  cache:
    enabled: true
    default_ttl: 0
    cookies: ['*']
    headers: ['Accept', 'Accept-Language']
```

##### Example

In this example, requests are cached based on the URI, the `Accept` header, `Accept-Language` header, and `X-Language-Locale` header.
Any response that lacks a `Cache-Control` header is cached for 60 seconds.
The presence of any cookie in the request disables caching of that response.

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  upstream: myapp:http
  cache:
    enabled: true
    headers: ['Accept', 'Accept-Language', 'X-Language-Locale']
    cookies: ['*']
    default_ttl: 60
```

##### How it works

###### The cache key

If a request can be cached, Upsun Fixed builds a cache key from several request properties and stores the response associated with this key. When a request comes with the same cache key, the cached response is reused.

There are two parameters that let you control this key: `headers` and `cookies`.

The default value for these keys are the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  # ...
  cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ['*']
    headers: ['Accept', 'Accept-Language']
```

###### Duration

The cache duration is decided based on the `Cache-Control` response header value. If no `Cache-Control` header is in the response, then the value of `default_ttl` key is used.

###### Conditional requests

Conditional requests using `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` are both supported. The web server doesn't honor the `Pragma` request header.

###### Cache revalidation

When the cache is expired (indicated by `Last-Modified` header in the response) the web server sends a request to your application with `If-Modified-Since` header.

If the `If-None-Match` header is sent in the conditional request when `Etag` header is set in the cached response, your application can extend the validity of the cache by replying `HTTP 304 Not Modified`.

###### Flushing

The HTTP cache doesn't support a complete cache flush, but you can invalidate the cache by setting `cache: false`. Alternatively, the cache clears on a rebuild, so triggering a rebuild (pushing a new commit) effectively causes a complete cache flush.

##### Cache configuration properties

###### `enabled`

Turns the cache on or off for a route.

**Note**: 

Regular expressions in routes are **not** supported.

###### Allowing only specific cookies

Some applications use cookies to invalidate cache responses, but expect other cookies to be ignored.
This is a case of allowing only a subset of cookies to invalidate the cache.

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  # ...
  cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ["MYCOOKIE"]
```

###### Cache HTTP and HTTPS separately using the `Vary` header

Set the Vary header to `X-Forwarded-Proto` [custom request header](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/headers.md) to render content based on the request protocol (i.e. HTTP or HTTPS). By adding `Vary: X-Forwarded-Proto` to the response header, HTTP and HTTPS content would be cached separately.

###### Cache zipped content separately

Use `Vary: Accept-Encoding` to serve different content depending on the encoding. Useful for ensuring that gzipped content isn't served to clients that can't read it.
### HTTPS

Using HTTPS for your site helps ensure your users' information remains secure.
HTTPS provides enhanced security thanks to the following characteristics:

- With HTTPS, data is encrypted so user activity can't be tracked and user information can't be stolen.
- HTTPS prevents the corruption of files transferred from a web server to a website and vice-versa.
- HTTPS also authenticates websites, which helps build trust with your users.

To enable HTTPS on your site, you need [Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates](#tls-certificates).

##### TLS certificates

Upsun Fixed automatically provides TLS certificates for all sites and environments.
These certificates are issued at no charge by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and cover most needs.
They're valid for 90 days and automatically renewed 28 days before expiration.

To use them, you only need to [specify HTTPS routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#enable-https).
Note that [limitations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#lets-encrypt-limitations) apply.
If you encounter issues with the TLS certificates provided by Upsun Fixed,
check that [TLS encryption is up-and-running](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/troubleshoot.md#verify-ssltls-encryption).

If you don't want to use the TLS certificates provided by Upsun Fixed,
configure your own [third-party TLS certificates](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/tls.md).

###### Let's Encrypt limitations

When you use the Let's Encrypt [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates) provided by Upsun Fixed,
the following limitations apply.

Let's Encrypt allows a maximum of 100 hostnames per certificate.
You can have 1 Let's Encrypt certificate for each of your environments.
If you define both a `{default}` and a `www.{default}` route for each domain you use,
you can add up to 50 hostnames.
Going over this limitation results in a warning on deploy and no new TLS certificates are issued.

If you need more hostnames, you can obtain additional certificates
or a wildcard certificate from a [third-party issuer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/tls.md).
Alternatively, consider splitting your project up into multiple Upsun Fixed projects.

Please note that when using multiple domains, the Common Name (CN) to which the certificate is issued to
is not guaranteed to be the same on each certificate renewal.

###### Certificate renewals

When you use the [TLS certificates](#tls-certificates) provided by Upsun Fixed,
certificate renewals are automatic.
They trigger a redeployment of your environment.
During this redeployment, required security and system upgrades are applied to your containers.
So the duration of the redeployment depends on what needs to be upgraded.

##### Enable HTTPS

To enable HTTPS, add a routing configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"

"https://www.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://{default}/"
```

All traffic to your domain is then sent to your app.
The `www` subdomain redirects to the [default domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md#default).
This also includes redirecting requests from HTTP to HTTPS.

For more information, see how to [define routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

##### Optional: Configure TLS connections

When you [specify HTTPS routes](#enable-https),
you can use the `tls` setting to further configure your TLS connections.

###### Enforce TLS 1.3

Although you can still use TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 is faster and more secure.
To instruct your web server to automatically reject TLS 1.2 connections,
enforce TLS 1.3 using the `min_version` setting:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
tls:
  min_version: TLSv1.3
```

Note that TLS versions older than 1.2 are deprecated and are rejected by default.

###### Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

[HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) forces clients to always communicate with your site over HTTPS.
To enable HSTS, use `strict_transport_security` in a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
tls:
  strict_transport_security:
    enabled: true
    include_subdomains: true
    preload: true
```

The following table presents the possible properties for `strict_transport_security`:

| Name                 | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                    |
|----------------------|-----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`            | `boolean` | `null`  | If set to `true`, HSTS is enabled for 1 year. If set to `false`, other properties are ignored. |
| `include_subdomains` | `boolean` | `false` | To specify whether HSTS applies to all subdomains.                                             |
| `preload`            | `boolean` | `false` | To add your website to the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/). Thanks to this list, most browsers are informed that your site requires HSTS before an HSTS header response is even issued. |

Note that when you enable or disable HSTS, the entire domain is affected.
Make sure you only add the HSTS configuration to a single route.
Having different routes with conflicting HSTS configurations can cause issues.

###### Enable mTLS

Standard TLS connections are useful to verify the identity of web servers and their certificates.
But you can also instruct your web server to verify the identity of clients and their certificates.
This allows you to restrict access to trusted users.

To do so, enable mTLS by adding the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
tls:
  client_authentication: "require"
```

By default, all valid TLS certificates issued by a legitimate certificate authority are accepted.
But you can instruct your web server to only accept TLS certificates issued by specific or even custom certificate authorities.

To do so, add a configuration similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
tls:
  client_authentication: "require"
  client_certificate_authorities:
    - !include
      type: string
      path: root-ca1.crt
    - !include
      type: string
      path: root-ca2.crt
```

In this case, the certificate files are resolved relative to the `.platform` directory.
Alternatively, you can specify the certificates inline in the file:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
tls:
  client_authentication: "require"
  client_certificate_authorities:
    - |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ### Several lines of characters here ###
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    - |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ### Several lines of different characters here ###
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

If you want to request a client certificate without _requiring_ the client to send one, you can set this by using `request` as a value for `client_authentication`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
routes:
  "https://{default}/":
    # ...
    tls:
      client_authentication: "request"
    # ...
```

Requests on routes with mTLS configured that are passed through to your app will contain additional headers such as `X-Client-Verify` (with values like `Success` or `None` depending on whether a client certificate was presented and validated or not) and `X-Client-Cert` (with information about the client certificate that was used) that your application can use as required.
### Proxy routes

**Warning**: 

Only use this feature to address edge cases where you need to proxy to another, outside project. 
**Do not use this for internal routing.** 
To expose your app to the outside world, see [how to define routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

Sometimes you want your app to pass requests on to a different Upsun Fixed project.
Basic redirects only work within the same project, so use proxy routes for routes elsewhere.

You can define an external proxy on your Upsun Fixed project by defining a route like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/foo:
  type: proxy
  to: https://www.example.com
```

This route passes requests for `https://{default}/foo/index.html` to `https://www.example.com/foo/index.html`.

You can also define a proxy route to an URL composed of an IP address and a port:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/foo:
  type: proxy
  to: https://192.0.2.0:8000
```

**Note**: 

Cache is disabled on this type of route and cannot be enabled.

##### URL paths

In the basic example above, the route preserves the URL path, `/foo`, in the request.

If you want to proxy a route to `https://www.example.com` without the URL path `/foo`,
add a trailing slash `/` to the `to` definition.

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/foo:
  type: proxy
  to: https://www.example.com/
```

The trailing slash makes the proxy route interpret the location as having a different path.
So requests for `https://{default}/foo/index.html` are forwarded to `https://www.example.com/index.html`.

To override the URL path entirely, define a route that contains its own path.
For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/foo:
  type: proxy
  to: https://www.example.com/bar
```

This route passes requests for `https://{default}/foo/index.html` to `https://www.example.com/bar/index.html`.

##### Multiple apps with the same base URL

You can use proxy routes to map a single domain to multiple Upsun Fixed projects with their own subdomain/domain names.
You might have a need to access multiple projects, each hosting specific applications for different languages.
You want to serve them all at the same base URL with different paths
(`https://example.com/en`, `https://example.com/fr`, and so on).

Because domains can't be reused at Upsun Fixed, you can't just set the same domain for all projects.
Use proxy routes so a single project can access different projects using the same base URL.

In the following example, a single project specifies proxy routes to three apps with the same `default` base URL.
Each app handles a different language.

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/en:
  type: proxy
  to: https://en.example.com/

https://{default}/jp:
  type: proxy
  to: https://jp.example.com/

https://{default}/pt:
  type: proxy
  to: https://pt.example.com/
```

The apps behind the proxy need to ensure links to assets are shown to the target domain.
For example, by changing `https://en.example.com/style.css` to `https://example.com/en/style.css`.

The following diagram shows the example project forwarding specific requests to the correct app.

```mermaid {no-copy="true"}

    Project->>+Pt: pt.example.com/index.html
    Note over Pt: Changes asset links
    Pt-->>-Project: index.html
    Project-->>-User: index.html
```

###### Large projects

This architecture makes the router of a single project into the central element of your app.
This setup may make scaling more difficult as the router scales with the size of that project.
The router can become a bottleneck for all external sites and acts as a single point of failure.

For larger projects, you should handle multiple websites with the same base URL via a [CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md).
### Redirects


Managing redirection rules is a common requirement for web applications, especially in cases where you do not want to lose incoming links that have changed or been removed over time.

You can manage redirection rules on your Upsun Fixed projects in two different ways, which we describe here. If neither of these options satisfy your redirection needs, you can still implement redirects directly from within your application, which if implemented with the appropriate caching headers would be almost as efficient as using the configuration options provided by Upsun Fixed.

**Route limits**: 

Please note that the maximum size of the routes document is 128 KB, which should fit around 300 different routes. [Read more about route limits here.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md#route-limits)

##### Whole-route redirects

Using whole-route redirects, you can define very basic routes in your [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) file whose sole purpose is to redirect. A typical use case for this type of route is adding or removing a `www.` prefix to your domain, as the following example shows:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: redirect
  to: https://www.{default}/
```
The default HTTP status code for Whole-route redirects is `301`. See [Specify a HTTP status code](#specify-a-http-status-code) to change the status code that is used.

##### Partial redirects

In the [`.platform/routes.yaml`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) file you can also add partial redirect rules to existing routes:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  # ...
  redirects:
    expires: 1d
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://example.com/'
      '^/foo/(.*)/bar':
        to: 'https://example.com/$1'
        regexp: true
```

This format is richer and works with any type of route, including routes served directly by the application. The default HTTP status code for partial redirects is `302`. See [Specify a HTTP status code](#specify-a-http-status-code) to change the status code that is used.

Two keys are available under `redirects`:

| Key                | Required | Description |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `expires`          | No       | The duration the redirect is cached. Examples of valid values include `3600s`, `1d`, `2w`, `3m`.  To disable caching for all your redirects, set `expires` to `0`. You can also [disable caching on a specific redirect](#disable-caching-on-your-redirects). |
| `paths`            | Yes      | The paths to be redirected |

Each rule under `paths` is defined by a key describing:
- The expression to match against the request path
- A value object describing both the destination to redirect to, with detail on how to handle the redirection

The value object is defined with the following keys:

| Key                | Required | Default |Description |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `to`               | Yes      | n/a     | A relative URL - `'/destination'`, or absolute URL - `'https://example.com/'`. |
| `regexp`           | No       | `false` | Specifies whether the path key should be interpreted as a PCRE regular expression. If you use a capturing group, the replace field (`$1`) has to come after a slash (`/`). [More information](#redirects-using-regular-expressions).|
| `prefix`           | No       | `true`, but not supported if `regexp` is `true` | Specifies whether both the path and all its children or just the path itself should be redirected. [More information](#redirects-using-prefix-and-append_suffix).|
| `append_suffix`    | No       | `true`, but not supported if `regexp` is `true` or if `prefix` is `false`  | Determines if the suffix is carried over with the redirect. [More information](#redirects-using-prefix-and-append_suffix).|
| `code`             | No       | n/a     | HTTP status code. Valid status codes are `301`, `302`, `307`, and `308`. Defaults to `302` for [Partial redirects](#partial-redirects), and `301` for [Whole-route redirects](#whole-route-redirects). [More information](#specify-a-http-status-code). |
| `expires`          | No       | Defaults to the `expires` value defined directly under the `redirects` key, but can be fine-tuned. To [disable caching on a specific redirect](#disable-caching-on-your-redirects), set `expires` to `0`. | The duration the redirect is cached for. [More information](#manage-caching).

To set up partial redirects, you can use regular expressions (`regexp`). 
Alternatively, and in many cases, you can use the `prefix` and/or `append_suffix` keys to achieve the same results. 
Here are some examples to illustrate this and help you choose a method for your partial redirects:

It achieves the same result as this basic redirect:

```yaml {}
'/from':
  to: https://example.com/to
```

Consider this redirect using ``prefix``:

```yaml {}
'/from':
  to: https//example.com/to
  prefix: false
```

It achieves the same result as this ``regexp`` redirect:

```yaml {}
'^/from$':
  regexp: true
  to: https://example.com/to
```

Consider this redirect using ``append_suffix``:

```yaml {}
'/from':
    to: https//example.com/to
    append_suffix: false
```

It achieves the same result as this ``regexp`` redirect:

```yaml {}
'^/from(/.*|)$':
    regexp: true
    to: https://example.com/to
```

**Warning**: 

If you’re using ``regexp`` in a redirect, you can’t also use ``prefix`` and ``append_suffix``.
Likewise, if you’re using ``prefix`` and ``append_suffix``, you can’t also use ``regexp``.

###### Redirects using regular expressions

You can use regular expressions to configure your redirects.

In the following example, a request to `https://example.com/foo/a/b/c/bar` redirects to `https://example.com/a/b/c`:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '^/foo/(.*)/bar':
        to: 'https://example.com/$1'
        regexp: true
```

The following special arguments in the `to` statement are available when `regexp` is set to `true`:

- `$is_args` evaluates to `?` or empty string
- `$args` evaluates to the full query string if any
- `$arg_foo` evaluates to the value of the query parameter `foo`
- `$uri` evaluates to the full URI of the request.

###### Redirects using `prefix` and `append_suffix`

Instead of using regular expressions to configure your redirects,
you might want to use the `prefix` and `append_suffix` keys.

**Warning**: 

If you’re using ``regexp`` in a redirect, you can’t also use ``prefix`` and ``append_suffix``.
Likewise, if you’re using ``prefix`` and ``append_suffix``, you can’t also use ``regexp``.

When set to `true`, which is their default value, `prefix` and `append_suffix` are equivalent.
For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://{default}/to'
        prefix: true
```
```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://{default}/to'
        append_suffix: true
```

With both configurations:

- `/from` redirects to `/to`
- `/from/some/path` redirects to `/to/some/path`

However, when set to `false`, `prefix` and `append_suffix` behave differently.
For example, with the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://{default}/to'
        prefix: false
```

A request to `/from/` redirects to `/to/some/path`, but a request to `/from/some/path` does not.

And with the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://{default}/to'
        append_suffix: false
```

A request to `/from/some/path` (and any path after `/from`) redirects to just `/to`.

###### Specify a HTTP status code

To set a specific HTTP status code for your redirect, use the `code` key:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://example.com/'
        code: 308
      '/here':
        to: 'https://example.com/there'
   ```

In this example, redirects from `/from` use a `308` HTTP status code,
while redirects from `/here` default to `302` ("found", as long as the resource is indeed found as a result from the redirect).

###### Manage caching

You can [set an expiration time on your redirects](#set-an-expiration-time-on-your-redirects)
or even [disable caching](#disable-caching-on-your-redirects) on them.

####### Set an expiration time on your redirects

You can specify how long you want your redirects to be cached for.
To do so, use the `expires` key under the `redirects` key.

In the following example, all redirects are cached for two weeks:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    expires: 2w
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://example.com/'
      '/here':
        to: 'https://example.com/there'
```

If you want to set a different expiration time for a specific redirect,
use the same `expires` key, but under the `paths` key.

In the following example:

- The first redirect uses the default expiration time set on all redirects
  and is cached for two weeks
- The second redirect ignores the default expiration time set on all redirects,
  and is cached for three days instead

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    expires: 2w
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://example.com/'
      '/here':
        to: 'https://example.com/there'
        expires: 3d
```

**Note**: 

You can set an expiration time on a specific redirect (under the ``paths`` key)
even if you haven’t defined a default expiration time on all your redirects (under the ``redirects`` key).

The expiration time you set on a specific redirect (under the ``paths`` key) overwrites any default expiration time
you may have set on all your redirects (under the ``redirects`` key).

####### Disable caching on your redirects

To disable caching on all your redirects, set the `expires` key to `0` under the `redirects` key:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    expires: 0
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://example.com/'
      '/here':
        to: 'https://example.com/there'
```

To disable caching on a specific redirect only,
set the `expires` key to `0` under the relevant path in the `paths` section.

In the following example, caching is disabled on the second redirect only:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
  type: upstream
  # ...
  redirects:
    paths:
      '/from':
        to: 'https://example.com/'
      '/here':
        to: 'https://example.com/there'
        expires: 0
```

##### Other redirects

###### Application-driven redirects

If neither whole-route or partial redirects satisfy your redirection needs,
you can still implement redirects directly in your application.
If sent with the appropriate caching headers,
this is nearly as efficient as implementing the redirect through one of the two configurations described above.
Implementing application-driven redirects depends on your own code or framework and is beyond the scope of this documentation.

###### Query-strings based redirects

Upsun Fixed **does not** support redirects based on query strings.

If you want to redirect based on query strings, this logic has to be implemented by your application.

### C#/.NET Core


Upsun Fixed supports deploying .NET applications by allowing developers to define a build process and pass its variables to the .NET Core build environment.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 7.0

   - 6.0

   - 8.0

  None available

###### Specify the language

To use .Net Core, specify `dotnet` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'dotnet:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'dotnet:8.0'
```

##### Building the application

To build basic applications in .NET containers, it's enough to use the [`dotnet publish` command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish)
with the default [framework-dependent deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-framework-dependent):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -xe
    dotnet publish --output "$PLATFORM_OUTPUT_DIR" \
      -p:UseRazorBuildServer=false \
      -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
```

where `PLATFORM_OUTPUT_DIR` is the output directory for compiled languages available at build time.

Typically, .NET Core builds start a collection of build servers, which are helpful for repeated builds.
On Upsun Fixed, however, if this process isn't disabled,
the build process doesn't finish until the idle timeout is reached.

As a result, you should include `-p` toggles that disable the Razor compiler for dynamic CSHTML pages (`UseRazorBuildServer`)
and the .NET MSBuild compiler (`UseSharedCompilation`).

If you want multiple builds for your application,
make sure to call `dotnet build-server shutdown` at the end of your build hook.

##### Running the application

.NET Core applications should be started using the `web.commands.start` directive in `.platform.app.yaml`.
This ensures that the command starts at the right moment and stops gracefully when a redeployment needs to be executed.
Also, should the program terminate for any reason, it's automatically restarted.
Note that the start command _must_ run in the foreground.

Incoming requests are passed to the application using either a TCP (default) or Unix socket.
The application must use the [appropriate environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#where-to-listen) to determine the URI to listen on.
For a TCP socket ([recommended](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874850)), the application must listen on `http://127.0.0.1`,
using the `PORT` environment variable.

There is an Nginx server sitting in front of your application.
Serving static content via Nginx is recommended, as this allows you to control headers (including cache headers)
and also has marginal performance benefits.

Note that HTTPS is also terminated at the Nginx proxy,
so the `app.UseHttpsRedirection();` line in `Startup.cs` should be removed.
To force HTTPS-only, refer to the [routes documentation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#enable-https).

The following example configures an environment to serve the static content folders commonly found in [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) templates using Nginx,
while routing other traffic to the .NET application.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      root: "wwwroot"
      allow: true
      passthru: true
      rules:
        # Serve these common asset types with customs cache headers.
        \.(jpe?g|png|gif|svgz?|css|js|map|ico|bmp|eot|woff2?|otf|ttf)$:
          allow: true
          expires: 300s
  commands:
    start: "dotnet WebApplication1.dll"
```
You can also route all requests to the application unconditionally:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      allow: false
      passthru: true

  commands:
    start: "dotnet WebApplication1.dll"
```

##### Project templates

  The following list shows templates available for .NET Core apps.

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

### Elixir

###### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Upsun Fixed supports building and deploying applications written in Elixir. There is no default flavor for the build phase, but you can define it explicitly in your build hook. Upsun Fixed Elixir images support both committed dependencies and download-on-demand. The underlying Erlang version is 22.0.7.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |

###### Specify the language

To use Elixir, specify `elixir` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  type: 'elixir:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform/applications.yaml"}
myapp:
  type: 'elixir:1.18'
```

##### Built-in variables

Upsun Fixed exposes relationships and other configuration as [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Most notably, it allows a program to determine at runtime what HTTP port it should listen on
and what the credentials are to access [other services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).

To get the `PORT` environment variable (the port on which your web application is supposed to listen) you would:

```elixir
String.to_integer(System.get_env("PORT") || "8888")
```

Some of the environment variables are in JSON format and are base64 encoded. You would need to import a JSON parsing library such as [JSON](https://hexdocs.pm/json/readme.md) or [Poison](https://hexdocs.pm/poison/api-reference.md) to read those. (There is an example for doing this to decode the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable in the section [below](#accessing-services-manually).)

**Tip**: 

Remember ``config/prod.exs`` is evaluated at **build time** and has no access to runtime configuration. Use ``config/releases.exs`` to configure your runtime environment.

##### Building and running the application

If you are using Hex to manage your dependencies, you need to specify the `MIX_ENV` environment variable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    MIX_ENV: 'prod'
```
The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` variable is generated automatically based on the [`PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
You can change it.

Include in your build hook the steps to retrieve a local Hex and `rebar`, and then run `mix do deps.get, deps.compile, compile` on your application to build a binary.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    mix local.hex --force
    mix local.rebar --force
    mix do deps.get --only prod, deps.compile, compile
```
**Note**: 

That build hook works for most cases and assumes that your ``mix.exs`` file is located at [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).

Assuming `mix.exs` is present at your app root and your build hook matches the above,
you can then start it from the `web.commands.start` directive.

The following basic app configuration is sufficient to run most Elixir applications.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: 'elixir:1.18'

variables:
  env:
    MIX_ENV: 'prod'

hooks:
  build: |
    mix local.hex --force
    mix local.rebar --force
    mix do deps.get --only prod, deps.compile, compile

web:
  commands:
    start: mix phx.server
  locations:
    /:
      allow: false
      passthru: true
```
Note that there is still an Nginx proxy server sitting in front of your application. If desired, certain paths may be served directly by Nginx without hitting your application (for static files, primarily) or you may route all requests to the Elixir application unconditionally, as in the example above.

##### Dependencies

The recommended way to handle Elixir dependencies on Upsun Fixed is using Hex.
You can commit a `mix.exs` file in your repository and the system downloads the dependencies in your `deps` section using the build hook above.

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
	  {:platformshconfig, "~> 0.1.0"}
    ]
  end
```

##### Accessing Services

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

If you are building a Phoenix app for example, it would suffice to add a database to `.platform/services.yaml` and a relationship in `.platform.app.yaml`. Put the lib in your `deps` and, assuming you renamed the `prod.secret.exs` to `releases.exs` per the [Phoenix guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/releases.md), change:

```elixir
System.get_env("DATABASE_URL")
```

to

```elixir
Platformsh.Config.ecto_dsn_formatter("database")
```

See [Config Reader Documentation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app) for the full API.

###### Accessing Services Manually

The services configuration is available in the environment variable `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`.

Given a [relationship](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships) defined in `.platform.app.yaml`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# Relationships enable an app container's access to a service.
# The example below shows simplified configuration leveraging a default service
# (identified from the relationship name) and a default endpoint.
# See the Application reference for all options for defining relationships and endpoints.
relationships:
  postgresql:
```

Assuming you have in `mix.exs` the Poison library to parse JSON:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:poison, "~> 3.0"}
    ]
  end
```

And assuming you use `ecto` you could put in `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
relationships = Poison.decode!(Base.decode64!(System.get_env("PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS")))
[postgresql_config | _tail] = relationships["postgresql"]

config :my_app, Repo,
  database: postgresql_config["path"],
  username: postgresql_config["username"],
  password: postgresql_config["password"],
  hostname: postgresql_config["host"]
```

and setup Ecto during the deploy hook:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  deploy: |
    mix do ecto.setup
```

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the[ Elixir configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-elixir/).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

### Go


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

###### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Upsun Fixed supports building and deploying applications written in Go using Go modules. They’re compiled during the Build hook phase, and support both committed dependencies and download-on-demand.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

###### Specify the language

To use Go, specify `golang` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'golang:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'golang:1.25'
```

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they don't receive security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future – consider migrating to a [supported version](#supported-versions).

   - 1.19

   - 1.18

   - 1.17

   - 1.16

   - 1.15

   - 1.14

   - 1.13

   - 1.12

   - 1.11

   - 1.10

   - 1.9

   - 1.8

##### Go toolchain auto download

Even though you select a specific version of Go, starting in Go 1.21, the `go` command will automatically download and use a different toolchain version as requested by the `toolchain` directive in `go.mod`, or the `GOTOOLCHAIN` environmental variable (see [Go Toolchains](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain)).

**Note**: 

Still, it is important to keep your chosen version of Go updated in your yaml configuration file. This will ensure that you are using the most up to date software for your projects.

##### Go modules

The recommended way to handle Go dependencies on Upsun Fixed is using Go module support in Go 1.11 and later. That allows the build process to use `go build` directly without any extra steps, and you can specify an output executable file of your choice. (See the examples below.)

##### Building and running the application

Assuming your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are present in your repository, your application can be built with the command `go build`, to produce a working executable. You can then start it from the `web.commands.start` directive. Note that the start command _must_ run in the foreground. If the program terminates for any reason it is automatically restarted.

The following basic `.platform.app.yaml` file is sufficient to run most Go applications.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp

type: golang:1.14

hooks:
  build: |
    # Modify this line if you want to build differently or use an alternate name for your executable.
    go build -o bin/app

web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: tcp
    protocol: http

  commands:
    # If you change the build output in the build hook above, update this line as well.
    start: ./bin/app

  locations:
    /:
      # Route all requests to the Go app, unconditionally.
      allow: false
      passthru: true

disk: 1024
```

Note that there is still an Nginx proxy server sitting in front of your application.
If desired, certain paths may be served directly by Nginx without hitting your application (for static files, primarily)
or you may route all requests to the Go application unconditionally, as in the example above.

##### Accessing services

To access various [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) with Go, see the following examples. The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.

```

You can get all information about a deployed environment,
including how to connect to services, through [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
Your app can [access these variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

You can also use the library to read other environment variables.

```go
package main

import (
	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
	psh "github.com/platformsh/gohelper"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {

	p, err := psh.NewPlatformInfo()

	if err != nil {
		panic("Not in an Upsun Fixed Environment.")
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// ...
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":"+p.Port, nil)
}
```

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the [Go configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-go/).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

##### Project templates

  The following list shows templates available for Go apps.

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

    Gin
    This template demonstrates building the Gin framework for Upsun Fixed using Go modules.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that demonstrates how to connect to a MariaDB server for data storage.  It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.
Gin is a lightweight web framework written in Go that emphasizes performance.

###### Features:

 - Go 1.14

 - MariaDB 10.4

 - Git module-based build

    View the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/gin).

        ![Deploy on  ](https://platform.sh/images/deploy/lg-blue.svg)

### Java


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

###### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Java is a general-purpose programming language, and one of the most popular in the world today. Upsun Fixed supports Java runtimes that can be used with build management tools such as Gradle, Maven, and Ant.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major version. But the latest compatible minor version is applied automatically and can’t be overridden.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like.
When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

###### OpenJDK versions:

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 21

   - 19

   - 18

   - 17

   - 11

   - 8

   - 17

   - 11

   - 8

These versions refer to the headless packages of OpenJDK.
To save space and reduce potential vulnerabilities, they don't contain GUI classes, which can't be used on the server.

###### Specify the language

To use Java, specify `java` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'java:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'java:21'
```

##### Support build automation

Upsun Fixed supports the most common project management tools in the Java ecosystem, including:

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)

###### Manage Maven versions

Java containers come with a version of Maven already installed.
You may need to use a specific different version to manage your project.
If the version you need differs from the version on your container, you can install the specific version that you need.

Add something like the following to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    MAVEN_VERSION: <DESIRED_VERSION_NUMBER>

hooks:
  build: |
    curl -sfLO "https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/$MAVEN_VERSION/binaries/apache-maven-$MAVEN_VERSION-bin.tar.gz"
    tar -zxf apache-maven-$MAVEN_VERSION-bin.tar.gz
    export PATH="$PWD/apache-maven-$MAVEN_VERSION/bin:$PATH"
    mvn --version
    mvn clean package
```
##### Other JVM languages

It’s worth remembering that the JVM by its specification [doesn't read Java code](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/index.md), but bytecode. So within the JVM, it’s possible to [run several languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages). Upsun Fixed supports several of them, such as Kotlin, Groovy, and Scala, so long as that language works with any build automation that Upsun Fixed supports.

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the[ Java configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

If your Java framework allows, you can instead overwrite configuration following the [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/config).
That removes the need for an additional dependency.

##### Project templates

  The following list shows templates available for Java apps.

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

  Templates in development.

#### Java featured frameworks

###### Monolith/Single Application

To start a Java application, you need to understand the [Upsun Fixed structure](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/structure.md).
You will need to configure your [application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md), [routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md),
and [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).

####### Application

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: 'java:<VERSION>' [1]
disk: 1024
hooks:
  build: [2]
web:
  commands:
    start: [3]
```
1. [A Java version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/java.md#supported-versions), e,g.: `java:21`
2. [Hooks define what happens when building the application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md). This build process typically generates an executable file such as a uber-jar e.g.: `mvn clean package`
3. [The commands key defines the command to launch the application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web-commands). E.g.:  `java -jar file.jar`
4. In the start's command needs to receive the port where the application will execute thought the `PORT` environment. That's best when your app follows the port bind principle. E.g.: `java -jar jar --port=$PORT`

**Note**: 

Be aware that after the build, it creates a read-only system. You have the [mount option to create a writable folder](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).

####### Route

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http" [1]
"https://www.{default}/":
  type: redirect
  to: "https://{default}/"
```
1. It defines the application will link in the route, e.g.: `"myapp:http"`

**Note**: 

Application instances have a limited amount of memory at build time, which has a maximum of 8 GB.
At runtime that limit depends on your plan and configuration.
A stateless application can be scaled horizontally to multiple application instances using Varnish in a [load balancer](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439676899474) configuration.

###### Microservices

You have the option to use several languages in microservices. If you're using Java there are several options to aggregate these services into a microservices:

* [Maven Modules](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.md)
* [Gradle Multi-project](https://guides.gradle.org/creating-multi-project-builds/)
* [Git submodules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md)

[Upsun Fixed supports multiple applications](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) and there are two options:

* One application YAML file to each application
* Aggregate all applications in a single file with an `.platform/applications.yaml` file

**Note**: 

You can load balance to some or [all applications in the project cluster](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439662235026).

###### Access to managed services

Upsun Fixed provides [managed services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) such as databases, cache and search engines.
However, you can use a database or any services such as a transition process, just be aware of the [firewall](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#firewall).

When applications need to access a service, it is important to include the [`relationships` key](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships).
By default an application may not talk to any other container without a `relationship` explicitly allowing access.

To connect to a service from your deployed application, you need to pass the relationships information into your application's configuration.
The way to do so varies with the application.
The most common mechanisms are listed below.

####### Overwrite

If you are using a framework that follows the [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology, particularly the [third point](https://12factor.net/config), you can configure the application directly from environment variables.
Examples of such frameworks include Spring, Eclipse MicroProfile Config, Quarkus, and Micronauts.

Service credentials are available within the [**PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS** environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
This variable is a base64-encoded JSON object with keys of the relationship name and values of arrays of relationship endpoint definitions.

Upsun Fixed supports the [`jq` tool](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), which allows to extract information from this JSON.

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export DB_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresql[0].host')"
```

To reduce the number of lines in the application file and to make it cleaner,
you have the option to move the variable environment to another file: a [`.environment` file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script).

E.g.:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export DB_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresql[0].host')"
export DB_PASSWORD="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresql[0].password')"
export DB_USER="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresql[0].username')"
export DB_DATABASE="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.postgresql[0].path')"
export JDBC="jdbc:postgresql://${HOST}/${DATABASE}"
export JAVA_MEMORY="-Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m"
export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_MEMORY -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError"
```

This `.environment` can interact to each application file. E.g.:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: "java:11"
disk: 1024
hooks:
  build: ./mvnw package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.package.uber-jar=true
relationships:
  postgresql:
web:
  commands:
    start: java -jar $JAVA_OPTS $CREDENTIAL -Dquarkus.http.port=$PORT jarfile.jar
```
####### Using Java Config Reader

If your framework doesn't support configuration via environment variables, use the [Config Reader](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).
This library provides a streamlined way to interact with an Upsun Fixed environment. It offers utility methods to access routes and relationships more cleanly than reading the raw environment variables yourself. [See the maven dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/sh.platform/config).

```java
import Config;

Config config = new Config();
MySQL database = config.getCredential("postgresql", MySQL::new);
DataSource dataSource = database.get();
```

#### Performance tuning Java


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

There are a number of settings that can be adjusted for each application to optimize its performance on Upsun Fixed.

###### Memory limits

The JVM generally requires specifying a maximum memory size it is allowed to use, using the `Xmx` parameter.
That should be set based on the available memory on the application container, which varies with its size.

To extract the container-scaled value on the command line, use `$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)`.

You should also set the `ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`.
When you enable this option, the JVM exits on the first occurrence of an out-of-memory error.
Upsun Fixed will restart the application automatically.

These are the recommended parameters for running a Java application. Thus, the command to use to start a Java application is:

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError //The rest of the arguments and the jar file.
```

###### Garbage collection

When migrating the application to a cloud environment, it is often essential to analyze the Garbage Collector's log and behavior. For this, there are two options:

* Placing the log into the Upsun Fixed `/var/log/app.log` file (which captures `STDOUT`).
* Creating a log file specifically for the GC.

To use the `STDOUT` log, you can add the parameter `-XX: + PrintGCDetails`, E.g.:

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+PrintGCDetails //The rest of the arguments and the jar file.
```

Java supports a number of different garbage collection strategies.
Which one is optimal for your application varies depending on your available memory, Java version, and application profile.
Determining which is best for your application is out of scope, but the main options and how to enable them are:

| Name        | Command  Flag         | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|Serial Garbage Collector|-XX:+UseSerialGC|This is the simplest GC implementation, as it basically works with a single thread.|
|Parallel Garbage Collector|-XX:+UseParallelGC|Unlike Serial Garbage Collector, this uses multiple threads for managing heap space. But it also freezes other application threads while performing GC.|
|CMS Garbage Collector|-XX:+USeParNewGC|The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) implementation uses multiple garbage collector threads for garbage collection. It's for applications that prefer shorter garbage collection pauses, and that can afford to share processor resources with the garbage collector while the application is running.|
|G1 Garbage Collector|-XX:+UseG1GC|Garbage First, G1, is for applications running on multiprocessor machines with large memory space.|

The default strategy on Java 9 and later is G1.
The GC strategy to use can be set in the start line with:

####### Serial

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseSerialGC //The rest of the arguments and the jar file.
```

####### Parallel Garbage Collector

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseParallelGC //The rest of the arguments and the jar file.
```

####### CMS Garbage Collector

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+USeParNewGC //The rest of the arguments and the jar file.
```

####### G1

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseG1GC //The rest of the arguments and the jar file.
```

###### Java 8 Optimization

Ideally, all applications should run the latest LTS release of the JVM at least.
That is currently Java 11.
Java 11 has a number of performance improvements, particularly on container-based environments such as Upsun Fixed.

However, in many cases, this isn't possible.
If you are still running on Java 8 there are two additional considerations.

The default garbage collector for Java 8 is Parallel GC.
In most cases G1 will offer better performance.
We recommend enabling it, as above.

Furthermore, there is the `UseStringDeduplication` flag which works to eliminate duplicate `String`s within the GC process.
That flag can save between 13% to 30% of memory, depending on application. However, this can impact on the pause time of your app.

```bash
java -jar -Xmx$(jq .info.limits.memory /run/config.json)m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+PrintGCDetails
```

### JavaScript/Node.js


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

###### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Node.js is a popular asynchronous JavaScript runtime.
Deploy scalable Node.js apps of all sizes on Upsun Fixed.
You can also develop a microservice architecture mixing JavaScript and other apps with [multi-app projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md).

##### Supported versions

You can select the major version. But the latest compatible minor version is applied automatically and can’t be overridden.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like.
When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

###### Specify the language

To use Node.js, specify `nodejs` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'nodejs:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'nodejs:24'
```

To use a specific version in a container with a different language, [use a version manager](node-version.md).

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they don't receive security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future – consider migrating to a [supported version](#supported-versions).

##### Usage example

To use JavaScript with Node.js on Upsun Fixed, configure your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)
(a complete example is included at the end).

###### 1. Specify the version

Choose a version from the [list of supported versions](#supported-versions)
and add it to your app configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'nodejs:24'
```

###### 2. Specify any global dependencies

Add the following to your app configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'nodejs:24'
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    sharp: "*"
```

These are now available as commands, the same as installing with `npm install -g`.

###### 3. Build your app

Include any commands needed to build and setup your app in the `hooks`, as in the following example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'nodejs:24'
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    sharp: "*"
hooks:
  build: |
    npm run setup-assets
    npm run build
```

###### 4. Start your app

Specify a command to start serving your app (it must be a process running in the foreground):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'nodejs:24'
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    sharp: "*"
hooks:
  build: |
    npm run setup-assets
    npm run build
web:
  commands:
    start: node index.js
```

###### 5. Listen on the right port

Make sure your Node.js application is configured to listen over the port given by the environment.
The following example uses the [`platformsh-config` helper](#configuration-reader):

```js
// Load the http module to create an http server.
const http = require('http');

// Load the Upsun Fixed configuration
const config = require('platformsh-config').config();

const server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"});
    response.end("Hello world!");
});

// Listen on the port from the Upsun Fixed configuration
server.listen(config.port);
```
###### Complete example

A complete basic app configuration looks like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: node-app

type: 'nodejs:24'

disk: 512

dependencies:
  nodejs:
    sharp: "*"

hooks:
  build: |
    npm run setup-assets
    npm run build

web:
  commands:
    start: "node index.js"
```

##### Dependencies

By default, Upsun Fixed assumes you're using npm as a package manager.
If your code has a `package.json`, the following command is run as part of the default [build flavor](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#build):

```bash
npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc
```

This means you can specify configuration in a `.npmrc` file in [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).

###### Use Yarn as a package manager

To switch to Yarn to manage dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Turn off the default use of npm:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
build:
   flavor: none
```

2. Specify the version of Yarn you want:

   ```json  {location="package.json"}
   {
     ...
     "packageManager": "yarn@3.2.1"
   }
   ```

What you do next depends on the versions of Yarn and Node.js you want.

```yaml {}
type: 'nodejs:24'
hooks:
  build: |
    corepack yarn install    
```

 - Enable Corepack (which is opt-in):

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'nodejs:24'
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    corepack: "*"
```

 - Use Corepack to run Yarn in your build hook:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'nodejs:24'
hooks:
  build: |
    corepack yarn install    
```

 - Add Yarn as a global dependency:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'nodejs:24'
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    yarn: "1.22.19"
```

 - Install dependencies in the ``build`` hook:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'nodejs:24'
hooks:
  build: |
    yarn --frozen-lockfile    
```

###### Use Bun as a package manager

  **Availability**

  [Bun is available as a runtime and package manager](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/bun-support-is-here/) for Node.js **versions 20 or above**.

To switch to Bun to manage dependencies,
use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# The name of your app.
name: myapp
# Choose Node.js version 20 or above.
type: 'nodejs:20'
# Override the default Node.js build flavor.
build:
  flavor: none
# Use Bun to install the dependencies.
hooks:
  build: bun install
```

####### Use Bun as a runtime

You can even [use Bun as a runtime](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/bun-support-is-here/) by adjusting the `start` command as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# The name of your app.
name: myapp
# Choose Node.js version 20 or above.
type: 'nodejs:20'
# Override the default Node.js build flavor.
build:
  flavor: none
# Use Bun to install the dependencies.
hooks:
  build: bun install
# In the start command replace node with Bun.
web:
  commands:
    start: 'bun app.js'
```

##### Connecting to services

The following examples show how to use Node.js to access various [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
To configure a given service, see the page dedicated to that service.

```js {}
const Memcached = require('memcached');
const config = require("platformsh-config").config();
const { promisify } = require('util');

exports.usageExample = async function() {
    const credentials = config.credentials('memcached');
    const client = new Memcached(`${credentials.host}:${credentials.port}`);

    // The MemcacheD client is not Promise-aware, so make it so.
    const memcachedGet = promisify(client.get).bind(client);
    const memcachedSet = promisify(client.set).bind(client);

    const key = 'Deploy-day';
    const value = 'Friday';

    // Set a value.
    await memcachedSet(key, value, 10);

    // Read it back.
    const test = await memcachedGet(key);

    return `Found value <strong>${test}</strong> for key <strong>${key}</strong>.`;
};

```
```js {}
const mongodb = require("mongodb");
const config = require("platformsh-config").config();

exports.usageExample = async function () {
    const credentials = config.credentials("mongodb");
    const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;

    const client = await MongoClient.connect(
        config.formattedCredentials("mongodb", "mongodb")
    );

    const db = client.db(credentials["path"]);

    const collection = db.collection("startrek");

    const documents = [
        { name: "James Kirk", rank: "Admiral" },
        { name: "Jean-Luc Picard", rank: "Captain" },
        { name: "Benjamin Sisko", rank: "Prophet" },
        { name: "Katheryn Janeway", rank: "Captain" },
    ];

    await collection.insertMany(documents, { w: 1 });

    const result = await collection.find({ rank: "Captain" }).toArray();

    const outputRows = Object.values(result)
        .map(({ name, rank }) => `<tr><td>${name}</td><td>${rank}</td></tr>\n`)
        .join("\n");

    // Clean up after ourselves.
    collection.deleteMany();

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the[Node.js configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

##### Project templates

  The following list shows templates available for Node.js apps.

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

#### Debugging


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Effectively debugging web apps takes effort,
especially when an HTTP request goes through multiple layers before reaching your web app.
Follow the steps below to debug a specific app.

You can choose to debug in an environment deployed to Upsun Fixed
or with your app running locally but connected to deployed services.
In either case, make sure to debug in a preview environment.

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

###### 1. Create a new environment

Start by creating a new environment completely isolated from production but with the same data for debugging:

```bash
platform branch debug-branch
```

###### 2. Get access

To access deployed apps and services, open tunnels to everything your app has relationships with:

```bash {}
platform tunnel:open
```

In the same terminal, set the relevant environment variables:

```bash {}
export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info --encode)"
export PORT=8888
```

###### 3. Run your app in inspect mode

In the same terminal as the previous step, run the following command:

```bash {}
node --inspect <START_FILE>
```

Replace `<START_FILE>` with the file defined for [your app's `start` command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs.md#4-start-your-app).

You get output something like this:

```bash
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/10701e5d-d627-4180-a967-d47a924c93c0
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
Listening on port 8888
```

###### 4. (If debugging remotely) Forward the debugger port locally

In another terminal, create an SSH tunnel that forwards to the 9229 port:

```bash
ssh -N -L 9229:localhost:9229 $(platform ssh --pipe)
```

###### 5. Connect the debugger

You can now connect the debugger as if you were debugging a local application.
See examples with some common tools:

Use the ``Node.js: Attach`` debugger option.
If you haven’t created the option:

 - On the **Run and Debug** tab, click ``create a launch.json file``.
 - Select ``Node.js`` as the environment.
 - In the ``configurations`` array, start IntelliSense (usually ctrl+space).
 - Select ``Node.js: Attach``.
 - Make sure the port is the same as in [step 4 above](#4-if-debugging-remotely-forward-the-debugger-port-locally).

Once you have the option:
In the **Run and Debug** tab, select ``Attach`` from the menu and click **Start Debugging** (the green arrow).
See more on [Node.js debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging).

Now when you load the site at your deployed URL (if debugging remote) or localhost (if debugging locally),
the local debugger you've attached is called.

Set breakpoints:

Directly in your source files.

###### Other issues

####### pm2 process manager blocks other processes

If you're using the [`pm2` process manager](https://github.com/unitech/pm2) to start your app from a script,
you might find it daemonizes itself and blocks other processes (such as backups) by constantly respawning.
This may happen even if you use the `--no-daemon` flag.

Instead of using a script, call `pm2 start` directly in your [`start` command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs.md#4-start-your-app).
#### Manage Node.js versions


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Each Upsun Fixed container image includes a specific language in a specific version.
A set of dependencies is also provided based on that language version.
This ensures that your application container is as small and efficient as possible.

Therefore, by default, when you use an Upsun Fixed container image,
you use the Node.js version that's included in that image, if any.

If you want to use a different Node.js version, use a version manager to install it yourself.
You can use one of the following version managers:

- [Use `n`](#use-n)
- [Use `nvm`](#use-nvm)

Both of the recommendations use a `.nvmrc` file to specify the desired Node.js version.
You could also specify a different file or use [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).

###### Use `n`

The [`n` package](https://github.com/tj/n) works for various Unix-like systems,
including Windows Subsystem for Linux.

1. Add the desired Node.js version to your environment using `.nvmrc`, `.n-node-version`, `.node-version`, or `package.json`.

```yaml {}
v16.13.2
```

Create a ``.n-node-version`` or ``.node-version`` file in [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory):

    .n-node-version or .node-version

```yaml {}
16.13.2
```

Add an ``engines.node`` property to your ``package.json``.
This property accepts either an exact version or a range:

    package.json

```json {}
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=0.10.3 <15"
  }
}
```

2. Add it as a dependency:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    n: "*"
```
   Adding it as a dependency ensures it's cached for future builds.

3. Set the location of the `n` files using the `N_PREFIX` environment variable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    N_PREFIX: /app/.global
```
4. Install the specified version of Node.js in a [`build` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    # Exit the hook on any failure
    set -e

    # Install the version specified in the .nvmrc file
    n auto

    # Reset the location hash to recognize the newly installed version
    hash -r
```
Now your hooks should be able to use the specified version of Node.js.
You can verify this by running `node -v`.

Your final app configuration should look something like this:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: 'python:3.13'
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    n: "*"

variables:
  env:
    N_PREFIX: /app/.global

hooks:
  build: |
    # Exit the hook on any failure
    set -e

    # Install the version specified in the .nvmrc file
    n auto

    # Reset the location hash to recognize the newly installed version
    hash -r
```
###### Use `nvm`

[Node Version Manager (`nvm`)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a bash script for managing Node.js versions.

You can use it to:

- Make a specific version available in the build and optionally the runtime container.
- Control the specific versions to be installed with [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md),
  meaning you can also have different versions in different environments.

To use `nvm`, follow these steps:

1. Define which `nvm` version to use using an [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).
   Add it to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    # Update for your desired NVM version.
    NVM_VERSION: v0.39.3
```
2. Define your desired Node.js version using an environment variable.
   For your base version, set it in your app configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    # Update these for your desired NVM and Node versions.
    NVM_VERSION: v0.39.3
    NODE_VERSION: v18.14.2
```
   To get different versions in different environments, [set environment-specific variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables).

3. Add a `.nvm` directory to your cache in your [build hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
    export NVM_DIR="$PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.nvm"

    # Link cache with app
    if [ ! -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm" ]; then
      mkdir -p $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm
    fi
    ln -s $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm $NVM_DIR
```
   **Note**: 

Instead of using a symlink between your cache and application directories,
you might need to copy the content of ``$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm`` into ``$PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.nvm`` manually.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash {}
rsync -av $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm $PLATFORM_APP_DIR
```

4. Use the cache directory and install based on the variables if not present:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    ...
    # Check for Node.js version and install if not present
    if [ ! -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm/versions/node/$NODE_VERSION" ]; then
      # Get nvm install script if correct version not present
      export NVM_INSTALL_FILE="${PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR}/nvm_${NVM_VERSION}_install.sh"
      if [ ! -f "$NVM_INSTALL_FILE" ]; then
        wget -nc -O "$NVM_INSTALL_FILE" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/$NVM_VERSION/install.sh"
      fi

      # Install, automatically using NODE_VERSION
      bash $NVM_INSTALL_FILE
    fi

    # Activate nvm
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

    # Use the specified version
    nvm use "$NODE_VERSION"
```
5. Optional: To use the specified Node.js version in the runtime container and not just the build,
   activate `nvm` via [script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script):

   ```bash  {location=".environment"}
   unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
   export NVM_DIR="$PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
   ```

Your final app configuration should look something like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: myapp
type: 'python:3.13'
variables:
  env:
    # Update these for your desired NVM and Node versions.
    NVM_VERSION: v0.39.3
    NODE_VERSION: v18.14.2
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
    export NVM_DIR="$PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.nvm"

    # Link cache with app
    if [ ! -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm" ]; then
      mkdir -p $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm
    fi
    ln -s $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm $NVM_DIR
    # Check for Node.js version and install if not present
    if [ ! -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.nvm/versions/node/$NODE_VERSION" ]; then
      # Get nvm install script if correct version not present
      export NVM_INSTALL_FILE="${PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR}/nvm_${NVM_VERSION}_install.sh"
      if [ ! -f "$NVM_INSTALL_FILE" ]; then
        wget -nc -O "$NVM_INSTALL_FILE" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/$NVM_VERSION/install.sh"
      fi

      # Install, automatically using NODE_VERSION
      bash $NVM_INSTALL_FILE
    fi

    # Activate nvm
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

    # Use the specified version
    nvm use "$NODE_VERSION"
```
### PHP

**Note**: 

You can now use the Upsun Fixed composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container.
To find out more about this feature, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md). 
Also, see how you can [modify your PHP runtime when using a composable image](#modify-your-php-runtime-when-using-a-composable-image).

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |

   - 8.5

   - 8.4

   - 8.3

   - 8.2

   - 8.1

   - 8.5

Note that from PHP versions 7.1 to 8.1, the images support the Zend Thread Safe (ZTS) version of PHP.

###### Specify the language

To use PHP, specify `php` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'php:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'php:8.5'
```

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they don't receive security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future – consider migrating to a [supported version](#supported-versions).

##### Usage example

Configure your app to use PHP on Upsun Fixed.

###### 1. Specify the version

Choose a [supported version](#supported-versions)
and add it to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'php:8.5'
```
###### 2. Serve your app

To serve your app, define what (and how) content should be served by setting the [`locations` parameter](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

Usually, it contains the two following (optional) keys:

- `root` for the document root,
  the directory to which all requests for existing `.php` and static files (such as `.css`, `.jpg`) are sent.
- `passthru` to [define a front controller](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/web/php-basic.md#set-different-rules-for-specific-locations) to handle nonexistent files.
  The value is a file path relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).

  **Note**: 

For enhanced security, when setting ``passthru`` to ``true``, you might also want to add the following configuration:

 - Set ``scripts`` to ``false``.
This prevents PHP scripts from being executed from the specified location.

 - Set ``allow`` to ``false``.
By default, when PHP scripts aren’t executed, their source code is delivered.
Setting ``allow`` to ``false`` allows you to keep the source code of your PHP scripts confidential.

Adjust the `locations` block to fit your needs.

In the following example, all requests made to your site's root (`/`) are sent to the `public` directory
and nonexistent files are handled by `app.php`:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/app.php'
```
See how to [create a basic PHP app with a front controller](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/web/php-basic.md).
To have more control, you can define rules to specify which files you want to allow [from which location](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/web/php-basic.md#set-different-rules-for-specific-locations).

###### Complete example

A complete basic app configuration looks like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: 'myapp'

type: 'php:8.5'

disk: 2048

web:
  locations:
    '/':
      root: 'public'
      passthru: '/app.php'
```
##### Dependencies

Up to PHP version 8.1, it's assumed that you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) 1.x to manage dependencies.
If you have a `composer.json` file in your code, the default [build flavor is run](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#build):

```bash
composer --no-ansi --no-interaction install --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
```

To use Composer 2.x on your project, either use PHP 8.2+ or, in your app configuration, add the following [dependency](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#dependencies):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
  php:
    composer/composer: '^2'
```
Adding a dependency to the [dependencies block](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#dependencies) makes it available globally.
So you can then use included dependencies as commands within your app container.
You can add multiple global dependencies to the dependencies block, such as [Node.js](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs.md#2-specify-any-global-dependencies).

If you want to have more control over Composer or if you don't want to use Composer at all, adapt the [build flavor](#change-the-build-flavor).
You can also use a [private, authenticated third-party Composer repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/composer-auth.md).

###### Change the build flavor

If you need more control over the dependency management,
you can either use your custom build flavor
or interact with Composer itself through [its environment variables](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#environment-variables).

You can remove the default build flavor and run your own commands for complete control over your build.
Set the build flavor to `none` and add the commands you need to your `build` hook, as in the following example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
build:
    flavor: none

hooks:
    build: |
        set -e
        composer install --no-interaction --no-dev
```
That installs production dependencies with Composer but not development dependencies.
The same can be achieved by using the default build flavor and [adding the `COMPOSER_NO_DEV` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md).

See more on [build flavors](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#build).

###### Alternative repositories

In addition to the standard `dependencies` format,
you can specify alternative repositories for Composer to use as global dependencies.
So you can install a forked version of a global dependency from a custom repository.

To install from an alternative repository:

1. Set an explicit `require` block:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
  php:
    require:
      "platformsh/client": "2.x-dev"
```
   This is equivalent to `composer require platformsh/client 2.x-dev`.

2. Add the repository to use:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
repositories:
  - type: vcs
    url: "git@github.com:platformsh/platformsh-client-php.git"
```
That installs `platformsh/client` from the specified repository URL as a global dependency.

For example, to install Composer 2 and the `platformsh/client 2.x-dev` library from a custom repository,
use the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
  php:
    require:
      composer/composer: '^2'
      "platformsh/client": "2.x-dev"
    repositories:
      - type: vcs
        url: "git@github.com:platformsh/platformsh-client-php.git"
```

###### Additional Composer schema properties
In addition to [alternate repositories](#alternative-repositories), other
[Composer schema properties](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md) can be added to the global dependencies. For
example, one of your dependencies may be a plugin where you need to explicitly whitelist it as an
[allowed-plugin](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#allow-plugins).

To add additional composer schema properties:

1. Set an explicit `require` block:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
applications:
  # The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
  myapp:
    type: 'php:8.5'

    dependencies:
      php:
        require:
          "third-party/required-plugin"": "^3.0"
```

2. Add each additional property as a block at the same indentation as the `require` block:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
applications:
  # The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
  myapp:
    type: 'php:8.5'

    dependencies:
      php:
        require:
          symfony/runtime: '*'
        config:
          "allow-plugins":
            symfony/runtime: true
```

##### Connect to services

The following examples show how to use PHP to access various [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
The individual service pages have more information on configuring each service.

```php {}

    $memcached = new Memcached();
    $memcached->addServer($credentials['host'], $credentials['port']);
    $memcached->setOption(Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL, true);

    $key = "Deploy day";
    $value = "Friday";

    // Set a value.
    $memcached->set($key, $value);

    // Read it back.
    $test = $memcached->get($key);

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the[PHP configuration reader library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php).
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

##### PHP settings

You can configure your PHP-FPM runtime configuration by specifying the [runtime in your app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#runtime).

In addition to changes in runtime, you can also change the PHP settings.
Some commonly used settings are:

| Name | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_execution_time` | `300` | The maximum execution time, in seconds, for your PHP scripts and apps. A value of `0` means there are no time limits.                                                                                |
| `max_file_uploads` | `20` | The maximum number of files that can be uploaded in each request.                                                                                                                                    |
| `max_input_time` | `60` | The maximum time in seconds that your script is allowed to receive input (such as for file uploads). A value of `-1` means there are no time limits.                                                 |
| `max_input_vars` | `1000` | The maximum number of input variables that are accepted in each request.                                                                                                                             |
| `memory_limit` | `128M` | The memory limit, in megabytes, for PHP. Ensure that the PHP memory limit is set to a lower value than your environment's memory.                                                                    |
| `post_max_size` | `64M` | The maximum size, in megabytes, per uploaded file. To upload larger files, increase the value.                                                                                                       |
| `zend.assertions` | `-1` | Assertions are optimized and have no impact at runtime. Set assertions to `1` for your local development system. [See more on assertions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.assertions). |
| `opcache.memory_consumption` | `64` | The number of megabytes available for [the OPcache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/tuning.md#opcache-preloading). For large apps with many files, increase this value.                                               |
| `opcache.validate_timestamps` | `On` | If your app doesn't generate compiled PHP, you can [disable this setting](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/tuning.md#disable-opcache-timestamp-validation).                                                                          |

###### Retrieve the default values

To retrieve the default PHP values, run the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/_index.md):

```bash
platform ssh "php --info"
```

To get specific default values, use grep.
For example, to get the value for `opcache.memory_consumption`, run the following command:

```bash
platform ssh "php --info" | grep opcache.memory_consumption
```

###### Retrieve the settings

To see the settings used on your environment:

1.  Find the PHP configuration files with the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/_index.md):

    ```bash
    platform ssh "php --ini"
    ```

    The output is something like the following:

    ```bash
    Configuration File (php.ini) Path: /etc/php/8.0-zts/cli
    Loaded Configuration File:         /etc/php/8.0-zts/cli/php.ini
    Scan for additional .ini files in: /etc/php/8.0-zts/cli/conf.d
    Additional .ini files parsed:      (none)
    ```

2.  Display the configuration file by adapting the following command with the output from step 1:

    ```bash
    platform ssh "cat <LOADED_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH>"
    ```

###### Customize PHP settings

For Dedicated Gen 2, see the [configuration options](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/development.md).

You can customize PHP values for your app in two ways.
The recommended method is to use variables.

For more information, see how to use [PHP-specific variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#php-specific-variables).
You can provide a custom ``php.ini`` file at the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
Using this method isn’t recommended since it offers less flexibility and is more error-prone.
Consider using variables instead.
For example, to change the PHP memory limit, use the following configuration:

    php.ini

```ini {}
memory_limit = 256M
```

If you're using [PHP-CLI](#execution-mode),
you need to take into account the default settings of PHP-CLI when you customize your PHP settings.
The default settings of PHP-CLI can't be overwritten and are the following:

```text
max_execution_time=0
max_input_time=-1
memory_limit=-1
```

###### Disable functions for security

A common recommendation for securing PHP installations is disabling built-in functions frequently used in remote attacks.
By default, Upsun Fixed doesn't disable any functions.

If you're sure a function isn't needed in your app, you can disable it.

For example, to disable `pcntl_exec` and `pcntl_fork`, add the following to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
    php:
        disable_functions: "pcntl_exec,pcntl_fork"
```
Common functions to disable include:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_function` | This function has been replaced by anonymous functions and shouldn't be used anymore. |
| `exec`, `passthru`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `proc_open`, `popen` | These functions allow a PHP script to run a bash shell command. Rarely used by web apps except for build scripts that might need them. |
| `pcntl_*` | The `pcntl_*` functions are responsible for process management. Most of them cause a fatal error if used within a web request. Cron tasks or workers may need them. Most are usually safe to disable. |
| `curl_exec`, `curl_multi_exec` | These functions allow a PHP script to make arbitrary HTTP requests. If you're using HTTP libraries such as Guzzle, don't disable them. |
| `show_source` | This function shows a syntax highlighted version of a named PHP source file. Rarely useful outside of development. |

##### Execution mode

PHP has two execution modes you can choose from:

- The command line interface mode (PHP-CLI) is the mode used for command line scripts and standalone apps.
  This is the mode used when you're logged into your container via SSH, for [crons](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons),
  and usually also for [alternate start commands](#alternate-start-commands).
  To use PHP-CLI, run your script with `php <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>`,
  where <PATH_TO_SCRIPT> is a file path relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
- The Common Gateway Interface mode (PHP-CGI) is the mode used for web apps and web requests.
  This is the default mode when the `start` command isn't explicitly set.
  To use PHP-CGI, run your script with a symlink: `/usr/bin/start-php-app <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>`,
  where <PATH_TO_SCRIPT> is a file path relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
  With PHP-CGI, PHP is run using the FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM).

##### Alternate start commands

To specify an alternative process to run your code, set a `start` command.
For more information about the start command, see the [web commands reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web-commands).

By default, start commands use PHP-CLI.
Find out how and when to use each [execution mode](#execution-mode).

Note that the `start` command must run in the foreground and is executed before the [deploy hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md).
That means that PHP-FPM can't run simultaneously with another persistent process
such as [ReactPHP](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-reactphp)
or [Amp](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-amphp).
If you need multiple processes, they have to run in separate containers.

See some generic examples on how to use alternate start commands:

```yaml {}
web:
    commands:
        start: /usr/bin/start-php-app
```

 - Add your web server’s code in a PHP file.

 - Specify an alternative ``start`` command by adapting the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
web:
    commands:
        start: /usr/bin/start-php-app
```

 - Configure the container to listen on a TCP socket:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
web:
    upstream:
        socket_family: tcp
        protocol: http
```

When you listen on a TCP socket, the ``$PORT`` environment variable is automatically set.
See more options on how to [configure where requests are sent](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream).
You might have to configure your app to connect via the ``$PORT`` TCP socket,
especially when using web servers such as [Swoole](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/swoole.md) or [Roadrunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner).

 - Optional: Override redirects to let the custom web server handle them:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
locations:
    "/":
        passthru: true
        scripts: false
        allow: false
```

To execute runtime-specific tasks (such as clearing cache) before your app starts, follow these steps:

 - Create a separate shell script that includes all the commands to be run.

 - Specify an alternative ``start`` command by adapting the following:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
web:
    commands:
        start: bash <PATH_TO_SCRIPT> && /usr/bin/start-php-app
```

<PATH_TO_SCRIPT> is the bash script created in step 1.
<PATH_TO_SCRIPT> is a file path relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).

##### Foreign function interfaces

PHP 7.4 introduced support for [foreign function interfaces (FFIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).
FFIs allow your PHP program to call routines or use services written in C or Rust.

Note: FFIs are only intended for advanced use cases.
Use with caution.

If you are using C code, you need `.so` library files.
Either place these files directly in your repository or compile them in a makefile using `gcc` in your [build hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook).
Note: The `.so` library files shouldn't be located in a publicly accessible directory.

If you are compiling Rust code, use the build hook to [install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.md).

To leverage FFIs, follow these steps:

1.  [Enable and configure OPcache preloading](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/tuning.md#enable-opcache-preloading).

2.  Enable the FFI extension:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
    extensions:
        - ffi
```

3.  Make sure that your [preload script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/tuning.md#opcache-preloading) calls the `FFI::load()` function.
    Using this function in preload is considerably faster than loading the linked library on each request or script run.

4.  If you are running FFIs from the command line,
    enable the preloader by adding the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
    php:
        opcache.enable_cli: true
```

5.  Run your script with the following command:

    ```bash
    php <CLI_SCRIPT>
    ```

See [complete working examples for C and Rust](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/php-ffi).

##### Project templates

  The following list shows templates available for PHP apps.

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

    WooCommerce (Bedrock) for Upsun Fixed
    This template builds WordPress on Upsun Fixed using the Bedrock boilerplate by Roots with Composer. It includes WooCommerce and JetPack as dependencies, which when enabled will quickly allow you to create a store on WordPress.
Plugins and themes should be managed with Composer exclusively. The only modifications made to the standard Bedrock boilerplate have been providing database credentials and main site url parameters via environment variables. With this configuration, the database is automatically configured such that the installer will not ask you for database credentials. While Bedrock provides support to replicate this configuration in a ``.env`` file for local development, an example Lando configuration file is included as the recommendated method to do so.
WordPress is a blogging and lightweight CMS written in PHP, and Bedrock is a Composer-based WordPress boilerplate project with a slightly modified project structure and configuration protocol. WooCommerce is an open-source eCommerce platform and plugin for WordPress.

###### Features:

##### Modify your PHP runtime when using a composable image

**Note**: 

This section is only relevant when using the Upsun Fixed [composable image (BETA)](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

The following table presents the possible modifications you can make to your PHP primary runtime using the `stack` key and composable image.
Each modification should be listed below the stack chosen (i.e. `extensions` are enabled under `.applications.frontend.stack[0]["php@8.3"].extensions` for PHP 8.3).
See the example below for more details.

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

PHP has a number of [extensions](https://pecl.php.net/) developed by members of the community.
Some of them are available for Upsun Fixed containers.

**Warning**: 

The information on this page applies to Grid plans.
See also [PHP extensions on Dedicated Gen 2 plans](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/environment-differences.md#extensions).

You can define the PHP extensions you want to enable or disable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
  extensions:
    - raphf
    - http
    - igbinary
    - redis
  disabled_extensions:
    - sqlite3
```
You can also [include configuration options](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#extensions) for specific extensions.

The following table shows all extensions that are available (Avail) and on by default (Def).
You can turn on the available ones with the `extensions` key
and turn off those on by default with the `disabled_extensions` key.
(Extensions marked with `*` are built in and can't be turned off.)

Some built-in modules are always on:

- `date`
- `filter`
- `hash`
- `json` (from 8.0)
- `libxml`
- `openssl`
- `pcntl`
- `pcre`
- `Reflection`
- `session`
- `SPL`
- `standard`
- `Zend OPcache` (from 5.5)
- `zlib`

To see a complete list of the compiled PHP extensions, run the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/_index.md):

```bash
platform ssh "php -m"
```

###### Custom PHP extensions

It's possible to use an extension not listed here,
but it takes slightly more work:

1. Download the `.so` file for the extension as part of your build hook using `curl` or similar.
   It can also be added to your Git repository if the file isn't publicly downloadable,
   but committing large binary blobs to Git is generally not recommended.

2. Load the extension using an absolute path by [customizing the PHP settings](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#customize-php-settings)
   For example, if the extension is named `spiffy.so` and is in your [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory),
   your configuration looks like the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  php:
    extension: /app/spiffy.so
```
#### Performance tuning


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Once your app is up and running it still needs to be kept fast.
Upsun Fixed offers a wide degree of flexibility in how PHP behaves,
but that does mean you may need to take a few steps to ensure your site is running optimally.

The following recommendations are guidelines only.
They're also listed in about the order to investigate them.

###### Upgrade to PHP 8

To make a PHP-based site run faster, the first step is to upgrade the PHP version.
Upgrading the PHP version might require changes to your app.
For more details and recommendations, see the [PHP migration guides](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php).

To change your PHP version, change the [`type` in your app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types).
Before merging to production, test the change on a branch and make sure that your app is working as expected.

###### Optimize the FPM worker count

PHP-FPM uses a fixed number of simultaneous worker processes to handle incoming requests.
If more simultaneous requests are received than the number of workers,
then some requests wait until worker processes are available.

The default worker count is set to a conservative default value.
To determine and set the optimal value for your app, see [PHP-FPM sizing](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/fpm.md).

###### OPcache preloading

OPcache preloading loads selected files into shared memory,
making their content (functions, classes) globally available for requests.
It also removes the need to include these files later.
When OPcache is correctly configured, it can result in significant improvements to both CPU and memory usage.

Consult your framework's documentation to see
if there are recommendations for optimal preload configuration or ready-to-use preload scripts.

OPcache is only available on PHP 7.4+ and uses PHP-CGI.
If your PHP version doesn't support OPcache, this is a good reason to upgrade.

Note that the only way to clear the preload cache is by [restarting PHP-FPM](#restart-php-fpm).

If you have [disabled OPcache timestamp validation](#disable-opcache-timestamp-validation),
you need to clear the OPcache explicitly on deployment (which can be done by restarting PHP-FPM).

####### Enable OPcache preloading

To enable preloading, add a variable that specifies a preload script:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  php:
    opcache.preload: '<PRELOAD_SCRIPT>'
```
`<PRELOAD_SCRIPT>` is a file path relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
It may be any PHP script that calls `opcache_compile_file()`.

The following example uses a `preload.php` file as the preload script.
This script loads all `.php` files in the `vendor` directory (and subdirectories):

```php  {location="preload.php"}
<?php
$directory = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator(getenv('PLATFORM_APP_DIR') . '/vendor');
$iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator($directory);
$regex = new RegexIterator($iterator, '/^.+\.php$/i', RecursiveRegexIterator::GET_MATCH);

foreach ($regex as $key => $file) {
    // This is the important part!
    opcache_compile_file($file[0]);
}
```

####### Configure OPcache

OPcache needs to be tuned before production usage and can be configured the [same way as PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#customize-php-settings).

Let the app run for a while before tuning OPcache
since the preload script may change some of the configuration.

######## Set the maximum number of cached files

`opcache.max_accelerated_files` is the maximum number of files that OPcache can cache at once.
If this value is lower than the number of files in the app,
the cache becomes less effective because it starts [thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)).

To determine the maximum number of files to cache, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the container via SSH using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md)
   by running `platform ssh`.
2. Determine roughly how many `.php` files your app has by running this command from [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory):

   ```bash
   find . -type f -name '*.php' | wc -l
   ```

    Note that the returned valued is an approximation.
    Some apps have PHP code in files that don't end in `.php` or files that are generated at runtime.

3. Set `opcache.max_accelerated_files` to a value slightly higher than the returned number.
   PHP automatically rounds the value up to the next highest prime number.

An example configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  php:
    'opcache.max_accelerated_files': 22000
```
######## Set memory consumption

`opcache.memory_consumption` is the total memory (in megabytes) that OPcache can use with FastCGI.
If the app uses more than this, the cache starts [thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)) and becomes less effective.

Determining the optimal limit to memory consumption requires executing code via a web request to get adequate statistics.
[CacheTool](https://github.com/gordalina/cachetool) is an open-source tool to help you get the statistics.

To determine the total amount of memory to use, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the container via SSH using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md)
   by running `platform ssh`.
2. Change to the `/tmp` directory (or any other non-web-accessible writable directory) with `cd /tmp`.
3. Download CacheTool with `curl -sLO https://github.com/gordalina/cachetool/releases/latest/download/cachetool.phar`.
4. Make CacheTool executable with `chmod +x cachetool.phar`.
5. Check the OPcache status for FastCGI commands by running the following command:

   ```bash
   php cachetool.phar opcache:status --fcgi=$SOCKET
   ```

   The `--fcgi=$SOCKET` option ensures the PHP-FPM process on the server connects through the right socket.
6. Analyze the output to determine the optimal value for `opcache.memory_consumption`.
   The most important values from CacheTool's output are the following:

   - `Memory used`
   - `Memory free`
   - `Oom restarts` (out of memory restarts)
     If the value is different than 0, you don't have enough memory allocated to OPcache.

   If `Memory free` is too low or `Oom Restarts` too high,
   set a higher value for memory consumption.
7. Set `opcache.memory_consumption`.
   Note: The unit for `opcache.memory_consumption` is megabytes.

   An example configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  php:
    'opcache.memory_consumption': 96
```
8. [Restart PHP-FPM](#restart-php-fpm) and make sure that OPcache works as expected by rerunning CacheTool
   with the following command:

    ```bash
    php cachetool.phar opcache:status --fcgi=$SOCKET
    ```

9. Remove CacheTool by deleting the `cachetools.phar` file with `rm -rf cachetools.phar`.

####### Disable OPcache timestamp validation

By default, OPcache checks that the cached version of a file is always up-to-date.
This means that every time a cached file is used, OPcache compares it to the file on disk.
If that file has changed, it gets reloaded and re-cached.
This allows to support apps that generate compiled PHP code from user configuration.

If you know your code isn't going to change outside a new deployment,
you can disable that check and get a small performance improvement.

Timestamp validation can be disabled by adding the following variable to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  php:
    'opcache.validate_timestamps': 0
```
When you have disabled OPcache timestamp validation,
you need to explicitly clear OPcache on deployment by [restarting PHP-FPM](#restart-php-fpm).

Note: If your app generates PHP code at runtime based on user configuration, don't disable timestamp validation.
Doing so would prevent updates to the generated code from being loaded.

###### Restart PHP-FPM

To force a restart of PHP-FPM:

1. Connect to your app container via SSH using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md) by running `platform ssh`.
2. Run `pkill -f -u "$(whoami)" php-fpm`.

###### Optimize your code

To optimize your app, consider using a [profiler](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability.md).
A profiler helps determine what slow spots can be found and addressed and helps improve performance.

The web agency [Pixelant](https://www.pixelant.net/) has released a [log analyzer tool for Upsun Fixed](https://github.com/pixelant/platformsh-analytics)
that offers visualization of access logs to determine how much memory requests are using on average.
It also offers additional insights into the operation of your site and can suggest places to further optimize your configuration or when it's time to increase your plan size.
Note that this tool is maintained by a third party, not by Upsun Fixed.
#### PHP-FPM sizing


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

PHP-FPM helps improve your app's performance
by maintaining pools of workers that can process PHP requests.
This is particularly useful when your app needs to handle a high number of simultaneous requests.

By default, Upsun Fixed automatically sets a maximum number of PHP-FPM workers for your app.
This number is calculated based on three parameters:

- The container memory: the amount of memory you can allot for PHP processing
  depending on [app size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#sizes).
- The request memory: the amount of memory an average PHP request is expected to require.
- The reserved memory: the amount of memory you need to reserve for tasks that aren't related to requests.

The number is calculated as follows: ![The sum of container memory minus reserved memory divided by request memory](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/php/PHP-FPM-Workers-Calculation.png "0.2")

Note that when the resulting number is a decimal,
it's rounded up to set the maximum number of workers.
Also, the minimum number of PHP-FPM workers is 2.

**Note**: 

To ensure that Upsun Fixed doesn’t add more workers than the CPU can handle,
a CPU limit applies as soon as the number of set workers equals or exceeds 25.
This limit is calculated as follows: ``number of vCPU cores * 5``.

For example, if you have a 2XL container with 8 CPU cores,
you can have up to 40 workers as long as you have sufficient memory.

To adjust the maximum number of PHP-FPM workers depending on your app's needs, follow the instructions on this page.

- An up-and-running web app in PHP, complete with [PHP-FPM](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php)
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

Note that the memory settings mentioned on this page are different from the [`memory_limit` PHP setting](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md).
The `memory_limit` setting is the maximum amount of memory a single PHP process can use
before it's automatically terminated.

###### 1. Estimate the optimal request memory for your app

To determine what the optimal request memory is for your app,
you can refer to your PHP access logs.
Run a command similar to:

```bash
platform log --lines 5000 php.access | awk '{print $6}' | sort -n | uniq -c
```

This command takes into account the last 5,000 requests that reached PHP-FPM.
You can adjust this number depending on the amount of traffic on your site.

In the output, you can see how many requests used how much memory, in KB.
For example:

```bash
    2654 2048
    431  4096
    584  8192
    889  10240
    374  12288
     68  46384
```

The output shows that:
- The majority of requests peaked at 2,048 KB of memory.
- Most other requests used up to around 10 MB of memory.
- A few requests used up to around 12 MB of memory.
- Only 68 requests peaked at around 46 MB of memory.

In this situation, you might want to be cautious
and [set your request memory](#2-adjust-the-maximum-number-of-php-fpm-workers) to 12 MB.
Setting a lower request memory presents a risk of allowing more concurrent requests.
This can result in memory swapping and latencies.

For further help in estimating the optimal request memory for your app,
use the [log analyzer tool for Upsun Fixed](https://github.com/pixelant/platformsh-analytics)
by [Pixelant](https://www.pixelant.net/).
This tool offers a better visualization of access logs.
It also provides additional insights into the operation of your app.
These can help you further optimize your configuration
and provide guidance on when to increase your plan size.
Note that this tool is maintained by a third party,
not by Upsun Fixed.

###### 2. Adjust the maximum number of PHP-FPM workers

By default, the request memory is set to 45 MB
and the reserved memory is set to 70 MB.
These values allow most programs to run,
but you can amend them to fit your needs.

To do so, adjust your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).
Under `runtime` in the [`sizing_hints` setting](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#sizing-hints),
set the values for `reserved_memory` and `request_memory`.

For example,
if you estimate your [optimal request memory](#1-estimate-the-optimal-request-memory-for-your-app) to be 110 MB
and your reserved memory to be 80 MB,
you can use:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
  sizing_hints:
    request_memory: 110
    reserved_memory: 80
```
Note that the minimum value for the `request_memory` key is 10 MB
and the minimum value for the `reserved_memory` key is 70 MB.
If you set lower values,
they're automatically overridden with those minimums.

To check the maximum number of PHP-FPM workers available to your app,
run the following command, where `children` refers to PHP-FPM workers:

```bash
platform ssh "grep -e '^pm.max_children' /etc/php/*/fpm/php-fpm.conf"
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
pm.max_children = 5
```
#### Using Xdebug


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

[Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) is a real-time debugger extension for PHP.
While usually used for local development, it can also be helpful for debugging aberrant behavior on the server.

As configured on Upsun Fixed, it avoids any runtime overhead for non-debug requests, even in production, and only allows connections via SSH tunnels to avoid any security issues.

Note that Xdebug runs only on your app containers.
So you can't use it for [worker containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/workers.md).

Also, note that if you use a [custom start command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#alternate-start-commands),
Xdebug is automatically disabled.

###### Before you begin

The following table shows the PHP versions where Xdebug is available on Grid environments:

| 5.4 | 5.5 | 5.6 | 7.0 | 7.1 | 7.2 | 7.3 | 7.4 | 8.0 | 8.1 | 8.2 | 8.3 | 8.4 | 8.5 |

              Avail

              Avail

              Avail

              Avail

You also need:

- The Upsun Fixed [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)
- A Xdebug-compatible IDE installed on your machine.
    For setup instructions, consult your IDE's Xdebug documentation, such as that for [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.md).

###### 1. Set up Xdebug

Xdebug runs as a second PHP-FPM process used only for debugging requests, leaving the normal process unaffected.

To enable Xdebug, add the following to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
  xdebug:
    idekey: <YOUR_KEY>
```
<YOUR_KEY> can be any arbitrary alphanumeric string.

When that key is defined, Upsun Fixed starts a second PHP-FPM process on the container that's identically configured but also has Xdebug enabled.
Only incoming requests that have an Xdebug cookie or query parameter set are forwarded to the debug PHP-FPM process.
All other requests are directed to the normal PHP-FPM process and thus have no performance impact.

If you have enabled the [router cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md),
you need to explicitly add the Xdebug cookie (`XDEBUG_SESSION`) to the cookie allowlist.
Depending on the cookies already listed, the result should look similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  # ...
  cache:
    enabled: true
    cookies: ['/^SS?ESS/', 'XDEBUG_SESSION']
```
Xdebug has several configuration options available.
They can be set the same way as any other [PHP setting](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#php-settings).
For a full list of available options, consult the [Xdebug documentation](https://xdebug.org/docs/).

###### 2. Use Xdebug

####### Open a tunnel

To open an SSH tunnel to the server from a local checkout of your app, run the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) :

```bash
platform environment:xdebug
```

That SSH tunnel allows your IDE and the server to communicate debug information securely.

By default, Xdebug operates on port `9003`.
Generally, it's best to configure your IDE to use that port.
To use an alternate port, use the `--port` flag.

To close the tunnel and terminate the debug connection, press Ctrl + C.

####### Install an Xdebug helper

While Xdebug can be triggered from the browser by adding a special query parameter, the preferred way is to use a browser plugin helper.
Helpers are available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xdebug-helper-for-firefox/)
and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc).
Their respective plugin pages document how to trigger them when needed.

###### 3. Configure your IDE

Follow the instructions for your IDE, such as those for [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.md).

The common steps for setup usually include:

1. Configuring the Xdebug debug port and making sure it's set to the expected value (`9003` as default or the value you chose with `--port` when opening the tunnel).
2. Making sure that external connections are allowed.
3. Adding a new server for your Upsun Fixed environment.
    The Host should be the hostname of the environment on Upsun Fixed you are debugging.
    The Port should always be `443` and the Debugger set to `Xdebug`.
4. Ensuring path mappings is enabled.
    This lets you define what remote paths on the server correspond to what path on your local machine.
    In the majority of cases you can just define [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)
    to map to `myapp`.
5. Listening for connections.
6. Starting debugging. While in listen mode, start the `platform xdebug` tunnel.
    Use the Xdebug helper plugin for your browser to enable debugging.
    Set a break point in your app, then load a page in your browser.
    The request should pause at the break point and allow you to examine the running app.

#### Custom Redis versions


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

[Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md) is a popular structured key-value service, supported by Upsun Fixed.
It's frequently used for caching.

###### Install PhpRedis

The [PhpRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) extension is available on Upsun Fixed's PHP container images.
The extension has been known to break its API between versions when removing deprecated functionality.
The version available on each application image is the latest available at the time that PHP version was built,
which if your app is sensitive to PhpRedis versions may not be ideal.

It may happen that the version of the PhpRedis extension available for your PHP version
isn't compatible with your app and upgrading your app isn't feasible.
If so, use the following script as an alternative to download and compile a precise version of the extension.

**Note**: 

Do not use this approach unless you really need to.
Using the provided PhpRedis extension is preferred in the majority of cases.

To ease the installation of a customer version of PhpRedis, use a [PhpRedis install script](https://github.com/platformsh/snippets/blob/main/src/install-phpredis.sh).
Invoke this script from your build hook, specifying a version.
Any tagged version of the library is acceptable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    # Install PhpRedis v5.3.7:
    curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install-phpredis.sh | { bash /dev/fd/3 5.3.7 ; } 3<&0
```
###### Install Relay

Relay is a [Redis](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/redis.md) client
similar to [PhpRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) and
[Predis](https://github.com/predis/predis).
It's intended to be a drop-in replacement for those libraries.

That PHP extension is also a shared in-memory cache like APCu. All retrieved keys are held in the PHP master process’ memory, which is shared across all FPM workers.

That means if the FPM Worker #1 fetches the `users:count` key from Redis,
all other FPM workers instantaneously retrieve that key from Relay without having to communicate with Redis.

To ease the installation of a customer version of Relay, use the [Relay install script](https://github.com/platformsh/snippets/blob/main/src/install-relay.sh).
Invoke this script from your build hook, specifying a version.
Any tagged version of the library is acceptable:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    # Install Relay v0.6.0:
    curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install-relay.sh | { bash /dev/fd/3 v0.6.0 ; } 3<&0
```
###### Change extension or version

To change the Redis extension or the version you are using, update the build hook and clear the build cache: `platform project:clear-build-cache`.

The new version is *not* be used until you clear the build cache.

There's no need to declare the extension in the `runtime` block.
That's only for pre-built extensions.

###### What these scripts do

1. Download the Relay/PhpRedis source code.
2. Check out the version specified in the build hook.
3. Compile the extension.
4. Copy the resulting `relay.so`/`redis.so` file to [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
5. Add a line to the `php.ini` file in your app root to enable the extension, creating the file if necessary.

If the script doesn't find a `$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR` directory defined, it exits silently.
So if you run the build hook locally, it has no effect.
#### Swoole


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Swoole is a PHP extension that extends PHP core with a coroutine based asynchronous network application framework designed for building large scale concurrent systems.

Unlike PHP-FPM’s stateless operating, Swoole relies on establishing persistent connections with every user, sending and receiving data in real-time.

[Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src) and [Open Swoole](https://openswoole.com/) are two forked libraries pursuing that goal.

**Note**: 

The ``swoole`` and ``openswoole`` extensions are [available by default](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md) on Upsun Fixed PHP 8.2 Upsun Fixed containers.

For other versions of PHP, you can install both extensions manually by following the instructions on this page. 
You need:

- PHP 7.3+ for Swoole
- PHP 7.4.0+ for Open Swoole
- The [Swoole installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install_swoole.sh).
  **Note**: 

Currently, the installation script is compatible with PHP <=8.0. It is **not** compatible with PHP 8.3,
and the ``swoole`` and ``openswoole`` extensions are **not** available on Upsun Fixed PHP 8.3 containers yet.

Check the documentation related to [Laravel Octane on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/laravel/deploy/octane.md).

###### Install

Install the PHP extension for Swoole or Open Swoole during the build.

Take advantage of an [installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install_swoole.sh).
You need to pass 2 parameters:

* Which Swoole project to use: `openswoole` or `swoole`
* Which version to install

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
    build: |
        set -e
        ...
        curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/snippets/main/src/install_swoole.sh | { bash /dev/fd/3 openswoole 4.11.0 ; } 3<&0
```

###### Use

Override the default web server with a [custom start command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md#alternate-start-commands).
Octane should listen on a TCP socket.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  upstream:
    socket_family: tcp
    protocol: http
  commands:
    start: php <PATH_TO_SWOOLE_START_COMMAND> --port=$PORT
  locations:
    "/":
      passthru: true
      scripts: false
      allow: false
```
#### Authenticated Composer repositories


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

[Packagist](https://packagist.org/) is the primary Composer repository for public PHP packages.
But you can also have Composer download PHP packages from a private, third-party Composer repository.
To make sure Composer has the necessary credentials to do so,
follow the instructions on this page.

###### Before you begin

You need:
- An Upsun Fixed project using [PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php.md) and Composer
- Credentials to access a private third-party Composer repository
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

###### 1. Declare a private Composer repository

To allow Composer to download packages from a private third-party repository,
declare the repository in your Composer setup.

```json  {location="composer.json"}
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://<PRIVATE_REPOSITORY_URL>"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### 2. Set up Composer authentication using a variable

To allow Composer to successfully authenticate when accessing the declared private repository,
set an [`env:COMPOSER_AUTH` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md) for your project.

To do so, run the following command:

```bash
platform variable:create --level project --name env:COMPOSER_AUTH \
  --json true --visible-runtime false --sensitive true --visible-build true \
  --value '{"http-basic": {"<PRIVATE_REPOSITORY_URL>": {"username": "<USERNAME>", "password": "<PASSWORD>"}}}'
```

The [`env:` prefix](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#top-level-environment-variables) means that the variable is exposed
as its own Unix environment variable.
The `--visible-runtime false` and `--visible-build true` flags mean the variable is available to Composer only during the build.

###### 3. Clear your project's build cache

For security reasons, make sure that the authentication credentials aren't cached in your project's build container.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
platform project:clear-build-cache
```

###### Access dependencies downloaded from a private repository

When you download a dependency from a private third-party Composer repository,
that dependency is usually hosted in a [private Git repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/private-repository.md).
Access to private Git repositories is restricted through the use of SSH keys.
But most private Composer tools mirror tagged releases of dependencies
and serve them directly without hitting the Git repository.
To avoid having to authenticate against a remote Git repository,
make sure your dependencies specify tagged releases.
#### Troubleshoot PHP


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

###### Server reached `max_children`

If the server is receiving more concurrent requests than it has PHP processes allocated,
you encounter a message like the following:

```text {location="/var/log/app.log",}
WARNING: [pool web] server reached max_children setting (2), consider raising it
```

This means some requests have to wait until another finishes.
Upsun Fixed sets the number of workers based on the available memory of your container
and the estimated average memory size of each process.

You have two ways to increase the number of workers:

- Adjust the [worker sizing hints](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/fpm.md) for your project.
- Upgrade your Upsun Fixed plan to get more computing resources.
###### Execution timeout

If your PHP app can't handle the amount of traffic or is slow,
you encounter a message like the following:

```text {location="/var/log/app.log",}
WARNING: [pool web] child 120, script '/app/public/index.php' (request: "GET /index.php") execution timed out (358.009855 sec), terminating
```

This means your PHP process is running longer than allowed.
You can adjust the `max_execution_time` value in `php.ini`. See also `request_terminate_timeout` in the [App reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#runtime).

The most common causes of a timeout are an infinite loop (which is a bug that you should fix)
or the work itself requires a long time to complete.
For the latter case, you should consider putting the task into a background job.

The following command identifies the 20 slowest requests in the past hour,
which can provide an indication of what code paths to investigate.

```bash
grep $(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H --date='-1 hours') /var/log/php.access.log | sort -k 4 -r -n | head -20
```

If you see that the processing time of certain requests is slow (such as taking longer than 1000 ms),
you should consider a continuous observability solution like [Blackfire](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/blackfire.md)
to monitor your app and help you improve the performance issue.

Otherwise, you may check if the following options are applicable:

- Find the most visited pages and see if they can be cached and/or put behind a CDN.
  Refer to [how caching works](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).
- Upgrade your Upsun Fixed plan to get more computing resources.
###### Troubleshoot a crashed PHP process

If your PHP process crashed with a segmentation fault,
you encounter a message like the following:

```text {location="/var/log/app.log",}
WARNING: [pool web] child 112 exited on signal 11 (SIGSEGV) after 7.405936 seconds from start
```

Either a PHP extension is hitting a segmentation fault or your PHP app code is crashing.
Review recent changes in your app and try to find the root cause.
You might want to use a tool such as [Xdebug](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/xdebug.md) for quicker troubleshooting.

###### Troubleshoot a killed PHP process

If your PHP process is killed by the kernel,
you encounter a message like the following:

```text {location="/var/log/app.log",}
WARNING: [pool web] child 429 exited on signal 9 (SIGKILL) after 50.938617 seconds from start
```

That means the memory usage of your container exceeds the limit allowed on your plan, so the kernel kills the offending process.
To solve this issue, try the following approaches:

- Check if the memory usage of your app is as expected and try to optimize it.
- Use [sizing hints](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/fpm.md) to reduce the amount of PHP workers, which reduces the memory footprint.
- Upgrade your Upsun Fixed plan to get more computing resources.

###### Restart PHP processes stuck during a build or deployment

If your [build or deployment is running longer than expected](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#stuck-build-or-deployment),
it might be because of a PHP process getting stuck.

To restart your PHP processes, run the following command in your app container:

```bash
pkill -f php-fpm
```

###### Resource temporarily unavailable

If all PHP workers are busy,
you encounter a message like the following:

```text {location="/var/log/error.log",}
connect() to unix:/run/app.sock failed (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
```

This can be because too many requests are coming in at once
or the requests are taking too long to be processed (such as with calls to external third-party servers without timeouts).

To address the issue, you can:

- Lower the memory consumption of each request so that the amount of PHP workers gets automatically raised.
  This can be customized with the `runtime.sizing_hints.request_memory` key in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.
  For more details, consult [PHP-FPM sizing](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/fpm.md).
- Add a [CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md).
- Set up [HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/bestpractices/http-caching.md).
- Follow the global [performance tuning recommendations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/tuning.md).
- Remove stale plugins and extensions when using a CMS.
- Upgrade the container size to get more resources.
### Python

Follow these steps to get your server started.

1.  Specify one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions):
```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'python:3.13'
```
2.  Define the conditions for your web server:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
  upstream:
    # Send requests to the app server through a unix socket
    # Its location is defined in the SOCKET environment variable
    socket_family: "unix"

  # Start your app with the configuration you define
  # You can replace the file location with your location
  commands:
    start: "uwsgi --ini conf/uwsgi.ini"

  locations:
    # The folder from which to serve static assets
    "/":
      root: "public"
      passthru: true
      expires: 1h
```
3.  Create configuration for uWSGI such as the following:

    ```ini  {location="config/uwsgi.ini"}
    [uwsgi]
    # Unix socket to use to talk with the web server
    # Uses the variable defined in the configuration in step 2
    socket = $(SOCKET)
    protocol = http

    # the entry point to your app
    wsgi-file = app.py
    ```

    Replace `app.py` with whatever your file is.

4.  Install the requirements for your app.
```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
    python3:
        pipenv: "2022.12.19"

hooks:
    build: |
        set -eu
        pipenv install --system --deploy
```
5.  Define the entry point in your app:

    ```python
    # You can name the function differently and pass the new name as a flag
    # start: "uwsgi --ini conf/uwsgi.ini --callable <NAME>"
    def application(env, start_response):

        start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/html')])
        return [b"Hello world from Upsun Fixed"]
    ```

##### Package management

Your app container comes with pip pre-installed.
For more about managing packages with pip, Pipenv, and Poetry,
see how to [manage dependencies](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/python/dependencies.md).

To add global dependencies (packages available as commands),
add them to the `dependencies` in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#dependencies):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
    python3:
        <PACKAGE_NAME>: <PACKAGE_VERSION>
```
For example, to use `pipenv` to manage requirements and a virtual environment, add the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
    python3:
        pipenv: "2022.12.19"

hooks:
    build: |
        set -eu
        pipenv install --system --deploy
```
##### Connect to services

The following examples show how to access various [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) with Python.
For more information on configuring a given service, see the page for that service.

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the
[`platformshconfig` library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-python)
.
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

##### Sanitizing data

By default, data is inherited automatically by each child environment from its parent.
If you need to sanitize data in preview environments for compliance,
see how to [sanitize databases](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/sanitize-db.md).

##### Frameworks

All major Python web frameworks can be deployed on Upsun Fixed.
See dedicated guides for deploying and working with them:

- [Django](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/guides/django.md)

##### Project templates

  The following list shows templates available for Python apps.

A template is a starting point for building your project.
It should help you get a project ready for production.

    FastAPI
    This template demonstrates building the FastAPI framework for Upsun Fixed.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that demonstrates how to connect to a MariaDB server for data storage and Redis for caching.  The application starts as a bare Python process with no separate runner.  It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

###### Features:

 - Python 3.9

 - MariaDB 10.4

 - Redis 5.0

#### Manage Python dependencies


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

You can manage Python packages in different ways.
Python images come with pip installed,
but they're flexible enough so you can choose what package manager you want.
This article describes how to configure major package management tools.

This package management is different from global dependencies (packages available as commands),
which you can add in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).
See more about [managing global dependencies](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/python.md#package-management).

###### Pip

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the primary package installer for Python
and comes installed on every Python container.
You can use it to install packages from the Python Package Index and other locations.

To manage packages with pip,
commit a `requirements.txt` file with all of the dependencies needed for your app.
Then install the packages in your [`build` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md),
such as by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The following sections present ideas to keep in mind to ensure repeatable deployments on Upsun Fixed.

####### pip version

The version of pip on Python containers gets updated regularly.
But it isn't guaranteed to be the latest version or the version that matches your local environment.
You might want to define a specific version of pip in your deployments to further enforce repeatable builds.

To do so, modify your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md), as in the following examples:

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
hooks:
  build: |
    # Fail the build if any errors occur
    set -eu
    # Download the latest version of pip
    python3.13 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt    
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
variables:
  env:
    PIP_VERSION: '22.3.1'
hooks:
  build: |
    # Fail the build if any errors occur
    set -eu
    # Download a specific version of pip
    python3.13 -m pip install pip==$PIP_VERSION
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt    
```

####### pip freeze

You can write `requirements.txt` files in various ways.
You can specify anything from the latest major to a specific patch version in a [requirement specifier](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirement-specifiers/).
Use `pip freeze` before committing your requirements to pin specific package versions.
This ensures repeatable builds on Upsun Fixed with the same packages.

###### Pipenv

[Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a package manager for Python
that creates and manages a virtual environment for Python projects.
Dependencies are tracked and defined within a `Pipfile`.
It also generates a `Pipfile.lock` file to produce repeatable installs.

You can specify the latest or a specific version of Pipenv
in your deployments to ensure repeatable builds.
Because Pipenv depends on pip, you might want to also specify the pip version.

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
dependencies:
  python3:
    pipenv: '*'
hooks:
  build: |
    # Fail the build if any errors occur
    set -eu
    # Download the latest version of pip
    python3.13 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # Install dependencies
    # Include `--deploy` to fail the build if `Pipfile.lock` isn't up to date
    pipenv install --deploy    
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
variables:
  env:
    PIP_VERSION: '22.3.1'
dependencies:
  python3:
    pipenv: '2022.12.19'
hooks:
  build: |
    # Fail the build if any errors occur
    set -eu
    # Download a specific version of pip
    python3.13 -m pip install pip==$PIP_VERSION
    # Install dependencies
    # Include `--deploy` to fail the build if `Pipfile.lock` isn't up to date
    pipenv install --deploy    
```

###### UV

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an extremely fast Python package and project
manager, written in Rust.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'python:3.13'
dependencies:
  python3:
    uv: "*"
```

###### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages them for you.
Poetry offers a lock file to ensure repeatable installs and can build your project for distribution.
It also creates and manages virtual environments to keep project work isolated from the rest of your system.

To set up Poetry on Upsun Fixed, follow these steps:

1.  Configure your virtual environment by setting two variables in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).

    - [`POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvsin-project):
      Setting this to `true` places the virtual environment at the root of the app container: `/app/.venv`.
    - [`POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvscreate):
      Setting this to `true` ensures that the same virtual environment created during the build hook is reused in subsequent steps.

    Set the variables as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT: true
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE: true
```

2.  Install Poetry.
    You can specify the latest or a specific version of Poetry in your deployments to ensure repeatable builds.

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
dependencies:
  python3:
    poetry: '*'
variables:
  env:
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT: true
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE: true
hooks:
  build: |
    # Fail the build if any errors occur
    set -eu
    # Download the latest version of pip
    python3.13 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # Install dependencies
    poetry install    
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
dependencies:
  python3:
    poetry: '>=1.8'
variables:
  env:
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT: true
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE: true

hooks:
  build: |
    # Fail the build if any errors occur
    set -eu
    # Download the latest version of pip
    python3.13 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # Install dependencies
    poetry install    
```

3.  Make Poetry available outside the build hook.
    Although step 2 updated the `PATH` to make Poetry available during the build hook,
    it isn't enough to make it available at subsequent stages.

    To use Poetry in a start command, a deploy hook, or during SSH sessions,
    update the `PATH` in a [`.environment` file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script).

    ```text  {location=".environment"}
    # Updates PATH when Poetry is used, making it available during deploys, start commands, and SSH.
    if [ -n "$POETRY_VERSION" ]; then
        export PATH="/app/.local/bin:$PATH"
    fi
    ```

###### Anaconda

Some frameworks and tools recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda to manage packages in Python.
The following Community resources can help get you started with them:

- [Running and installing Anaconda/Miniconda on Upsun Fixed](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439726140946)
- [Running R Shiny using Miniconda on Upsun Fixed](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439711774994)
#### Web servers


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

The Python ecosystem offers a number of web servers that can be used to deploy to Upsun Fixed.
The following examples deploy a Django project named `myapp`.
They assume a `myapp/wsgi.py` or `myapp/asgi.py` file  with a callable `application`.
Adjust the examples to fit your framework and app.

###### Gunicorn

[Gunicorn](https://docs.gunicorn.org/) is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for Unix
that operates on a pre-fork worker model.
The Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, light on server resource usage, and fast.

To deploy with Gunicorn on Upsun Fixed ,
use one of the following examples to update your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../create-apps.md).

The examples vary based on both your package manager (Pip, Pipenv, or Poetry)
and whether your app listens on a TCP (default) or Unix (for running behind a proxy server) socket.
For more information on upstream sockets and protocols, see the [application reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream).

The snippets below assume that Gunicorn has been added as a dependency to your `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile.lock`, or `poetry.lock`.

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
web:
  commands:
    start: "gunicorn -w 4 -b localhost:$PORT myapp.wsgi:application"
  locations:
    "/":
      passthru: true
    "/static":
      root: "static"
      expires: 1h
      allow: true
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
web:
    upstream:
        socket_family: unix
    commands:
        start: "gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
    locations:
        "/":
            passthru: true
        "/static":
            root: "static"
            expires: 1h
            allow: true
```

    .platform.app.yaml

    locations:
        "/":
            passthru: true
        "/static":
            root: "static"
            expires: 1h
            allow: true
```

    .platform.app.yaml

        start: "pipenv run gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
    locations:
        "/":
            passthru: true
        "/static":
            root: "static"
            expires: 1h
            allow: true
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
web:
    commands:
        start: "poetry run gunicorn -w 4 -b localhost:$PORT myapp.wsgi:application"
    locations:
        "/":
            passthru: true
        "/static":
            root: "static"
            expires: 1h
            allow: true
```

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
web:
    upstream:
        socket_family: unix
    commands:
        start: "poetry run gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
    locations:
        "/":
            passthru: true
        "/static":
            root: "static"
            expires: 1h
            allow: true
```

####### Gunicorn workers

These examples define four worker processes with `-w 4`.
For more details on what you can configure, see the [Gunicorn documentation](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/faq.md#worker-processes).

Workers can also be defined with a custom [worker class](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.md#worker-class),
such as [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/#running-with-gunicorn), [gevent](https://www.gevent.org/),
or [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/).

For example, to add a Uvicorn worker class to the pip example for Unix,
adjust the start command to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
    upstream:
        socket_family: unix
    commands:
        start: "gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b unix:$SOCKET myapp.wsgi:application"
```
###### Daphne

[Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne) is a HTTP, HTTP2 ,and WebSocket protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP,
developed to power Django Channels.

To deploy with Daphne on Upsun Fixed ,
use one of the following examples to update your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../create-apps.md).

The examples vary based on both your package manager (Pip, Pipenv, or Poetry)
and whether your app listens on a TCP (default) or Unix (for running behind a proxy server) socket.
For more information on upstream sockets and protocols, see the [application reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream).

The snippets below assume that Daphne has been added as a dependency to your `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile.lock`, or `poetry.lock`.

```yaml {}
type: 'python:3.13'
web:
    commands:
        start: "daphne -p $PORT myapp.asgi:application"
    locations:

###### Uvicorn

[Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) is an ASGI web server implementation for Python.

To deploy with Uvicorn on Upsun Fixed ,
use one of the following examples to update your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../create-apps.md).

The examples vary based on both your package manager (Pip, Pipenv, or Poetry)
and whether your app listens on a TCP (default) or Unix (for running behind a proxy server) socket.
For more information on upstream sockets and protocols, see the [application reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream).

The snippets below assume that Uvicorn has been added as a dependency to your `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile.lock`, or `poetry.lock`.

```yaml {}

####### Uvicorn workers

These examples define four worker processes with `-w 4`.
For more recommendations on this and other settings, see the [Uvicorn documentation](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/#timeouts).

Instead of the `-w` flag, you can also use the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` variable.
See how to [set variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md).

###### Hypercorn

[Hypercorn](https://hypercorn.readthedocs.io/) is an ASGI and WSGI web server inspired by Gunicorn.

To deploy with Hypercorn on Upsun Fixed ,

####### Hypercorn workers

These examples define four worker processes with `-w 4`.
For more details on what you can configure, see the [Hypercorn documentation](https://hypercorn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guides/configuring.md).

Workers can also be defined with a custom [worker class](https://hypercorn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guides/configuring.md#configuration-options),
such as Asyncio, Uvloop, or Trio.

For example, to add a Asyncio worker class to the pip example for Unix,
adjust the start command to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
    upstream:
        socket_family: unix
    commands:
        start: "hypercorn myapp.asgi:application -b unix:$SOCKET -w 4 -k asyncio"
```
#### Manage Python versions in non-Python containers


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

####### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

You may need to use a specific version of Python that isn't available in an app container for a different language.
For example, a container might have a long-term support version, while you want the latest version.

In such cases, use the [Pyenv version manager](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
to install the specific version you want to use.

1.  Add your target Python version as a [variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/_index.md):

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    variables:
      env:
        # Update for your desired Python version.
        PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11.0"
    ```

2.  Add Pyenv in a [`build` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook):

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    hooks:
      build: |
        # Exit the hook on any failure
        set -e

        # Clone Pyenv to the build cache if not present
        if [ ! -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv" ]; then
            mkdir -p $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv
            git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv
        fi

        # Pyenv environment variables
        export PYENV_ROOT="$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv"
        export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"

        # Initialize Pyenv
        if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
            eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
        fi

        # Install desired Python version
        mkdir -p $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv/versions
        if [ ! -d "$PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv/versions/$PYTHON_VERSION" ]; then
            pyenv install $PYTHON_VERSION
        fi

        # Set global Python version
        pyenv global $PYTHON_VERSION
    ```

    Now your build hook can use the specified version of Python.
    You can verify this by running `python --version`.

    If you want this Python version to be available in the runtime environment, follow these steps:

1.  Copy Pyenv to your runtime environment at the end of your build hook:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    hooks:
      build: |
        ...

        # Copy Pyenv directory to runtime directory
        cp -R $PLATFORM_CACHE_DIR/.pyenv $PLATFORM_APP_DIR

        # Rehash Pyenv for new (runtime) location
        PYENV_ROOT="$PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.pyenv" $PLATFORM_APP_DIR/.pyenv/bin/pyenv rehash
    ```
2.  Create an [`.environment` file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script):

    ```bash
    touch .environment
    ```

3.  Update the PATH for the runtime environment:

    ```yaml  {location=".environment"}
    export PATH=/app/.pyenv/bin:/app/.pyenv/shims:$PATH
    ```

    Now the specified Python version is used in the runtime environment.
### Ruby


p:last-child]:mb-0 [&>h3]:mt-0 rounded-lg" >

###### Note
You can now use composable image (BETA) to install runtimes and tools in your application container. To find out more, see the [dedicated documentation page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md).

Upsun Fixed supports deploying any Ruby application. Your application can use any Ruby application server such as Puma or Unicorn and deploying a Rails or a Sinatra app is very straight forward.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major and minor version.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like. When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

###### Ruby

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |
| 

   - 3.4

   - 3.3

   - 3.2

   - 3.1

   - 3.0

  None available

###### Specify the language

To use Ruby, specify `ruby` as your [app's `type`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#types):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'ruby:<VERSION_NUMBER>'
```

For example:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
type: 'ruby:3.4'
```

###### Deprecated versions

The following versions are [deprecated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#deprecated-versions).
They're available, but they don't receive security updates from upstream and aren't guaranteed to work.
They'll be removed in the future – consider migrating to a [supported version](#supported-versions).

   - 2.7

   - 2.6

   - 2.5

   - 2.4

   - 2.3

##### Puma based Rails configuration

This example uses Puma to run a Ruby application.
You could use any Ruby application server such as Unicorn.

Configure the `.platform.app.yaml` file with a few key settings as listed below.
A complete example is included at the end of this section.

1. Specify the language of your application (available versions are listed above):

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    type: 'ruby:3.4'
    ```

2. Setup environment variables.

   Rails runs by default on a preview environment.
   You can change the Rails/Bundler via those environment variables,
   some of which are defaults on Upsun Fixed.

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    variables:
      env:
        PIDFILE: "tmp/server.pid" # Allow to start puma directly even if `tmp/pids` directory is not created
        RAILS_ENV: "production"
        BUNDLE_WITHOUT: 'development:test'
        TARGET_RUBY_VERSION: '~>3.4' # this will allow to not fail on PATCH update of the image
    ```

   The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` variable is generated automatically based on the
   [`PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY`
   variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables) but you can change it.

   Based on TARGET_RUBY_VERSION, we recommand to set on your Gemfile so next
   PATCH release of ruby doesn't fail the build:

   ```ruby
   ruby ENV["TARGET_RUBY_VERSION"] || File.read(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), ".ruby-version")).strip
   ```

3. Build your application with the build hook.

    Assuming you have your dependencies stored in the `Gemfile` at [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory),
    create a hook like the following:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    hooks:
      build: |
        set -e
        bundle install
        bundle exec rails assets:precompile
      deploy: bundle exec rake db:migrate
    ```

   These are installed as your project dependencies in your environment.
   You can also use the `dependencies` key to install global dependencies.
   These can be Ruby, Python, NodeJS, or PHP libraries.

   If you have assets, it's likely that you need NodeJS/yarn.

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    dependencies:
      nodejs:
        yarn: "*"
    ```
4. Configure the command to start serving your application (this must be a foreground-running process) under the `web` section:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    web:
      upstream:
        socket_family: unix
      commands:
        # for puma
        start: "bundle exec puma -b unix://$SOCKET"
        # for unicorn
        # start: "bundle exec unicorn -l $SOCKET"
    ```
   This assumes you have Unicorn as a dependency in your Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem "puma", ">= 5.0"
   ```

5. Define the web locations your application is using:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    web:
      locations:
        "/":
          root: "public"
          passthru: true
          expires: 1h
          allow: true
    ```
   This configuration sets the web server to handle HTTP requests at `/static`
   to serve static files stored in `/app/static/` folder.
   Everything else is forwarded to your application server.

6. Create any Read/Write mounts.
   The root file system is read only.
   You must explicitly describe writable mounts.

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    mounts:
      "/log":
        source: local
        source_path: log
      "/storage":
        source: local
        source_path: storage
      "/tmp":
        source: local
        source_path: tmp
    ```
   This setting allows your application writing temporary files to `/app/tmp`,
   logs stored in `/app/log`, and active storage in `/app/storage`.

   You can define other read/write mounts (your application code itself being deployed to a read-only file system).
   Note that the file system is persistent and when you backup your cluster these mounts are also backed up.

7. Then, setup the routes to your application in `.platform/routes.yaml`.

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"
```

##### Configuring services

This example assumes there is a MySQL instance.
To configure it, [create a service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md) such as the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/services.yaml"}
mysql:
  type: mysql:11.8
  disk: 2048
```
##### Connecting to services

Once you have a service, link to it in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
relationships:
  mysql:
```
By using the following Ruby function calls, you can obtain the database details.

```ruby
require "base64"
require "json"
relationships= JSON.parse(Base64.decode64(ENV['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']))
```

This should give you something like the following:

```json
{
  "mysql" : [
    {
      "path" : "main",
      "query" : {
        "is_master" : true
      },
      "port" : 3306,
      "username" : "user",
      "password" : "",
      "host" : "mysql.internal",
      "ip" : "246.0.241.50",
      "scheme" : "mysql"
    }
  ]
}
```

For Rails, you have two choices:

- Use the standard Rails `config/database.yml` with the values found with the snippet provided before
- Use the [platformsh-rails-helper gem](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-rails-helper)
  by adding it to your `Gemfile` and commenting the production block in `config/database.yml`

###### Configuration reader

While you can read the environment directly from your app,
you might want to use the
[helper library for Ruby apps](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-ruby-helper) or [one for Rails apps](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-rails-helper)
.
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.

##### Other tips

- To speed up boot you can use the [Bootsnap gem](https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap)
  and configure it with the local `/tmp`:

  ```ruby  {location="config/boot.rb"}
  Bootsnap.setup(cache_dir: "/tmp/cache")
  ```

- For garbage collection tuning, you can read [this article](https://shopify.engineering/17489064-tuning-rubys-global-method-cache)
  and look for [discourse configurations](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker/blob/b259c8d38e0f42288fd279c9f9efd3cefbc2c1cb/templates/web.template.yml#L8)

- New images are released on a regular basis to apply security patches. While the minor version will not change (as you are specifying it in the `type` property), the patch version will be updated. You may encounter this kind of error:

  ``` {no-copy="true"}
  bundler: failed to load command: puma (/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/3.2.0/bin/puma)
  /app/.global/gems/bundler-2.4.22/lib/bundler/definition.rb:447:in `validate_ruby!': Your Ruby version is 3.2.9, but your Gemfile specified 3.2.8 (Bundler::RubyVersionMismatch)
  ```

  To avoid issues when such updates are performed, use

  ``` ruby
  ruby ENV["TARGET_RUBY_VERSION"] || File.read(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), ".ruby-version")).strip
  ```

  in your `Gemfile`, where `TARGET_RUBY_VERSION` has been defined as above.

##### Troubleshooting

By default, deployments have `BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT=1` to ensure projects have a `Gemfile.lock` file.
This is safer for version yank issues and other version upgrade breakages.

You may encounter an error like the following during a build:

```txt
W: bundler: failed to load command: rake (/app/.global/bin/rake)
W: /app/.global/gems/bundler-2.3.5/lib/bundler/resolver.rb:268:in `block in verify_gemfile_dependencies_are_found!': Could not find gem 'rails (= 5.2.6)' in locally installed gems. (Bundler::GemNotFound)
```

To resolve this error:

1. Run `bundle install` with the same `ruby` and `bundler` versions defined in your `.platform.app.yaml` file.
2. Push the `Gemfile.lock` to your repository.
### Rust

Upsun Fixed supports building and deploying applications written in Rust.

##### Supported versions

You can select the major version. But the latest compatible minor version is applied automatically and can’t be overridden.

Patch versions are applied periodically for bug fixes and the like.
When you deploy your app, you always get the latest available patches.

| Grid | Dedicated Gen 2 |

##### Dependencies

The recommended way to handle Rust dependencies on Upsun Fixed is using Cargo.
Commit a `Cargo.toml` and a `Cargo.lock` file in your repository
so the system automatically downloads dependencies using Cargo.

##### Building and running your app

Assuming your `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files are present in your repository,
you can build your app using the `cargo build` command to produce a working executable.

You can then start it from the `web.commands.start` directive.
Note that the start command _must_ run in the foreground.
If the program terminates for any reason it is automatically restarted.

The following basic [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md) is sufficient to run most Rust apps.
See the [complete example](#complete-example) below for more details.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
# The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
name: 'myapp'

# The language and version for your app.
type: 'rust:1'

# The size of the app's persistent disk (in MB).
disk: 2048

hooks:
  build:
    cargo build

web:
  commands:
    # Customize the start command with your own target.
    start: './target/debug/hello'

  locations:
    /:
      # Route all requests to the Rust app, unconditionally.
      allow: false
      passthru: true
```
Note that there is still an Nginx proxy server sitting in front of your application. If desired, certain paths may be served directly by Nginx without hitting your application (for static files, primarily) or you may route all requests to the Rust app unconditionally, as in the example above.

##### Built-in variables

Upsun Fixed exposes relationships and other configuration as [environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).

To get the `PORT` environment variable (the port on which your app is supposed to listen),
use the following snippet:

```rust
let port : String = env::var("PORT").unwrap_or(String::from("8888"));
```

Note that some of the environment variables are in JSON format and are base64 encoded.
For example, to decode the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable,
use the following snippet:

```rust
use base64::{Engine as _, engine::{general_purpose}};
use serde_json::Value;

let bytes = general_purpose::STANDARD.decode(env::var("PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS").unwrap_or(String::new())).unwrap();
let psh_config: Value = serde_json::from_slice(&bytes).unwrap();
println!("{}", psh_config["database"]);
```

##### Complete example

Here is a basic hello world app to illustrate how you can use Rust with Upsun Fixed.
It builds from a `hello.rs` file to serve a static `index.html`.
Follow these steps:

1. [Install Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Create a repository for your app and add the following `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021"

    [[bin]]
    name = "hello"
    path = "hello.rs"

    [dependencies]
    time = "0.1.12"
    regex = "0.1.41"
    base64 = "0.21.0"
    serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }

    serde_json = "1.0"
    ```

3. Add the following [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

    ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    # The app's name, which must be unique within the project.
    name: 'myapp'

    # The language and version for your app.
    type: 'rust:1'

    # The size of the app's persistent disk (in MB).
    disk: 2048

    hooks:
      build:
        cargo build

    web:
      commands:
        # Customize the start command with your own target.
        start: './target/debug/hello'

      locations:
        /:
          # Route all requests to the Rust app, unconditionally.
          allow: false
          passthru: true
    ```
4. To generate a `Cargo.lock` file,
   run the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo generate-lockfile
   ```

5. Add the following `hello.rs` file:

   ```rust
   /* Simple HTTP Server */
   /* Author : Ramesh Vyas */
   use std::io::prelude::*;
   use std::net::TcpListener;
   use std::net::TcpStream;
   use std::fs;
   use std::env;

   fn main() {

       /* Creating a Local TcpListener at Port 8888 */
       const HOST : &str ="127.0.0.1";
       let port : String = env::var("PORT").unwrap_or(String::from("8888"));

       /* Concating Host address and Port to Create Final Endpoint */
       let end_point : String = HOST.to_owned() + ":" +  &port;

       /*Creating TCP Listener at our end point */
       let listener = TcpListener::bind(end_point).unwrap();

       println!("Web server is listening at port {}",port);

       /* Connecting to any incoming connections */
       for stream in listener.incoming() {
           let _stream = stream.unwrap();
           // Call Function to process any incomming connections
           handle_connection(_stream);
       }

   }

   fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
       let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
       stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();

       let get = b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n";

       if buffer.starts_with(get) {
           let contents = fs::read_to_string("index.html").unwrap();

           let response = format!(
               "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: {}\r\n\r\n{}",
               contents.len(),
               contents
           );

           stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
           stream.flush().unwrap();
       } else {
           // some other request
       }
   }
   ```

    Magento 2 Community Edition
    This template builds Magento 2 CE on Upsun Fixed.  It includes additional scripts to customize Magento to run effectively in a build-and-deploy environment.  A MariaDB database and Redis cache server come pre-configured and work out of the box.  The installer has been modified to not ask for database information.  Background workers are run using a worker container rather than via cron.
Magento is a fully integrated ecommerce system and web store written in PHP.  This is the Open Source version.

###### Features:

 - PHP 7.2

 - MariaDB 10.2

 - Redis 3.2

 - Dedicated worker instance for background processing

    WooCommerce (Bedrock) for Upsun Fixed
    This template builds WordPress on Upsun Fixed using the Bedrock boilerplate by Roots with Composer. It includes WooCommerce and JetPack as dependencies, which when enabled will quickly allow you to create a store on WordPress.
Plugins and themes should be managed with Composer exclusively. The only modifications made to the standard Bedrock boilerplate have been providing database credentials and main site url parameters via environment variables. With this configuration, the database is automatically configured such that the installer will not ask you for database credentials. While Bedrock provides support to replicate this configuration in a ``.env`` file for local development, an example Lando configuration file is included as the recommendated method to do so.
WordPress is a blogging and lightweight CMS written in PHP, and Bedrock is a Composer-based WordPress boilerplate project with a slightly modified project structure and configuration protocol. WooCommerce is an open-source eCommerce platform and plugin for WordPress.

###### Features:

 - PHP 7.4

 - MariaDB 10.4

 - Automatic TLS certificates

    FastAPI
    This template demonstrates building the FastAPI framework for Upsun Fixed.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that demonstrates how to connect to a MariaDB server for data storage and Redis for caching.  The application starts as a bare Python process with no separate runner.  It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

###### Features:

 - Python 3.9

 - MariaDB 10.4

 - Redis 5.0

### Set up your local development environment

To make changes to your app's code and test them without affecting your production environment,
set up a local development environment on your computer.

For the most effective testing, you want your local environment to match your Upsun Fixed environments.
The best way to do this is to use a cross-platform tool based on Docker.
This ensures the changes you make locally appear as they would on your Upsun Fixed environments.
It also means you don't have to worry about configuring your machine with
the various dependencies, certificates, and connections your app needs to run.

The **recommended tool** for local development with Upsun Fixed is **[DDEV](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/ddev.md)**.
The integration with DDEV is maintained by Upsun Fixed to ensure it works smoothly.

Other Docker-based tools are also supported, such as [Docksal](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/docksal.md) and [Lando](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/lando.md).
If you choose to use a Docker-based tool, follow the steps on its page. Otherwise, follow these steps to run
your app on your computer.

##### Before you begin

You need to have:

- An Upsun account
- A working project
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

##### 1. Get your code

If you don't have your app code on your computer, download a copy.

1.  Get your project ID by running `platform projects`.

2.  Get the code by running the following command:

    ```bash
    platform get <PROJECT_ID> <TARGET_DIRECTORY_NAME>
    ```

    Or pull from your [integrated Git repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md).

You can now access your code from the project directory on your computer.
The CLI created a `.platform/applications.yaml/local` directory that's excluded from Git.
It contains builds and local metadata about your project.

You can now make changes to your project without pushing to Upsun Fixed each time to test them.
Instead, you can locally build your application using the Upsun Fixed CLI.

Note that if your app contains services, you need to open an SSH tunnel to connect to them.
For more information, see how to [connect services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services#2-connect-the-service).

##### 2. Connect to services

If your app requires services to run, you have two options for developing locally:

- [Tethered local development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/tethered.md) involves running your app on a local web server
  but keeping all other services on Upsun Fixed and connecting to them over an SSH tunnel.
- [Untethered local development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/untethered.md) involves running your entire site locally,
  including all services.

Choose the option that works for you and get your services running.

##### 3. Build your site locally

If you want your local development environment to be enclosed
so your main system remains unaffected by the build and its dependencies,
you can use a local virtual machine.

To build your site locally:

1.  Install any dependencies or tools needed for the build process.

2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    platform build
    ```

    Your app is built in the `.platform/applications.yaml/local/builds` directory.
    Unless you specify otherwise with the `--destination` flag,
    a symbolic link from your build is created as the `_www` directory at your project root.

3.  To check that the build was successful, move to the `_www` directory
    and run a web server.
#### Use DDEV for local development


[DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an open-source tool for local development environments.
It allows you to use Docker in your workflows while maintaining a GitOps workflow.
You get fully containerized environments to run everything locally
without having to install tools (including the Upsun Fixed  CLI, PHP, and Composer) on your machine.

This guide assumes you have a project already running with Upsun Fixed and you have the code on your computer.

If you're starting from scratch, first [create a project from a PHP template](
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/template?_utm_campaign=cta_deploy_marketplace_template&utm_source=public_documentation&_utm_medium=organic
).

###### Before you begin

Make sure your computer meets the [system requirements for DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements).

For the integration to run smoothly, you also need the following tools:

- `jq`
- `base64`
- `perl`

If you don't have these already installed, use your normal package manager.

###### 1. Install DDEV

To install DDEV, follow the [DDEV documentation for your operating system](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/).

This installs the self-contained `ddev` command-line interface (CLI).
For more information on `ddev`, run `ddev help`.

###### 2. Add DDEV configuration to your project

Get basic configuration set up for your project by running the following command:

```bash
ddev config
```

If you started with a Drupal template, your repository already had DDEV configuration files.
Otherwise, you have to answer a couple of questions about what your repository is
so the correct files are added.

###### 3. Add an API token

To connect DDEV with your Upsun Fixed  account, use a Upsun Fixed  API token.

First [create an API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token) in the Console.

Then add the token to your DDEV configuration.
You can do so globally (easiest for most people):

```bash
ddev config global --web-environment-add=PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN>

```

You can also add the token only to the project:

```bash
ddev config --web-environment-add=PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN>

```

###### 4. Connect DDEV to your project

The best way to connect your local DDEV to your Upsun Fixed project is through the [Upsun Fixed  DDEV add-on](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh).
To add it, run the following command:

```bash
ddev get ddev/ddev-platformsh
```

Answer the interactive prompts with your project ID and the name of the environment to pull data from.

With the add-on, you can now run `ddev platform ` from your computer without needing to install the Upsun Fixed  CLI.

###### 5. Optional: Get your project data

To get your environment data (files, database), run the following command:

```bash
ddev pull platform
```

To skip pulling files, add `--skip-files` to the command.
To skip pulling a database, add `--skip-db` to the command.

###### 6. Run your project

Now your project is ready to run:

```bash
ddev start
```

This runs all your hooks and builds your project like on Upsun Fixed.

The command returns the project URL `http://<PROJECT_NAME>.ddev.site/`
as well as a specific port on `http://127.0.0.1`.
To see your project running, open one of these URLs.

###### What's next

You've got a project running on a local web server.
Now you can add customizations.
For more ideas and options, see the [DDEV documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

####### Add environment variables

If your project requires environment variables for its hooks or runtime,
add them to the project's DDEV environment:

```yaml  {location=".ddev/config.yaml"}
web_environment:
  - <VARIABLE_NAME>: <VALUE>
```

To apply your changes, run the following command:

```bash
ddev restart
```
#### Tethered local development

To test changes locally, you can connect your locally running web server
to service containers on an active Upsun Fixed environment.
This method requires less configuration than tools such as [DDEV](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/ddev.md),
but may not perform well enough for everyday use.
Because it replies on a local web server, it's also less consistent across your team.

###### Before you begin

You need:

- A local copy of the repository for a  project running on Upsun Fixed.

  To get one, run ``platform
 get <PROJECT_ID>
``.

  Alternatively, you can clone an integrated source repository and set the remote branch.
  To do so, run ``platform
 project:set-remote <PROJECT_ID>
``.
- The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)

###### Create the tethered connection

1. Create a new environment based on production.

   ```bash
   platform branch new-feature <PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
   ```

   If you're using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
   open a merge/pull request.

1. To open an SSH tunnel to the new environment's services, run the following command:

   ```bash
   platform tunnel:open
   ```

   This command returns the addresses for SSH tunnels to all of your services.

1. Export the `PLATFORMSH_RELATIONSHIPS` environment variable with information from the open tunnel:

   ```bash
   export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info --encode)"
   ```

1. Run your application locally.
   Make sure it's set up to read configuration from Upsun Fixed environment variables.

   If you app relies on other Upsun Fixed environment configuration, such as routes or secret variables,
   make sure to mock those variables as well.

   Your options for running the app depend on the language and configuration.
   You can use the server for your language, install a copy of Nginx,
   or use a virtual machine or Docker image.

1.  When you've finished your work, close the tunnels to your services by running the following command:

    ```bash
    platform tunnel:close --all -y
    ```

###### Connect to services directly

With open tunnels to all your services, you can also connect to the running services directly.
To get information on all running services, run the following command:

```bash
platform tunnels
```

You get a response similar to the following:

```bash
+-------+---------------+-------------+-----+--------------+
| Port  | Project       | Environment | App | Relationship |
+-------+---------------+-------------+-----+--------------+
| 30000 | abcdefg123456 | new-feature | app | cache        |
| 30001 | abcdefg123456 | new-feature | app | database     |
+-------+---------------+-------------+-----+--------------+
```

You can use the port information to connect directly to a service.
If you need more detailed information, such as a path or password, run the following command:

```bash
platform tunnel:info
```

You can use the information returned to connect to the remote database as if it were local.
For example, the following command would connect to a MySQL database running through a tethered connection:

```bash
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=<PORT> --user=<USERNAME> --password=<PASSWORD> --database=<PATH>
```

###### Next steps

You can now use your local environment to develop changes for review on Upsun Fixed environments.
The following examples show how you can take advantage of that.

####### Onboard collaborators

It's essential for every developer on your team to have a local development environment to work on.
Place the local configuration into a script to ensure everyone has this.
You can merge this change into production.

1.  Create a new environment called `local-config`.

1.  To set up a local environment for a new Upsun Fixed environment, create an executable script.

    ```bash
    touch init-local.sh && chmod +x init-local.sh
    ```

1. Fill it with something similar to the following example, depending on your app and configuration:

   ```bash  {location="init-local.sh"}
   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   ENVIRONMENT=$1
   PARENT=$2

   # Create the new environment
   platform branch $ENVIRONMENT $PARENT

   # Open a tunnel to the current environment
   platform tunnel:open --no-interaction

   # Mock Upsun Fixed environment variables
   export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info --encode)"

   # Add any other variables you need

   # If necessary, install dependencies here

   # Add the command to run the server
   ```

1. To commit and push the revisions, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "Add local configuration" && git push platform local-config
   ```

1.  Merge the change into production.

Once the script is merged into production,
any user can set up their local environment by running the following commands:

```bash
platform <PROJECT_ID>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
./init-local.sh <PROJECT_ID> another-new-feature <PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```
#### Untethered local development

It's possible to run your entire site locally on your computer.
That way you get better performance as there's no extra latency to connect to a remote database and doesn't require an active Internet connection to work.
But it does require running all necessary services (databases, search servers, and so on) locally.
These can be set up however you prefer, although Upsun Fixed recommends using a virtual machine to make it easier to share configuration between developers.

If you already have a development workflow in place that works for you, you can keep using it with virtually no changes.

To synchronize data from an environment on Upsun Fixed, consult the documentation for each [service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).
Each service type has its own native data import/export process and Upsun Fixed doesn't get in the way of that.
It's also straightforward to [download user files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/exporting.md) from your application using rsync.
#### Use Docksal for local development

[Docksal](https://docksal.io) is a Docker-based local development tool that plays nicely with Upsun Fixed.
It allows you to have fully containerized environments to run everything locally
without having to install tools (such as the Upsun Fixed CLI) on your machine.
It's maintained by a community of developers and is a viable option for most Upsun Fixed projects.

This guide assumes you have a project already running within Upsun Fixed.
If you're starting from scratch, first [create a project from a template](
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/template?_utm_campaign=cta_deploy_marketplace_template&utm_source=public_documentation&_utm_medium=organic
).

###### Before you begin

Make sure your computer meets the [system requirements for Docksal](https://docs.docksal.io/getting-started/setup/#system-requirements).

###### 1. Install Docksal

To install Docksal, follow the [Docksal documentation for your operating system](https://docs.docksal.io/getting-started/setup/#install).

This installs Docksal and `fin`, its command-line interface (CLI).
For more information on `fin`, run `fin help`.

###### 2. Create a projects directory

Create a directory to store all of your Docksal projects.
It's recommended to be `~/Projects` on Linux/macOS and `C:\Projects` on Windows.
See all [restrictions on the projects directory](https://docs.docksal.io/getting-started/project-setup/#projects-directory).

###### 3. Add an API token

To connect Docksal with your Upsun account, use an Upsun API token.

1. [Create an API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token) in the Console.
2. Add the token to your Docksal configuration by running this command:

   ```bash
   fin config set --global SECRET_PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN="<API_TOKEN>"
   ```

Now you can run `fin platform <COMMAND>` from your computer without needing to install the Upsun Fixed CLI.

###### 4. Get your project

To get your project, pull it with the following command:

```bash
fin pull init --hosting-platform='platformsh' --hosting-site=<PROJECT_ID> --hosting-env=<ENVIRONMENT_NAME> <TARGET_DIRECTORY_NAME>
```

This creates a directory with the specified name with all your files and code.
It also adds a `.docksal` directory with all necessary Docksal configuration.
These files are ignored by Upsun Fixed.

###### 5. Add commands

Docksal doesn't automatically copy over any commands you have in your [build flavor](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#build)
and [hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md).
To get your project running like on Upsun Fixed, you have to add the commands to Docksal.

The `.docksal/commands` directory should already have one command (`init`) such as the following:

```bash  {location=".docksal/commands/init"}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

fin project rm -f
fin project start

```

This command removes any running Docksal containers and starts new ones.
You can add new commands here that run on `fin init`
or create a new file to run on `fin <NAME_OF_FILE>`.

You can add your build flavor and hook commands after these commands.
That way the Docksal CLI container is running and can process commands.

For example, to install dependencies, use a command like the following depending on your dependency manager:

```bash {}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

fin project rm -f
fin project start

cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
echo "Installing dependencies..."
npm install
```

    .docksal/commands/init

```bash {}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

fin project rm -f
fin project start

cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
echo "Installing dependencies..."
fin composer install
```

###### 6. Run your project

Now your project is ready to run.
In your project directory, run `fin init`.

The command returns the project URL `http://<DIRECTORY_NAME>.docksal/`.
Open this URL to see your project running.

###### What's next

You've got a project running on a local web server.
Now you can add customizations.
For more ideas and options, see the [Docksal documentation](https://docs.docksal.io/).

####### Add environment variables

If your project requires environment variables for its hooks,
add them to the Docksal environment.

    .docksal/docksal.env

```txt {}
<VARIABLE_NAME>=<VARIABLE_VALUE>

HOSTING_PLATFORM="platformsh"
```

To apply your changes, run the following command:

```bash
fin project restart
```

####### Customize your stack

Docksal comes configured with a default PHP container (known as the CLI container),
web container, and database container.
You can customize the versions for each.

Check the available versions for each by running `fin image registry <IMAGE>`.
For example, to check the available containers for the app, run `fin image registry docksal/cli`.

You can then use the version you want by adding it as an [environment variable](#add-environment-variables).
For example, to use the latest version, run the following command:

```bash
fin config set CLI_IMAGE='docksal/cli:latest'
```

You can also customize the `.docksal/docksal.yml` file.
Use it for a docker-compose definition for your [custom configurations](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/custom-configuration/#custom-configuration).

####### Import MySQL data into Docksal

To download your data from Upsun Fixed and load it into your Docksal database container, run the following commands:

```bash
fin platform db:dump --gzip -f /tmp/database.sql.gz
fin exec 'zcat < /tmp/database.sql.gz | mysql -u user -p user -h db default'
```

You can also set the username, password, and database name using [specific environment variables](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/configuration-variables/#mysql-user).
#### Use Lando for local development

[Lando](https://docs.lando.dev) is a third-party local development tool for which several stacks are available (LAMP, LEMP, MEAN).
Lando works with most services supported by Upsun Fixed [except for](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/caveats.md#unsupported-things) Vault KMS and network storage.
See a list of [supported services](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/config.md#services-yaml).

**Note**: 

Lando used to support Upsun Fixed PHP projects out of the box through a plugin.
However, this plugin is now deprecated.
It’s still available, but it’s no longer receiving updates and isn’t guaranteed to work.

For a seamless experience, switch to [DDEV](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/ddev.md), which is the recommended tool for local development with Upsun Fixed.
The integration with DDEV is maintained by Upsun Fixed to ensure it works smoothly.
Note that a Upsun Fixed migration guide from Lando to DDEV will be released soon.

For a complete reference, consult the following resources:

- [Lando Upsun Fixed plugin documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/) and [source code](https://github.com/lando/platformsh)
- [Lando documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/)

###### Before you begin

You need :

- Hardware that meets the [requirements](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.md#hardware-requirements).
- A PHP project.

Lando doesn't automatically pull and set up environment variables that have been set in the Console.
To use a build hook that requires environment variables, manually [add them](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/config.md#environment-variables).

###### 1. Install Lando

Follow the [Lando installation instructions](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.md).

###### 2. Create an access token

To authorize Lando to communicate with Upsun Fixed, create an [API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#2-create-an-api-token).
Copy the value.

###### 3. Initialize Lando

For a quicker start, create a project based on the Upsun Fixed [PHP template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/php).
The template provides the most basic configuration for running a custom PHP project built with Composer.
It also includes the required Upsun Fixed configuration files out of the box.

 - [Create a new project based on the PHP template](https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/template?query=php&amp;_utm_campaign=cta_deploy_marketplace_template&utm_source=public_documentation&_utm_medium=organic).
 - Clone that project locally in one of these ways:

 - Using the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) by running ``platform get <PROJECT_ID>``.
 - Using [Git](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-environment.md#actions-on-environments)

 - In the project’s folder, run ``lando init –recipe platformsh –source platformsh –platformsh-auth <API_TOKEN>``.
 - Follow the instructions provided by the interactive prompt.
On the ``Which project?`` step, select the project created in the first step.

The `init` command generates the `.lando.yml` file required to start Lando.
It also adds to your account a [public SSH key](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/ssh-keys.md).

###### 4. Start Lando

To start your app and services, run `lando start`.

###### 5. Access your local app

The last lines of the `lando start` command from the previous step contains URL to the different app and services.
Access your app and services by opening the according URLs in your browser.

###### What's next

- [Import data and download files](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/sync.md) from your remote Upsun Fixed site.
- If you make changes in the Upsun Fixed [configuration files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/structure.md) during development, run `lando rebuild` for these to be taken into account in Lando.
- To keep your Lando image up-to-date, see how to [update Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/updating.md).

###### Troubleshooting

**Note**: 

Lando used to support Upsun Fixed PHP projects out of the box through a plugin.
However, this plugin is now deprecated.
It’s still available, but it’s no longer receiving updates and isn’t guaranteed to work.

For a seamless experience, switch to [DDEV](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/local/ddev.md), which is the recommended tool for local development with Upsun Fixed.
The integration with DDEV is maintained by Upsun Fixed to ensure it works smoothly.
Note that a Upsun Fixed migration guide from Lando to DDEV will be released soon.

- Make sure that the [Upsun Fixed configuration files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/structure.md) are present in your local repository.
- Check that your [services](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/config.md#services-yaml) are supported by Lando.
- Check [caveats and known issues](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/platformsh/caveats.md).
- Carefully check the output of the Lando commands you run to spot warnings and errors.
- Run `lando rebuild`.
- Restart Lando in debug mode by running `lando restart -vvv`.
- Check that you don't face common issues, such as [DNS rebinding protection](https://docs.lando.dev/help/dns-rebind.md).
- For more extensive troubleshooting, check the [Lando documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/help/logs.md#install-logs).

####### Access logs

Access the global logs by running `lando logs`.

To access specific logs:

1. Run `lando list` to get a list of the services you are using.
2. Choose the one you'd like to inspect.
3. Run ``lando logs -s <SERVICE_TO_INSPECT>``.

For more guidance regarding logs, check the [Lando logs documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/help/logs.md)

####### Untrusted SSL certificate

When you access your local Lando sites through HTTPS, you get an error message in your browser.
This is expected behavior.

Find out how to solve it in the [Lando blog](https://lando.dev/blog/2020/03/20/5-things-to-do-after-you-install-lando.md).

### Variables overview


Variables give you control over your project’s build process and runtime environment. You can set them in your code to make changes across your project or independent of the code for environment-specific settings.

In this way, your app has additional information, such as database credentials, the host or port it can use, and which server to connect to.

##### Variable types

You can set variables at different levels.
All variables can be strings or base64-encoded JSON-serialized values.

The following table defines what types of variables are available to you:

| Type                                                                             | Definer     | Scope       | Precedence | Build | Runtime  | Uses |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |----- |
| [Application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-in-your-app) | Application | Application | 4          | Yes   | Yes      | Non-secret values that are the same across all environments |
| [Project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-project-variables)                           | User        | Project     | 3          | Yes   | Yes      | Secret values that are the same across all environments, such as database credentials |
| [Environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables)          | User        | Environment | 2          | Some  | Yes      | Values that vary by environment, such as which database to connect to or which payment API keys to use |
| [Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables)                 | Pre-defined | Environment | 1          | Some  | Yes      | For information about your Upsun Fixed project |

If there are conflicts between variables with the same name, variables [take precedence](#overrides) from 1 down.
So Upsun Fixed-provided values (1) override environment variables (2), which override project variables (3),
which override application-provided variables (4).

All of the variables can also be [overridden via a script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script).

###### Choosing a variable type

Choose how to set the variable based on what you are trying to do.

Some environment variables should be the same for all environments.
For example:

- Build tool versions.
  If you have scripts that use specific versions of build tools (such as a [specific Node.js version](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs/node-version.md)),
  You want the tools to be versioned along with your code so you can track the impact of changes.
  Set those variables [in the application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-in-your-app).
- Credentials for common services.
  If you have credentials for services shared across your environments,
  you don't want to commit these secrets to code.
  Set them as sensitive [project variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-project-variables).

Other configurations should vary between environment types.
For example:

- Service configuration for databases and such.
  This information be read from the Upsun Fixed-provided [`PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
  It varies by environment automatically.
- Mode toggles such as enabling `debug` mode, disabling certain caches, and displaying more verbose errors.
  This information might vary by environment type and should be set on the [environment level](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables).
- API keys for remote services, especially payment gateways.
  If you have a different payment gateway for production and for testing,
  set its keys on the [environment level](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables).

##### Overrides

If the names of variables at different levels match,
an environment variable overrides a variable with the same name in a parent environment
and both override a project variable.
All variables can also be [overridden via script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script).

For an example of how the different levels work,
suppose you have the following inheritable variables defined for the `main` environment:

```sh
platform var -e main
Variables on the project Example (abcdef123456), environment main:
+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
| Name           | Level       | Value  | Enabled |
+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
| system_name    | project     | Spiffy |         |
| system_version | project     | 1.5    |         |
| api_key        | environment | abc123 | true    |
| debug_mode     | environment | 1      | true    |
+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
```

And the following variables defined for the `feature-x` environment, a child environment of `main`:

```sh
platform var -e feature-x
Variables on the project Example (abcdef123456), environment feature-x:
+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
| Name           | Level       | Value  | Enabled |
+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
| system_name    | project     | Spiffy |         |
| system_version | project     | 1.5    |         |
| api_key        | environment | def456 | true    |
| system_version | environment | 1.7    | true    |
+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
```

In the `main` environment, you can access `$PLATFORM_VARIABLES`:

```bash
echo $PLATFORM_VARIABLES | base64 --decode | jq
```

The output looks like this:

```json
{
    "system_name": "Spiffy",
    "system_version": "1.5",
    "api_key": "abc123",
    "debug_mode": "1"
}
```

While in the `feature-x` environment, it looks like this:

```json
{
    "system_name": "Spiffy",
    "system_version": "1.7",
    "api_key": "def456",
    "debug_mode": "1"
}
```

To get a visual overview of which variables are overridden in an environment,
navigate in the Console to that environment's variables settings.
This example shows how it looks within the `feature-x` environment:

![The Console showing the variables split into environment and project ones, with the environment variables `api_key` and `system_version` labeled as overridden and `debug_mode` as inherited the project variable `system_version` labeled as inactive.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/variables-overridden.png "0.5")

Project variables that conflict with environment variables are labeled as **Inactive**.
Environment variables are labeled as **Inherited** when they get their value from a parent environment
and as **Overridden** when there is a conflict and the parent environment's value doesn't apply.

##### Variable prefixes

Certain variable name prefixes have special meanings.
Some are defined by Upsun Fixed and apply automatically.
Others are just available as a convention for your application code to follow.

###### Top-level environment variables

By default, project and environment variables are only added to the `PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable.
You can also expose a variable as its own environment variable by giving it the prefix `env:`.

For example, the variable `env:foo` creates an environment variable called `FOO`.
(Note the automatic upper-casing.)

```bash
platform variable:create --name env:foo --value bar
```

You can then access that variable directly in your app container:

```bash
echo $FOO
bar
```

Note that environment variables with the `env:` prefix aren't added to the `PLATFORM_VARIABLES` environment variable.

###### PHP-specific variables

Any variable with the prefix `php` is added to the PHP configuration for all PHP-based application containers in the project.

Using variables, you can use the same files for all your environments and override values on any given environment if needed.

You can set the PHP memory limit to 256 MB on a specific environment by running the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/_index.md):

```bash
platform variable:create --level environment --prefix php --name memory_limit --value 256M --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

To use variables across environments, set them in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).
For example, to change the PHP memory limit for all environments, use the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
applications:
  <APP_NAME>:
    variables:
      php:
        memory_limit: "256M"
```

###### Framework-specific variables

For specific frameworks, you can implement logic to override global configurations with [environment-specific variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables).
So you can use the same codebase and settings for all your environments,
but still adapt the behavior to each environment.

####### Implementation example
The [Drupal template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10/) shows an example of
overriding Drupal configuration using environment variables.
These variables are parsed in the [settings.platformsh.php](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10/blob/386ea35b034b5d78da8060925940e793bea479d9/web/sites/default/settings.platformsh.php#L126-L164).
For example, the site name is overridden by a variable named ``drupalsettings:system.site:name``.
Variables for the override are composed of three distinct parts each separated by colons:

 - A prefix (``drupalsettings``)
 - The configuration object to override (``system.site``)
 - The property to set (``name``)

Setting the ``drupalsettings:system.site:name`` variable overrides the ``name`` property of the ``system.site`` configuration object located in the global ``$settings`` array.
You can do this by running the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md):

```bash {}
platform variable:create --name "drupalsettings:system.site:name" --value "<SITE_NAME>"
```

The same logic applies for other configuration options,
such as the global ``$config`` array, which uses the variable prefix ``drupalconfig``.
You need to name your Upsun Fixed variables to match the ones used in your script.
Make sure that the Upsun Fixed variables start with a string present in your ``switch`` statement.
You can apply similar logic for [other frameworks and languages](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

#### Set variables

To set variables, determine which [type of variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-types) to use.
Remember to take into account the order of precedence.
All of the variables can also be [overridden via script](#set-variables-via-script).

###### Set variables in your app

Set variables [in code](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#variables) using the `.platform.app.yaml` file.
These values are the same across all environments and present in the Git repository,
which makes them a poor fit for API keys and other such secrets.

They're better fits for uses such as configuration for consistent builds across every environment,
including setting [PHP configuration values](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#php-specific-variables).

Application variables are available at both build time and runtime.

###### Create project variables

Add secrets for all environments in project variables
using [the Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-project.md#variables) or the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).

For example, you may need to vary API credentials between production and other environments.
To do so, set the non-production credentials as a project variable
and then override these credentials for the production environment by setting a [variable specific to that environment](#create-environment-specific-variables).

To specify other options, use the [flags for variable options](#variable-options).
To add a project variable, follow these steps:

 - Select the project where you want to create a variable.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Under **Project settings**, click **Variables**.
 - Click **+ Create variable**.
 - Enter a name for the variable.
 - Enter the variable value.
 - Ensure you have selected the right [other options](#variable-options).
 - Click **Create variable**.

When naming variables, be sure to take [variable prefixes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-prefixes) into account.
In particular, to expose a variable as its own environment variable,
[use the prefix `env:`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#top-level-environment-variables).

####### Variable options

Variables have several Boolean options you can set in the Console or the CLI:

| Option    | CLI flag            | Default | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSON      | `--json`            | `false` | Whether the variable is a JSON-serialized value (`true`) or a string (`false`).                                                                        |
| Sensitive | `--sensitive`       | `false` | If set to `true`, the variable's value is hidden in the Console and in CLI responses for added security. It's still readable within the app container. |
| Runtime   | `--visible-runtime` | `true`  | Whether the variable is available at runtime.                                                                                                          |
| Build     | `--visible-build`   | `true`  | Whether the variable is available at build time.                                                                                                       |

So if you want the `foo` variable to be visible at build time but hidden during runtime,
you can set it by running the following command:

```bash
platform variable:create --level project --name foo --value bar --visible-build true --visible-runtime false
```

You can also change the variable options after you create them (except for sensitive values, which can't be set to non-sensitive).
For example, to make the `foo` variable visible at runtime and hidden during the build, run the following command:

```bash
platform variable:update foo --visible-build false --visible-runtime true
```

Note that for changes to project variables to have effect,
you need to [redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy) your environments.

###### Create environment-specific variables

Set variables for specific environments using [the Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-environment.md#variables) or the CLI.
Variables can be inherited or overridden from parent environments and project variables.
See [more on overriding values](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#overrides).

To specify the environment for the variable, use the ``-e`` flag to specify its name.
To specify other options, use the [flags for variable options](#environment-variable-options).
To add a project variable, follow these steps:

 - Select the project where you want to create a variable.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Under **Environments**, click the environment where you want to create a variable.
 - Click **Variables**.
 - Click **+ Create variable**.
 - Enter a name for the variable.
 - Enter the variable value.
 - Ensure you have selected the right [other options](#environment-variable-options).
 - Click **Create variable**.

When naming variables, be sure to take [variable prefixes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-prefixes) into account.
In particular, to expose a variable as its own environment variable,
[use the prefix `env:`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#top-level-environment-variables).

####### Environment variable options

Environment variables share all of the [options available for project variables](#variable-options).
Environment variables have one additional option:

| Option      | CLI flag        | Default | Description                                              |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Inheritable | `--inheritable` | `true`  | Whether the variable is inherited by child environments. |

This option is useful for setting production-only values such as credentials.
For example, to set a PayPal secret value for only the `main` branch and have it not be readable elsewhere,
run the following command:

```bash
platform variable:create -e main --name paypal_id --inheritable false --sensitive true
```

Other environments don't inherit it and get either a project variable of the same name if it exists or no value at all.

Note that changing an environment variable causes that environment to be redeployed so the new value is available.
But child environments are *not* redeployed.
To make the new value accessible to those environments, [trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

####### Example environment variable

Environment variables are a good place to store values that apply only on Upsun Fixed and not on your local development environment.
This includes API credentials for third-party services, mode settings, and which server (development vs. production) to use.

One example would be to define a Node.js application's build on a production branch (`NODE_ENV=production`),
but use development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`) for each of your preview environments.
Assuming you have a `main` environment for production and a `staging` environment with more child environments for development,
run the following commands:

```bash
platform variable:create -l environment -e main --prefix env: --name NODE_ENV --value production --visible-build true --inheritable false
platform variable:create -l environment -e staging --prefix env: --name NODE_ENV --value development --visible-build true --inheritable true
```

Now `NODE_ENV` is `production` on the default branch but `development` on `staging` and each of its child environments.
Note that build visible environment variables change the application's build configuration ID:
value updates trigger a rebuild of the application in the same way that a commit would.

###### Set variables via script

You can also provide a `.environment` file as in [your app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory).
This file runs as a script in dash when the container starts and on all SSH logins.
It can be used to set any environment variables directly, such as the PATH variable.

For example, the following `.environment` file allows any executable installed in the `vendor/bin` directory
(such as executables installed using Composer)
to be run regardless of the current directory:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export PATH=/app/vendor/bin:$PATH
```

You can also dynamically define environment variables based on the current environment.
For example, you might want to get the [defined route](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) with the id `api` for the current environment.
To define it as the `URL` environment variable, you might add something like:

```bash  {location=".environment"}
URL=$(echo $PLATFORM_ROUTES | base64 --decode | jq -r 'to_entries[] | select (.value.id == "api") | .key')
```

Note that the file is sourced after all other environment variables above are defined and so they're available to the script.
This also means the `.environment` script has the last word on environment variable values and can override anything it wants to.

####### Testing `.environment` scripts

You may find that a command that works during an SSH session provides a `bad substitution` error when placed in a `.environment` file.
Remember, `.environment` is sourced using dash, not bash.
When testing your `.environment` logic, be sure to first enter a `dash` session in your terminal or within the SSH session.

When testing, you might print to stdout (using an `echo` or `printf` command) to check what's happening.
The following example looks for a `deploy/environment.tracker.txt` file.
It displays a different message if it's found or not, which helps you track what variables are being set.

```bash  {location=".environment"}
if [ -f "deploy/environment.tracker.txt" ]; then
    echo "File found."
    export DEPLOY='Friday'
else
    echo "File not found."
    export DEPLOY='Never on a Friday'

While sanity checks like this are useful during troubleshooting, you shouldn't include such commands in your final code.
Because the `.environment` file is run at the start of an SSH session, the message is printed at the start of the session.

Even when your SSH command executes successfully, you might later attempt to download data from one of your mounts,
such as by using the CLI command `platform mount:download`.
When you do, you see this error:

```bash
protocol version mismatch -- is your shell clean?
(see the rsync man page for an explanation)
rsync error: protocol incompatibility (code 2) at .../rsync/compat.c(61) [receiver=2.6.9]

[ProcessFailedException]
The command failed with the exit code: 2
```

This failure comes because `mount:download` and `rsync` don't expect output when the SSH connection is made.
To solve the issue, remove the printed output from your `.environment` file.

###### Map variables

If your app needs different names for environment variable than those set by Upsun Fixed, which is common for database connections,
map the Upsun Fixed's variable names to those required by the application.
Do this in the app with the help of the [Config Reader library](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app) or via a shell script.

For example, the following [`.environment` script](#set-variables-via-script) exports variables that are visible to the application.
It uses the `jq` library, which is included in all app containers for this purpose.

```bash  {location=".environment"}
export APP_DATABASE_HOST="$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].host')"
export APP_DATABASE_USER="$(echo $PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].username')"
```

This sets environment variables with names your app needs and the values from `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`.

###### When to use `.env` files {#use-env-files}

Upsun does not read `.env files`, as conventionally they are not committed to Git. You can use these for local
development, but they will not be sourced on any Upsun environment. Typically, you can add `.env` to your .gitignore
file so that its contents can vary for different developers.

Read more about [the use cases for `.env` files](https://upsun.com/blog/what-is-env-file/).
#### Use variables

Get a list of all variables defined on a given environment in [the Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-environment.md#variables)
or use the CLI:

```bash
platform var
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
Variables on the project Example (abcdef123456), environment main:
+------+---------+-------+---------+
| Name | Level   | Value | Enabled |
+------+---------+-------+---------+
| foo  | project | bar   | true    |
+------+---------+-------+---------+
```

###### Access variables in a shell

Project and environment variables with the [prefix](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#top-level-environment-variables) `env:`
are available as Unix environment variables in all caps.
Access these variables and Upsun Fixed-provided variables directly like this:

```bash
echo $FOO
bar
echo $PLATFORM_APPLICATION_NAME
Sample Project
```

Other project and environment variables are listed together in the `PLATFORM_VARIABLES` variable as a base64-encoded JSON object.
Access them like this:

```bash
echo $PLATFORM_VARIABLES | base64 --decode
{"theanswer": "42"}
```

You can also get the value for a single variable within the array, such as with this command,
which uses the [`jq` processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```bash
echo $PLATFORM_VARIABLES | base64 --decode | jq '.theanswer'
"42"
```

Variable availability depends on the type and configuration.
Variables available during builds can be accessed in `build` hooks and those available at runtime can be accessed in `deploy` hooks.

###### Access variables in your app

To access environment variables in your app, you can use the Upsun Fixed Config Reader for the given language:

* [PHP](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php)
* [Python](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-python)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs)
* [Go](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-go)
* [Java](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-ruby-helper)
* [Elixir](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-elixir)

Alternatively, use a built-in method for the given language.

```python {}
import os
import json
import base64

# A simple variable.
project_id = os.getenv('PLATFORM_PROJECT')

# An encoded JSON object.
variables = json.loads(base64.b64decode(os.getenv('PLATFORM_VARIABLES')).decode('utf-8'))
```

```js {}
const { env } = process;

// Utility to assist in decoding a packed JSON variable.
function read_base64_json(varName) {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(Buffer.from(env[varName], "base64").toString());
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(`no ${varName} environment variable`);
  }
};

// A simple variable.
const projectId = env.PLATFORM_PROJECT;

// An encoded JSON object.
const variables = read_base64_json('PLATFORM_VARIABLES');
```

```ruby {}
# A simple variable.
project_id = ENV["PLATFORM_PROJECT"] || nil

# An encoded JSON object.
variables = JSON.parse(Base64.decode64(ENV["PLATFORM_VARIABLES"]))
```

```java {}
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Base64;
import java.util.Map;

import static java.lang.System.getenv;
import static java.util.Base64.getDecoder;

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // A simple variable.
        final String project = getenv("PLATFORM_PROJECT");
        // An encoded JSON object.
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        final Map<String, Object> variables = mapper.readValue(
                String.valueOf(getDecoder().decode(getenv("PLATFORM_VARIABLES"))), Map.class);
    }
}
```

####### Access complex values

Variables can have nested structures.
The following example shows nested structures in an [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#variables):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
  env:
    BASIC: "a string"
    INGREDIENTS:
      - 'peanut butter'
      - 'jelly'
    QUANTITIES:
      "milk": "1 liter"
      "cookies": "1 kg"
  stuff:
    STEPS: ['one', 'two', 'three']
    COLORS:
      red: '#FF0000'
      green: '#00FF00'
      blue: '#0000FF'
```

You can access these nested variables as follows:

```php {}
<?php
var_dump($_ENV['BASIC']);
// string(8) "a string"

var_dump($_ENV['INGREDIENTS']);
// string(26) "["peanut butter", "jelly"]"

var_dump($_ENV['QUANTITIES']);
// string(38) "{"milk": "1 liter", "cookies": "1 kg"}"

$variables = json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV['PLATFORM_VARIABLES']), TRUE);

print_r($variables['stuff:STEPS']);
/*
array(3) {
  [0]=>
  string(2) "one"
  [1]=>
  string(4) "two"
  [2]=>
  string(5) "three"
}
*/

print_r($variables['stuff:COLORS']);
/*
array(3) {
  ["red"]=>
  string(7) "#FF0000"
  ["green"]=>
  string(7) "#00FF00"
  ["blue"]=>
  string(7) "#0000FF"
}
*/
```

```python {}
import os
import json
import base64

print os.getenv('BASIC')
# a string

print os.getenv('INGREDIENTS')
# ["peanut butter", "jelly"]

print os.getenv('QUANTITIES')
# {"milk": "1 liter", "cookies": "1 kg"}

variables = json.loads(base64.b64decode(os.getenv('PLATFORM_VARIABLES')).decode('utf-8'))

print variables['stuff:STEPS']
# [u'one', u'two', u'three']
print variables['stuff:COLORS']
# {u'blue': u'#0000FF', u'green': u'#00FF00', u'red': u'#FF0000'}
```

```java {}
scriptconst { BASIC, INGREDIENTS, QUANTITIES, PLATFORM_VARIABLES } = process.env;

const { "stuff:STEPS": stuffSteps, "stuff:COLORS": stuffColors } = JSON.parse(
  Buffer.from(PLATFORM_VARIABLES, "base64").toString()
);

console.log(BASIC);
// "a string"
console.log(INGREDIENTS);
// ["peanut butter", "jelly"]
console.log(QUANTITIES);
// {"cookies": "1 kg", "milk": "1 liter"}
console.log(stuffSteps);
// [ 'one', 'two', 'three' ]
console.log(stuffColors);
// { blue: '#0000FF', green: '#00FF00', red: '#FF0000' }
```

###### Use provided variables

Upsun Fixed also provides a series of variables to inform your app about its runtime configuration.
Many of them have a `PLATFORM_` prefix to differentiate them from user-provided values.
You can't set or update them directly.

The most important of these variables is the relationship information in `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`,
which tells the app how to connect to databases and other services defined in `.platform/services.yaml`.

The following table presents all available variables
and whether they're available at build time (during [build hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook))
and at runtime.

| Variable name                            | Build | Runtime | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY`  | Yes   | Yes     | A random, 56-character value created at project creation and then stable throughout the project's life. Can be used for Drupal hash salts, Symfony secrets, and other similar values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`    | No    | Yes     | A base64-encoded JSON object of relationships. The keys are the relationship name and the values are arrays of relationship endpoint definitions. The exact format is defined differently for each [service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md).                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `PLATFORM_ROUTES`           | No    | Yes     | A base64-encoded JSON object that describes the routes for the environment. It maps the content of your [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md). Note that this information is also available in your `/run/config.json` file.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `PLATFORM_SMTP_HOST`        | No    | Yes     | The SMTP host to send email messages through. Is empty when mail is disabled for the current environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `PLATFORM_SOURCE_DIR`       | Yes   | No      | The path to the root directory of your code repository in the context of a running [source operation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md). The directory contains a writable copy of your repository that you can commit to during the operation.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `PLATFORM_TREE_ID`          | Yes   | Yes     | The ID of the tree the application was built from, essentially the SHA hash of the tree in Git. Use when you need a unique ID for each build.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `PLATFORM_VARIABLES`        | Some  | Some    | A base64-encoded JSON object with all user-defined project and environment variables that don't use a [prefix](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-prefixes). The keys are the variable names and the values are the variable values. Availability during builds and at runtime depends on the settings for each variable. See how to [access individual variables](#access-variables-in-a-shell). |
| `PLATFORM_VENDOR`           | Yes   | No      | Allows you to change the behavior of the build according to the vendor (Upsun Fixed or Upsun).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `PORT`                                   | No    | Yes     | A `string` representing the port to which requests are sent if the [`web.upstream.socket_family` property](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream) is unset or set to `tcp`.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `SOCKET`                                 | No    | Yes     | A `string` representing the path to the Unix socket file to use if the [`web.upstream.socket_family` property](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream) is set to `unix`.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

####### Variables on Dedicated Gen 2 environments

[Dedicated Gen 2 instances](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md) also have the following variables available:

| Variable name    | Build | Runtime | Description |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `PLATFORM_CLUSTER` | No    | Yes     | The cluster ID. In older Dedicated Gen 2 instances, this is used to get the project ID. When several projects are linked, this provides the main project/cluster they're linked to, while `PLATFORM_PROJECT` offers the specific project ID. |
| `PLATFORM_MODE`    | No    | Yes     | `enterprise` in all Dedicated Gen 2 production and staging environments. Note that an Enterprise support plan doesn't always imply a Dedicated Gen 2 environment, but a Dedicated Gen 2 environment always implies an Enterprise support plan. |

######## Distinguish Dedicated Gen 2 environment types

While both production and staging Dedicated Gen 2 environments have `enterprise` for the `PLATFORM_MODE` variable,
you can distinguish them by environment type.
Make sure that the environment type is set correctly via the CLI or Console.
Then run different code based on the type:

```bash
if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ] ; then
    echo "This is live on production"
else if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = staging ] ; then
    echo "This is on staging"
else
    echo "We're on development"
fi
```

####### `PLATFORM_APPLICATION`

The `PLATFORM_APPLICATION` variable is available both at build time and in the runtime environment.
But the specific attributes it contains differ in each case.

Each environment's build is associated with a configuration ID that identifies it uniquely so builds can be reused.
The ID is a product of your app code and some of its [configuration for Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).
Not every attribute your app configuration is relevant to the build.
Only those attributes that are relevant to builds are accessible at build time from `PLATFORM_APPLICATION`.

Attributes that are **not** available in `PLATFORM_APPLICATION` during builds:

- Everything under `access`
- Everything under `relationship`
- Everything under `firewall`
- `hooks.deploy` and `hooks.post_deploy`
- Everything under `crons`
- Everything under  `web`, except `web.mounts`
- Everything under `workers`, except `workers.mounts`

These attributes aren't visible during build because they aren't included as a part of the configuration component of the build slug.
So modifying these values in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md) doesn't trigger an app rebuild, only a redeploy.
For more information, read about [how builds work](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md#the-build).

###### Use variables in static files

Some apps require configuration values to be specified in a static, non-executable file (such as a `.ini`, `.xml`, or `.yaml` file)
and don't support reading from environment variables.

To populate these files with variables you set yourself,
make sure the variables are set to be [visible at build time](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#variable-options).

The files can't be populated with Upsun Fixed-provided variables not available at build time (such as `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`).
You also can't write to them in a `deploy` hook as the file system is read only.

One workaround is to create a symbolic link to a writable location and then write to it in a [`deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook).
The following example shows the process, though you have to modify it to fit your needs.

1. Create a mount that isn't accessible to the web in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   mounts:
     /config:
       source: local
       source_path: config
   ```

2. Create a symbolic link from the config file the application wants to a location in that mount:

   ```bash
   # From the application root...

   ln -s config/db.yaml db.yaml
   ```

   This example assumes the app wants a `db.yaml` file in its root for configuration.
3. Commit the symbolic link and an empty `config` directory to Git.
4. Configure a script to read from environment variables and write to `config/db.yaml`.
   Create a file with a shell script similar to this:

   ```bash  {location="export-config.sh"}
   #!/bin/bash

   # Ensure the file is empty.
   cat '' > config/db.yaml

   # Map the database information from the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable into the YAML file.
   # Use this process to use whatever variable names your app needs.

   printf "host: %s\n" "$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].host')" >> config/db.yaml
   printf "user: %s\n" "$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].username')" >> config/db.yaml
   ```

5. Call the script from the `deploy` hook your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/_index.md):

   ```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
   hooks:
     deploy: |
       bash export-config.sh
   ```

Now, when your app starts and attempts to parse `db.yaml`, the symbolic link redirects it to `config/db.yaml`.
Your script writes to that file on each deploy with updated information.
Your app reads the exported values and proceeds as expected.
### Access your site

Once you have an environment running, you can view it in a web browser.
To find which URLs you can use to access your site, follow these steps:

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform url
```

 - Select the URL to open in a browser.

For more information about URLs in your project and how you can control access to your web applications,
see how to [define routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/).

### Transfer files to and from your app

After your app is built, its file system is read-only.
This means that the only way you can edit your app's code is through Git.

However, you can transfer files to and from your built app without using Git.
To do so, you need to configure mounts or use an SSH client.

[Mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) let you set up directories that remain writable after the build is complete.
You can then transfer files directly to and from mounts inside your app
with a single command via the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).

Alternatively, you can transfer files to and from your built app using an SSH client
such as `scp` or `rsync`.

##### Transfer files using the CLI

###### View the mounts inside your app

Before you start transferring files,
you may want to view a list of all the mounts inside your app.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
platform mounts
```

The output is similar to the following:

```bash
Mounts on abcdefgh1234567-main-abcd123--app@ssh.eu.platform.sh:
+-------------------------+----------------------+
| Mount path              | Definition           |
+-------------------------+----------------------+
| web/sites/default/files | source: local        |
|                         | source_path: files   |
| private                 | source: local        |
|                         | source_path: local   |
| tmp                     | source: tmp          |
|                         | source_path: temp    |
+-------------------------+----------------------+
```

###### Transfer a file to a mount

To transfer a file to a mount using the CLI, you can use the `mount:upload` command.

For example, to upload the files contained in the local `private` directory to the `private` mount,
run the following command:

```bash
platform mount:upload --mount private --source ./private
```

You get the following output:

```bash
Uploading files from ./private to the remote mount private

Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]

  sending incremental file list
  example.sh

  sent 2.35K bytes  received 20 bytes  1.58K bytes/sec
  total size is 1.77M  speedup is 745.09
```

###### Transfer a file from a mount

To transfer a file from a mount using the CLI, you can use the `mount:download` command.

For example, to download a file from the `private` mount to your local `private` directory,
run the following command:

```bash
platform mount:download --mount private --target ./private
```

You get the following output:

```bash
Downloading files from the remote mount private to ./private

Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]

  receiving incremental file list
  example.sh

  sent 2.35K bytes  received 20 bytes  1.58K bytes/sec
  total size is 1.77M  speedup is 745.09
```

##### Transfer files using an SSH client

Another way to transfer files to and from your built app is to use an SSH client such as [`scp`](file-transfer.md#scp),
[`rsync`](file-transfer.md#rsync), or [`sftp`](file-transfer.md#sftp).

###### scp

You can use `scp` to copy files to and from a remote environment.

For example, to download a `diagram.png` file from the `web/uploads` directory
(relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)),
run the following command:

```bash
scp "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads/diagram.png .
```

The `diagram.png` file is copied to the current local directory.

To copy files from your local directory to the Upsun Fixed environment,
reverse the order of the parameters:

```bash
scp diagram.png "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads
```

For other options, see the [`scp` documentation](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.md).

###### rsync

You can use `rsync` to copy files to and from a remote environment.

For example, to copy all the files in the `web/uploads` directory on the remote environment
to the local `uploads` directory,
run the following command:

```bash
rsync -azP "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads/ ./uploads/
```

To copy files from your local directory to the Upsun Fixed environment,
reverse the order of the parameters:

```bash
rsync -azP uploads/ "$(platform ssh --pipe)":web/uploads/
```

Note that `rsync` is very sensitive about trailing `/` characters.

If you're using UTF-8 encoded files on macOS,
add the `--iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8` flag to your `rsync` call.

For more options, consult the [rsync documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.md).

###### sftp

You can use `sftp` to copy files to and from a remote environment.

**Note**: 

``sftp`` is supported on the Grid, but the following limitations apply:

 - You can only create ``sftp`` accounts with an existing Upsun Fixed user and an SSH key.
Custom users and passwords aren’t supported.
 - ``sftp`` access cannot be limited to a specific directory.
Instead, access is given to **the whole application directory** and its mounts.

``sftp`` is also supported on Dedicated projects with different limitations and requirements.
For more information, see the [Dedicated Gen 2](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md#sftp) section.

####### Open an `sftp` connection

Run the following command:

```bash
sftp "$(platform ssh --pipe)"
```

When prompted, select the project and environment you want to connect to.
The `sftp` connection is open once the `sftp>` prompt is displayed in your terminal.

####### Download a file

Say you want to download a `diagram.png` file from the `web/uploads` directory
(relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)).
To do so, run the following command:

```
sftp> get web/uploads/diagram.png
```

The `diagram.png` file is copied to the current local directory.

####### Upload a file

Say you want to upload a `diagram.png` file to the `web/uploads` directory
(relative to the [app root](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#root-directory)).
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
sftp> put diagram.png web/uploads
```

For other options, see the [`sftp` documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sftp.1.md).
### HTTP Headers


Upsun Fixed adds a number of HTTP headers to both inbound and outbound messages. We don’t modify or block existing headers on either request or response.

##### Request headers

Upsun Fixed adds the following HTTP headers in the router to give the application information about the connection. These are stable and may be examined by the application as necessary.

* `X-Forwarded-Proto`: The protocol forwarded to the application, for example: `http`, `https`.
* `X-Client-IP`: The remote IP address of the request.
* `X-Client-SSL`: Set "on" only if the client is using SSL connection, otherwise the header isn't added.
* `X-Original-Route`: The route in `.platform/routes.yaml` which is used currently, for example: `https://{default}/`.

##### Response headers

Upsun Fixed adds a number of response headers automatically to assist in debugging connections. These headers should be treated as a semi-private API. Do not code against them, but they may be inspected to help determine how Upsun Fixed handled the request to aid in debugging.

- `X-Platform-Cache`: Either `HIT` or `MISS` to indicate if the router in your cluster served the response from its own cache or if the request was passed through to the application.
- `X-Platform-Cluster`: The ID of the cluster that received the request. The cluster name is formed from the project ID and environment ID.
- `X-Platform-Processor`: The ID of the container that generated the response. The container ID is the cluster ID plus the container name.
- `X-Platform-Router`: The ID of the router that served the request. The router ID is the processor ID of the router container, specifically.
- `X-Debug-Info`: This is a header added by the edge layer. It doesn't contain any sensitive information or anything that could be misused. It has no relation to the PHP debugging tool [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org).

##### Classification data headers

Upsun Fixed sends classification data to your backend system through the following HTTP headers.

| HTTP header          | Type    | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Client-Cdn`         | string  | When a CDN that is supported by Upsun Fixed is used, this header displays its name (Fastly, Cloudflare, or Cloudfront). |
| `Client-Country`     | string  | The two-character ISO 3166-1 country code of the end-client IP (after CDN handling for the CDNs that Upsun Fixed supports). The geolocation data sent through this header is provided by [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data).|
| `Client-Abuse-Score` | integer | The abuse score of the end-client IP. A score >= 100 indicates a near certainty that the request comes from an abusive IP.  The abuse data sent through this header is provided by [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/). |
| `Client-Asn`         | integer | The Autonomous System number of the end-client IP.  The geolocation data sent through this header is provided by [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data).|

##### Custom headers

Apart from those listed above, your application is responsible for setting its own response headers.

You can also [add headers to static files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/web/custom-headers.md).
### Send email

You can configure your Upsun Fixed environments to send emails via an SMTP proxy.

Emails aren't guaranteed to be deliverable and you can't white-label them.
The SMTP proxy is intended as a zero-configuration, best-effort service.

**Note**: 

All preview environments are limited to 12,000 email credits per calendar month.

##### 1. Turn on outgoing email

You can turn on outgoing email for each environment.
By default, email is turned on for your Production environment and blocked for other environments.

To turn it on for a specific environment, follow these steps:

To turn on outgoing email, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:info --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> enable_smtp true
```

To turn off outgoing email, replace ``true`` with ``false``.

Changing the setting rebuilds the environment.

##### 2. Recommended: Improve deliverability

Improve deliverability of your email with [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/glossary/spf).
If you don't have an SPF record, add the following `TXT` record to your domain's DNS records:

```txt
v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net -all
```

Having several, conflicting `TXT` records isn't supported due to [rfc4408 section 3.1.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4408#section-3.1.2).

If you already have an SPF record, please add SendGrid into your existing record.

##### 3. (Optional) Validate your email

  **Tier availability**
  This feature is available for
  **Enterprise and Elite** customers. [Compare the  tiers](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) on our pricing page, or [contact our sales team](https://upsun.com/contact-us/
  ) for more information.

If you're on an Enterprise or Elite plan,
you can request for DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to be enabled on your domain.

DKIM improves your delivery rate as an email sender.
Learn more about [how DKIM works](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/glossary/dkim).

To have DKIM enabled for your domain:

1. Open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) with the domain where you want DKIM.
2. Update your DNS configuration with the `CNAME` and `TXT` records that you get in the ticket.

Checks for the expected DNS records run every 15 minutes before validation.

The `TXT` record looks similar to the following:

```txt
v=spf1 include:u17504801.wl.sendgrid.net -all
```

##### 4. Test the email service

To test the email service, use the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) to connect to your app by running `platform ssh`.
Run the following command:

```bash
printf "From: <SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS>\nSubject: Test \nThis is a test message" | /usr/sbin/sendmail <RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
```

Replace the variables with actual email addresses as in the following example:

```bash
printf "From: someone@example.com\nSubject: Test \nThis is a test message" | /usr/sbin/sendmail someone@example.net
```

In a little while, the test message should arrive at the recipient address.

**Note**: 

When sending emails from your project, **use a mail address that is on the same domain as your project** otherwise it will be flagged as spoofing attempt and not be sent.

Also, **make sure to test with real email addresses**. If you send emails to fake domains (such as ``example.com``), they fail and hurt your sending reputation. Make sure your test emails are deliverable.

##### 5. Send email from your app

You can use `/usr/sbin/sendmail` on your app container to send emails as with the example in the previous step.
Or use the `PLATFORM_SMTP_HOST` environment variable in your SMTP configuration.

When outgoing emails are on, `PLATFORM_SMTP_HOST` is the address of the SMTP host that should be used.
When outgoing emails are off, the variable is empty.

When using `PLATFORM_SMTP_HOST`, send email through port 25 (often the default).
Your emails are proxied through the Upsun Fixed SMTP host and encrypted over port 465
before being sent to the outside world.

The precise way to send email depends on the language and framework you use.
See some examples for given languages.

JavaMail is a Java API used to send and receive email via SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.
JavaMail is built into the [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/) platform, but also provides an optional package for use in Java SE.
[Jakarta Mail](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.mail) defines a platform-independent and protocol-independent framework to build mail and messaging applications.
The following example sends email using Jakarta Mail:

```java {}
import sh.platform.config.Config;

import javax.mail.Message;
import javax.mail.MessagingException;
import javax.mail.Session;
import javax.mail.Transport;
import javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress;
import javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class JavaEmailSender {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(JavaEmailSender.class.getName());

    public void send() {
        Config config = new Config();
        String to = "";//change accordingly
        String from = "";//change accordingly
        String host = config.getSmtpHost();
        //or IP address
        //Get the session object
        Properties properties = System.getProperties();
        properties.setProperty("mail.smtp.host", host);
        Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(properties);

        //compose the message
        try {
            MimeMessage message = new MimeMessage(session);
            message.setFrom(new InternetAddress(from));
            message.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, new InternetAddress(to));
            message.setSubject("Ping");
            message.setText("Hello, this is example of sending email  ");

            // Send message
            Transport.send(message);
            System.out.println("message sent successfully....");

        } catch (MessagingException exp) {
            exp.printStackTrace();
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "there is an error to send an message", exp);
        }
    }
}
```

Guides on using JavaMail:

 - [Send email with HTML formatting and attachments](https://mkyong.com/java/java-how-to-send-email/)
 - [JavaMail API](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/)

##### Alternative: Use a different email server

If you need more options, use your own SMTP server or email delivery service provider.
Bear in mind that TCP port 25 is blocked for security reasons.
Use port 465 or 587 instead to send email to your own external email server.
### Pull code from a private Git repository

To complete its build, your Upsun Fixed project may need to access pieces of code stored in private Git repositories.
Examples include themes, libraries, and modules.
Configure these repositories to grant access to your project.

To grant access to a private Git repository,
add the project's public SSH key to your Git repository's deploy keys.

##### 1. Get your project's public key

1. In the Console, open the project you want.
2. Click **Settings Settings**.
3. Under **Project settings**, click **Deploy key**.
4. Click ** Copy**.

![Deploy Key](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-deploy-key.png "0.5")

##### 2. Add the key to your repository in your Git provider

* [GitHub deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys)
* [GitLab deploy key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/#grant-project-access-to-a-public-deploy-key)
* [Bitbucket access key](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/configure-repository-settings/)

If you're only pulling code, the key doesn't need write permissions.

Now your Upsun Fixed project can access your private repository via SSH, including to add dependencies.

This means you can access the private repository through links like:
``git@<GIT_PROVIDER>:<PATH_OR_USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git``.
For example, you can clone a repository in your [`build` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/_index.md):

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/module.git
```

You can also use [private repositories as submodules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/submodules.md#use-private-git-repositories).

##### Using multiple private GitHub repositories

GitHub requires a separate deploy key for each repository.
To grant your project access to multiple repositories, create an automated user account, known as a machine user, with its own SSH key.

You can then add the machine account as collaborator to specific repositories
or to a team with access to the repositories.

See more information about [machine users on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users).
### Use Git submodules

##### Clone submodules during deployment

Upsun Fixed allows you to use submodules in your Git repository.
They're usually listed in a `.gitmodules` file at the root of your Git repository.
When you push via Git, Upsun Fixed tries to clone them automatically.

The following example is based on [a Bigfoot multi-app project](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp/tree/multiapp-subfolders-applications) which uses the following submodules:

- A [BigFoot app](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-api/tree/without-platform-app-yaml)
- An [API Platform v3, Admin component](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin/tree/without-platform-app-yaml)
- A [Gatsby frontend](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-gatsby/tree/without-platform-app-yaml)
- A [Mercure Rocks server](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-mercure/tree/without-platform-app-yaml)

![Diagram of a project containing multiple apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/config-diagrams/multiple-app.png "0.5")

To import all the submodules, run the following commands from your multiple application project's root folder:

```bash
touch .gitmodules
git submodule add --name admin https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin.git admin
git submodule add --name api https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-api.git api
git submodule add --name gatsby https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-gatsby.git gatsby
git submodule add --name mercure https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-mercure.git mercure
git add .
git commit -m "Adding submodules for Bigfoot App, API Platform Admin, Gatsby frontend and Mercure Rocks server"
git push
```

Here is an example of a `.gitmodules` file:

```ini
[submodule "admin"]
  path = admin
  url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin.git
[submodule "api"]
  path = api
  url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-api.git
[submodule "gatsby"]
  path = gatsby
  url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-gatsby.git
[submodule "mercure"]
  path = mercure
  url = https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-mercure.git
```

When you run `git push`, you can see the output of the logs:

```bash
  Validating submodules
    Updating submodule ttps://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin.git
    Updated submodule https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin.git: 549 references updated.
    Updating submodule ttps://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-api.git
    Updated submodule https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-api.git: 898 references updated.
    Updating submodule https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-gatsby.git
    Updated submodule https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-gatsby.git: 257 references updated.
    Updating submodule https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-mercure.git
    Updated submodule https://github.com/platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-mercure.git: 124 references updated.
  ...
```

**Note**: 

If your submodule contains an independent app,
see [how to configure it properly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#split-your-code-source-into-multiple-git-submodule-repositories).

##### Update submodules

**Note**: 

To specify which submodule needs to be updated, replace ``[submodule]`` with your submodule path.

**Tier availability**: 

This feature is available for **Elite** and **Enterprise** customers.
[Compare the Upsun Fixed tiers](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) on our pricing page,
or [contact our Sales team](https://upsun.com/contact-us/) for more information.

Automate your submodule updates using a [source operation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md).
To do so, follow these steps:

 - Define a source operation. 
Add the following configuration to your ``.platform.app.yaml`` file:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
source:
  operations:
    rebuild:
      command: |
        set -e
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        git submodule update --remote --checkout
        git add admin api gatsby mercure
        if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD; then
          git commit -m "Updating submodules admin, api, gatsby and mercure"
        fi        
```

For multiple app projects, make sure you define your source operation
in the configuration of an app whose source code **is not** in a submodule.
If you use [Git submodules for each of your apps](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app/project-structure.md#split-your-code-source-into-multiple-git-submodule-repositories), define a new app at the top level of your project repository.
Don’t define routes so your app isn’t exposed to the web.
To define a source operation, add the following configuration to your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md):

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
# The type of the application to build.
type: 'nodejs:24'

# The web key configures the web server running in front of your app.
web:
  # Commands are run once after deployment to start the application process.
  commands:
    # The command to launch your app. If it terminates, it’s restarted immediately.
    # As this app will handle source operation only, no need to keep it alive (sleep)
    start: |
      sleep infinity      
source:
  operations:
    update-submodules:
      command: |
        set -e
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        git submodule update --remote --checkout
        git add .
        if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD; then
          git commit -m "Updating submodules"
        fi
        # "git push" is automatic at the end of this command        
```

 - Run your source operation. 
To do so, in the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md),
navigate to the environment where you want to run the source operation. 
Click More **More**. 
Click **Run Source Operation**. 
Select the operation you want to run. 
Click **Run**.
Alternatively, to run your source operation from the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md),
run the following command:

```bash {}
platform source-operation:run <SOURCE_OPERATION_NAME>
```

##### Error when validating submodules

Using an SSH URL (`git@github.com:...`) to fetch submodules triggers the following error:

```bash
Validating submodules.
  Found unresolvable links, updating submodules.

E: Error validating submodules in tree:
    - admin: Exception: commit 03567c6 not found.

   This might be due to the following errors fetching submodules:
    - git@github.com:platformsh-templates/bigfoot-multiapp-admin.git: HangupException: The remote server unexpectedly closed the connection.
```

This is due to the fact that the Upsun Fixed Git server can't connect to GitHub via SSH without being granted an SSH key to do so.
To solve this issue, use an HTTPS URL (`https://github.com/...`) instead.

##### Use private Git repositories

When using Git submodules that are private repositories, URLs with the HTTPS protocol fail with errors such as the following:

```bash
GitProtocolError: unexpected http resp 401 for https://bitbucket.org/myusername/mymodule.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
```

To fix this, follow these steps:

1. Change your module declarations to use SSH for URLs.

    Your existing declaration might look like this:

    ```bash  {location=".gitmodules"}
    [submodule "support/module"]
        path = support/module
        url = https://bitbucket.org/username/module.git
        branch = submodule/branch
    ```

    Change this to the following:

    ```bash  {location=".gitmodules"}
    [submodule "support/module"]
        path = support/module
        url = git@bitbucket.org:username/module.git
        branch = submodule/branch
    ```

2. Add the [project's public key to your remote Git repository](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/private-repository.md). If there are nested
   submodules in your submodule, then add the public key to those repositories as well. This allows your
   Upsun Fixed project to pull the repository from the remote Git service.

**Note**: 

Deploy keys only grant access to a single repository,
which can cause issues when attempting to pull several repositories to the same server.
If your server needs access to multiple repositories, follow these steps:

 - [Create a machine user](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users)
with access rights to each of the private repositories.
 - Attach the deploy key to your machine user.

##### Removing submodules

These steps aren't specific to Upsun Fixed, but kept as a reference for Git so that submodules are effectively removed before entering the build process.

1. In your `.gitmodules` and `.git/config` files, delete the information related to the submodule you want to remove.

   ```bash
   git submodule deinit -f path_to_submodule
   ```

2. Stage changes to `.gitmodules`:

    ```bash
    git add .gitmodules
    ```
3. Remove the submodule from the repository (without trailing slash):

    ```bash
    git rm --cached path_to_submodule
    ```

4. Remove the submodule files in `.git` from the repository  (without trailing slash):

    ```bash
    rm -rf .git/modules/path_to_submodule
    ```

5. Commit the changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Removed submodule."
    ```

6. Remove the submodule code locally, now no longer tracked:

    ```bash
    rm -rf path_to_submodule
    ```
### Connect securely with SSH

When you interact with a deployed environment, you need to guard your connection against unauthorized access.
Use Secure Shell (SSH) to provide a secure channel.

You can securely log in to your deployed app to troubleshoot and read logs.
And create a tunnel to export data through.
And interact with your project through the CLI.
All secured through SSH.

##### Connect to apps

To connect to an app securely with SSH, follow two steps.

###### 1. Authenticate with the CLI

To authenticate with the CLI:

1. Install the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
2. Run `platform login`.
3. In the open browser window, log in with your Upsun account credentials.
   (This webpage is encrypted with [HTTPS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md), making it secure.)
4. Authorize the CLI to use your account.

A certificate gets stored in your local SSH configuration.
The certificate is automatically cycled every hour for a new certificate as long as your session is active.

If you are inactive for an extended period,
your certificate expires and you are asked to login again the next time you use a command that requires authentication.

You are now ready to run CLI commands and connect to an environment.

###### 2. Connect to an app with SSH

To access an app in a given environment via the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
platform ssh --project <PROJECT_ID> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --app <APPLICATION_NAME>
```

Replace each of ``<PROJECT_ID>``, ``<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>``, and ``<APPLICATION_NAME>`` with the values you want to access.
To find these values in the Console,
navigate to the environment you want to access and click **SSH** in the top right-hand corner.

Alternatively, just run `platform ssh` and select the values from each list presented to you.

Once you've connected, you get a welcome message detailing which environment you're connected to.

Now you can interact with the environment as you want.
Note that your app's file system is read-only,
except for any [mounts you've defined]/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).

##### Connect to services

To connect to a service, you need the [service credentials](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md#connect-to-a-service).
Then you can connect either with a [direct tunnel](#use-a-direct-tunnel) or a [tunnel in your app](#use-an-app-tunnel).

###### Use a direct tunnel

To open SSH tunnels for all of your services, run the following command:

```bash
platform tunnel:open
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
SSH tunnel opened to database at: http://127.0.0.1:30000

Logs are written to: ~/.platform/tunnels.log

List tunnels with: platform tunnels
View tunnel details with: platform tunnel:info
Close tunnels with: platform tunnel:close

Save encoded tunnel details to the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable using:
  export PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS="$(platform tunnel:info --encode)"
```

Use the returned host (in this case `http://127.0.0.1:30000`) for your connection
and fill in the details with the rest of your [service credentials](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md#connect-to-a-service).

The `tunnel:open` command connects all relationships defined in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).

To open only one connection when you have multiple relationships defined, run `tunnel:single`.
By default, this opens a tunnel at `http://127.0.0.1:30000`.
You can specify the port for the connection using the `--port` flag.

###### Use an app tunnel

Many database applications (such as MySQL Workbench) support establishing their own SSH tunnel.
You need to use [SSH keys](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/ssh-keys.md) for authentication.
Consult the documentation for your application for how to enter SSH credentials.

####### Get SSH connection details

To get the host and username for connections, follow these steps:

You get output similar to the following:

```bash {}
jyu7waly36ncj-main-7rqtwti--app@ssh.us.platform.sh
```

 - Navigate to the environment you want to connect to.
 - Click **SSH** in the top right-hand corner.
 - You get output similar to the following: 
``jyu7waly36ncj-main-7rqtwti--app@ssh.us.platform.sh``

The host is everything after the `@` and the username is what's before it.
In this case, the host is `ssh.us.platform.sh` and the username is `jyu7waly36ncj-main-7rqtwti--app`.
The host is the same for the entire project, while the username varies by environment.

To connect to a service, fill in the details with the rest of your [service credentials](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md#connect-to-a-service).

##### Alternative authentication methods

There are three basic ways to authenticate with Upsun Fixed:

* [Through the CLI](#1-authenticate-with-the-cli)
  * The fastest and easiest method.
  * Supports multifactor authentication.
  * Automatically generates new certificates to keep your connection safe.
  * Necessary when using the CLI and when your organization has multifactor authentication set up.
* [Using SSH keys](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/ssh-keys.md)
  * Requires more setup on your part.
  * Represents only a single authentication method.
  * Requires you to regularly change the keys to maintain security.
  * Useful for checking out code as part of an automated process.
* [Using API tokens](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md)
  * Good for letting automation tools use the CLI.
  * Requires you to regularly change the tokens to maintain security.

##### SSH into an MFA-protected environment

For enhanced security, as an organization owner or admin user,
you can [enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) within your organization](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/security/mfa.md#enforce-mfa-within-your-organization).

As a project contributor, if you haven't enabled MFA on your user account and SSH into an environment that is protected by MFA,
you get an error message. See how you can [troubleshoot that error message](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/troubleshoot-ssh.md#mfa-related-error-message).
#### Authenticate with SSH keys

To connect to your app using SSH keys, you need two keys:

* A **private key** you must keep _secret_
* A **public key** stored in your Upsun account

A given SSH key pair can only be linked to a single user account.

A key pair is valid for as long as you have access to the private key on the system from which you are connecting.
If you have a key pair available, you aren't prompted to login.

To keep connection secure, you need to regularly update the keys you use.
A well-encrypted key is no substitute for regular key rotation.

If you used GitHub to sign up for your Upsun account
your public keys from GitHub are automatically synced to your Upsun account.
So you can use them already with the CLI or to [connect to your app](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md#2-connect-to-an-app-with-ssh).

###### Add SSH keys

If you don't have keys already added,
you might be able to [find existing keys](#1a-find-your-keys) or else you need to [generate new keys](#1b-generate-new-keys).

####### 1A. Find your keys

If you haven't used SSH keys before or it's been a while since you created the key,
skip right to [generating new keys](#1b-generate-new-keys).

If you have generated SSH keys before and want to find them on your system,
follow these instructions.

A public key file has a name ending in `.pub`.
It contains seemingly random lines of characters,
like this example of a public [RSA key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29)
(note the email address at the end, which wouldn't be present in a private key):

```text
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC2nDRLgPANWParTiaGIgySG+thTtnqFGI1tMWyqDdfvH+5hL91w2tK9PzaP+NJ5hA/cOyh30YRFb52Y64toU16Ko5K1mLqNFJajjWEI5Y4VukG6betrWfqdQ7XBr/s7nBuDOFQ5+eKbvug4rRSCSo8CsEI1eI0VNQkC9HJWYK28k7KurMdTN7X/Z/4vknM4/Rm2bnMk2idoORQgomeZS1p3GkG8dQs/c0j/b4H7azxnqdcCaR4ahbytX3d49BN0WwE84C+ItsnkCt1g5tVADPrab+Ywsm/FTnGY3cJKKdOAHt7Ls5lfpyyug2hNAFeiZF0MoCekjDZ2GH2xdFc7AX/ your_email_address@example.com
```

To find your public key file:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
   ls -a
   ```

If you find a file ending in `.pub`,
copy the location and [add it to your Upsun account](#2-add-an-ssh-key-to-your-account).

If you don't find an existing key, [generate new keys](#1b-generate-new-keys).

####### 1B. Generate new keys

If you're logged in using the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md#1-authenticate-with-the-cli),
generate a key and have it added to your Upsun account automatically.

1. In a terminal, run `platform ssh-key:add`.
1. If necessary, log in to a browser.
1. Press `Y` and `enter` to create a new SSH key.
1. Copy the location of the generated key.
1. Run the following commands (replacing `<PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY>` with the location you copied):

   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent)
   ssh-add '<PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY>'
   ```

To generate a key otherwise, GitHub has a good [walk-through for creating SSH key pairs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on various operating systems.

Then you need to [add it to your Upsun account](#2-add-an-ssh-key-to-your-account).

####### 2. Add an SSH key to your account

Once you have the location of your public key, add it to your Upsun account.

If you're logged in using the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md#1-authenticate-with-the-cli),
in a terminal run the following command (replacing `<PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY>` with the location of your public key):

```bash
platform ssh-key:add '<PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY>'
```

You can also add it in the Console,
similar to this [video](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/videos/management-console/add-ssh-mc.mp4).

Now you are ready to use the key to [connect to an environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md#2-connect-to-an-app-with-ssh).

####### 3. Connect to your server with SSH keys

To connect to a server using SSH keys, find the details in the Console:

1. Open the [Upsun Fixed Console](https://console.upsun.com/).
1. Select a project.
1. In the **Environment** dropdown, select the environment you want to access.
1. Click the **SSH** dropdown.
1. Copy the ssh command for where you want access.
   (Example: `ssh abcdefghi5k-main-7rqtwti--app@ssh.us-2.platform.sh`)
1. Enter the command into a terminal.

Note that if you have just added your SSH key,
you need to [redeploy your environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/troubleshoot-ssh.md#redeploy-your-environment) before you can access it using SSH keys.

###### Forwarding keys by default

It may be helpful to set your SSH client to always forward keys to Upsun Fixed servers, which can simplify other SSH or rsync commands.
To do so, include a block in your local `~/.ssh/config` file like so:

```text
Host *.us.platform.sh
       ForwardAgent yes
Host *.eu.platform.sh
       ForwardAgent yes
```

Include one `Host` entry for each Upsun Fixed region you want to connect to, such as `us-2` or `eu-4`.
(You can include other configuration as desired.)
#### Troubleshoot SSH

While trying to use SSH, you may get a response indicating permission is denied. Or if you get an error with a code of 255, it means there's a problem with your SSH connection.

```txt
The command failed with the exit code: 255
```

There are several places to check to try to solve such issues.

###### Check your environment

If your environment is [inactive](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#inactive-environment) or the deployment has failed,
you can't log in to it.
To make sure the environment is active and the deployment has succeeded,
check it using `platform environment:list` or in the [Console](https://console.upsun.com/).

###### Redeploy your environment

If you have just added your SSH key or made changes to [access rules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md), you need to redeploy your environment before you can access it using SSH keys. You can do this in the [Console](https://console.upsun.com/), by running `platform redeploy`, or by pushing an empty git commit:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m 'chore: force redeploy'
git push origin main
```

###### Check your public key

Make sure your public key has been uploaded to your user account. Check it in the [Upsun Fixed Console](https://console.upsun.com/).

###### SSH key can not be duplicated

A given SSH key pair can only be linked to a single user account.
If you add an already used SSH key to another account, you see the error: `SSH key can not be duplicated`.
[Generate a new pair of SSH keys](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/ssh-keys.md#add-ssh-keys) for the second user account you want to add.

###### Check your SSH agent

Check that your key is properly added to your SSH agent. This is an authentication agent that manages your private key.

1. Run `ssh-add -l` in your terminal:

   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```
   You get output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   2048 12:b0:13:83:7f:56:18:9b:78:ca:54:90:a7:ff:12:69 /Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
   ```

1. Check that the file exists and that the file name or comment matches your private key file.
1. If you don't see your private key file, add your private key:

    ```bash
    ssh-add path-to-your-key
    ```

###### Specify your identity file

If your identity (SSH key) associated with Upsun Fixed isn't in a default file name
(as may be explained in your SSH software manual, for example),
you may have to append a specification like the one below so that the SSH software finds the correct key.

```bash
Host platform.sh
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_platformsh
```

Be aware that, above, `platformsh` stands for a hostname.
Each different hostname you connect to Upsun Fixed at may have to be specified in the host line, separated by spaces.

###### Check your Git integrations

If your project is integrated with another Git provider (such as GitHub), that provider controls Git operations.
Make sure you have added your public SSH key to your provider and that your user there has access.

###### Generate SSH debug information

If your private key and public key both look OK but you don't have any luck logging in, print debugging information.
These lines often give clues about what's going wrong.

Run the SSH command with the `-v` option, like so:

```bash
ssh -v [SSH-URL]
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
OpenSSH_6.7.8, OpenSSL 1.2.3 1 Sep 2014
debug1: Connecting to ssh.eu.platform.sh [54.32.10.98] port 22.
debug1: Connection established.
debug1: identity file /Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa type 1
...(many more lines of this light reading)...
debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git clone <REPO_URL>
```

You can use this information to make one last check of the private key file.

###### MFA-related error message

If you haven't enabled MFA on your user account and try to SSH into an environment that is protected by MFA,
you get the following error message:

```bash
Error: Access denied
Service: abcdefg123456-main-bvxea6i--app
User:  ()
Parameters: {"amr":["mfa","sso:acme"]}
Detail: Additional authentication is required:
	 - Multifactor authentication (MFA)
	 - Single sign-on (SSO), provider: "acme"
```

To solve this, [enable MFA on your user account](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/security/mfa.md#enable-mfa-on-your-user-account).

Alternatively, open the Console and select the desired organization.
Follow the instructions so you can effectively access its contents.

Similarly for bot users and CLI tokens, you may see the message:

```bash
  [RequestException]
  Multifactor authentication (MFA) is required.
  The API token may need to be re-created after enabling MFA.
```

In this case, as described, it will be necessary to:

1. Enable MFA on the (bot) user account associated with the token.
2. Generate a new access token, and then replace its value in your workflow that requires the token (such as updating a GitHub workflow secret variable).

###### Something still wrong?

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

If you're still stuck, open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) and provide the full SSH debug information.
### Transfer data to and from a {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} cluster

Transferring data to and from [a Dedicated Gen 2 cluster](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#dedicated-gen-2) slightly differs from the process on the Grid.

##### Back up your files

Upsun Fixed automatically creates backups of the Staging and Production environments of a Dedicated Gen 2  cluster every six hours.
These are only useful to fully restore an environment and are managed by the support team.

You can make a manual local backup yourself by downloading data from your environment to your local system by running the following command:

```bash
platform scp -r remote:<DIRECTORY_TO_SYNCHRONIZE> <LOCAL_DIRECTORY>
```

This command copies all files from the `<DIRECTORY_TO_SYNCHRONIZE>` in the environment you want to back up
to your `<LOCAL_DIRECTORY>`.
Before running the command, make sure that you don't overwrite local data (or do a backup first).

##### Back up your database

To back up your database, adapt and run the following command on your local computer:

```bash
platform db:dump --gzip
```

For more backup options and examples, see how to [export data from an SQL database](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#exporting-data).

##### Synchronize files from Development to Staging/Production

To transfer data into either the Staging or Production environment,
download data from your Development environment to your local system and from there to your Production/Staging environment.

**Note**: 

Be aware that synchronizing files is a destructive operation that overwrites data.
[Back up your Staging/Production files first](#back-up-your-files).

1. To download data from your Development environment to your local system, adapt the following command:

   ```bash
   platform scp --environment <DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT> -r remote:<DIRECTORY_TO_SYNCHRONIZE> <LOCAL_DIRECTORY>
   ```

2. To copy the local directory to the remote Staging/Production mount, adapt the following command:

   ```bash
   platform scp --environment <TARGET_ENVIRONMENT> -r <LOCAL_DIRECTORY> remote:<DIRECTORY_TO_SYNCHRONIZE>
   ```

##### Synchronize a database from Development to Staging/Production

To synchronize a database into either the Staging or Production environment,
export the database from your Development environment to your local system and from there to your Staging/Production environment.

**Note**: 

Be aware that this is a destructive operation that overwrites data.
[Back up your Staging/Production database first](#back-up-your-database).

To synchronize your database:

1. Export the Development database to your local computer:

   ```bash
   platform db:dump --environment <DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT> --file=dump.sql
   ```

   For more backup options and examples, see how to [export data from an SQL database](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#exporting-data).

2. Import the Development database dump file into the remote Staging/Production database:

   ```bash
   platform sql --environment <TARGET_ENVIRONMENT> < dump.sql
   ```

For more granular connection options, see [SSH connection details](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md#get-ssh-connection-details).
### Regions

Upsun Fixed offers several regions for hosting project data.
You can choose a region based on criteria such as its closeness to your users and its environmental impact.

##### Environmental impact

Whenever you create a project with us, we provide information about the electricity grid provider for that region. You can view the average carbon intensity of the energy grid in grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour.
These data are sourced from an annual average, which we update as new information becomes available. If you want to see real-time emissions generated by each power grid, we recommend checking out [Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymap.org/map). You can also access a public GitHub page of Electricity Maps [data sources](https://github.com/electricitymap/electricitymap-contrib/blob/master/DATA_SOURCES.md).

Summary of data being used in Upsun Fixed’s Region Picker when creating a new Project:
| Source | Last update of this page | Previous versions of this page |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Electricity Maps 2022 annual averages (previous to May 2023, we had used annual averages from the IEA). <BR> See our [blog post](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/platformsh-is-now-using-annual-carbon-intensities-from-electricity-maps/) for more information.| 11 May 2023 | Available [here](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs/commits/main/docs/src/development/regions.md) |

Information on carbon intensity is also available in the Upsun Fixed API.
For example, to get a list of the regions and their carbon intensities, run the following command:

```bash
platform api:curl regions | jq -r '.regions[] | select(.available) | "\(.label): \(.environmental_impact.carbon_intensity)"'
```

See all available information in the [API documentation](https://docs.upsun.com/api/#tag/Regions).

###### Carbon Emissions dashboard

The Carbon Emissions dashboard provides an overview of the carbon footprint associated with your cloud resource usage. This dashboard calculates emissions using a Carbon Price List (CPL) methodology, inspired by the Cloud Carbon Footprint model.

Users can view total emissions over time and project specific emissions for the current year, broken down by kilograms of CO2 equivalent (kg CO2e). The dashboard also includes information about how emissions are calculated and what factors (server location, usage etc.) can influence those totals.

####### Access the dashboard

This dashboard is accessible via the Emissions tab within the Billing section in Console.

####### How is this calculated?

We collect detailed billing data from our cloud service providers (including associated costs and quantities) and this information is represented as line items. 

Our carbon management partner, Greenly, calculates the energy use and embodied emissions for each line item. This is done through data gathering and modeling that estimates energy consumption, power usage effectiveness (PUE), and carbon intensity for the cloud providers. Using cost allocation models, your project’s share of emissions is then estimated.

We have been working closely with Greenly to build upon the model, tailoring it to better reflect our specific data and technical requirements to ensure your emissions data is credible, compliant and supports your progress toward real, measurable sustainability targets.

**Note**: 

[OVH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md#france-fr-3-fr-3) region data is not available in this dashboard.

####### What affects emissions?

- **Where you run:** Data center regions vary greatly in grid-carbon intensity. Selecting a cleaner region is the most impactful way to reduce footprint.

- **What you provision:** Emissions rise in proportion to the resources you allocate.

**Note**: 

Optimizing code or app performance reduces emissions only if it leads to lower resource allocation.

##### Region availability

The regions listed here may be different from those available to you when you create a new project.
Each organization can have its own rules for what regions to allow.
When adding a new project, you only see regions allowed by your organization.

##### Region location

| Name | Provider | Geographic Zone | Timezone |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------ |------------------|-----------------------| 
| au-2.platform.sh |  Azure | Australia | Australia/Sydney |
| au.platform.sh |  AWS | Australia | Australia/Sydney |
| bnpp-1.platform.sh |  none |  | UTC |
| ca-1.platform.sh |  AWS | North America | America/Toronto |
| ch-1.platform.sh |  Google | Europe | Europe/Zurich |
| de-2.platform.sh |  Google | Europe | Europe/Berlin |
| eu-5.platform.sh |  AWS | Europe | Europe/Stockholm |
| eu.platform.sh |  AWS | Europe | Europe/Dublin |
| fr-3.platform.sh |  OVH | Europe | Europe/Paris |
| fr-4.platform.sh |  Azure | Europe | Europe/Paris |
| uk-1.platform.sh |  Google | Europe | Europe/London |
| us-2.platform.sh |  AWS | North America | America/New_York |
| us-3.platform.sh |  Azure | North America | America/Los_Angeles |
| us-4.platform.sh |  Google | North America | America/New_York |
| us.platform.sh |  AWS | North America | America/New_York |

**Note**: 

As an alternative, you can also use the following command with the Upsun Fixed CLI to find out where a given region is hosted:

```bash {}
platform api:curl regions | jq '.regions[] | select(.available)  | .id + ": " + .provider.name + " - " + .zone + " - " + .timezone' | sort
```

The returned list contains, for each available region, its name, provider, geographic zone and its timezone - as shown above.

##### Public IP addresses

The public IP addresses for regions are stable, but not guaranteed to never change.
Before any change, you are notified well in advance regarding affected projects.

They're useful for cases such as when you have a corporate firewall that blocks outgoing SSH connections.
In such cases, add the inbound IP addresses for your region to your allow list.

**Historic changes**: 

On March 17, 2025, the outbound IP addresses for regions running on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure services were changed. This change was made to separate the inbound and outbound IP addresses for these regions.

If you have external services relying on outbound IP whitelisting from your Upsun Fixed project, you should update your external whitelists to reflect this change.
Please see the relevant region information above for the new regional outbound IP addresses.

### Troubleshoot development

##### Common tasks

###### Force a redeploy

There are times where you might want to trigger a redeployment of your application,
such as to add custom TLS certificates.
A redeploy reuses your built app and services.

To trigger a redeploy, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```sh {}
platform redeploy
```

The redeploy takes place after any scheduled activities (either *Running* or *Pending*).

**Note**: 

Despite the name, redeployment doesn’t rerun the ``deploy`` hook, only the ``post_deploy`` hook.
Both your ``build`` and ``deploy`` hooks are tied to individual commits in code.
They’re reused until another commit is pushed to the environment.
See [more about hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md) and their reuse.

To rerun the ``build`` and ``deploy`` hooks, [manually trigger a build](#manually-trigger-builds).

**Is there a way to redeploy the production environment without knowing its name?**: 

It’s often desirable that the production environment, like many other values, is not hardcoded into your external workflows and management scripts.
You can use the CLI, along with the [environment type distinction](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#environment-type) to identify a production environment (assuming there is only one) and redeploy it in a single line.

To do so, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform redeploy -e $(platform environment:list --type production --pipe)
```

###### Manually trigger builds

To increase performance and keep applications the same across environments,
Upsun Fixed reuses built applications if its code and build time configuration (variables and such) remain the same.

There may be times where you want to force your application to be built again without changing its code,
for example to test an issue in a build hook or when external dependencies change.
To force a rebuild without changing the code,
use an [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables).

Assuming you want to do this for your `main` environment,
first create a `REBUILD_DATE` environment variable:

```bash
platform variable:create --environment main --level environment --prefix env --name REBUILD_DATE --value "$(date)" --visible-build true
```

This triggers a build right away to propagate the variable.
To force a rebuild at any time, update the variable with a new value:

```bash
platform variable:update --environment main --value "$(date)" "env:REBUILD_DATE"
```

This forces your application to be built even if no code has changed.

###### Clear the build cache

You may find that you need to clear the build cache,
such as when it's grown too big or, in rare circumstances, when it's corrupted.
It may get corrupted when code is downloaded from a third-party language service like Packagist or npm
while that service is experiencing issues.

To clear the build cache, run the following command:

```sh
platform project:clear-build-cache
```

The next build for each environment is likely to take longer as the cache rebuilds.

##### Access denied or permission denied

In most cases, issues accessing a project are caused by missing permissions for a given user.
For more information see how to [manage user permissions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md).

If you are using the CLI, make sure that [you are authenticated](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md#2-authenticate).

If you are using SSH, see how to [troubleshoot SSH access](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/troubleshoot-ssh.md).

##### HTTP responses 502 Bad Gateway or 503 Service Unavailable

If you see these errors when accessing your application,
it indicates your application is crashing or unavailable.

Typical causes and potential solutions include:

- Your app is listening at the wrong place.
  - Check your app's [upstream properties](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#upstream).
  - If your app listening at a port, make sure it's using the [`PORT` environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).
- Your `.platform.app.yaml` configuration has an error and a process isn't starting
  or requests can't be forwarded to it correctly.
  - Check your `web.commands.start` entry or your `passthru` configuration.
- The amount of traffic coming to your site exceeds the processing power of your application.
  - You may want to [check if bots are overwhelming your site](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439634723858).
  - Alternatively, you may need to [increase your plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
- Certain code paths in your application are too slow and timing out.
  - Check your code is running smoothly.
  - Consider adding an [observability solution](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability.md) to get a better view of your application.
- A PHP process is crashing because of a segmentation fault.
  - See [how to deal with crashed processes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/troubleshoot.md#troubleshoot-a-crashed-php-process).
- A PHP process is killed by the kernel out-of-memory killer.
  - See [how to deal with killed processes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/troubleshoot.md#troubleshoot-a-killed-php-process).

##### Site outage

If you can't access some part of your project, whether it's the live site, development environment, or Console,
check the [Upsun Fixed status page](https://status.platform.sh/).
There you can see planned maintenance and subscribe to updates for any potential outages.

If the status is operational, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### Command not found

When you've added a command line tool (such as [Drush](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#drush)),
you might encounter an error like the following:

```bash
-bash: drush: command not found
```

If you see this, add the command you want to run to your path
with a [`.environment` file script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script).

As a Linux or Unix-like operating system user (MacOS included),
to be able to run your scripts directly and quickly get past this error
you may need to run the `chmod +x <YOUR_SCRIPT_FILE_NAME>` command.

However, regardless of which operating system you're using,
it's best if you **don't rely on scripts having execute permissions**.
Instead, call the app/shell/runtime directly passing your script file to that executable.

##### Missing commits

If you push code to Upsun Fixed without the full Git history, sometimes commits are missing.
This can happen if you're pushing code from an external CI/CD pipeline, such as a GitHub action.
Such pipelines often do only shallow clones by default.

In such cases, your build might fail with an internal error.
Or you might see an error like `unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet`.

To avoid the error, make sure you do a full clone of the repository before pushing code.
For example, for the [Checkout GitHub action](https://github.com/actions/checkout),
set `fetch-depth: 0` to clone the full history.
For GitLab, set clones to have a limit of `0` either in [repository settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.md#limit-the-number-of-changes-fetched-during-clone)
or using the [`GIT_DEPTH` variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/monorepos/index.md#shallow-cloning).

##### Large JSON file upload failing

When trying to upload a large JSON file to your API, you might see a 400 response code (`Malformed request`).

Upsun Fixed enforces a 10 MB limit on files with the `application/json` `Content-Type` header.
To send large files, use the `multipart/form-data` header instead:

```bash
curl -XPOST 'https://example.com/graphql' --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' --form file=large_file.json
```

##### Databases

For MySQL specific errors, see how to [troubleshoot MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql/troubleshoot.md).

###### Permission error creating a database

If you try to use a user to create a database, you get an error saying `permission denied to create database`.
The database is created for you
and can be found in the `path` key of the `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` [environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#use-provided-variables).

##### Storage

If you're having trouble with storage, see how to [troubleshoot mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/troubleshoot-mounts.md) and [disks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/troubleshoot-disks.md).

###### Can't write to file system

If you attempt to write to disk outside a `build` hook, you may encounter a `read-only file system` error.
Except where you define it, the file system is all read-only, with code changes necessary through git.
This gives you benefits like repeatable deployments, consistent backups, and traceability.

To generate anything you need later, [write to disk during a `build` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#writable-directories-during-build).
Or [declare mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts),
which are writable even during and after deploy.
They can be used for your data: file uploads, logs, and temporary files.

###### Upsun Fixed push fails due to lack of disk space

You might see the following message when attempting to run `platform push`:
`There isn't enough free space to complete the push`

This usually indicates that large files are present in the repository (where they shouldn't be).
Make sure that the paths for files like media files, dependencies, and databases are set to be ignored in your `.gitignore` file.

If large files are already in the repository, the open-source tool [bfg-repo-cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)
can help in cleaning up the repository by purging older commits, removing unnecessary files, and more.

If none of these suggestions work, open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### Stuck build or deployment

If you see a build or deployment running longer than expected, it may be one of the following cases:

- The build is blocked by a process in your `build` hook.
- The deployment is blocked by a long-running process in your `deploy` hook.
- The deployment is blocked by a long-running cron job in the environment.
- The deployment is blocked by a long-running cron job in the parent environment.

To determine if your environment is being stuck in the build or the deployment, check your [activity log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#activity-logs).

If the activity has the result `success`, the build has completed successfully and the system is trying to deploy.
If the result is still `running`, the build is stuck.

In most regions, stuck builds terminate after one hour.

When a deployment is blocked, you should try the following:

1. Connect to your environment using [SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md).
2. Find any long-running cron jobs or deploy hooks on the environment by running `ps afx`.
3. Kill any long-running processes with `kill <PID>`.
  Replace `<PID>` with the process ID shown by `ps afx`.

If a `sync` of `activate` process is stuck, try the above on the parent environment.

Note that, for PHP apps,
you can [restart processes that get stuck during a build or deployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/troubleshoot.md#restart-php-processes-stuck-during-a-build-or-deployment)
from your app container.

##### Slow or failing build or deployment

Builds can take long time or fail.
Most of the time, it's related to an application issue.
Here are a few tips that can help you find the exact cause.

###### Check for errors in the logs

Invisible errors during the build and deploy phase can cause increased wait times, failed builds, and other problems.
Investigate [each log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#container-logs) and fix any errors you find.

###### Build and deploy hooks

[`build` and `deploy` hooks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md) can cause long build times.
If they run into issues, they can cause the build to fail or hang indefinitely.

`build` hooks can be tested in your local environment.
`deploy` hooks can be tested either locally
or by logging into the application over [SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md) and running them there.
Be careful not to test the scripts on production environments.

You can also test your hooks with these Linux commands to help debug issues:

```text
time <YOUR_HOOK_COMMAND> # Print execution time
strace -T <YOUR_HOOK_COMMAND> # Print a system call report
```

###### Cron jobs

Containers can't be shutdown while long-running [cron jobs and scheduled tasks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons) are active.
That means long-running cron jobs block a container from being shut down to make way for a new deploy.

Make sure your custom cron jobs run quickly and properly.
Cron jobs may invoke other services in unexpected ways, which can increase execution time.

##### Cache configuration

A common source of performance issues is a misconfigured cache.
The most common issue isn't allowing the right cookies as part of the router cache.

Some cookies, such as session cookies, need to be allowed.
Others, such as marketing and analytics cookies, usually shouldn't be part of the cache key.

See more about [router cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md)
and [cookie entry](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md#cookies).

Because the router cache follows cache headers from your app,
your app needs to send the correct `cache-control` header.

For static assets, set cache headers using the `expires` key in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

##### Language-specific troubleshooting

For language-specific troubleshooting for your apps:

- [PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/troubleshoot.md)
- [Node JS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/nodejs/debug.md)
### Deploy on Upsun Fixed

Upsun Fixed offers a number of project templates as part of the Project Creation Wizard to help bootstrap a new project.
However, you can also create arbitrary links to spawn projects on Upsun Fixed from an arbitrary Git repository or prepared template.

There are two ways to create such a link, shown below.
In each case, when a user clicks on the link they are redirected to create a new Upsun Fixed project,
with the template selection step skipped in favor of the template specified.
If the user doesn't have an Upsun account yet, they're prompted to create one.

You may include the link on your own project's website, your company's internal Wiki,
or anywhere else a link can go to make launching your code base as straightforward as possible.

##### Preparation

To have a deployable template, you need to first prepare the repository.
The Deploy on Upsun Fixed button works with any Git repository that's deployable on Upsun Fixed.
It needs [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)
and [`.platform/routes.yaml` file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).
If you are using any [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md),
you also need a [`.platform/services.yaml` file](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md),

The repository must be available at a publicly accessible Git URL.
That may be hosted with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, your own custom Git hosting,
or any other publicly accessible Git URL.

###### (Optional) Make a template definition file

You can create a Deploy on Upsun Fixed button for any compatible repository;
however, you can also provide a YAML template definition file.
A template definition file is a YAML file that references a Git repository but can also include additional information,
such as limiting the resulting project to a certain minimum project size or only allowing it to be deployed in certain regions.
Use this mechanism when you want more control over how the template gets deployed.

The template definition file may be at any publicly accessible URL.
It can be in the template repository itself or separate.
Note that if it's in the template repository then it's included in every deployed user project from that template.
(It doesn't hurt anything as it has no effect at runtime,
but users have a copy of the file in their code base and may be confused by it.)

A list of all [Upsun Fixed-supported templates](https://github.com/platformsh/template-builder/tree/master/templates) is available on GitHub.
[3rd party templates](https://github.com/platformsh/templates-external/) are also available.
You can also create your own template file and host it anywhere you wish.

The template definition file's format is [documented](https://github.com/platformsh/templates-external/blob/master/template-definition.yaml)
in the 3rd party template repository.

##### Making a button (with a widget)

The easiest way to make a Deploy on Upsun Fixed button is to use the [button builder widget](https://docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md).
You provide it with either the Git URL of the repository or a URL to a corresponding template definition file.

The button builder widget gives you an HTML fragment to copy and paste to wherever you want the button hosted.
It also includes a tracking code to know whose Deploy on Upsun Fixed button was clicked, but doesn't add any cookies to the site.

##### Making a button manually

###### Arbitrary Git repository

Create a link in the following form:

```text
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project?template=GIT_URL
```

Where `GIT_URL` is the URL of a publicly visible Git repository.
For example, to install Upsun Fixed's [Drupal 10 template on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10) you would use:

```text
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/?template=https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10.git
```

(Note that's the URL of the Git repository as if you were cloning it, NOT the URL of the repository's home page on GitHub.)

A new project is created and then initialized with whatever code is at the tip of the default branch of that repository.
This method works for any publicly visible Git repository,
provided that it includes the necessary Upsun Fixed YAML configuration files.
If those are missing the project still initializes but fails to build.

###### Defined Template

Create a link in the following form:

```text
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project?template=TEMPLATE_URL
```

Where `TEMPLATE_URL` is the URL of a publicly visible template definition file.
For example, to install Upsun Fixed's [Drupal 10 template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/drupal10) you would use:

```text
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/?template=https://github.com/platformsh/template-builder/blob/master/templates/drupal10/.platform.template.yaml
```

A new project is created, initialized with whatever code is at the tip of the default branch of the repository referenced by that file,
provided that it includes the necessary Upsun Fixed YAML configuration files.
If those are missing the project still initializes but fail to build.

##### Listing a repository

Upsun Fixed welcomes project templates produced by the application vendor.
If you have a Free Software application you want available in the Upsun Fixed setup wizard,
create a template definition file and submit a pull request against the [3rd party templates repository](https://github.com/platformsh/templates-external/).
The Developer Relations team reviews and evaluate the application and template, and may offer feedback before merging.
Generally speaking, any Free Software application that's actively maintained and runs well on Upsun Fixed is welcome.
Projects released under a non-Free license aren't accepted.
### Sanitize databases

When working on a new feature on your website, you want to use a new branch.
Using a new branch makes sure that you don't risk breaking your live, production website.

Creating a branch on Upsun Fixed copies both the code and the database to that new development branch.
These code and database changes need to be tested before being merged into production.
Depending on your processes, internal or external teams may interact with the preview environment branch.

Databases of live websites often contain personally identifiable information (PII)
such as full names, mailing addresses, and phone numbers.
To ensure people reviewing code changes can't access information they shouldn't,
sanitize your databases of any PII that they may contain.

##### Examples
#### Sanitizing databases: MariaDB and Drupal


Databases of live websites often contain personally identifiable information (PII)
such as full names, mailing addresses, and phone numbers.
To ensure people reviewing code changes can't access information they shouldn't,
sanitize your databases of any PII that they may contain.

This example goes through the process for a MySQL database using Drupal.

###### Before you begin

You need:

- A project with a [MySQL database](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../add-services/mysql.md).
- A command interface installed:
  - If doing it manually, the [Upsun CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/cli.md).
  - Otherwise, make sure [Drush](https://www.drush.org/latest/install/) is installed in your environment.

This guide is about sanitizing MySQL databases.

This guide doesn't address:

- Sanitizing NoSQL Databases (such as [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../add-services/mongodb.md))
- Input validation and input sanitization, which both help prevent security vulnerabilities

###### Sanitize the database

Make sure that you only sanitize preview environments and **never** the production environment.
Otherwise you may lose most or even all of the relevant data stored in your database.

First, take a [database dump](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../add-services/mysql.md#exporting-data) of your preview environment.
This is just a safety precaution.
Production data isn't altered.
To get a database dump, run the following command:
``platform
 db:dump -e <DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
``.

You see output like the following:

```sql {}
+----+------------+---------------+---------------------------+---------------+
| ID | first_name | last_name     | user_email                | display_name  |
+----+------------+---------------+---------------------------+---------------+
|  1 | admin      | admin         | admin@yourcompany.com     | admin         |
|  2 | john       | doe           | john.doe@gmail.com        | john          |
|  3 | jane       | doe           | janedoe@ymail.com         | jane          |
+----+------------+---------------+---------------------------+---------------+
```

 - Change the fields where PII is contained with the [UPDATE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/update/).
For example, to change the display name of users with an email address not in your company’s domain
to a random value, run the following query:

```sql {}
UPDATE users
SET display_name==substring(md5(display_name||'$PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY') for 8);
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@yourcompany%'
```

Adapt and run that query for all fields that you need to sanitize.
If you modify fields that you shouldn’t alter,
[you can restore them](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/restore.md) from the dump you took in step 1.
You can create a script to automate the sanitization process to be run automatically on each new deployment.
Once you have a working script, add your script to sanitize the database to [a ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook):

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
    deploy: |

        # ...

        cd /app/public
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
            # Do whatever you want on the production site.
        else
            # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
            sanitize_the_database.sh
        fi
```

To sanitize your database and get rid of sensitive, live information, use the ``drush sql:sanitize`` command.
Add your script to sanitize the database to [a ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook)
for preview environments:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  deploy: |

    # ...

    cd /app/public
    if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
      # Do whatever you want on the production site.
    else
      drush -y sql:sanitize
    fi
    drush -y updatedb
```

More options are available.
These are described in the [Drush documentation](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/sql_sanitize/).
To sanitize only on the initial deploy and not all future deploys,
use [Drush state](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/state_set/) as in the following example:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  deploy: |

    # ...

    cd /app/public
    if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ] || [ "$(drush state:get --format=string mymodule.sanitized)" != yes ]; then
      # Do whatever you want on the production site.
    else
      drush -y sql:sanitize
      drush state:set --input-format=string mymodule.sanitized yes
    fi
```

###### What's next

You learned how to remove sensitive data from a database.

To replace sensitive data that with other meaningful data, you can add a `faker` to the process.
A `faker` is a program that generates fake data that looks real.
Having meaningful PII-free data allows you to keep your current Q&A, external reviews, and other processes.
To add a faker, adapt your sanitizing queries to replace each value that contains PII with a new value generated by the faker.

You might also want to make sure that you [implement input validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.md#goals-of-input-validation).

If your database contains a lot of data, consider using the [`OPTIMIZE TABLE` statement](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/optimize-table/)
to reduce its size and help improve performance.
#### Sanitizing databases: PostgreSQL and Django


Databases of live websites often contain personally identifiable information (PII)
such as full names, mailing addresses, and phone numbers.
To ensure people reviewing code changes can't access information they shouldn't,
sanitize your databases of any PII that they may contain.

This example goes through the process for a PostgreSQL database using Django.

###### Before you begin

You need:

- A project with a [PostgreSQL database](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../add-services/postgresql.md).
- A command interface installed:
  - If doing it manually, the [Upsun CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/cli.md).
  - Otherwise, make sure ``pqsl`` is installed in your environment.

This guide is about sanitizing PostgreSQL databases.

Production data isn't altered.
To get a database dump, run the following command:
``platform
 db:dump -e <DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
``.

You see output like the following:

```sql {}
id   |                user_email               |     display_name
-----+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------
3501 | daniel02@yourcompany.com                | Jason Brown
3502 | ismith@kim.com                          | Sandra Griffin
3503 | olee@coleman-rodriguez.com              | Miss Christine Morgan
```

 - Change the fields where PII is contained with the [UPDATE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/update/).
For example, to change the display name of users with an email address not in your company’s domain
to a random value, run the following query:

```sql {}
UPDATE users
SET display_name==substring(md5(display_name||'$PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY') for 8);
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@yourcompany%'
```

Adapt and run that query for all fields that you need to sanitize.
If you modify fields that you shouldn’t alter,
[you can restore them](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/restore.md) from the dump you took in step 1.
You can create a script to automate the sanitization process to be run automatically on each new deployment.
Once you have a working script, add your script to sanitize the database to [a ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook):

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
    deploy: |

        # ...

        cd /app/public
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
            # Do whatever you want on the production site.
        else
            # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
            sanitize_the_database.sh
        fi
```

Assumptions:

 - ``users`` is the table where all of your PII is stored in the ``staging`` development database.
 - ``database`` is the relationship name for the PostgreSQL service.

Set up a script by following these steps:

 - Retrieve service credentials from the ``PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS`` environment variable to use the ``psql`` command interface.
Export these values to a [.environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#set-variables-via-script)
or include them directly in the sanitization script.

    .environment

```bash {}
# Pull credentials from the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS environment variable.
export DB_USER="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].username')"
export DB_HOST="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].host')"
export DB_PORT="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].port')"
export DB_PASS="$(echo "$PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS" | base64 --decode | jq -r '.database[0].password')"
```

 - Create an executable sanitizing script by running the following command:

```bash {}
touch sanitize.sh && chmod +x sanitize.sh
```

 - Make the script sanitize environments with an [environment type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#environment-type-roles)
other than ``production``.
The following example runs only in preview environments
and sanitizes the ``display_name`` and ``email`` columns of the ``users`` table.
Adjust the details to fit your data.

    sanitize.sh

```bash {}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ]; then
    # Sanitize data
    PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASS psql -c "UPDATE users SET display_name=substring(md5(display_name||'$PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY') for 8);" -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT
    PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASS psql -c "UPDATE users SET email=substring(md5(email||'$PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY') for 8);" -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT
fi
```

To sanitize only on the initial deploy and not all future deploys,
on sanitization create a file on a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).
Then add a check for the file as in the following example:

    sanitize.sh

```bash {}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ] && [ ! -f <MOUNT_PATH>/is_sanitized ]; then
    # Sanitize data
    touch <MOUNT_PATH>/is_sanitized
fi
```

 - Update the deploy hook to run your script on each deploy.

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  build: ...
  deploy: |
    python manage.py migrate
    bash sanitize.sh    
```

 - Commit your changes by running the following command:

```bash {}
git add .environment sanitize.sh .platform.app.yaml&& git commit -m "Add sanitization."
```

Push the changes to ``staging`` and verify that environment’s database was sanitized.
Once merged to production, all data from future preview environments are sanitized on environment creation.

            # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
            sanitize_the_database.sh
        fi
```

Assumptions:

 - An Entity User exist and contains all of your PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
 - [fakerphp/faker](https://fakerphp.github.io/) has been installed as a dependency on your Symfony application

Set up a script by following these steps:

 - Create a Symfony command to sanitize data

    src/Command/SanitizeDataCommand.php

```php {}
<?php
namespace App\Command;

use App\Entity\User;
use App\Repository\UserRepository;
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;
use Faker;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Style\SymfonyStyle;

class SanitizeDataCommand extends Command
{
    protected static $defaultName = 'app:sanitize-data';

    protected static $defaultDescription = 'Sanitize user data (username and email).';

    public function __construct(
      private UserRepository $userRepository,
      private EntityManagerInterface $entityManager
    )
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    protected function configure()
    {
        $this->setDescription('This command allows you to sanitize user data (username and email).');
    }

    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)
    {
        $io = new SymfonyStyle($input, $output);

        $users = $this->userRepository->findAll();
        $io->progressStart(count($users));

        /** @var User $user */
        foreach ($users as $user) {
            $io->progressAdvance();

            // initialize faker
            $faker = Faker\Factory::create();

            // sanitize user info
            $user->setUsername(uniqid($faker->userName()));
            $user->setEmail($faker->email());
            // adapt to your needs

            $this->entityManager->flush();
        }
        $io->progressFinish();

        return static::SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

 - Update the deploy hook to run your Symfony Command on each deploy.

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  build: ...
  deploy: |
  if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ]; then
    # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
    php bin/console app:sanitize-data
  fi  
```

To sanitize only on the initial deploy and not all future deploys, on sanitization create a file on a mount. Then add a check for the file as in the following example:

    .platform.app.yaml

```yaml {}
hooks:
  build: ...
  deploy: |
    if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" != production ] && [ ! -f MOUNT_PATH/is_sanitized ]; then
      # The sanitization of the database should happen here (since it's non-production)
      php bin/console app:sanitize-data
      touch MOUNT_PATH/is_sanitized
    fi    
```

 - Commit your changes by running the following command:

```bash {}
git add src/Command/SanitizeDataCommand.php .platform.app.yaml && git commit -m "Add sanitization."
```

Push the changes to ``staging`` and verify that environment’s database was sanitized.
Once merged to production, all data from future preview environments are sanitized on environment creation.

This example show you how to sanitize data on multiple projects inside an organization, except for production environments.
Assumptions:

 - Symfony Command from previous tab ``Using a Symfony Command`` has already been pushed to all of your environments.

Set up a script by following these steps:

 - Create an executable sanitizing script by running the following command:

```bash {}
touch sanitize_fleet.sh && chmod +x sanitize_fleet.sh
```

 - Make the script sanitize environments with an [environment type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#environment-type-roles)
other than ``production``.
The following example runs only in preview environments
and sanitizes data using the Symfony Command from previous tab, already pushed to all of your environments.

```

 - use this shell script
Depending on the machine you want to run this script on, adapt this to your needs.

```bash {}
. sanitize_fleet.sh  # or source sanitize_fleet.sh
ORGANIZATION=<organizationIdentifier>
sanitize_organization_data $ORGANIZATION
```

**Note**: 

You can find the organization identifier for a specific project, within the Upsun Fixed console, by clicking on your name, and then on “Settings”, in the top right corner.

 - [Option] Commit your changes by running the following command:

```bash {}
git add sanitize_fleet.sh && git commit -m "Add sanitization."
```

Push the changes to ``staging`` and verify that environment’s database was sanitized.
Once merged to production, all data from future preview environments are sanitized on environment creation.

###### What's next

You learned how to remove sensitive data from a database.

To replace sensitive data that with other meaningful data, you can add a `faker` to the process.
A `faker` is a program that generates fake data that looks real.
Having meaningful PII-free data allows you to keep your current Q&A, external reviews, and other processes.
To add a faker, adapt your sanitizing queries to replace each value that contains PII with a new value generated by the faker.

You might also want to make sure that you [implement input validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.md#goals-of-input-validation).

If your database contains a lot of data, consider using the [`REINDEX` statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.md) to help improve performance.

### External Integrations


Upsun Fixed can be integrated with external services.

Upsun Fixed supports native integrations with multiple services, first and foremost Git hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
You can continue to use those tools for your development workflow, and have Upsun Fixed environments created automatically for your pull requests and branches.

You can also add native integrations with performance monitoring tools.
Upsun Fixed recommends [Blackfire](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability//blackfire.md),
which is part of the standard Upsun Fixed Observability Suite.
Note that only a project administrator (someone with `admin` level access to the project) can add or remove integrations.

See [User administration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md) for more details.

##### List active integrations

With the CLI, you can list all your active integrations using the following command:

```bash
platform integrations
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
+---------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ID            | Type        | Summary                                                                             |
+---------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| abcdefghijklm | github      | Repository: platformsh/platformsh-docs                                              |
|               |             | Hook URL:                                                                           |
|               |             | https://eu-3.platform.sh/api/projects/123abcdefgh3i/integrations/abcdefghijklm/hook |
+---------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

##### Validate integrations

Once your integration has been configured, you can check that it's working as expected.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Run the `platform integration:validate` command.
2. When prompted, select the integration you want to validate:
   ```bash
   Enter a number to choose an integration:
     [0] 5aut2djgt6kdd (health.slack)
     [1] a6535j9qp4sl8 (github)
    > 1
   ```

   You get output similar to:

   ```bash
   Validating the integration a6535j9qp4sl8 (type: github)...
   The integration is valid.
   ```

##### Debug integrations

When integrations run, they trigger "activities."  Activities are actions that happen on Upsun Fixed, and they get logged.

Usually these are triggered nearly instantaneously on the webhook endpoint.
These activities may be delayed due to the external services having latency.

Those logs are available via the CLI.
In most cases they aren't necessary but may be useful for debugging an integration if it is misbehaving for some reason.

There are a handful of CLI commands available, all under the `integrations` section.

###### List all activities

To list all the updates triggered by [activities](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/reference.md) on a given project and integration,
follow these steps:

1. Run the `platform integration:activities` command.
2. When prompted, select an integration.

   ```bash
   Enter a number to choose an integration:
     [0] dxr45hfldrkoe (webhook)
     [1] n2ukd4p7qofg4 (health.email)
     [2] c4opi5tjv3yfd (github)
   > 2
   ```

   You get output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Activities on the project Upsun Fixed | Docs (6b2eocegfkwwg), integration c4opi5tjv3yfd (github):
   +---------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------+---------+

   +---------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+----------+---------+
   ```

You may also specify an integration to display in the command line directly: `platform integration:activities c4opi5tjv3yfd`.

The ID is an internal identifier for the activity event.
The Description field is an arbitrary string of text produced by the integration code.
The State and Result fields indicate if the activity completed successfully, failed for some reason, or is currently in progress.

See the `--help` output of the command for more options.

###### Show detailed information on an activity

To show detailed information on a specific activity,
run the following command:

```bash
platform integration:activity:log <INTEGRATION_ID> <ACTIVITY_ID> -t
```

The `-t` option specifies that timestamps must be included in the display of the results.

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
Integration ID: ceopz5tgj3yfc
Activity ID: 6456zmdtoykxa
Type: integration.github.fetch
Description: Fetching from https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs
Created: 2020-04-15T08:44:07-05:00
State: complete
Log:
[2020-04-15T13:44:17-05:00] Waiting for other activities to complete
[2020-04-15T13:46:07-05:00] Fetching from GitHub repository platformsh/platformsh-docs
[2020-04-15T13:46:09-05:00]   No changes since last fetch
[2020-04-15T13:46:09-05:00]
[2020-04-15T13:46:09-05:00] Synchronizing branches
[2020-04-15T13:46:09-05:00]
[2020-04-15T13:46:09-05:00] Synchronizing pull requests
[2020-04-15T13:46:59-05:00]
[2020-04-15T13:46:59-05:00] W: No changes found, scheduling a retry..
```

That shows the full output of the activity, including timestamps.
That can be especially helpful if trying to determine why an integration isn't behaving as expected.

See the `--help` output of the command for more options.

If you omit the activity ID (the second random-seeming string), the command will default to the most recent activity recorded.
### Activity scripts


Upsun Fixed supports custom scripts that can fire in response to any activity. These scripts allow you to take arbitrary actions in response to actions in your project, such as when it deploys, when a new branch is created, etc.

Check out examples from other users on the Upsun Fixed [Community site](https://community.platform.sh/c/activity-scripts/10).

##### Installing

Activity scripts are configured as integrations.
That means they're at the *project level*, not at the level of an individual environment.
While you can store the scripts in your Git repository for access, they have no effect there.

To install a new activity script, use [`integration:add` command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference.md#integrationadd) from the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).

```bash
platform integration:add --type script --file ./my_script.js
```

That installs and enables the `my_script.js` file as an activity script on the current project.

Don't run the `integration:add` command a second time,
or it installs a second integration with the same code.

##### Updating

To update an existing activity script, follow these steps:

1. Get the activity script's ID by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform integrations
   ```

   This returns something like the following:

   ```bash
   +---------------+--------------+--------------+
   | ID            | Type         | Summary      |
   +---------------+--------------+--------------+
   | nadbowmhd67do | script       | ...          |
   | rcqf6b69jdcx6 | health.email | From:        |
   |               |              | To: #admins  |
   +---------------+--------------+--------------+
   ```

2. Update the integration by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform integration:update --file ./my_script.js <SCRIPT_ID>
   ```

   This [`integration:update` command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference.md#integrationupdate) updates the integration in place, permanently overwriting the previous version.

3. Test the activity script update by [triggering a redeployment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference.md#environmentredeploy) with the following command:

   ```bash
   platform redeploy
   ```

##### Removing

To disable an activity script, follow these steps:

1. Get the activity script's ID by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform integrations
   ```

   This returns something like the following:

   ```bash
   +---------------+--------------+--------------+
   | ID            | Type         | Summary      |
   +---------------+--------------+--------------+
   | nadbowmhd67do | script       | ...          |
   | rcqf6b69jdcx6 | health.email | From:        |
   |               |              | To: #admins  |
   +---------------+--------------+--------------+
   ```

2. [Delete the integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference.md#integrationdelete) by running the following command:

   ```bash
   platform integration:delete <SCRIPT_ID>
   ```

##### Debugging

Get activity logs by running the following command:

```bash
platform integration:activities
```

Every time your activity script runs it generates a new log entry, including the output from the script.
Any output produced by `console.log` is available in the activity log, which is the recommended way to debug scripts.

See the [activity log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/overview.md#debug-integrations) documentation for further details.

To get a more readable output of a variable you're trying to debug, you can make `JSON.stringify` use human-friendly formatting.

```javascript
console.log(JSON.stringify(project, null, 2));
```

##### Configuring scripts

There are many types of activity to which a script could respond.
By default, it will activate only after a successful `git push` operation.
That trigger is configurable via command line switches when adding or updating a script.

For example, to have a script trigger any time an environment is activated or deactivated, run:

```bash
platform integration:update --events='environment.activate,environment.deactivate' <SCRIPT_ID>
```

A complete list of possible events is available in the [Activity script type documentation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/reference.md#type).
Any of those Activity Script types can be added to the `--events=event1,event2,...` option.

Scripts can also trigger only when an action reaches a [given state](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/reference.md#state), such as `pending`, `in_progress`, `complete`, `cancelled`, or `scheduled`.
The default is only when they reach `complete`.
To have a script execute when a synchronize action first starts, for example, you would run:

```bash
platform integration:update --events=environment.synchronize --states=in_progress <SCRIPT_ID>
```

It's also possible to restrict scripts to certain environments by name.
Most commonly, that's used to have them execute only for your production environment or for all other environments.

The following example executes only for backup actions on the `production` environment:

```bash
platform integration:update --events=environment.backup --environments=production <SCRIPT_ID>
```

As a general rule, it's better to have an activity script only execute on the specific events and branches you're interested in
rather than firing on all activities and then filtering out undesired use cases in the script itself.

##### Activity script variables

Some activities don't have access to [project and environment variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#variable-types).
In this case, to avoid hardcoding sensitive variables (such as API tokens) and therefore prevent security breaches,
add a variable to your activity script.

You can add activity script variables through the Upsun Fixed CLI.
Activity script variables are only visible in the activity script itself,
inside the `variables` variable.

###### Add an activity script variable

To add a variable to your activity script at the integration level,
use the following `POST` request:

```bash
POST /api/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/integrations/<INTEGRATION_ID>/variables
```

You get a payload similar to the following:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "attributes": {
    "property1": "string",
    "property2": "string"
  },
  "value": "string",
  "is_json": true,
  "is_sensitive": true
}
```

###### Delete or patch an activity script variable

To delete an activity script variable,
use the following `DELETE` request:

```
DELETE /api/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/integrations/<INTEGRATION_ID>/variables
```

You can also patch your activity script variable.
To do so, send the same request using the `PATCH` method instead of the `DELETE` one.

###### List an activity script variable

To list all your activity script variables at the integration level,
use the following `GET` request:

```
GET /api/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/integrations/<INTEGRATION_ID>/variables
```

##### Available APIs

Activity scripts can be written in ES2021 and don't support installing additional packages.
There are a series of [utility functions you can reuse](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/utility.md)
as well as the following libraries, APIs, and global variables to facilitate building out custom functionality.

###### `underscore.js`

[`Underscore.js`](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore) is available out-of-the-box to make writing Activity scripts more pleasant.
See [Underscore's documentation](https://underscorejs.org/) for available functions and utilities.

###### `activity`

Every activity script has a global variable `activity` that contains detailed information about the activity,
including embedded, JSON-ified versions of the routes configuration and relevant `.platform.app.yaml` files.
The `activity` variable is the same as the [webhook payload](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/webhooks.md).
See the documentation there for details and a complete example.

Several of the utility functions below work by pulling out common portions of the `activity` object.

###### `project`

The `project` global variable includes information about the project subscription itself.
That includes its ID and name, how many users are associated with the project, its SSH public key, and various other values.
An example of this object is below:

```json
{
  "attributes": {},
  "created_at": "2024-03-15T19:50:09.514267+00:00",
  "default_domain": null,
  "description": "",
  "id": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm",
  "owner": "...",
  "region": "eu-1.platform.sh",
  "repository": {
    "client_ssh_key": "ssh-rsa ...",
    "url": "azertyuiopqsdfghjklm@git.eu-1.platform.sh:kqyhl5f5nuzky.git"
  },
  "status": {
    "code": "provisioned",
    "message": "ok"
  },
  "subscription": {
    "environments": 3,
    "included_users": 1,
    "license_uri": "...",
    "plan": "development",
    "restricted": false,
    "storage": 5120,
    "subscription_management_uri": "...",
    "suspended": false,
    "user_licenses": 1
  },
  "timezone": "Europe/Dublin",
  "title": "Activity script examples",
  "updated_at": "2020-04-21T17:15:35.526498+00:00"
}
```

###### Storage API

Activity scripts have access to a limited key/value storage API to persist values from one execution to another.
The API is similar to the JavaScript `LocalStorage` API.

```javascript
// Access the storage API.
// It isn't pre-required.
var storage = require("storage");

// Retrieve a stored value. If the value isn't set it will return null.
var counter = storage.get('counter') || 0;

if (counter) {
    // Generate debug output.
    console.log("Counter is: " + counter);
}

// Write a value into the storage. Only string-safe values are supported.
// To save an object or array, run JSON.stringify() on it first.
storage.set('counter', counter + 1);

// Remove a value completely.
storage.remove('counter');

// Remove all values in storage, unconditionally.
storage.clear();
```

###### Fetch API

Activity scripts support a modified version of the browser "Fetch API" for issuing HTTP requests.
Unlike the typical browser version, however, they only support synchronous requests.
That means the return value of `fetch()` is a `Response`, not a `Promise` for one.
The returned `Response` is also a bit different: only the `ok`, `status` and `statusText` properties
as well as the `text` and `json` methods are available.
Note that because of the synchronous nature of our `fetch` implementation,
the `Response.text` and `Response.json` methods are also synchronous,
so they directly return a `string` and an `object`, respectively.
The API is otherwise essentially the same as that [in the MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

For instance, this example sends a GET request every time it executes:

```javascript
var resp = fetch("http://example.com/site-deployed");

// The fetch call above being synchronous, we can directly access resp properties.
// resp.ok is true if the response was a 2xx, false otherwise.
if (!resp.ok) {
    console.log("Well that didn't work.");
}
```

While this example sends a POST request with a JSON string as the body:

```javascript
var body = JSON.stringify({
  "some": "value",
});

var resp = fetch("http://example.com/", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: body,
  }
)
if (!resp.ok) {
    console.log("Couldn't POST.");
} else {
  // resp.json() is synchronous so this will log an object, not `Promise {  }`
  console.log(resp.json());
}
```

For more `fetch()` options, see the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

###### Cryptographic API

A minimalist cryptographic API is also available to activity scripts.
Its main use is for signing requests to 3rd party APIs.

The `crypto.createHmac()` function allows you to create a secure HMAC hash and digest.

```javascript
var h = crypto.createHmac("sha256", "foo");
h.update("bar");
h.digest("hex")
```

* The available hashing functions are `'sha256'`, `'sha1'` and `'md5'` as hashing functions.
* The available digest formats are `'base64'`, `'hex'` or `''` (empty).
An empty digest will yield a byte string.

For example, if you wanted to call an AWS API, you would calculate the signature like so:

```Javascript
function HMAC(key, value) {
  var h = crypto.createHmac("sha256", key);
  h.update(value);
  return h.digest();
}
var kSecret = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY";
HMAC(HMAC(HMAC(HMAC("AWS4" + kSecret,"20150830"),"us-east-1"),"iam"),"aws4_request");
```

> Example taken from the [AWS documentation for signing API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.md).
#### Activity reference

Activities log changes to your project,
including when you deploy your app,
when you [push code](#push), and when a [cron job is run](#cron).

To automate your workflows, you can parse and react to the activity's JSON object
through [activity scripts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity.md).

###### Activity schema

Every activity has a corresponding JSON object containing all information for that activity,
including timestamps, configuration, and sometimes logs.
In practice, you can ignore much of the JSON object's content.
The most commonly used values are documented in this reference.

The response differs depending on the activity and doesn't always include all fields.

####### Example response

The following is a shortened example of a response for an [environment sync activity](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#sync).
You can also see [complete examples of responses](#examples).

```json {no-copy="true"}

####### `id`

A unique `id` value to identify the activity itself.

####### `*_at`

`created_at`, `started_at`, `updated_at`, `cancelled_at`, `completed_at`, and `expires_at` are all timestamps in UTC.
For when a given activity occurred, use `completed_at`.
You can use these properties to calculate the duration of the activity.
To calculate the timing for steps in the activity, see the [`timings` property](#timings).

####### `parameters`

The `parameters` property includes detailed information about what triggered the activity,
such as the user, the impacted environment, the git commits, or the cron commands.
The response changes based on the activity.

####### `project`

The ID of the project in which the activity took place.
Use this value to distinguish multiple projects sent the same URL.

Different from [`project` activities](#type).

####### `type`

The type of the activity in one of the following categories:

- [Project](#project-activity-types)
- [Environment](#environment-activity-types)
- [Integration](#integration-activity-types)
- [Maintenance](#maintenance-activity-types)

###### Maximum activities and parallelism

Project activities are distributed across separate queues,
which enables *two* simultaneous activities to occur in parallel across your environments.
For a given environment, only one activity can run at a time.
Those queues include the following types of activities:

| Name           | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`      | The most common activities on repositories (pushes, merges) and environments (syncs, redeployments). |
| `integrations` | Source and webhook integration activities.                                                           |
| `backup`       | Backup activities.                                                                                   |
| `cron`         | Cron activities.                                                                                     |

Production activities are prioritized across all queues.
When an activity for the production environment is triggered, it's placed at the top of the queue.
This makes it unlikely that activities on preview environments block activities for the production environment for long,
though there may be a temporary wait.

###### Examples

The response is often usually long, so the following examples are shortened using ellipses.
Remember that the response differs depending on the activity and not all fields are always available.

To test responses, [set up a webhook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/webhooks.md#setup).

####### Cron

When a cron job is triggered, the activity contains all the [job's information](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).
The following example response was triggered by a setting
where the cron is scheduled to run every five minutes (`5 * * * *`)
with the command `sleep 60 && echo sleep-60-finished && date` and times out after 86,400 seconds.

To get details about the configured cron job, see the `parameters` property:

```json {no-copy="true"}
...
  "parameters": {
    "user": "admin",
    "cluster": "abcdefgh1234567-main-abcd123",
    "environment": "main",
    "application": "myapp",
    "cron": "saybye",
    "spec": {

      },
      "shutdown_timeout": null,
      "timeout": 86400
    }
...
```

####### Push

A push activity contains several properties.
The `commits` property contains everything related to the Git push that triggered the activity:

```json  {no-copy="true"}
...
    "commits": [
      {
        "sha": "2bab04e050279ac078d5d34016f5dd9c466e948d",

#### Utility routines


The following utility routines can help simplify common tasks in your activity scripts. They’re free to copy, modify, bend, fold, spindle, and mutilate as needed for your own scripts. They also demonstrate some common patterns for working with the ``activity`` and ``project`` data structures.

###### Route access

```javascript
/**
 * Returns just those routes that point to a valid upstream.
 *
 * This method is similar to routes(), but filters out redirect routes that are rarely
 * useful for app configuration. If desired it can also filter to just those routes
 * whose upstream is a given application name. To retrieve routes that point to the
 * current application where the code is being run, use:
 *
 * routes = getUpstreamRoutes(applicationName);
 *
 * @param {string} [appName]
 *   The name of the upstream app on which to filter, if any.
 * @return {object}
 *   An object map of route definitions. The generated URLs of the routes are added as a "url" key.
 */
function getUpstreamRoutes(appName) {
  return Object.entries(activity.payload.deployment.routes).reduce(
    (upstreams, [url, route]) =>
      route.type === "upstream" &&
      (!appName || appName === route.upstream.split(":")[0])
        ? {
            ...upstreams,
            [url]: {
              ...route,
              url,
            },
          }
        : upstreams,
    {}
  );
}
```

```javascript
/**
 * Returns the primary route.
 *
 * The primary route is the one marked primary in `.platform/routes.yaml`, or else
 * the first non-redirect route in that file if none are marked.
 *
 * @return {object}
 *   The route definition. The generated URL of the route is added as a "url" key.
 */
function getPrimaryRoute() {
  return Object.entries(activity.payload.deployment.routes).reduce(
    (primary, [url, route]) =>
      route.primary
        ? {
            ...route,
            url,
          }
        : primary,
    {}
  );
}
```

```javascript
/**
 * Returns the route definition that has the specified id.
 *
 * Note: If no route ID was specified in .platform/routes.yaml then it will not be possible
 * to look up a route by ID.
 *
 * @param {string} id
 *   The ID of the route to load.
 * @return {object}
 *   The route definition. The generated URL of the route is added as a "url" key.
 * @throws {Error}
 *   If there is no route by that ID, an exception is thrown.
 */
function getRoute(id) {
  const found = Object.entries(activity.payload.deployment.routes).reduce(
    (foundRoute, [url, route]) =>
      route.id === id
        ? {
            ...route,
            url,
          }
        : foundRoute,
    null
  );

  if (found === null) {
    throw new Error(`No such route id found: ${id}`);
  }

  return found;
}
```
#### Example: Discord

The following example activity script posts a message to a Discord channel every time it's triggered.

To use it, follow these steps:

1. In your Discord administrative interface, [create a new Discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
   Give it a name and specify the channel where it should post messages.
  Copy the URL for the webhook.
2. Replace `DISCORD_URL` in the following script with your webhook URL.
3. Paste the code into a `.js` file.
4. Add it as a new [script integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity.md#installing).

   Specify which events should trigger it using the `--events` flag.
   Optionally specify environments with the `--environments` flag.

Now, any activities that meet the events/environment criteria you specified are reported to Discord.

Once you have it working, you're free to modify the code below as desired.
For more on the message format, see the [Discord webhook API reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook).

```javascript
/**
 * Sends a message to Discord.
 *
 * To control what events trigger it, use the --events switch in
 * the Upsun Fixed CLI.
 *
 * @param {string} title
 *   The title of the message block to send.
 * @param {string} message
 *   The message body to send.
 */
function sendDiscordMessage(title, message) {
  const url = DISCORD_URL;

  const messageTitle =
    title + (new Date().getDay() === 5) ? " (On a Friday! :calendar:)" : "";

  const body = {
    content: messageTitle,
    embeds: [
      {
        description: message,
      },
    ],
  };

  const resp = fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  });

  if (!resp.ok) {
    console.log("Sending Discord message failed: " + resp.body.text());
  }
}

sendDiscordMessage(activity.text, activity.log);
```

Common properties you may want to send to Discord (in the last line of the script) include:

- `activity.text`: A brief, one-line statement of what happened.
- `activity.log`: The complete build and deploy log output, as it would be seen in the Console log screen.

For more properties, see the [activity reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/reference.md).
#### Example: Slack

The following example activity script posts a message to a Slack channel every time it's triggered.

To use it, follow these steps:

1. In your Slack administrative interface, [create a new Slack webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
   You get a URL starting with `https://hooks.slack.com/`.
2. Replace `SLACK_URL` in the following script with your webhook URL.
3. Paste the code into a `.js` file.
4. Add it as a new [script integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity.md#installing).

   Specify which events should trigger it using the `--events` flag.
   Optionally specify environments with the `--environments` flag.

Now, any activities that meet the events/environment criteria you specified are reported to Slack.

Once you have it working, you're free to modify the code below as desired.
For formatting more complex messages, see the [Slack messaging documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts).

```javascript
/**
 * Sends a color-coded formatted message to Slack.
 *
 * To control what events trigger it, use the --events switch in
 * the Upsun Fixed CLI.
 *
 * @param {string} title
 *   The title of the message block to send.
 * @param {string} message
 *   The message body to send.
 */
function sendSlackMessage(title, message) {
  const url = SLACK_URL;

  if (!message) {
    // No message. Don't send it.
    return;
  }

  const messageTitle =
    title + ((new Date().getDay() === 5) ? " (On a Friday! :calendar:)" : "");

  const color = activity.result === "success" ? "#66c000" : "#ff0000";

  const body = {
    attachments: [
      {
        title: messageTitle,
        text: message,
        color: color,
      },
    ],
  };

  const resp = fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  });

  if (!resp.ok) {
    console.log("Sending slack message failed: " + resp.body.text());
  }
}

sendSlackMessage(activity.text, activity.log);
```

Common properties you may want to send to Slack (in the last line of the script) include:

- `activity.text`: A brief, one-line statement of what happened.
- `activity.log`: The complete build and deploy log output, as it would be seen in the Console log screen.

For more properties, see the [activity reference](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/reference.md).
#### Webhooks


Webhooks allow you to host a script yourself externally that receives the same payload as an activity script and responds to the same events, but can be hosted on your own server in your own language.

###### Setup

```bash
platform integration:add --type=webhook --url=<URL_TO_RECEIVE_JSON>
```

The webhook URL receives a POST message for every activity that's triggered.
The message contains complete information about the entire state of the project at that time.

It's possible to set the integration to only send certain activity types, or only activities on certain branches.
The CLI prompts you to specify which to include or exclude.
Leave at the default values to get all events on all environments in a project.

For testing purposes, you can generate a URL from a service such as [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
and use the generated URL as `<URL_TO_RECEIVE_JSON>`.

###### Webhook schema

See the [activity script](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/activity/reference.md) reference for a description of the webhook payload.

###### Validate the integration

To verify your integration is functioning properly, run the following [CLI command](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/overview.md#validate-integrations):

```bash
platform integration:validate
```
### Source integrations

You might want to keep your code in a third-party repository that's linked to your Upsun Fixed project.
This means you keep all your workflows where you want and use Upsun Fixed for deploying.

Your Upsun Fixed project becomes a mirror of your code repository elsewhere.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Upsun Fixed.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the third-party repository.
#### Integrate with Bitbucket


If you have code in a Bitbucket repository, you might want to connect it to a Upsun Fixed project.
This means you can keep your Bitbucket workflows
and treat the Bitbucket repository as the source of truth for your code.

Your Upsun Fixed project becomes a mirror of your Bitbucket repository.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Upsun Fixed.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the Bitbucket repository.

When you set up an integration with Bitbucket,
it automates the following processes for you:

- Creating a new environment when a branch is created or a pull request is opened.
- Rebuilding the environment when new code is pushed to Bitbucket.
- Deleting the environment when a pull request is merged.

You can set up an integration with either Bitbucket Cloud
or a self-hosted [Bitbucket Server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/).

###### Before you begin

To manage source integrations, you need to be a [project admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/users.md).

You also need a Bitbucket Cloud or Bitbucket Server repository with working code.

###### Bitbucket Cloud

####### 1. Create an OAuth consumer

To integrate your Upsun Fixed project with an existing Bitbucket Cloud repository,
[create an OAuth consumer](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/):

![A screenshot of how to setup the Bitbucket OAuth consumer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/integrations/bitbucket/bitbucket-oauth-consumer.svg "0.35")

**Note**: 

Be sure to define the above as a private consumer by checking the **This is a private consumer** box.

The **Callback URL** isn't important in this case.
You can set it to `http://localhost`.

Copy the **Key** and **Secret** for your consumer.

####### 2. Enable the Cloud integration

To enable the integration, use either the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

 - ``PROJECT_ID`` is the ID of your Upsun Fixed project.
 - ``OWNER/REPOSITORY`` is the name of your repository in Bitbucket.
 - ``CONSUMER_KEY`` is the key of the [OAuth consumer you created](#1-create-an-oauth-consumer).
 - ``CONSUMER_SECRET`` is the secret of the [OAuth consumer you created](#1-create-an-oauth-consumer).

For example, if your repository is located at ``https://bitbucket.org/platformsh/platformsh-docs``,
the command is similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform integration:add \
  --project abcdefgh1234567 \
  --type bitbucket \
  --repository platformsh/platformsh-docs \
  --key abc123 \
  --secret abcd1234 \
```

 - Select the project where you want to enable the integration.
 - Click **Settings Settings**.
 - Under **Project settings**, click **Integrations**.
 - Click **+ Add integration**.
 - Under **Bitbucket**, click **+ Add**.
 - Complete the form with:

 - The repository in the form ``owner/repository``
 - The [key and secret you generated](#1-create-an-oauth-consumer)

 - Check that the other options match what you want.
 - Click **Add integration**.

In both the CLI and Console, you can choose from the following options:

| CLI flag         | Default | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fetch-branches` | `true`  | Whether to mirror and update branches on Upsun Fixed and create inactive environments from them. When enabled, merging on an Upsun Fixed environment isn't possible. That is, merging environments must be done on the source repository rather than on the Upsun Fixed project. See note below for details related to this flag and synchronizing code from a parent environment. |
| `prune-branches` | `true`  | Whether to delete branches from Upsun Fixed that don’t exist in the Bitbucket repository. When enabled, branching (creating environments) must be done on the source repository rather than on the Upsun Fixed project. Branches created on Upsun Fixed that are not on the source repository will not persist and will be quickly pruned. Automatically disabled when fetching branches is disabled. |
| `build-pull-requests` | `true` | Whether to track all pull requests and create active environments from them, which builds the pull request. |
| `resync-pull-requests` | `false` | Whether to sync data from the parent environment on every push to a pull request. |

To [keep your repository clean](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/bestpractices/clean-repository.md) and avoid performance issues, make sure you enable both the `fetch-branches` and `prune-branches` options.

####### 3. Validate the integration

Verify that your integration is functioning properly [using the CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../overview.md#validate-integrations):

```bash
platform integration:validate
```

######## Add the webhook manually

If the integration was added with the correct permissions, the necessary webhook is added automatically.
If you see a message that the webhook wasn't added, add one manually.

To configure a webhook on a Bitbucket repository,
you need to have Admin [user permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/).

1. Get the webhook URL by running this command: `platform
 integration:get --property hook_url`.
1. Copy the returned URL.

1. Follow the [Bitbucket instructions to create a webhook](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/#Create-webhooks)
   using the URL you copied.
   Make sure to update the triggers to include all pull request events except comments and approval.

You can now start pushing code, creating new branches,
and opening pull requests
directly in your Bitbucket repository.
Your Upsun Fixed environments are automatically created and updated.

###### Bitbucket Server

####### 1. Generate a token

To integrate your Upsun Fixed project with a repository on a Bitbucket Server instance,
you first need to create an access token associated with your account.

[Generate a token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/HTTP+access+tokens).
and give it at least read access to projects and admin access to repositories.
Copy the token.

####### 2. Enable the Server integration

To enable the integration, use either the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

 - ``PROJECT_ID`` is the ID of your Upsun Fixed project.
 - ``OWNER/REPOSITORY`` is the name of the repository in Bitbucket server.
 - ``BITBUCKET_SERVER_ACCESS_TOKEN`` is the [token you generated](#1-generate-a-token).
 - ``BITBUCKET_SERVER_URL`` is the URL for your Bitbucket server.

For example, if your repository is located at ``https://example.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs``,
the command is similar to the following:
```bash {}
platform integration:add \
  --project abcdefgh1234567 \
  --type bitbucket_server \
  --repository platformsh/platformsh-docs \
  --username user@example.com \
  --token abc123
  --bitbucket-url https://example.com  

```

 - Select the project where you want to enable the integration.

 - Click Settings **Settings**.

 - Under **Project settings**, click **Integrations**.

 - Click **+ Add integration**.

 - Under **Bitbucket server**, click **+ Add**.

 - Complete the form with:

 - Your server URL
 - Your Bitbucket username
 - The [token you generated](#1-generate-a-token)
 - The Bitbucket server project name
 - The repository in the form ``owner/repository``

 - Check that the other options match what you want.

 - Click **Add integration**.

In both the CLI and Console, you can choose from the following options:

| CLI flag | Default | Description |
| ``fetch-branches`` | ``true`` | Whether to mirror and update branches on Upsun Fixed and create inactive environments from them. |
| ``prune-branches`` | ``true`` | Whether to delete branches from Upsun Fixed that don’t exist in the Bitbucket server repository. Automatically disabled when fetching branches is disabled. |
| ``build-pull-requests`` | ``true`` | Whether to track all pull requests and create active environments from them, which builds the pull request. |
| ``pull-requests-clone-parent-data`` | ``true`` | Whether to clone data from the parent environment when creating a pull request environment. |

To [keep your repository clean ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/bestpractices/clean-repository.md) and avoid performance issues,
  make sure you enable both the ``fetch-branches`` and ``prune-branches`` options.

####### 3. Validate the integration

Verify that your integration is functioning properly [using the CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../overview.md#validate-integrations):

If you see a message that the webhook wasn't added, add one manually.

To configure a webhook on a Bitbucket repository,
you need to have Admin [user permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/).

1. Get the webhook URL by running this command: `platform
 integration:get --property hook_url`.
1. Copy the returned URL.

1. Follow the [Bitbucket instructions to create a webhook](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver076/managing-webhooks-in-bitbucket-server-1026535073.md#ManagingwebhooksinBitbucketServer-creatingwebhooksCreatingwebhooks)
   using the URL you copied.
   Send all events except comments and approval.

You can now start pushing code, creating new branches,
and opening pull requests
directly in your Bitbucket repository.
Your Upsun Fixed environments are automatically created and updated.

###### Environment parent and status

When a **branch** is created in Bitbucket,
an environment is created in Upsun Fixed with the default branch as its parent.
It starts as an [inactive environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#inactive-environment) with no data or services.

When a **pull request** is opened in Bitbucket,
an environment is created in Upsun Fixed with the pull request's target branch as its parent.
It starts as an [active environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#active-environment) with a copy of its parent's data.

###### Source of truth

When you add an integration, your Bitbucket repository is considered to be the source of truth for the project.
Your Upsun Fixed project is only a mirror of that repository and you can only push commits to Bitbucket.

To clone your code, follow these steps:

 - In the Console, open the project you want to clone.
 - Click **Code**.
 - Click **Git**.
 - Run the command you find using Git.

When you do this, you're cloning from your integrated Bitbucket repository,
if you have the [appropriate access to do so](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/troubleshoot.md).

####### Sync, fetch, and prune

An integration from Bitbucket to Upsun Fixed establishes that:

- Bitbucket is the source of truth, where Git operations occur
- Upsun Fixed is a mirror of that repository - provisioning infrastructure according to configuration, and orchestrating environments according to the branch structure of the Bitbucket repository

Actions that take place on Upsun Fixed don't affect commits on Bitbucket.
Because of this, the Bitbucket integration enables both `fetch-branches` (track branches on Bitbucket) and `prune-branches` (delete branches that don't exist on Bitbucket) by default.
You can change these settings but it is recommend to keep them.

When enabled by default, you are limited by design as to what actions can be performed within the context of a Upsun Fixed project with a Bitbucket integration:

| Action         | Observation         | Recommendation |
| :---------------- | :---------------- | :------- |
| Branch from parent | Running [`environment:branch`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference#environmentbranch) with the CLI, or selecting **Branch** in Console produces a new child environment, but it's deleted shortly after automatically. | Contribute to the Bitbucket repository itself by creating a branch and pull request. When the PR has been opened, a new environment will be provisioned for it.  |
| Merge in parent | Running [`environment:merge`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference#environmentmerge) with the CLI fails locally, and the **Merge** option in Console is not clickable. | Review and merge pull requests and/or branches on the Bitbucket repository. |
| Merge into child (sync code) | Running [`environment:synchronize`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference#environmentsynchronize) with the CLI fails locally, and the **Sync** option in Console won't allow me to include `code` in that sync. | Perform the merge locally from a matching branch on Bitbucket. For example, clone the most recent parent (`git pull origin parent-branch`), switch to the pull request branch (`git checkout ga-staging`), and then merge the parent into the current branch (`git merge main`). |

###### Pull request URLs

When a pull request is deployed, the integration reports the primary URL for the deployed environment.
So you get a link to the deployed environment right in the pull request.

If you have multiple routes,
ensure the correct one is reported by [specifying the primary route](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md#route-configuration-reference).

#### Integrate with GitHub


If you have code in a GitHub repository, you might want to connect it to a Upsun Fixed project.
This means you can keep your GitHub workflows
and treat the GitHub repository as the source of truth for your code.

Your Upsun Fixed project becomes a mirror of your GitHub repository.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Upsun Fixed.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the GitHub repository.

When you set up an integration with GitHub,
it automates the following processes for you:

- Creating a new environment when a branch is created or a pull request is opened.
- Rebuilding the environment when new code is pushed to GitHub.
- Deleting the environment when a pull request is merged.

###### Before you begin

To manage source integrations, you need to be a [project admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/users.md).

You also need a GitHub repository with working code.

###### 1. Generate a token

To integrate your Upsun Fixed project with an existing GitHub repository,
you need to [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
You can generate a classic personal access token,
or a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens/)
for even greater control over the permissions you grant.

For the integration to work,
your GitHub user needs to have permission to push code to the repository.

When you set up or update an integration, it also needs permission to manage its webhooks.
This means your user needs to be a repository admin to create the integration.
You can remove this permission after setup.

Make sure you give your token a description, and set it to "No expiration".

If you're generating a classic personal access token,
ensure the token has the appropriate scopes based on what you want to do:

| Scope                 | Purpose                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin:repo_hook`     | To create webhooks for events in repositories. Always needed.          |
| `public_repo`         | To integrate with public repositories.                                 |
| `repo`                | To integrate with your private repositories.                           |
| `repo` and `read:org` | To integrate with private repositories in organizations you belong to. |

If you're generating a fine-grained personal access token,
ensure the token has the right [repository permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
for the integration to work:

| Permission        | Access level    |
| ------------------| ----------------|
| `Commit statuses` | Read and write  |
| `Contents`        | Read and write  |
| `Metadata`        | Read-only       |
| `Pull request`    | Read and write  |
| `Webhooks`        | Read and write  |

After you've set the needed scopes or permissions,
generate and copy your token.

###### 2. Enable the integration

To enable the integration, use either the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

 - ``PROJECT_ID`` is the ID of your Upsun Fixed project.
 - ``OWNER/REPOSITORY`` is the name of your repository in GitHub.
 - ``GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`` is the [token you generated](#1-generate-a-token).
 - ``GITHUB_URL`` is the base URL for your GitHub server if you self-host.
If you use the public ``https://github.com``, omit the ``--base-url`` flag when running the command.

For example, if your repository is located at ``https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs``,
the command is similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform integration:add \
  --project abcdefgh1234567 \
  --type github \
  --repository platformsh/platformsh-docs \
  --token abc123
```

 - Select the project where you want to enable the integration.
 - Click **Settings Settings**.
 - Under **Project settings**, click **Integrations**.
 - Click **+ Add integration**.
 - Under **GitHub**, click **+ Add**.
 - Add the [token you generated](#1-generate-a-token).
 - Optional: If your GitHub project isn’t hosted at ``github.com``, enter your GitHub custom domain.
 - Click **Continue**.
 - Choose the repository to use for the project.
 - Check that the other options match what you want.
 - Click **Add integration**.

In both the CLI and Console, you can choose from the following options:

| CLI flag         | Default | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fetch-branches` | `true`  | Whether to mirror and update branches on Upsun Fixed and create inactive environments from them. When enabled, merging on an Upsun Fixed environment isn't possible. That is, merging environments must be done on the source repository rather than on the Upsun Fixed project. See note below for details related to this flag and synchronizing code from a parent environment. |
| `prune-branches` | `true`  | Whether to delete branches from Upsun Fixed that don’t exist in the GitHub repository. When enabled, branching (creating environments) must be done on the source repository rather than on the Upsun Fixed project. Branches created on Upsun Fixed that are not on the source repository will not persist and will be quickly pruned. Automatically disabled when fetching branches is disabled. |
| `build-pull-requests` | `true` | Whether to track all pull requests and create active environments from them, which builds the pull request. |
| `build-draft-pull-requests` | `true` | Whether to also track and build draft pull requests. Automatically disabled when pull requests aren’t built. |
| `pull-requests-clone-parent-data` | `true` | 	Whether to clone data from the parent environment when creating a pull request environment. |
| `build-pull-requests-post-merge`| `false` | Whether to build what would be the result of merging each pull request. Turning it on forces rebuilds any time something is merged to the target branch. |

To [keep your repository clean](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/bestpractices/clean-repository.md) and avoid performance issues, make sure you enable both the `fetch-branches` and `prune-branches` options.

###### 3. Validate the integration

Verify that your integration is functioning properly [using the CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../overview.md#validate-integrations):

```bash
platform integration:validate
```

####### Add the webhook manually

If the integration was added with the correct permissions, the necessary webhook is added automatically.
If you see a message that the webhook wasn't added, add one manually.

To configure a webhook on a GitHub repository,
you need to have Admin [user permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role).

1. Get the webhook URL by running this command: `platform
 integration:get --property hook_url`.
1. Copy the returned URL.

1. In your GitHub repository, click **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add webhook**.
1. In the **Payload URL** field, paste the URL you copied.
1. For the content type, select **application/json**.
1. Select **Send me everything**.
1. Click **Add webhook**.

You can now start pushing code, creating new branches,
and opening pull requests
directly in your GitHub repository.
Your Upsun Fixed environments are automatically created and updated.

###### Environment parent and status

When a **branch** is created in GitHub,
an environment is created in Upsun Fixed with the default branch as its parent.
It starts as an [inactive environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#inactive-environment) with no data or services.

When a **pull request** is opened in GitHub,

#### Integrate with GitLab


If you have code in a GitLab repository, you might want to connect it to a Upsun Fixed project.
This means you can keep your GitLab workflows
and treat the GitLab repository as the source of truth for your code.

Your Upsun Fixed project becomes a mirror of your GitLab repository.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Upsun Fixed.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the GitLab repository.

When you set up an integration with GitLab,
it automates the following processes for you:

- Creating a new environment when a branch is created or a merge request is opened.
- Rebuilding the environment when new code is pushed to GitLab.
- Deleting the environment when a merge request is merged.

###### Before you begin

To manage source integrations, you need to be a [project admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/users.md).

You also need a GitLab repository with working code.

**Note**: 

If your GitLab instance is not accessible from the public internet, configure a [GitLab CI/CD pipeline](#optional-use-a-gitlab-cicd-pipeline) that pushes code to Upsun Fixed and manages environments via the Upsun Fixed API. This method provides full deployment control while keeping your GitLab instance isolated.

###### 1. Generate a token

To integrate your Upsun Fixed project with an existing GitLab repository,
generate a [project access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md#create-a-project-access-token).
Ensure the token has the following scopes:

- `api` to access your API
- `read_repository` to read the repository

For the integration to work, your GitLab user needs push access to the repository and to configure a webhook on a GitLab repository, you need to have Maintainer or Owner user permissions.

Copy the token.

**Note**: 

To create a project access token, you need to have a [sufficient GitLab license tier](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md).
If you don’t see **Access Tokens** under **Settings**, upgrade your GitLab tier.
Alternatively, you can create a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md),
but that’s attached to a specific user rather than the project as a whole
and grants more permissions.

###### 2. Enable the integration

To enable the integration, use either the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

 - ``PROJECT_ID`` is the ID of your Upsun Fixed project.
 - ``PROJECT/SUBPROJECT`` is the name of your repository in GitLab.
 - ``GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`` is the [token you generated](#1-generate-a-token).
 - ``GITLAB_URL`` is the base URL for your GitLab server if you self-host.
If you use the public ``https://gitlab.com``, omit the ``--base-url`` flag when running the command.

For example, if your repository is located at ``https://gitlab.com/platformsh/platformsh-docs``,
the command is similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform integration:add \
  --project abcdefgh1234567 \
  --type gitlab \
  --server-project platformsh/platformsh-docs \
  --token abc123
```

 - Select the project where you want to enable the integration.
 - Click **Settings Settings**.
 - Under **Project settings**, click **Integrations**.
 - Click **+ Add integration**.
 - Under **GitLab**, click **+ Add**.
 - Add the [token you generated](#1-generate-a-token).
 - Optional: If your GitLab project isn’t hosted at ``gitlab.com``, enter your GitLab custom domain.

directly in your GitLab repository.
Your Upsun Fixed environments are automatically created and updated.

###### Environment parent and status

If you have multiple routes,
ensure the correct one is reported by [specifying the primary route](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md#route-configuration-reference).

###### Optional: use a GitLab CI/CD pipeline

If your GitLab instance is not accessible from the internet (e.g. air-gapped or behind a firewall), the GitLab integration process outlined above, based on incoming webhooks, might not be the best option to use.

Instead, [set up a push-based GitLab CI/CD pipeline](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/gitlab-push-solution/) that pushes code to Upsun Fixed and manages environments using the Upsun Fixed API. This setup allows you to:

- Deploy to production on `main` branch updates
- Create preview environments for Merge Requests
- Clean up environments when branches or MRs are removed
- Keep your GitLab instance fully private

**Detailed tutorial**: 

For a detailed tutorial of how this works, with code samples and rationale, see this blog post: [Synchronize your air-gapped GitLab](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/gitlab-push-solution/).

You can also find a complete working example of how this works in the Upsun Fixed [GitHub snippets repository](https://github.com/upsun/snippets/tree/main/examples/gitlab-ci).

#### Resolve access issues with source integrations

If you [add a user](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#add-a-user-to-a-project) to an Upsun Fixed project,
but you haven’t added them to the remote repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket,
they can't clone the project locally.

That user might try to clone the repository using the CLI with the following command:

```bash
platform get <PROJECT_ID>
```

In this case, the user gets an error similar to the following:

```txt
Failed to connect to the Git repository: git@github.com:organization/repository.git
Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
```

###### Solution: Check external repository access rights

To enable the user to clone the repository,
grant them the correct access rights for the integrated repository.
### Fastly CDN


Offers an integrated web interface to manage your Fastly CDN service yourself without having to create individual Upsun Fixed support tickets.

- [Click to install directly in the Upsun console](https://console.upsun.com/-/add-plugin?manifest=https%253A%252F%252Ffastsun.plugins.pltfrm.sh%252Fmanifest.json)
- Plugin manifest URL:
https://fastsun.plugins.pltfrm.sh/manifest.json

The Fastly CDN plugin enables you to:
- Manage cache (purge all URLs or purge a specific URL)
- Manage ACLs (add, edit, delete)
- View real-time statistics and performance metrics
- View historical statistics and performance metrics
- View all domains attached to the Fastly service
- View current VCL version, and version history
- View service activity, and recent events history

##### Using the Fastly CDN plugin
1. In the Upsun [console](https://console.upsun.com), navigate to the project and environment whose metrics you want to view.

      **Note:** To view summarized monthly _project-level_ traffic, including CDN bandwidth and CDN requests, see the **Traffic this month** section of a project page (make sure no environment is selected).

1. On the **Fastly CDN** tab, log in with your Fastly credentials:
    - Service ID
    - API token

      If you have a Fastly subscription, you can get your credentials directly from the Fastly interface.

      If you purchased your Fastly service through Upsun, you can find your credentials in the Upsun project variables or you can get them by [opening a support ticket](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open).

      Your Fastly credentials are stored securely within your browser and are never transmitted to Upsun.

After you log in, you can see a dashboard with the following information for the selected environment:
- A real-time metrics tab
- A historical metrics tab, where you can:
  - View metrics by weeks, months, and years by using the date picker.
  - Enable/disable chart metrics by clicking them. Disabled metrics are not shown on the graph.
  - View average, min, and max values for different metrics (when available, these are shown below the historical chart).<BR>

    Both the chart and the table presentation are based on the range you select in the date picker.

The image below shows a sample Fastly CDN historical metrics tab:
![Image showing the Fastly CDN historical metrics tab in the Upsun console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/integrations/console-fastly.png "0.75")### Health notifications


Upsun Fixed can notify you when various events happen on your project, in any environment. At this time the only notification provided is a low disk space warning, but others may be added in the future.

To add or modify an integration for a project, you need to be a [project admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#project-roles).

##### Default low-disk email notifications

When you create a new project,
Upsun Fixed creates a default [low-disk email notification](#low-disk-warning) for all [project admins](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#project-roles).

##### Available notifications

###### Low-disk warning

Upsun Fixed monitors disk space usage on all applications and services in your cluster.

* When available disk space drops below 20% or 4 GB, whichever is smaller, a warning notification is generated.
* When available disk space drops below 10% or 2 GB, whichever is smaller, a critical notification is generated.
* When available disk space returns above 20% or 4 GB, whichever is smaller, an all-clear notification is generated.

Notifications are generated every 5 minutes, so there may be a brief delay between when the threshold is crossed and when the notification is triggered.

##### Configuring notifications

Health notifications can be set up via the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md), through a number of different channels.

###### Email notifications

A notification can trigger an email to be sent, from an address of your choosing to one or more addresses of your choosing.

You can view an email notification by running `platform integration:get`.

```bash
platform integration:get
+--------------+---------------+
| Property     | Value         |
+--------------+---------------+
| id           | abcdefghijklm |
| type         | health.email  |
| role         |               |
| from_address |               |
| recipients   | - '#admins'   |
+--------------+---------------+
```

To edit the `recipients` that receive the default email notification, use the `integration:update` command.

```bash
platform integration:update abcdefghijklm --recipients you@example.com
```

The `recipients` field may be any valid email address, or one of the following special values.

* `#admins` maps to all project admins and up.
* `#viewers` maps to everyone with access to the project.

To add a new email notification, register a `health.email` integration as follows:

```bash
platform integration:add --type health.email --recipients them@example.com --recipients others@example.com
```

You must specify one or more `recipients`, each as its own switch.

The default `from-address` points to the "Upsun Fixed Bot".

You can also configure a custom `--from-address`. The `--from-address` is whatever address you want the email to appear to be from. It is completely fine to use the same email address for both `from-address` and `recipients`. Note that depending on the configuration of the recipient mail server (including SPF and DKIM DNS entries) when using a custom `from-address`, the email can be marked as spam or lost.

###### Slack notifications

A notification can trigger a message to be posted to a Slack channel via a [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps).

####### 1. Optional: Create a Slack app

**Note**: 

If you are already have a Slack app, you can jump to [enabling notifications](#2-enable-notifications).

1. Open the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/) and go to **Your apps**.
2. Click **Create an App**.
3. Choose if you want to build your app from scratch, or via [an app manifest](https://api.slack.com/concepts/manifests).
4. Give your app a name.
5. Select a workspace to install your app in.
   **Note**: 

If you are not an admin of the selected workspace, request approval to install your app there.

6. Click **Create App**.

####### 2. Enable notifications

1. Open the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/) and go to **Your apps**.
2. Go to **Features** > **OAuth & Permissions** in the sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the **Scopes** area and select **User Token Scopes**.
4. Click **Add an OAuth Scope** to add the `chat:write` scope.

    ![Slack app scopes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/slack/slack-app-scopes.png "0.30")

5. Go to **Settings** > **Install app** in the sidebar.
   **Note**: 

If you are not an admin of the workspace, you need to provide a link to install the app into the workspace and onto a channel.

Once the app is approved and installed, a **User OAuth Token** is provided in your app settings.
Copy the token, and use it in the next step.

6. Using the **User OAuth Token**, run the following command:

    ```bash
    platform integration:add --type health.slack --token <USER_OAUTH_TOKEN> --channel <CHANNEL_NAME> --project <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

    For example, if you want your Slack app to post messages in the `project-notifications` channel, write the channel name in the command as you would reference it within Slack:

    ```bash
    platform integration:add --type health.slack ... --channel '#project-notifications' ...
    ```
6. When the integration is successfully configured, Upsun Fixed then sends an initial message to the channel.

**Bot users v. Slack apps**: 

Previously, Upsun Fixed allowed for the configuration of health notifications sent to Slack via bot users and their associated API tokens.
As of June 2024, Slack has deprecated bot users, and integrations must be configured using Slack apps as described above.

If you already have defined an integration using a bot user API token, it will continue to work properly, though you should consider upgrading your processes to the above settings to avoid any future retirement.

###### PagerDuty notifications

A notification can trigger a message to be sent via PagerDuty, if you are using that service.
First, create a new PagerDuty "[integration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations)" that uses the Events API v2.
Copy the "Integration Key" as known as the "routing key" for the integration.

Now register a `health.pagerduty` integration as follows:

```bash
platform integration:add --type health.pagerduty --routing-key YOUR_ROUTING_KEY
```

Any notification will now trigger an alert in PagerDuty.

##### Validate the integration

You can then verify that your integration is functioning properly [using the CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/overview.md#validate-integrations) command

```bash
platform integration:validate
```

### Infrastructure metrics

Upsun Fixed projects are accompanied by live infrastructure metrics that provide an overview of resource usage for environments.

Within the Console, metrics can be found for an environment under **Metrics**.

The information under **Metrics** shows usage metrics for:

[Dedicated Gen 2 environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview/_index.md):
each of the three hosts in your [N+1 configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md)
and their average for the Production environment.
Metrics aren't available for other Dedicated Gen 2 environments (such as a staging environment),
but are available for Grid environments (such as your preview environments).

![A screenshot of what the metrics dashboard displays for Dedicated Gen 2 environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/dg2-dashboard.png "0.45")

Grid environments: your service, app, and worker containers.
These metrics are available for all of your Grid environments.

![A screenshot of what the metrics dashboard displays for Grid environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/grid-metrics-RAM.png "0.45")

##### Default thresholds

All of the graphs show color-coded lines for the following thresholds:

- Usage up to _100%_ results.
- Usage that crosses _80%_ results.
- Usage that crosses _90%_ results.
- Usage that crosses _50%_ results.

###### Recommendations

The default thresholds aim to give you an idea of when your hosts/containers are close to running out of resources. The impact differs based on your specific apps and service.

####### Dedicated Gen 2 environments

For Dedicated Gen 2 environments, the thresholds are set for each host.
If the resources are high and hovering close to the 100% threshold,
you might want to consider:

* [Optimizing your code](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability.md) (if possible)
* [Increasing your plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md)

####### Grid environments

For Grid environments, the thresholds are set for each container.
If the resources are high and hovering close to the 100% threshold,
you might want to consider:

* [Optimizing your code](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability.md) (if possible)
* Changing your [app size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#sizes)
  or [service size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md#size)
* [Increasing your plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md)

##### Time intervals

Measurements are taken for each metric every 1 minute.
You can select a time frame over which to see these measurements for the entire **Metrics** view.
In the primary three views, averages are shown over larger intervals.

| View                                                                  | Time between measurements                     | Example                      |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| The last 15 minutes (*15m*)                                           | 1 minute                                      | 10:00, 10:01, 10:02          |
| The last hour (*1hr*)                                                 | 1 minute                                      | 10:00, 10:01, 10:02          |
| The last 24 hours (*24hr*) for Dedicated and 8 hours (*8hr*) for Grid | 20 minutes for Dedicated, 10 minutes for Grid | 10:00, 10:20, 10:40, 11:00   |

To zoom in on smaller intervals, select specific ranges in a graph.

The interval between measurements then changes based on the range you choose.

| View         | Time between measurements |
| :----------- | :------------------------ |
| < 2 hours    | 1 minute                  |
| 2 to 5 hours | 5 minutes                 |
| 5+ hours     | 20 minutes                |

###### Longer time intervals

  **Observability Suite**

  This feature is available as part of the [Observability Suite](https://upsun.com/product/).
To add the Observability Suite to your project and take advantage of this feature,
[contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

If you have the Observability Suite, you can access historical data for up to 30 days.
These data should help you understand trends over time
and whether a given measurement is normal, something that occurs occasionally, or a true anomaly.

To see data over a given time frame, use the date picker to select the range to display.

##### Deployments

Sometimes deployment activities (pushes, merges, syncs) can influence the underlying infrastructure.
You don't want to confuse a spike caused by a successful deploy with an issue that needs your attention.

To see how deployment activity influences the infrastructure, turn on **Deployments** on your metrics.

Each deployment activity appears as a line on each graph corresponding to the time the activity finished.

To see information about the deployment activity, hover over the line.
To see the build log for a specific deployment activity, click the line.
#### HTTP metrics

The HTTP metrics dashboard provides Upsun Fixed users with network-related metrics.
Those insights are designed to help them better understand the state of their
applications.

**No CDN data**: 

It should be noted that the data being fed to the HTTP metrics dashboard **does not include CDN**.

###### Grid support

HTTP Metrics is only supported on Grid environments. **There is no support for Dedicated environments.**

###### Accessing the dashboard

Those metrics can be accessed by clicking the **HTTP metrics** tab on the environment page within the console.

The HTTP metrics dashboard can help you:

- Verify if there were any recent spikes in error responses
- Check bandwidth consumption to determine if there were any service interruptions
- Identify specific URLs causing site-wide issues
- Prioritize performance optimization (see [integrate observability](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability.md))

###### HTTP requests status graph

The **HTTP requests** graph provides an aggregated view of the health of HTTP
requests made to the application. It reflects the status responses
(e.g. 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX) of HTTP requests across a defined time frame.

This graph helps identify surge of error responses or periods of elevated
request activity.

###### Bandwidth usage graph

The **Bandwidth** graph displays the data transfer volume. It represents
incoming (data the app receives) and outgoing (data the app sends) bandwidth
usage over time.

This graph helps identify bandwidth bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation,
and track bandwidth usage.

###### Top 10 most impactful URLs

The **Top 10 URL Impact** graph and list pinpoint high-traffic or resource-intensive
URLs for targeted optimization or investigation. It showcases the evolution over
time of the top-10 most impactful URLs during a given time frame.

This graph helps identify potential trouble spots, understand user behavior, and
prioritize areas for optimization.

**Note**: 

For security and privacy reasons, all URLs undergo the following sanitization measures:

 - All query parameters (``?param=value``) are sanitized to prevent leakage of sensitive information.
 - URLs exceeding 2048 characters are truncated to adhere to security best practices.
 - Specific sensitive URL paths are proactively scrubbed and anonymized.

###### Limits
Note that the following data retention limits apply when using the HTTP metrics dashboard:

- **8-hour retention** for standard customers (without Observability Suite).
- **24-hour retention** for Observability Suite customers (Enterprise and Elite tiers).

For more information about the different tiers for standard and Observability Suite customers, visit the [Pricing page](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).
#### Monitor {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}} metrics

For Dedicated Gen 2 environments, infrastructure metrics report CPU, RAM, and disk space per host and mount point.
The graphs differ when the environment has multiple clusters.

Metrics are available for Production environments and [Grid environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/metrics/grid.md) (such as your preview environments).
They aren't available for other Dedicated Gen 2 environments (such as a staging environment).

By default, the graphs include all hosts and an average over the hosts.
To select metrics for specific hosts, click **Filter**.

![Clicking Filter reveals a list of hosts you can filter](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-filter-metrics.png "0.4")

###### Host IDs

The IDs for the hosts in a list for metrics filtering will *not* match the IDs for interacting with a host, such as for accessing the environment using SSH. For example:

| Host ID under **Metrics** | SSH connection string under **Overview**                            |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Host i-04353f1e6f`       | `ssh 3.ent-abcde3clusterID-production-qwerty8@ssh.us-4.platform.sh` |
| `Host i-04d1ac8319`       | `ssh 2.ent-abcde3clusterID-production-qwerty8@ssh.us-4.platform.sh` |
| `Host i-0b1e1b96cf`       | `ssh 1.ent-abcde3clusterID-production-qwerty8@ssh.us-4.platform.sh` |

To get the host ID from an SSH connection, SSH into the host:

```bash
ssh 3.ent-abcde3clusterID-production-qwerty8@ssh.us-4.platform.sh
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash

 Welcome to Upsun Fixed.

 This is environment production-qwerty8 of project abcde3clusterID.

abcde3clusterID@i-04d1ac8319f6ab9a6:~$
```

The relevant string for the host ID is shown after the `@` and before the 7-character string at the end (`f6ab9a6`).
In this example, the ID is: `i-04d1ac8319`.
You can then match this ID with the one under **Metrics** for your investigations.

###### Multiple clusters

Standard Dedicated Gen 2 environments have a single cluster of three hosts,
where each additional cluster adds at least three additional hosts to the project.
Dedicated Gen 2 environments with two clusters display metrics in two separate groups:
one for the web hosts that handle web requests and one for the service hosts that handle database, cache, and other services.

![Metrics split into Web hosts and Service hosts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-multiple-clusters.png "0.75")

###### Example of how to read metrics

This example should give you an idea of how the metrics appear.
Dedicated Gen 2 environments metrics show the resource usage per host within the cluster.

This reference project has a single PHP application and three services: MySQL, Redis, and Solr.

The metrics below are for a single Production environment.

Once you've read the metrics, see [recommendations for action](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/metrics.md#dedicated-gen-2-environments).

![All of the metrics available for a Dedicated Gen 2 environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-how-to-read-metrics.png)

####### CPU

The project has 2 virtual CPUs allocated per host, as seen in the upper limit for the CPU metric.

![A closeup of the CPU metrics](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-CPU.png)

####### RAM

RAM measures overall RAM usage, displaying the percentage of the RAM available for each host.

For this example, each host has been granted 30.69 GB of memory. 9.3% of that memory has been used.

![A closeup of the RAM metrics](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-RAM.png)

####### Disk

Disk represents the plan space for all services and mounts,
which for Dedicated Gen 2 production environments is [50 GB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md).

This example has the following persistent disk space configured:

* App: 14.68 GB for the mount `exports`
* MySQL: 9.78 GB
* Root (`/`) folder: 58.88 GB

![All of the metrics for disks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-disks.png)

For each host, you first see metrics for the root (`/`) folder.
Utilizing this folder doesn't count against the space set aside for your plan:
it's infrastructure disk, including the `/tmp` directory.
It's included in the metrics so you can keep track of build artifacts you write to `/tmp`
and make sure that they don't get too large and fill up.

Next to this space comes the other defined directories: for the MySQL service and the `exports` mount.

![A closeup of the metrics for the MySQL service disk](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/DG2-mysql-disk.png "0.4")
#### Monitor Grid metrics

Grid environments consist of:

* App containers: one or more [app containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md)
* Service containers: zero or more [service containers](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)
* Worker containers: zero or more [worker instances](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers).

Infrastructure metrics report CPU, RAM, and disk space for app and worker containers
and CPU and disk space for service containers. These metrics are available for all of your Grid environments.

You can see summaries of the metrics for each container separately in the Console under **Services** for a given environment. The full details are available under **Metrics**.

App containers are shown first, with the app name and an image corresponding to the app type.
Service containers follow next with the same pattern and worker containers are shown last.

You can collapse the graphs by clicking **Hide metrics**.
The graphs switch to an overview of the average resource utilization for the selected container.

![How service container metrics look when minimized](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/grid-postgresql-hidden.png "0.65")

###### Start metrics collection

To start collecting metrics on Grid environments, you need to redeploy the environment.
If a redeploy is required for the specific environment, you see a note in the Console:

![Screenshot showing the text "Your metrics are almost here" and a prompt to redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/metrics-redeploy-prompt.png "0.3")

###### Example of how to read metrics

This example should give you an idea of how the metrics appear.
Grid environment metrics show resource usage for each app, service, and worker container.

Note that resources are spread across all containers within the project.
So the resources you see for a given container don't equal the total resources for the project.

This reference project has a single app, two services (PostgreSQL and Redis), and two workers.
The plan size for this project is [Medium](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).
The appropriate resources have been [allocated automatically](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#sizes) for each container
based on the number and type of containers for this plan size.
The graphs show the current average usage in relation to the allocated resources.

Once you've read the metrics, see [recommendations for action](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/metrics.md#grid-environments).

####### App container

Metrics graphs for the app container show CPU, RAM, and disk allocation and usage.
The persistent disk has been configured in the [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#top-level-properties)
at 9.57 GB, while the temporary disk is 7.99 GB.

![All of the metrics for the app container](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/grid-appcontainer.png)

By default, the graphs include all instances and an average over the instances.
To select metrics for specific instances, click **Filter**.

![Clicking Filter reveals a list of instances you can filter](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/filtering-gen3.png "0.4")

####### Service containers

Metrics graphs for the cache service container show CPU, RAM and disk allocation and usage.
The temporary disk is 7.99 GB.

![All of the metrics for the Redis container](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/grid-services.png)

######## PostgreSQL

Metrics graphs for the PostgreSQL service container show CPU, RAM, disk allocation and usage.
The persistent disk has been configured in the [services configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)
as 2.81GB,
while the temporary disk is 7.99 GB.

![All of the metrics for the PostgreSQL container](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/grid-postgresql-full.png)

####### Worker containers

Metrics graphs for the worker container show CPU, RAM, and disk allocation and usage.
The persistent disk has been configured in the [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#top-level-properties)
at 9.51 GB, while the temporary disk is 7.99 GB.

![All of the metrics for the worker container](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/grid-workers.png)

###### Set up Blackfire

####### On a Grid infrastructure

If you're using a plan with the [Observability Suite](https://upsun.com/product/),
the [Blackfire automated integration](#automated-integration) is enabled on your environments by default.
Note that as an Observability Suite user, you can only access your Blackfire environments
after you've been granted access to the related Upsun Fixed project.
Therefore, to access your Blackfire environments, make sure you log in using your Upsun account.

If you have Grid environments without the Observability suite,
you need to enable the integration yourself.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a [Blackfire account](https://blackfire.io/signup?target=/login), preferably using your Upsun Fixed login.
2. In your Blackfire account, create an organization.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire independently, your organization is automatically activated.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire through Upsun Fixed,
   [ask **Upsun Fixed** Support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open) to activate your organization.
3. In your organization, create an environment.
4. In your environment, click **Settings/Environment Credentials**.
5. Retrieve your Blackfire server ID and server token.
6. Follow [the instructions from the Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/platformsh).

If you're using the [Managed Fastly CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md),
it's already configured to operate with Blackfire.
If you're using a different [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md),
make sure you [configure it](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/proxies/index)
to let Blackfire profile the code running on your servers.

####### On Dedicated Gen 2 infrastructure

To install Blackfire on your Dedicated Gen 2 environments:

1. Create a [Blackfire account](https://blackfire.io/signup?target=/login), preferably using your Upsun Fixed login.
2. In your Blackfire account, create an organization.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire independently, your organization is automatically activated.
   If you subscribed to Blackfire through Upsun Fixed,
   [ask **Upsun Fixed** Support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open) to activate your organization.
3. In your organization, create an environment.
4. In your environment, click **Settings/Environment Credentials**.
5. Retrieve your Blackfire server ID and server token.
6. Send those credentials to [Support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open) so they complete the installation.

If you're using the [Managed Fastly CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md),
it's already configured to operate with Blackfire.
If you're using a different [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md),
make sure you [configure it](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/proxies/index)
to let Blackfire profile the code running on your servers.

####### Automated integration

  **Observability Suite**

  This feature is available as part of the [Observability Suite](https://upsun.com/product/).
To add the Observability Suite to your project and take advantage of this feature,
[contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

The Blackfire automated integration is available for Grid.

When you create a new environment,
it automatically triggers the creation of a Blackfire environment with the same settings.
On this Blackfire environment, you have access to [all the features provided by Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/features/).
This includes monitoring, profiling, alerting, and build-related features.

When a Blackfire environment is created based on a Grid environment,
user access settings are replicated from the Upsun Fixed Console to Blackfire.

This includes all [access levels](https://blackfire.io/docs/up-and-running/access-management).

To access the Blackfire environment, each project user needs a Blackfire account.
When a project user doesn't already have a Blackfire account,
a new one is automatically created using the user's Upsun Fixed credentials.

You might have Blackfire variables already set on your project.
In this case, the existing variables override the settings of the automated integration.

Note that to trigger the synchronization of changes to users and their access levels,
you need to redeploy the environment.

###### Get started with Blackfire Monitoring

Once Blackfire is [set up on your infrastructure](#set-up-blackfire),
to start monitoring your environment follow these steps:

####### 1. Activate Blackfire Monitoring

If you want to monitor a PHP or Python app, Blackfire Monitoring is available by default on your environments.
You only need to [specify which environments](#2-enable-blackfire-monitoring-on-your-environments) you want to monitor.

You can override the default behavior and deactivate Blackfire Monitoring by setting a `env:BLACKFIRE_APM_ENABLED`
[environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md#create-environment-specific-variables) with a value of `0`.

To do so, create the following :

```bash
platform variable:create --level environment --prefix env: --name BLACKFIRE_APM_ENABLED --value 0
```

####### 2. Enable Blackfire Monitoring on your environments

To enable Blackfire Monitoring on your environments, follow these steps:

1.  Go to your [organizations list](https://blackfire.io/my/organizations)
    and select the organization where you want to enable Blackfire monitoring.

2.  Click **Organization Monitoring Usage**.

    ![A screenshot of where to find Organization Monitoring Usage](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/integrations/blackfire/blackfire-organization-monitoring.png "0.40")

3.  In the **Monitoring Activation** section,
    enable monitoring on the environments of your choice.

    ![A screenshot of what's seen in Monitoring Activation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/integrations/blackfire/blackfire-monitoring-activation.png "0.40")

For more information on Blackfire monitoring features,
see the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/monitoring-cookbooks/index).

###### Blackfire Profiling

While your code is running, the Blackfire profiler collects deep performance metrics
and provides full details and context of your code's behavior.
This helps you find the root cause of performance bottlenecks.

Blackfire lets you profile your application anywhere it's deployed,
including on your local development machines.
Using a browser extension or CLI command,
you can profile HTTP requests, CLI scripts, Consumers, and Daemons.

For more information on Blackfire profiling features,
see the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/profiling-cookbooks/index).

###### Test the performance of each new deployment

Blackfire's native integration with Upsun Fixed enables you to test your app's performance
every time you deploy a branch in production, staging, or development.
Follow these steps:

1.  Set up the [Blackfire Builds integration](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/paas/platformsh#builds-level-production).

2.  Optional: set up an [integration with your Git provider](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/git/index)
    and get commit status updates from build reports.

3.  To test business-critical use cases, [write scenarios](https://blackfire.io/docs/builds-cookbooks/scenarios).

###### Troubleshooting

####### Bypass your reverse proxy, load balancer or CDN

To use [Blackfire profiling](#blackfire-profiling),
you need to bypass any reverse proxy, load balancer or [CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md) that sits in front of your app.
See [how to configure a bypass](https://blackfire.io/docs/reference-guide/reverse-proxies#documentation).

####### Configure your HTTP cache

To take advantage of Blackfire features while using the HTTP cache with cookies,
allow the `__blackfire` cookie to go through the cache.

To do so, add [a configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md#allowing-only-specific-cookies) similar to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
cache:
  enabled: true
  cookies: ["/SESS.*/", "__blackfire"]
```

###### Get support

If you're experiencing issues with Blackfire and [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) information doesn't help, follow these steps:

1. Retrieve [startup errors](#1-retrieve-startup-errors).
2. Retrieve your [Blackfire logs](#2-retrieve-your-blackfire-logs).
3. Send this data to [Blackfire Support](https://support.blackfire.io).

####### 1. Retrieve startup errors

To retrieve startup errors, run the following command:

```bash
platform ssh -- php -d display_startup_errors=on --ri blackfire
```

####### 2. Retrieve your Blackfire logs

To retrieve your Blackfire logs, follow these steps:

1.  On the environment where you're facing issues, create the following [variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.md):

    ```bash
    platform variable:create php:blackfire.log_file --value /tmp/blackfire.log
    ```

2.  To set the verbosity of the logs to level 4 (debug level), create the following variable:

    ```bash
    platform variable:create php:blackfire.log_level --value 4
    ```

3.  Start a profile or build.

4.  To display the logs, run the following command:

    ```bash
    platform ssh -- cat /tmp/blackfire.log > blackfire.log
    ```

After you've retrieved the logs, you can disable them.
To do so, run the following commands:

```bash
platform variable:delete php:blackfire.log_file
platform variable:delete php:blackfire.log_level
```
#### New Relic

Upsun Fixed supports [New Relic application performance monitoring](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring).

On a Dedicated Gen 2 cluster
Open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) and let us know what your license key is.
Our support team will install it and let you know when it’s complete.
On a Grid plan
On Grid plans, you can configure your project.

The configuration for New Relic varies a bit by language.
See language-specific instructions:

- [Java](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/new-relic/java.md)
- [Node.js](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/new-relic/nodejs.md)
- [PHP](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/new-relic/php.md)

For more languages, see the [New Relic Documentation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability?search=agents&category=application-monitoring).
Install the specific agent in the [build hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks.md).
#### Tideways

Upsun Fixed supports [Tideways APM](https://tideways.com/) for PHP. This functionality is only available on PHP 7.0 and later.

**Note**: 

The Tideways upstream is available as a plugin on Upsun Fixed:

 - [tideways](https://tideways.com): The bundle proprietary full version of the product and plugins, which the rest of the guide is mostly aimed to cover.

###### Get Started

####### 1. Get your license key

Sign up at [Tideways](https://app.tideways.io/register/) and get your license key.

####### 2. Add your license key

Add your Tideways license key as a project level variable:

```bash
platform variable:create --visible-build false php:tideways.api_key --value ''
```

####### 3. Enable the Tideways extension

Enable the Tideways extension in your `.platform.app.yaml` as follows:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
runtime:
  extensions:
    - tideways
```

Enabling the extension also activates the Tideways background process.

Push the changes to your Upsun Fixed environment to enable Tideways as follows:

```bash
git add .platform.app.yaml
git commit -m "Enable Tideways."
git push
```

Tideways should now be enabled.
Give it a few hours to a day to get a decent set of data before checking your Tideways dashboard.

###### Deployment Integration

Tideways integrates with Upsun Fixed deployment hooks and provides performance comparisons
before and after deployments were released. You can find the Upsun Fixed CLI command to register
this hook for your application in Tideways "Application Settings" screen under the section
"Exports & Integrations". Here is an example:

```bash
platform integration:add --type=webhook
```
### Consume logs
#### Access your logs

###### Activity logs

Changes to your environments, such as deployments, cron jobs, and code or variable updates,
are each logged as activities.
You can access the logs either in the Console or using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/_index.md):

 - Get a list of activities by running

```bash {}
platform activity:list -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

Pass the ``--start`` flag to get activities from a specific date in the past.

 - To see details about the activity’s state and timing, run

```bash {}
platform activity:get <ACTIVITY_ID>
```

Where <ACTIVITY_ID> comes from the list in step 1.

 - Get a log of any given activity by running

```bash {}
platform activity:log <ACTIVITY_ID>
```

If a running activity is stuck, you can [cancel the activity](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/cancel-activity.md).

####### Sharing activity logs

When trying to identify and resolve failures, it can often help to have another person's perspective.
Troubleshoot collaboratively by sharing the logs of specific activities.

To share a log, open the log and click Share **Copy URL**.

Share specific lines in the log on clicking the line number.
To select multiple lines, hold Shift.
After selecting multiple lines,
hovering on the next unselected line gives you the amount of time that passed between the selected lines.

![An activity log with multiple lines selected showing the duration of part of the activity](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/activity-lines.png "0.5")

###### Container logs

Events that occur within an app container are logged within that container.
The logs can be written to, but you should do so only with standard logging mechanisms.
If your app has its own logging mechanism, use it to write to a dedicated logs [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts).

To access the logs of various types of events:

To get other logs, just replace ``access`` with the [type of log](#types-of-container-logs).
To view more lines, use the ``--lines`` flag.

 - Access the container by running

```bash {}
platform ssh -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

 - Change to the right directory by running ``cd /var/log``.

If you’re on a Dedicated Gen 2 cluster, run

```bash {}
cd /var/log/platform/<APP_NAME>/
```

 - Read the desired log, such as by running ``tail access.log``.

All log files are trimmed to 100 MB automatically.
If you need larger logs, set up a [cron job](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons) to upload them to third-party storage.
See an example of [uploading logs to Amazon S3](https://gitlab.com/contextualcode/platformsh-store-logs-at-s3) from Contextual Code.

####### Types of container logs

| Type          | Always present | Description |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `access`      | Yes            | The raw access log for the nginx instance running on the container. It doesn't include requests that are redirected or cached by the [router](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md). |
| `app`         | Yes            | All log messages generated by the app including language errors and exceptions. |
| `cron`        | No             | The output of cron jobs. Only exists after a cron job has run. |
| `deploy`      | No             | The output of the [`deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#deploy-hook). Only exists after a `deploy` hook has run. |
| `dns`         | Yes            | All DNS queries made by processes in the container (such as the app and cron jobs). |
| `error`       | Yes            | nginx-level errors that occur once nginx has fully started such as HTTP errors for missing directories and excluded file types. |
| `nginx/error` | No             | All nginx startup log messages. Only useful when debugging possible nginx configuration errors. Not currently available using the `platform log` command. |
| `php.access`  | No             | A record of all requests to the PHP service. See [PHP access record format](#php-access-record-format). |
| `post-deploy` | No             | The output of the [`post_deploy` hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#post-deploy-hook). Only exists after a `post_deploy` hook has run. |
| `syslog`      | Yes            | General system-wide logs.          |     

######## PHP access record format

The formatting of `php.access.log` is determined by the PHP settings.
To determine the format, run the following:

```bash
platform ssh cat -n /etc/php/<PHP_VERSION>-zts/fpm/php-fpm.conf | grep "access.format"
```

You get a response such as the following:

```bash
Connection to ssh.eu.platform.sh closed.
access.format = "%{%FT%TZ}t %m %s %{mili}d ms %{kilo}M kB %C%% %{REQUEST_URI}e"
```

See what [each value in this string means](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php#access-format).

###### Timezones

UTC is the default timezone for all logs.
#### Forward Upsun Fixed and Blackfire logs

You might use a service to analyze logs from various parts of your fleet.
You might want to consolidate all your logs in one place that everyone has access to
without needing to grant them access to each project individually.

In such cases, forward your logs from Upsun Fixed and Blackfire to a third-party service.
You can use a [service with an integration](#use-a-log-forwarding-integration)
or any service that supports a [syslog endpoint](#forward-to-a-syslog-endpoint) or [HTTP endpoint](#forward-to-an-http-endpoint).

Log forwarding is available for Grid projects.
For Dedicated Gen 2 projects, see how to [log remotely with ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md#remote-logging).
To enable log forwarding in a project, you need to be a [project admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com../../administration/users.md).
You also need your project to have the capability for log forwarding.
To get a price quote, [contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

####### Which logs are forwarded?
When log forwarding is enabled, Upsun Fixed forwards logs sent to journald.  

By default, Upsun Fixed sends the following logs to journald: 
- `stdout` and `stderr` logs from your application
   Note: You can configure your application to use syslog to send these (or additional) messages to journald.
- MariaDB/MySQL slow query logs 
- Redis logs (all except command-level operations and low-level internals)

Logs in files are not forwarded to journald.

###### Use a log forwarding integration

Certain services have a specific integration for forwarding logs.
If your third-party service isn't supported, you can forward to a [syslog endpoint](#forward-to-a-syslog-endpoint).

####### Integrated third-party services

Integrations exist for the following third-party services to enable log forwarding:

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)
- [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/)

####### Enable a log forwarding integration

######## Using the CLI

To enable log forwarding for a specific project using the [Upsun CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md),
follow the steps for your selected service.

View your logs in the **Logs** dashboard.

 - In Splunk, get an Event Collector token on [Splunk Platform](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token_on_Splunk_Cloud_Platform)
or [Splunk Enterprise](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token_on_Splunk_Enterprise).

 - Determine your host, which is the Splunk instance that’s collecting data.

 - Choose an index name.

 - Create the integration with the following command:

```bash {}
platform integration:add --type splunk --url https://http-inputs.<HOST>.splunkcloud.com/services/collector/event --index <INDEX> --token <TOKEN>
```

View your logs in the **Apps->Search & Reporting** dashboard.
Filter by the index name to find the relevant events.

 - In Sumo Logic, [configure an HTTP source](https://www.sumologic.com/help/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/#configure-an-httplogs-and-metrics-source).
Make sure to copy the Source Category and collector URL.

 - Create the integration with the following command:

```bash {}
platform integration:add --type sumologic --url <COLLECTOR_URL> --category <SOURCE_CATEGORY>
```

View your logs in the **Log Search** tab.

To start forwarding logs, [trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

######## In the Console

To enable log forwarding for a specific project from the Console,
follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project.
2. Click Settings **Settings**.
3. Click **Integrations**.
4. Click **Add Integration**.
5. Select the integration you want to enable.
6. In the **Configure your integration** window,
   specify your configuration options.
7. Click **Add Integration**.
   The new integration overview is displayed,
   and you can view your logs in the **Activity** section.

###### Forward to a syslog endpoint

Syslog is a standard protocol for transferring log messages.
Many third-party services offer endpoints for ingesting syslog events.
You can forward your Upsun Fixed and Blackfire logs to any of those endpoints.

``type``, ``syslog-host``, and ``syslog-port`` are the only properties required for all endpoints.
The following table shows the other available properties:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| ``auth-token`` | ``string`` |  | The token to authenticate with the given service. |
| ``auth-mode`` | ``string`` | ``prefix`` | The mode for authentication with the given service. Can be ``prefix`` or ``structured_data``. Defaults to ``prefix``. |
| ``facility`` | ``string`` | ``1`` (user) | A [syslog facility code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility) to attach with each log to identify the source. Can be a number from 0 to 23. |
| ``message-format`` | ``string`` | ``rfc5424`` | The standard to use for the message format. Can be ``rfc5424`` or ``rfc3164``. |
| ``protocol`` | ``string`` | ``tls`` | The network protocol to use in the connection. Can be one of ``tls``, ``tcp``, or ``udp``. Defaults to ``tls``. |
| ``verify-tls`` | ``boolean`` | ``true`` | Whether to verify Transport Layer Security (TLS) certification when using the TLS protocol. |
To include a property, add it as a flag, for example ``--protocol tcp``.
This should let you connect to any service that has syslog endpoints.
To start forwarding logs, once you’ve added the service [trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).
To enable log forwarding to a syslog endpoint for a specific project using the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md),
follow these steps:

 - Navigate to your project.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Integrations**.
 - Click **Add Integration**.
 - Select the syslog integration.
 - In the **Configure your integration** window,
specify your configuration options.
 - Click **Add Integration**.
The new integration overview is displayed,
and you can view your logs in the **Activity** section.

###### Forward to an HTTP endpoint

Some third-party services, such as [Elasticsearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/elasticsearch.md) and [OpenSearch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/opensearch.md),
support ingesting log messages through an HTTP endpoint.
You can use HTTP forwarding to forward Upsun Fixed and Blackfire logs to such third-party services.

HTTP forwarding makes a `POST` HTTP request with an `application/json` body while forwarding the log messages to the endpoint.

As an example, to forward logs to Elasticsearch using HTTP log forwarding, run the following command:

```
platform integration:add --type httplog --url "https://<ELASTICSEARCH_URL>/<INDEX_NAME>/_doc" --header "Authorization: Basic " --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

`type` and `url` are the only properties required for all endpoints.
Optionally, you can use the `headers` property to pass additional headers in the HTTP requests.

Note that if your endpoint URL includes a `PORT`, that can also be included in the `--url` flag:

```
platform integration:add --type httplog --url "https://<ELASTICSEARCH_URL>:<PORT>/<INDEX_NAME>/_doc" --header "Authorization: Basic " --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Once you've [added the service](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md),
to start forwarding logs [trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

###### Log levels

Your app may output logs with distinct severity levels.
But as Upsun Fixed only reads logs from `stdout`,
this distinction is lost and everything gets logged at `INFO` level.

To preserve the original log level, use a language-specific syslog module/package for logging.

The following example code snippets show how logs can be written to Syslog:

Using the logging module:

```python {}
import logging
import logging.handlers

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
handler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address="/dev/log")
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.info("Operation started")
logger.error("Operation failed")
```

Using the Syslog module:

```python {}
import syslog

syslog.openlog(logoption=syslog.LOG_PID, facility=syslog.LOG_LOCAL0)
syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_INFO, "Operation started")
syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, "Operation failed")
syslog.closelog()
```

Using the log package:

```go {}
package main

import (
	"log"
	"log/syslog"
)

func main() {
	logger, err := syslog.NewLogger(syslog.LOG_LOCAL0|syslog.LOG_INFO, log.LstdFlags)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	logger.Println("Operation started...")
	logger.Fatalln("Operation failed")
}
```

Using the Syslog package:

```go {}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"log/syslog"
)

func main() {
	syslogWriter, err := syslog.Dial("", "", syslog.LOG_LOCAL0|syslog.LOG_INFO, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer syslogWriter.Close()

	fmt.Fprintf(syslogWriter, "Operation has started")
	syslogWriter.Err("Operation failed")
}
```

#### Forward your Fastly CDN logs

When you use a Fastly Content delivery network (CDN),
[forwarding your CDN logs](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/about-fastlys-realtime-log-streaming-features) to a third-party service
can help you diagnose caching issues,
and therefore improve your site's overall performance.

To enable log forwarding on your Fastly CDN,
follow these directions:

- If you've subscribed to [Fastly through Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md),
  [contact Support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open).

- If you've subscribed to Fastly independently,
  see the official [Fastly documentation](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/logging/).

### Back up an environment

When you're making changes to your apps,
you want to be sure those changes only improve things and don't make you lose any data.
You also want to have a disaster recovery plan in place.
Backups help you protect yourself against potential data loss.

You might want to create backups of your live environment before merging a different environment into it
or each time you increase the storage space of your services.

You also have regularly scheduled automated backups of your production environments to cover most cases.

You can only create backups and restore active environments.
To work with an [inactive environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#inactive-environment), first activate it.

##### How backup and restore works

1. As an [admin user](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md), you can do a backup of your environment.
   This backup includes the complete data and code of the environment.
   All persistent data from all running [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)
   and any files stored on [mounts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) are included.
   The backup is stored internally on Upsun Fixed.
   That is, the backup can be applied to environments on Upsun Fixed, but it can't be downloaded.
   If you need to download backups, instead [export your mount and service data](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/exporting.md).

2. You restore your environment using the backup.
   At this point, the data and code from the backup are restored to ensure a consistent state.
   The latest code in your repository may have been modified such that it no longer works correctly with the old, restored data.

   **Warning**: 

Upsun Fixed does not modify your Git repository. Any further changes you make use the latest code in your repository.

3. Depending on your needs, you can do the following:

   a) To use the code from the time of the backup as a baseline for future changes,
      make sure you restore it yourself in your Git repository.
      To do so, use Git commands such as `revert`.

   b) To use your latest code instead, just redeploy your environment or push a new change.

##### Backups and downtime

By default, creating a manual backup causes a momentary pause in site availability so that all requests can complete.
This means the environment is backed up in a known consistent state.
The total interruption is usually only 15 to 30 seconds.
Any requests during that time are held temporarily, not dropped.

To avoid this downtime, use [live backups](#live-backups).

For consistent backups, create the backups during non-peak hours for your site.

##### Retention

For information on how long backups are retained, see the [data retention policy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/security/data-retention.md).

##### Backup schedule

Backups for Dedicated environments have a [specific frequency](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/environment-differences.md#backups).

On Grid environments, preview environments can have up to 2 [manual backups](#create-a-manual-backup).
The number of available backups for Production environments depends on your schedule.

| Schedule | Manual backups | Automated backups                                                      |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic    | 2              | 2 daily backups (1 backup for each of the last 2 days) |
| Advanced | 4              | 21 backups: - 6 daily backups (1 backup for each of the last 6 days)  - 3 weekly backups (1 backup for each of the last 3 weeks) - 12 monthly backups (1 backup for each of the last 12 months) |
| Premium  | 4              | 44 backups: - 3 backups for the last 24 hours - 30 daily backups (1 backup for each of the last 30 days) - 11 monthly backups (1 backup for each of the last 11 months) |

Note that [backup retention](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/security/data-retention.md#grid-backups) also depends on your schedule.

The schedules available to you depend on your [tier](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).

| Tier             | Default schedule | Possible upgrade |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Professional     | Basic            | Advanced         |
| Enterprise/Elite | Advanced         | Premium          |

An upgrade comes at an additional cost.
The exact cost depends on the size of your storage.

###### Change your backup schedule

To upgrade to the higher schedule, follow these steps:

1. In the [Console](https://console.upsun.com/), navigate to the project where you want to change the schedule.
2. Click **Settings Settings**.
3. Click **Edit plan**.
4. For **Backups**, click the name of your current schedule.
   If clicking has no effect, you are already on the highest available schedule.
5. Select the target schedule.
6. Click **Save**.

To downgrade to the lower schedule, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### Use automated backups

For Dedicated environments, see more about [backups of Dedicated environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/environment-differences.md#backups).

For Grid environments, automated backups are taken for production environments at least once every day.
The exact number of backups depends on your [backup schedule](#backup-schedule).

Daily backups are taken at around 4:00 every day based on the [project timezone](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/projects/change-project-timezone.md).
The time for 6-hourly backups is based on the daily backup.

Automated backups are always [live](#live-backups).

**Note**: 

Automated backups are only available for production environments.

If you’re on a [development plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#development-plans),
all your environments are [development environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#environment-type).
This includes your future production environment.
If you want to enable automated backups for it, [upgrade to a non-development plan](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/).

##### Live backups

You can create backups without any downtime.
This means your environment is running and open to connections during the backup.

Because the connections may come in during backup creation, live backups may have data inconsistencies among containers.
They may make restorations less reliable.
To avoid such issues, schedule [manual backups](#create-a-manual-backup) during non-peak hours,
when the short amount of downtime is least noticed.

Automated backups are always live, including those taken on [Dedicated Gen 2](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md) environments.

You can create a manual live backup on a Grid project:

When [creating the backup](#create-a-manual-backup), select **Run live backup** in the last step.

##### Create a manual backup

You can create a manual backup using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or in the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

 - Navigate to the environment you want to back up.
 - Click **Backups**.
 - Click  **Backup**.
 - Click **Backup**.

###### Automate manual backups

You can also automate the process of creating manual backups through [cron jobs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).
The cron job uses the CLI command to back up the environment.
It requires you to [set up the CLI on the environment with an API token](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/api-tokens.md#authenticate-in-an-environment).

Although this process is automated,
backups created in this way count as manual for the [backup schedule](#backup-schedule).
They don't affect the automated backups taken as part of the schedule.

##### Physical storage location

Backups are stored as binary large objects separate from your environments.
This storage is replicated over multiple data centers in different locations
[within the region your project is hosted in](https://upsun.com/trust-center/security/data-security/).
This means that in the rare event a data center becomes unavailable, your backups are still available.
### Restore an environment from a backup

Once you have [backups of your environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md), you can restore data from a previous point.

To restore an environment, you need an [Admin role for that environment type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md).

##### 1. List available backups

To restore an environment, first select one of the available backups:

You get a response similar to the following:

```bash {}
Backups on the project My Project (1234567abcdef), environment main (type: production):
+---------------------------+----------------------------+------------+
| Created                   | Backup ID                  | Restorable |
+---------------------------+----------------------------+------------+
| 2022-08-15T09:48:58+01:00 | 5ouvtgo4v75axijww7sqnftste | true       |
| 2022-07-09T14:17:17+01:00 | 7jks7dru5xpx5p5id5wtypur2y | true       |
| 2022-06-22T18:33:29+01:00 | f3jbyxlhtmalco67fmfoxs7n4m | true       |
+---------------------------+----------------------------+------------+
```

Select one of the backups marked as **Restorable** and copy its **Backup ID**.

 - Navigate to the environment where you want to see backups.
 - Click **Backups**.

Select one of the backups marked as having completed successfully .

##### 2. Restore from a backup

To restore the backup you've selected, follow these steps:

 - Press ``enter`` to agree with the consequences and continue.

 - Next to the backup you’ve selected, click **More** More.
 - Click **Restore**.
 - Read through the consequences and click **Yes, Restore**.

The data is restored and your backed-up environment is deployed.
This deployment uses the built app, including variables, from when the backup was taken.

**Warning**: 

The code is also initially restored, but Upsun Fixed doesn’t modify your Git repository.
So any future (re)deployments use the current Git repository to build the environment.

To restore your code to its previous state when the backup was taken,
use Git commands such as [revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert).
See [how backup and restore works on Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md#how-backup-and-restore-works).

##### Restore to a different environment

You can restore backups to a different environment than they were created on using the CLI:

1. Switch to the branch where the backup was created.
2. To restore your backup to an existing environment, run the following command:

   ```bash
   platform backup:restore --target=<TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_NAME> <BACKUP_ID>
   ```

   If your target environment doesn't exist yet, you can create it by [branching an existing environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#branch).
   The new target environment will be an exact copy of the existing (parent) environment.

   To do so, use the `--branch-from` option to specify the parent of your new target environment:

   ```bash
   platform backup:restore --target=<TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --branch-from=<PARENT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME> <BACKUP_ID>
   ```
### Cancel an activity

If you have a stuck activity or you pushed a change you know doesn't work,
you can cancel a running or pending activity on an environment.
This works for activities such as builds, cron jobs, and source operations.

You can cancel activities using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md)
or in the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

If you have more than one running or pending activity, choose which activity to cancel.
You can also cancel a specific activity by specifying its ID:

```bash {}
platform activity:cancel <ACTIVITY_ID>
```

Get the ID from the [activity log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#activity-logs).

 - Open the environment where you want to cancel an activity.
 - In the [activity log](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#activity-logs),
click More **More** next to the activity you want to cancel.
 - Click **Cancel**.

##### Non-cancellable activities

An activity can finish in between when you load the Console and when you click **Cancel**.
For example, when the activity is a [source operation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/source-operations.md)
and the related build hook has already completed.
In such cases, you get a message that the activity can't be cancelled.
### Change an environment's parent

All environments default to having another environment as their parent.
If you [branched](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#branch) the environment from another,
its parent starts as the environment it was created from.
If you pushed a branch through Git or a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
the parent defaults to the default environment.

To change the environment's parent, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:info -e <CHILD_ENVIRONMENT_NAME> parent <PARENT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

So if you have the environment ``new-feature`` and want to change its parent to ``main``, run the following:

```bash {}
platform environment:info -e new-feature parent main
```

If you're not using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
you can also set a parent for your environment when pushing changes to it.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
git push -o "environment.parent=<PARENT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>"
```

Learn more about how to [trigger actions on `push`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments.md#push-options).
### Configure HTTP access control

When developing your site, you might want to hide your preview environments from outside viewers.
Or you may find you have performance issues from [excessive bot access](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/16439634723858).
You can control access with a username and password **or** by allowing/denying specific IP addresses or networks.
This setting applies to the entire environment.

The settings for a specific environment are inherited by all of its children.
So if you have a `staging` environment and you [branch environments from it](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#branch),
all of the environments branched from it inherit the same authentication information.

Changing access control triggers a new deploy of the current environment.
The changes don't propagate to child environments until they're [redeployed manually](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

##### Use a username and password

You can set up one or more combinations of a username and password.
To add a username and password, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:http-access -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --auth <USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>
```

For example, to add the username ``name`` with the password ``12321`` to the ``test`` environment, run:

```bash {}
platform environment:http-access -e test --auth name:12321
```

##### Filter IP addresses

Alternatively, you can control access to environments by allowing or denying specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses.
The addresses should be in the [CIDR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).
Both`4.5.6.7` and `4.5.6.0/8` are accepted formats.

Note that `allow` entries should come before `deny` entries in case they both match.

For example, the following configuration allows only the IP `198.51.100.0` to access your website.

```txt
198.51.100.0 allow
0.0.0.0/0 deny
```

**Pick your authentication method**: 

When you set up IP filtering authentication,
make sure no [username and password are defined](#use-a-username-and-password) for your environment.

Otherwise, your environment will remain accessible through the defined username and password combination,
regardless of your IP filtering settings.

To control access based on IP address, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:http-access -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --access allow:<IPS_TO_ALLOW> --access deny:<IPS_TO_DENY>
```

### Deactivate an environment

If you have environments you aren't using, you may want to deactivate them to save resources for what you need.
To deactivate an environment, you need to be an admin for the project or the given environment.

**Note**: 

Your default environment is protected.
It can’t be deactivated through the Console or the CLI.
To change which environment is the default, see how to [rename the default branch](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/default-environment.md).

Deactivating the project results in the following:

* The environment becomes [inactive](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#inactive-environment).
  Unless it's reactivated, it's no longer deployed and isn't accessible from the web or via SSH.
* All services running on this environment are deleted.
* All data specific to the environment is deleted.
  If the environment is reactivated, it syncs data from its parent environment.

##### Deactivate an environment

To deactivate an environment, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:deactivate <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

##### Delete the branch

Inactive environments still have branches in Git.
To delete the branch entirely, run the following command:

```bash
git push origin --delete <BRANCH_NAME>
```

##### Reactivate an environment

Reactivating an environment [syncs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#sync) data from its parent environment.

To reactivate an inactive environment, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:activate <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

If you're not using a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
you can also activate an environment when pushing changes to it.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
git push -o "environment.status=active"
```

Learn more about how to [trigger actions on `push`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments.md#push-options).
### Rename the default environment

You can set the name of your default/production environment when creating a project.
To change it after project creation, follow the steps below.
For consistency, the steps are all given using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).

The examples below are based off of changing the default environment from `old` to `main`.
Replace these names with what suits your situation.

If your site is already live,
remember that deactivating an environment is a destructive operation that can result in data loss.
To minimize potential issues, take the following steps:

- Switch the default environment during non-peak hours.
- Keep your data by taking a [backup of the `old` environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md)
- Reduce your DNS time-to-live (TTL) to a minimum.

##### Requirements

If you have a domain set for your default environment, remove it before changing the default branch.
Otherwise you get an error that `default domain must be a valid project domain`.

To change the default branch, you need to be an [admin for the project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md)

##### Note on source integrations

The following steps depend of whether your project has a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md).

If it doesn't, Upsun Fixed is your primary remote repository for the project.
If it does, GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket hosts your primary remote repository for the project.

##### 1. Create a `main` environment

<div
>

            Without a source integration

            With a source integration

    In your local copy of your repository, create a new environment from ``old`` called ``main``:

```bash {}
platform environment:branch main old
```

In your local copy of the external repository, make sure your default branch is up to date:

```bash {}
git checkout old && git pull origin old
```

Then create the ``main`` branch off of your default branch and push it to the remote repository:

```bash {}
git checkout -b main
git push origin main
```

Source integrations include all branches, but don’t activate the corresponding environments in Upsun Fixed.
Activate the ``main`` environment by running the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:activate main
```

##### 2. Copy settings

If you have variables or other settings specific to your default environment, add those to the `main` environment.

For example, you may have variables for your production environment set to not be inheritable
(such as if you set them with `--inheritable=false` through the CLI).
These variables aren't added automatically to child environments and so you need to add them to the `main` environment manually.

If you want the `main` environment to send emails, [turn on outgoing email](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/email.md).

##### 3. Make `main` a top-level branch

To have `main` be your default, it needs to not be a child of `old`.
Use the following command to remove its parent and make it a top-level branch:

```bash
platform environment:info -e main parent -
```

##### 4. Make `main` the parent for other environments

<div
>

            Without a source integration

            With a source integration

    You probably have other environments that are children of ``old``.
For each environment, update its parent to ``main``:

```bash {}
platform environment:info -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> parent main
```

To preserve your data on Upsun Fixed,
it’s best to switch your work in progress to be based off of ``main``.
Close any open pull/merge requests and resubmit them against ``main``.
If you want to continue working on branches after switching the default branch,
rebase them by running ``git rebase --onto main <BRANCH_NAME>``.
Once you resubmit a request, it appears under the ``main`` environment on Upsun Fixed.

##### 5. Deactivate the `old` branch

To change your default branch, you first need to deactivate the existing default branch to remove protections.
Deactivate the `old` environment without deleting it by running the following CLI command:

```bash
platform environment:delete --no-delete-branch old
```
##### 6. Set `main` as the default branch

<div
>

            Without a source integration

            With a source integration

    Set the project’s default branch to ``main``:

```bash {}
platform project:info default_branch main
```

Once ``old`` has been deactivated, set the project’s default branch in Upsun Fixed to ``main``:

```bash {}
platform project:info default_branch main
```

Follow the instructions to change the default branch to ``main`` for your provider:

 - [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch)
 - [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/default.md#change-the-default-branch-name-for-a-project)
 - [BitBucket](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/How-to-change-MAIN-branch-in-BitBucket/qaq-p/977418)

##### 7. Update DNS records

Whether or not you're using a CDN,
if your site is live you have probably added an Upsun Fixed address somewhere when configuring a [custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
If you have a CDN, it's with the CDN provider.
If you don't have a CDN, it's probably a `CNAME` record.

In either case, the setting probably has the old environment name as part of it.
Update the setting to use the new environment name.

Verify that the new URL is correct by comparing it to the result from this command:

```bash
platform environment:info edge_hostname
```

##### 8. Optional: Delete the `old` environment

If you no longer want the `old` environment, such as to stop accidental use, delete it completely:

```bash
platform environment:delete --delete-branch old
```
### Scale your live site

Your production environment gets a [pool of resources](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#sizes)
based on your [plan size](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md).
These resources are split up between the apps and services you've defined.

You might occasionally get increased load on your site,
such as during a major product launch or a sales event like Black Friday.
This pressure might cause problems in your site or even bring it down.
At such times, you want your site to have enough resources to handle the additional load.

How your site handles the need to scale depends on your plan.
On higher tiers with the Observability Suite,
everything is taken care of automatically.
When your site starts experiencing pressure,
it gets the resources needed to handle that pressure.
On self-service tiers, you have to handle that yourself, often after your site has gone down.

If you know a spike in traffic is likely coming,
scale your plan up in advance to handle the event and downscale after it.
You're only charged for the time when the plan was higher.

##### Auto-scaling Dedicated environments

  **Observability Suite**

  This feature is available as part of the [Observability Suite](https://upsun.com/product/).
To add the Observability Suite to your project and take advantage of this feature,
[contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

If you have the Observability Suite on a Dedicated environment,
your site is monitored for traffic spikes.
If these spikes are causing application errors,
your site is automatically scaled up to the next largest size to handle the traffic.

The process is initiated and run automatically and a support ticket is opened.
The upscaling process is then monitored by the Upsun Fixed team.
The team determines whether the upscaling is working as intended and is necessary
or can be avoided by, for example, blocking a malicious bot.

Autoscaling uses HTTP, CPU, and memory metrics to scale your Dedicated clusters.
There are two classes of measurement that trigger an autoscaling event:

- HTTP error rate trigger: A daily error rate (`50x` requests/total requests) for the last 24 hours.
  This value is compared against 5 minute intervals of requests for the last hour of requests.
  As soon as two interval error rates in that hour are greater than the daily error rate,
  an autoscaling event is triggered.

- CPU load/request trigger: autoscaling occurs when CPU usage and traffic reaches a predefined threshold.

##### Managed scaling for Dedicated and Grid environments

  **Tier availability**
  This feature is available for
  **Enterprise and Elite** customers. [Compare the  tiers](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) on our pricing page, or [contact our sales team](https://upsun.com/contact-us/
  ) for more information.

If your plan includes managed scaling,
Upsun Fixed monitors your application to make ensure it doesn't fail due to a lack of resources.
If the monitoring determines that a lack of resources is causing issues for your site,
a support ticket is opened.
The Upsun Fixed team determines whether upscaling is necessary
or can be avoided by, for example, blocking a malicious bot.

If upscaling is necessary, it's handled for you and you're kept up to date in the support ticket.
When the traffic spike passes, your plan is downgraded again to use only the necessary resources.

On Dedicated environments, the upscaling is handled by cycling through each node in the redundant architecture.
One at a time, they're removed from the cluster, upsized, and returned.

On Split Architecture dedicated environments, additional web servers may be added to provide additional capacity (Horizontal scaling).

##### Manually scale Grid environments

To increase the pool of resources available to your project,
[upgrade your plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#switch-plans) and redeploy your site.
### Set an environment's visibility to search engines

When you have preview environments,
you don't want search engines indexing them and diluting the SEO of your production site.

Search engine indexers are told to ignore all preview environments.
When you're ready to go live, give your production environment a [custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md)
and then set it to be visible to search engines.

To change your production environment's visibility to search engines, follow these steps:

 - Select the project where you want to change visibility.
 - From the **Environment** menu, select your production environment.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - In the row with **Hide from search engines**, click **Edit **.
 - Select or clear the **Hide from search engines** checkbox.

Upsun Fixed can't guarantee that indexers follow the instructions.
If you're concerned about access, set up [HTTP access control](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/http-access-control.md).

##### How it's done

When the **Hide from search engines** is activated,
search engines are turned away from environments by including a `X-Robots-Tag` header:

```txt
X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow
```

That tells search engine indexers to not index these sites and not traverse links from these sites.
This helps keep non-Production sites out of search engine indexes.

It's automatically on for all `platform.site` domains, and it's automatically off for production environments with a custom domain.

##### Alternative method

You can also send instructions to search engine indexers using a `robots.txt` file.
Your app can serve this as a static file from its disk or as a dynamic response from its `passthru`.
Control either with the [`location` section of your app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).

If your `robots.txt` file includes instructions to ignore a page,
search engine indexers may ignore it even if you have configured Upsun Fixed to not send the header.

### Change a project's region

To host your project data, Upsun Fixed offers several [regions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md).
You specify a region when you create a project.

You can also change the project's region after it's created.

##### Why migrate between regions

- Different data centers are located in different geographic areas.
  You may want your site close to your users for improved performance.
- You may want to move to a region with a lower [environmental impact](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md#environmental-impact).

##### 1. Plan the migration

Before starting the migration process, you need to plan for it:

- Plan a time frame in which to handle the migration.
  Your code shouldn't change during this time to ensure all changes are copied to the new project.
  Prepare for a brief site outage when you migrate, just as with a relaunch of a site.
- Set your DNS Time-to-Live as low as possible.
  This ensures the switch to the new site propagates as quickly as possible.

##### 2. Create a new project

In the target region, [create a new project from scratch](
https://console.upsun.com/org/create-project/info?_utm_campaign=cta_deploy_marketplace_template&utm_source=public_documentation&_utm_medium=organic
).

If you plan to test for long, start with a Development plan and upsize it before switching the DNS.
Otherwise, use the desired plan size from the start.

##### 3. Add code and environments

Select your newly created blank project.

 - Push the code for your production branch:

```bash {}
platform push --target <PRODUCTION_BRANCH_NAME>
```

 - (Optional) Checkout other branches and then push their code:

```bash {}
platform push --activate --target <BRANCH_NAME> --parent <PRODUCTION_BRANCH_NAME>
```

For a [source integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md) with GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab,
add the integration to your new project.
Your new project then mirrors the configured repository automatically.

##### 4. Copy files

If you have files in a mount, first download them:

```bash
platform mount:download
```

Then upload them to your new project:

```bash
platform mount:upload
```

See more options on [how to export files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/exporting.md)
and [how to import files](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/tutorials/migrating.md#5-import-data).

##### 5. Copy data from services

For services with generated data such as Solr and Redis, you don't need to copy data directly.
Just rebuild the data in the new project.

To download data from persistent services such as databases,
see how to export and then import data for each service:

- [InfluxDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/influxdb.md#export-data)
- [MongoDB](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mongodb.md#exporting-data)
- [MariaDB/MySQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/mysql.md#exporting-data)
- [PostgreSQL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/postgresql.md#exporting-data)

##### 6. Migrate variables and project settings

Make sure anything else connected to your old project is moved to your new project:

- If you have project or environment variables defined on your old project, add them to your new project.
  Get a list of all variables set outside of code by running `platform variables`.
- Add any users to your new project that you want to continue to have access.
- Add any existing [integrations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations.md).

##### 7. Test the site

Verify that the new site is working as desired before continuing.
You can leave the two projects running for as long as you need.
After you have finished all your testing, sync all your data (code, files, database) for the last time.

##### 8. Switch to the new site

Now that you know the new project works, switch public traffic to that site:

1. Make sure your new project has the right plan size.
2. If possible, put your site into read-only mode or maintenance mode.
3. Add your domain names to your new project and remove them from the old project.
4. (Optional) Add any custom SSL certificates you have.
5. Update your DNS provider's records to point to the new site. See more on [setting custom domains](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).

It may take some time for the DNS change and SSL change to propagate.
Until it does, some browsers may not see the new site or may get an SSL mismatch error.
In most cases that resolves itself in 1--3 hours.

##### 9. Remove the old project

Once the new project is running and the DNS has fully propagated, delete the old project.

##### Alternative process

We have open-sourced [the Upsun Fixed cloning tool](https://github.com/upsun/clonsun), which allows you to clone a project from one region to another. This cloning tool helps you migrate most of your project assets from one region to another with some remaining manual steps like moving your domain names from one region to the other (or at the CDN level) and update your DNS records.

We also have [the Upsun Fixed converting tool](https://github.com/upsun/convsun), which allows you to change existing configuration files to another format. It converts details from files like `services.yaml` and `routes.yaml`, and generates a new `config.yaml` file. This streamlines the conversion process by significantly reducing the manual effort required to adapt your app’s infrastructure setup.

Although not directly supported by Upsun Fixed, an agency named [Contextual Code](https://www.contextualcode.com/) has built a bash migration script. This script automates most common configurations. If your site is a typical single app with a single SQL database, the script should take care of most of the process for you.

See more at the [Upsun Fixed Project Migration repository](https://gitlab.com/contextualcode/platformsh-migration).
### Change the project timezone

The project timezone affects [automated backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md).

The project timezone doesn't affect:

- [App runtime](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/timezone.md).
- [Cron jobs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons).
- [System logs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs.md). UTC is the default timezone for all logs.

To change the timezone for a project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project where you want to change the timezone.
2. Click Settings **Settings**.
3. Select the timezone from the list.
4. Click **Save**.
### Delete a project

To delete a project, you must be an organization owner or have the [manage plans permission](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

To delete an Upsun Fixed project, including all data, code, and active environments:

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform project:delete --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

 - Read the consequences to deletion and enter ``y``.

 - Enter the project title to confirm.

You are billed only for the portion of a month when the project was active.

When you remove all your projects from your user account,
you stop being charged.

### Set up a custom domain

Once your project is ready for production, replace the automatically generated domain with your own custom domain.
Note that adding a domain disables the automatically generated URL for your Production environment only.

If you are an Enterprise or Elite customer and have a Grid project, you can [customize the URLs for your non-production environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/custom-domains-preview-environments.md).
Dedicated Gen 2 customers can also customize the domain for their Staging environment.

##### Before you begin

You need:

- A project that's ready to go live
- A domain with access to its settings with the registrar
- A registrar that allows `CNAME` records or [one of the alternatives](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/dns.md) on [apex domains](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#apex-domain)
- Optional: The [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) installed locally
- If you are on a development plan, you need to [upgrade your tier to a production plan](#optional-change-your-plan-to-a-production-plan).

If you are planning to use several subdomains of the same domain on different projects,
see how to [manage multiple subdomains](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/subdomains.md) *before* you add your domain to Upsun Fixed.

##### Optional: Change your plan to a production plan

If you are on a Development plan, you can't add a domain.
You need to upgrade your subscription to a [production plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#production-plan).

To upgrade your plan tier, you must be an organization owner or have the [manage plans permission](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

To upgrade your plan tier:

 - On the tile of the project you want to upgrade, click **More More**.
 - Click **Edit plan**.
 - Change the plan to at least Standard
.
 - Check the change to the monthly cost.
 - Click **Save**.

You can find [more information on plan tiers](https://upsun.com/pricing).

##### 1. Get the target for your project

You want to point your DNS record to the automatically generated URL.
Your domain needs to point to that target for your site to go live.

For Dedicated plans, get the target for your project from your Upsun Fixed contact.

 - Navigate to your production environment and click **Settings Settings**.
 - Select the **Domains** tab.
 - In the **Configure your domain** section, copy the content of the **CNAME record** field.

##### 2. Configure your DNS provider

Your DNS provider (usually your registrar) is where you manage your domain.
Most registrars offer similar functionalities regarding DNS configuration but use different terminology or configuration.
For example, some registrars require you to use an `@` to create custom records on the apex domain, while others don't.
Check your registrar's documentation.

Note that depending on your registrar and the time to live (TTL) you set,
it can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 72 hours for DNS changes to be taken into account.

To configure your CDN and your domain name to point to your project:

 - Open your CDN’s management system.
 - Point the CDN at your [target](#1-get-the-target-for-your-project).
 - Open your registrar’s domain management system.
 - Open your registrar’s domain management system and configure your DNS zone settings to point at your CDN.
The address or ``CNAME`` record to use varies by CDN provider.
Refer to the official documentation of your DNS provider and CDN provider.
 - Check that redirects and subdomains are set correctly for the [TLS certificate ownership verification](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/troubleshoot.md#ownership-verification).
 - [Disable the router cache](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md#disable-the-router-cache).
 - Optional: For increased security and to prevent the CDN from being bypassed,
you can force all traffic to [go through the CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md#prevent-direct-access-to-your-server).
 - Optional: If you have multiple domains you want to be served by the same app, add a ``CNAME`` record for each of them.
That includes the ``www`` subdomain if you are using it in your [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

Adding a custom domain sets your site as [visible to search engines](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/search-engine-visibility.md#how-its-done).
See how you can further [configure your CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md).

##### 3. Set your domain

Add a single domain to your project:

 - Select the project where you want to add a domain.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Domains**.
 - In the **Domain** field, enter your domain.
 - Click **Add domain**.

##### What's next

* [Use a content delivery network](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md)
* [Use subdomains across multiple projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/subdomains.md)
* [Use a custom TLS certificate](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/tls.md)
#### DNS management and apex domains

Using `CNAME` records helps [prevent downtime](#cname-records) during maintenance operations.
But `CNAME` records can't point to apex domains,
so you need to [set up a workaround](#workarounds-for-apex-domains).
Available workarounds depend on your DNS provider.

###### `CNAME` records

Each site on Upsun Fixed is made up of a set of containers.
To map incoming requests to the appropriate container,
Upsun Fixed runs routers in [each region](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md).
A router's IP address can change in two cases:
- During an upgrade or maintenance operation, routers can be taken offline while changes are applied.
- During a region upscale or downscale, routers can be added or removed.

In such situations, using `A` records can cause downtime.
`A` records map a domain to an IP address.
When a router's IP address changes,
you need to manually update your `A` records.
Your site remains offline until you do,
or until the router is back from maintenance.

To prevent downtime, create `CNAME` records through your DNS provider.
`CNAME` records map a domain to another.
Set up your `CNAME` records to point at your project's [target URL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#1-get-the-target-for-your-project).
The DNS record for this target URL automatically resolves to the IP addresses of the routers in your project's region.
When a router's IP address changes,
the DNS record is automatically and immediately updated.
This prevents downtime without intervention from you.

Note that `CNAME` records can't point to [apex domains](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#apex-domain).
Check with your DNS provider if they offer [workarounds](#workarounds-for-apex-domains).

###### Workarounds for apex domains

Although `CNAME` records can't point to apex domains,
most DNS providers offer workarounds.
Contact your DNS provider and choose the option that works for you.

If you use a CDN, you likely already have a workaround in place,
such as with [Fastly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md#3-handle-apex-domains)
and [Cloudflare](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/cloudflare.md#3-handle-apex-domains).

####### Custom records

Some DNS providers offer custom records such as `ANAME`, `ALIAS` or `HTTPS` records,
which you can manage like `CNAME` records.
But unlike `CNAME` records, these custom records can point to apex domains.

To use custom records, follow the instructions on [how to set up a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
When you come to configuring your DNS provider, instead of a `CNAME` record,
add a custom record pointing from your domain to [your project's target URL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#2-get-the-target-for-your-project).

####### Domain forwarding

If your DNS provider doesn't support custom records,
consider using domain forwarding.

If your domain is `example.com`, domain forwarding redirects all requests from `example.com` to `www.example.com`.

To use domain forwarding, follow these steps:

1.  Make the `www.` version of your site the default (canonical) version
    and configure your app and routes to [use the `www` subdomain as `upstream`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

2.  Follow the instructions on [how to set up a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
    When you come to configuring your DNS provider,
    instead of a `CNAME` record, add a record forwarding requests
    from `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` to `www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`.

####### Redirection service

If your DNS provider doesn't support custom records or domain forwarding,
consider using a redirection service.
If your domain is `example.com`,
a redirection service uses an `A` record to redirect all requests from `example.com` to `www.example.com`.

To use a redirection service, follow these steps:

1.  Make the `www.` version of your site the default (canonical) version
    and configure your app and routes to [use the `www` subdomain as `upstream`](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

2.  Follow the instructions on [how to set up a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
    When you come to configuring your DNS provider, instead of a `CNAME` record,
    add an `A` record pointing from your domain to the redirection service.

####### `A` records

If your DNS provider doesn't support any other workaround,
consider using `A` records, but only as a last resort.
When you use `A` records, [if a router's IP address changes](#cname-records),
you need to update your `A` records manually.
Until you do, your site can appear offline because requests are lost.

To use `A` records, follow these steps:

1.  [Get the IP addresses](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md#public-ip-addresses) of your project's production environment.

2.  Follow the instructions on [how to set up a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
    When you come to configuring your DNS provider, instead of a `CNAME` record,
    add `A` records pointing from your domain to each of the IP addresses from step 1.
    When a request comes in, one of those IP addresses is used at random.
#### Configure a third-party TLS certificate

Upsun Fixed automatically provides standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for all sites and environments.
These certificates are issued at no charge by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and cover most needs.
To use them, you need to [specify HTTPS routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#enable-https).
Note that some [limitations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#lets-encrypt-limitations) apply.

Upsun Fixed allows you to use third-party TLS certificates free of charge.

You can use many kinds of custom certificates, including domain-validated, extended validation, high-assurance, or wildcard certificates.
Consult your TLS issuer for pricing and instructions on how to generate a TLS certificate.

Seven days before a third-party custom certificate is due to expire,
Upsun Fixed replaces it with a new default Let’s Encrypt certificate.
This helps prevent downtime.
To avoid switching to a default certificate,
make sure you replace your custom certificate with an updated one
more than seven days before its expiration date.

Note that custom certificates aren't necessary for preview environments as we provision Let's Encrypt certificates by default for them.

####### Add a custom certificate

You can add a custom certificate using the [CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) or in the [Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web.md).

Your certificate has to be in PKCS #1 format and start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
If it doesn't start that way, [change the format](#change-the-private-key-format).

To add your custom certificate, follow these steps:

For example:

```bash {}
platform domain:add secure.example.com --cert /etc/TLS/private/secure-example-com.crt --key /etc/TLS/private/secure-example-com.key
```

You can optionally include intermediate SSL certificates by adding ``‐‐chain <PATH_TO_FILE>`` for each one.

 - Redeploy your production environment with the following command:

```bash {}
platform environment:redeploy
```

 - Open the project where you want to add a certificate.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Certificates**.
 - Click **+ Add**.
 - Fill in your private key, public key certificate, and (optionally) intermediate SSL certificates.
 - Click **Add Certificate**.
 - Access your production environment.
 - Click More **More**.
 - Click **Redeploy**.

####### Change the private key format

The expected format for your certificate’s private key is PKCS #1.
Private keys in PKCS #1 format start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
If your private key starts with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`, it’s in PKCS #8 format, which isn’t appropriate.

To convert your private key (`private.key`) from PKCS #8 to PKCS #1 format (`private.rsa.key`), run the following command:

```bash
openTLS rsa -in private.key -out private.rsa.key
```
#### Handle subdomains across different projects

You can host multiple subdomains, such as `foo.example.com` and `bar.example.com`,
within a single project using [routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).

If you try to use a subdomain that's used in another project,
you get an error like the following:

```text
This domain is already claimed by another service
```

You need to add a DNS record to make it clear you explicitly allow multiple projects to use the domain.

###### Enable subdomains across multiple projects

To ensure multiple projects can use subdomains of the same apex domain,
add a specific `TXT` DNS record for your apex domain.

The `TXT` record should look like the following:

```text
_public-suffix-root.<YOUR_APEX_DOMAIN> TXT "public-suffix-root=<YOUR_APEX_DOMAIN>"
```

This adds your domain to the [Upsun Fixed implementation of the Public Suffix List](#why-this-is-necessary).

After you add your subdomains, remove the `TXT` record to reinstate [subdomain hijacking protection](#subdomain-hijacking-protection).
This ensures no other users can possibly add a subdomain of your domain to their project.

Even if you don’t remove the record, your DNS records should prevent others from using a subdomain
as long as you don’t use wildcards records pointing at Upsun Fixed.

**Apex domain cannot be re-added**: 

If you don’t remove the ``TXT`` record, restrictions apply on the apex domain.
For example, you can’t add the apex domain to another project until you remove the ``TXT`` record.

Note that depending on your registrar and the time to live (TTL) you set, it can take
anywhere from 15 minutes to 72 hours for DNS changes to be taken into account, so take this into
account if you need to add the apex domain to another project.
You can see an error like ``YOUR_APEX_DOMAIN is a root domain``.

###### Bypass locked domains

In certain cases (such as if your domain was added manually by Upsun Fixed support),
your domain may be reserved for the project you added it to.
Then you can't set up a second project with the bare domain (`example.com`) or a subdomain (`foo.example.com`).

If that happens, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).
Include the project ID of the project that already has the domain.

###### Why this is necessary

####### The Public Suffix List

Domain names are segmented into different hierarchical levels, separated by a `.`.
The right-most portion of the domain, such as `.com`, `.edu`, and `.fr`,
is known as the top-level domain (TLD).
Most applications, including web browsers, handle TLDs specially, such as by restricting certain actions.

For example, a webpage at `foo.bar.baz.example.com` can usually set a cookie that's keyed to any of the following:

- `foo.bar.baz.example.com`
- `bar.baz.example.com`
- `baz.example.com`
- `example.com`

So a single site can be segmented across different subdomains but use a single account login cookie.

But this webpage *can't* set cookies keyed to all `.com` domains,
which would be a security risk.

Other restrictions apply to TLDs, but cookies are the most basic example.

Aside from true TLDs, browser makers have a list of domain suffixes that should get the same special handling
called the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/).
If you add the `example.com` domain to the PSL,
browsers refuse to set a cookie on `example.com` from a page at `foo.example.com`.
They still accept cookies from a page at `example.com`.

####### Subdomain hijacking protection

By default, a given domain can be used by only one project at a time.
This security measure prevents malicious actions such as registering a project with the `evil.example.com` subdomain
and using that to set cookies on your `example.com` website.

When you add a domain to a project,
the first level of the domain not in the [PSL](#the-public-suffix-list) is reserved.
So if you add `foo.bar.baz.example.com` to a project,
that project has `example.com` reserved within Upsun Fixed
and no other project can have a domain anywhere in `*.example.com`.
You can add multiple subdomains within that one project.

Subdomain hijacking protection ensures that no other users can add a subdomain to their project
as long as you don't use wildcard DNS records pointing at Upsun Fixed.

In most cases, that's a desirable added layer of security.
But you may run into a problem when you want multiple subdomains from the same organization as separate projects.
One option would be to add `example.com` to the PSL, but you might not want or be able to do that.

To limit what domains get protected, Upsun Fixed supports a small extension to the PSL.
When you add a `TXT` record for your domain, Upsun Fixed treats that domain as part of the PSL.

So when you add a `TXT` record for `example.com`,
Upsun Fixed treats `example.com` as a top-level domain.
That means it isn't reserved and is open for other projects.

Then when you add a domain, the next level down from `example.com` is reserved.
So if you add `foo.bar.baz.example.com` to a project, `*.baz.example.com` is reserved for that project.
You can add `beep.example.com` to a different project without any issues.

You can do the same for any level of subdomain.
So if you set a `TXT` record for `baz.example.com`
and add `foo.bar.baz.example.com` to a project,
`*.bar.baz.example.com` is reserved for that project.
Nothing at a higher level is reserved.
#### Set up a custom domain on a preview environment

[Preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#preview-environment) in your project can't use the custom domain [set up on your production environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
By default and for each preview environment,
Upsun Fixed automatically replaces the custom production domain
with an automatically generated URL.

If you don't want to use these default URLs,
you can add a custom domain to each of your preview environments
(`staging` or `development` [environment types](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#environment-type)).

To do so, no need to modify your [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).
When you add a new custom domain for a preview environment,
just attach it to the custom production domain it replaces.
If you have multiple custom production domains,
you need to select which one you're replacing.

**Example**: 

You have two environments, a production environment and a staging environment.
You’ve added the ``example.com`` custom domain to your production environment.

You want to add the ``staging.example.com`` custom domain to your staging environment.
To do so, you need to attach the new ``staging.example.com`` custom domain
to its corresponding custom production domain ``example.com``.
You can then access your staging environment through ``staging.example.com``,
and still access your production environment through ``example.com``.

If you have multiple custom domains on your production environment,
when you set up a custom domain on a preview environment,
you don't need to update your [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) either.
Upsun Fixed automatically figures out the routing of your preview environment
based on the following elements:

- The custom production domains in your existing [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md)
- The custom domains for preview environments attached to each of those custom production domains

###### Before you start

You need:

- A Grid project on which you have **admin rights** <BR>

  **Note**: 

If you have a Dedicated Gen 2 project,
currently you can only add a custom domain to the dedicated environments of your project (production and staging).
To do so, [contact Support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open).

  If you use a [Managed Fastly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md) CDN,
  it needs to be configured to operate with custom domains for preview environments.
  For more information, [contact Support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets/open).
- A production environment with at least one custom domain already set up
- At least one preview (staging or development) environment
- Optional: The [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) (v4.8.0+)

To prevent abuse, by default you can add custom domains to up to 5 preview environments per project only.
This limit doesn't include the production environment,
and you can increase it without charge.
To do so, [contact Support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

**Note**: 

If you delete a custom production domain,
all of the attached custom domains for preview environments are deleted too.
You need to rebuild the affected preview environments for the deletion to be complete.

If you downgrade from an Elite or Enterprise plan to a Professional plan,
all of the custom domains set up on preview environments are automatically removed.
Downgrading your plan doesn't affect custom domains set up on your production environments.

###### Add a custom domain to a preview environment

To add a custom domain to a preview environment, follow these steps:

 - [Configure your DNS provider](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#2-configure-your-dns-provider).
In particular, make sure your DNS record points to the target of your preview environment.
**Note**: 

Using the target of your production environment to configure your DNS provider is technically possible,
but Upsun Fixed recommends using the target of your preview environment as a best practice.

 - Run a command similar to the following:

```bash {}
platform domain:add staging.example.com --environment <STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_ID> --attach <PRODUCTION_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TO_ATTACH>
```

 - Get the target for your preview environment. 
To do so, navigate to your preview environment and click **Settings Settings**. 
Select the **Domains** tab. 
In the **Configure your domain** section, copy the content of the **CNAME record** field. 
Save it for later use at step 7.

 - Click **Add domain**.

 - Name the custom domain for your preview environment.

 - Attach the custom domain for your preview environment to the desired production custom domain.

 - Click **Add**.

 - Click **Okay**.

 - [Configure your DNS provider](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#2-configure-your-dns-provider). 
In particular, make sure your DNS record points to the target of your preview environment.

**Note**: 

Using the target of your production environment to configure your DNS provider is technically possible,
but Upsun Fixed recommends using the target of your preview environment as a best practice.

**Note**: 

You can’t update a custom domain when it’s used on a preview environment.
You can only delete it and create a new one as a replacement.

####### Example

You've added the `mysite.com` custom domain to your production environment.
You now want to add the `mydev.com` custom domain to a preview environment called `Dev`.

To do so, follow these steps:

 - Get the target for ``Dev``. 
To do so, navigate to ``Dev`` and click **Settings Settings**. 
Select the **Domains** tab. 
In the **Configure your domain** section, copy the content of the **CNAME record** field. 
Save it for later use at step 7.

 - Click **Add domain**.

 - Enter ``mydev.com`` as a name for the custom domain you want to add to ``Dev``.

 - Select ``mysite.com`` as the production custom domain you want to attach ``mydev.com`` to.

 - Click **Add**. 

 - Click **Okay**.

 - [Configure your DNS provider](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#2-configure-your-dns-provider). 
In particular, make sure your DNS record points to ``Dev``’s target.

In the above example, the `Dev` environment needs to exist
for you to add the `mydev.com` custom domain successfully.
If the `Dev` environment is later removed,
the `mydev.com` custom domain is removed too.

###### List the custom domains of a preview environment

 - Navigate to your preview environment and click **Settings Settings**.
 - Select the **Domains** tab. 
All the custom domains for your preview environment are displayed.

###### Get a specific custom domain used on a preview environment

 - Navigate to your preview environment and click **Settings Settings**. 
 - Select the **Domains** tab. 
All the custom domains for the selected environment are displayed.
 - To see which actions you can perform on a displayed custom domain,
click **More More** next to it.

###### Remove a custom domain from a preview environment

 - Navigate to your preview environment and click **Settings Settings**.
 - Select the **Domains** tab. 
All the custom domains for the selected environment are displayed.
 - Click **More More** on the custom domain you want to delete.
 - Click **Delete**.
 - Click **Yes, delete**.

### Content delivery networks (CDNs)

Using a CDN speeds up the delivery of your site's content to its users.
The CDN deploys edge servers at many locations around the world.
These edge servers behave like local caches to nearby users.
Bringing content closer to users helps enhance your site's perceived performance
and so can improve user engagement and retention.

Fastly is the recommended CDN for Upsun Fixed projects.
By default, Dedicated projects include a [Fastly CDN managed by Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md).
Self-service Grid plans don't include a CDN by default, but you can set up one at any time,
such as [Fastly](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md) or [Cloudflare](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/cloudflare.md).

##### DNS records

To start routing client traffic through your CDN, [set up a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).

If you use `CNAME` records for your custom domain, these records [can't point to apex domains](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/dns.md).
But most CDN providers offer workarounds.
For example, Fastly offers [Anycast options](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md#3-handle-apex-domains)
and Cloudflare offers [`CNAME` flattening](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/cloudflare.md#3-handle-apex-domains).

##### Host header forwarding

When an HTTP request is made to a website, the client adds a `Host` header to the request.
The value of this header is the domain name the request is made to.
When a server hosts multiple websites, like what a CDN does,
it can use the `Host` header to identify which domain to access to handle the request.

When a request is made from a client to fetch a resource on a CDN edge server,
the `Host` header value is rewritten to point to the CDN.
If the requested resource isn't cached on the edge server,
the edge server makes a request to the Upsun Fixed server to pull and cache the resource.

For this process to be successful,
set an `X-Forwarded-Host` header to forward the original `Host` header value to the Upsun Fixed server.
Use your root domain as the value of your `X-Forwarded-Host` header,
for example: `example.com`.

To ensure your app handles the `X-Forwarded-Host` header,
you might need to adjust your app configuration.
For more information on how to set up an `X-Forwarded-Host` HTTP header,
see your CDN provider's official documentation.

##### Disable the router cache

When you use a CDN, the Upsun Fixed router [HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md) becomes redundant.
To disable it, change your cache configuration for the routes behind a CDN to the following:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "myapp:http"
  cache:
    # Disable the HTTP cache on this route. It's handled by the CDN instead.
    enabled: false
```

##### Configure your CDN to support high SLA

If your plan includes high SLA, configure your CDN so that Upsun Fixed can perform automated monitoring using NodePing.
To do so, [add all NodePing IP addresses](https://nodeping.com/faq.md#ip-addresses) to your CDN's allowlist.

If you want Upsun Fixed to limit checks to one or more of the following regions, [contact Support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md):

- North America
- Europe
- East Asia / Oceania

##### Prevent direct access to your server

When you use a CDN, you might want to prevent direct access to your Upsun Fixed server for security purposes.

###### IP filtering and HTTP auth

While using password or IP based authentication might be possible, it is insecure, and unreliable. There are many scenarios in which the implementation can fail, and the security features circumvented.

Furthermore, IP based filtering will usually be impossible due to the fact that most CDNs use the `x-forwarded` HTTP header, which your project origin will use as the visitor IP address.

Both methods are highly insecure, and we highly recommend against them.

###### Enable mTLS

If your CDN provider supports it,
you can secure your site through [mTLS](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md#enable-mtls).

To enable mTLS, follow these steps:

1.  Obtain an Origin Certificate Authority (CA) certificate from your CDN provider.

2.  Check that the CA certificate is a `.crt` file.
   If the file is a `.pem` file, rename it to `cdn.crt`.

3.  Add the `cdn.crt` file to your Git repository.

4.  Change your routing configuration for the routes behind a CDN to the following:

    ```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
    "https://{default}":
      tls:
        client_authentication: "require"
        client_certificate_authorities:
          - !include
            type: string
            path: cdn.crt
    ```

The procedure can vary depending on your CDN.
Contact your CDN provider for specific assistance.

Note that mTLS is a mutual authentication process.
It allows your CDN to check that it's communicating with your Upsun Fixed server
and vice versa.
So in addition to the CA certificate supplied by your CDN provider,
you need to [create your own TLS certificate](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/https.md).
#### Set up your Fastly CDN

You can [use a CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md) to deliver your site's content to users more quickly.

To set up a Fastly CDN with your own Fastly subscription,
follow the instructions on this page.

If you are using a Fastly CDN provided by Upsun Fixed,
for example as part of a Dedicated project,
see guidance about [Fastly CDNs managed by Upsun Fixed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/managed-fastly.md).

###### Before you begin

You need:

- An up-and-running Upsun Fixed project
- A [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) CDN subscription

###### 1. Avoid double-caching

To avoid stale content that can't be cleared,
avoid using Fastly with [HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).

For routes where Fastly is used,
disable HTTP caching using the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
    type: upstream
    ...
    cache:
        enabled: false
```

###### 2. Set up your Fastly CDN

To properly configure your Fastly CDN,
see the Fastly official documentation on [how to get started](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/getting-started#_basics).
Then set up a [custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
To get the [DNS challenge to succeed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/troubleshoot.md#ownership-verification),
have your CDN point to your [project's target URL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#1-get-the-target-for-your-project).

###### 3. Handle apex domains

To start routing client traffic through Fastly,
[create `CNAME` records for your domain names](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/dns.md)
through your DNS provider.
`CNAME` records can't point to apex domains.
As a workaround, Fastly offers [Anycast options](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-fastly-with-apex-domains).

###### 4. Optional: Protect your site from on-path attacks

An on-path attack occurs when a hacker intercepts
or modifies the communication between a client and a server.
This can lead to sensitive data leaks.
To prevent such attacks, make sure all communication with your site is encrypted through HTTPS
and can't be downgraded to HTTP.

To do so, enable HTTP strict transport security (HSTS).
HSTS forces clients to always communicate with your site over HTTPS.

You can [enable HSTS](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/enabling-hsts-through-fastly#forcing-tls-and-enabling-hsts)
in your Fastly account.
All HTTP requests are then automatically redirected to HTTPS.
#### Managed Fastly CDN

Instead of starting your own Fastly subscription and [managing your CDN yourself](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn/fastly.md),
you can take advantage of a Fastly CDN provided by Upsun Fixed.
For example, Dedicated projects include a managed Fastly CDN by default.
These CDNs are exclusively set up and managed by Upsun Fixed.

To modify any settings for a managed Fastly CDN,
open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).
To add a managed Fastly CDN to your project,
[contact sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

**Note**: 

Upsun Fixed does not write nor debug any custom VCL on Managed Fastly CDN services.

**Monitor CDN metrics**: 

You can access a summary of your monthly traffic usage under the “Traffic this month” section at the Project level inside [Console](https://console.upsun.com/). This will help you monitor your monthly bandwidth and requests consumption.

In this summary, you will find specific details about:

 - **Origin Bandwidth:** Data transferred from origin servers (in TB).

 - **Origin Requests:** Requests served by origin servers (in millions of requests).

 - **CDN Bandwidth & CDN Requests:** Shown if you have Fastly CDN enabled.

This data is updated daily and will reflect your traffic usage throughout the billing period.

**Set up traffic alerts**: 

You can also set up consumption alerts for your resource usage. Click the Alert button in the “Traffic this month” block within [Console](https://console.upsun.com/) to configure usage thresholds. For more information, head to the [Pricing docs page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md#monthly-traffic-alerts).

####### Domain control validation

When you request for a new domain to be added to your Fastly service,
Upsun Fixed support provides you with a [`CNAME` record](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/dns.md) for [domain control validation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/troubleshoot.md#ownership-verification).
To add this `CNAME` record to your domain settings,
see how to [configure your DNS provider](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#2-configure-your-dns-provider).

####### Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates

By default, Enterprise and Elite plans include two [TLS certificates](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#transport-layer-security-tls),
an apex and a wildcard one.
This allows for encryption of all traffic between your users and your app.

If you use a Fastly CDN provided by Upsun Fixed,
you can provide your own third-party TLS certificates for an additional fee.

To do so, if you don't have one,
set up a [mount](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#mounts) that isn't accessible to the web.
Use an environment with access limited to Upsun Fixed support and trusted users.
[Transfer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/file-transfer.md) each certificate, its unencrypted private key,
and the intermediate certificate to the mount.
To notify Upsun Fixed that a certificate is to be added to your CDN configuration,
open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

If you need an Extended Validation TLS certificate,
you can get it from any TLS provider.
To add it to your CDN configuration, open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

Note that when you add your own third-party TLS certificates,
you are responsible for renewing them in due time.
Failure to do so may result in outages and compromised security for your site.

####### Retrieve your Fastly API token

The API token for your managed Fastly CDN is stored in the `FASTLY_API_TOKEN` or the `FASTLY_KEY` environment variables.

This variable is usually set in the `/master/settings/variables` folder of your project,
and you can access it [from a shell](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-a-shell)
or directly [in your app](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables/use-variables.md#access-variables-in-your-app).

**Note**: 

Dedicated (gen2) projects may not have the ``FASTLY_*`` environment variable(s) set. 
In this case, the Fastly API token is stored in a text file called ``fastly_tokens.txt`` on the server,
typically located at ``/mnt/shared/fastly_tokens.txt``.

###### Dynamic ACL and rate limiting
For details about updating an access control list (ACL) and applying rate limiting, check out the [Working with Upsun Fixed rate-limiting implementation](https://support.platform.sh/hc/en-us/community/posts/26091087795602-Working-with-platform-sh-rate-limiting-implementation-Fastly) article in the Upsun Community.#### Set up your Cloudflare CDN

You can [use a CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md) to deliver your site's content to users more quickly.

###### Before you begin

You need:

- An up-and-running Upsun Fixed project
- A [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) CDN subscription

###### 1. Avoid double-caching

To avoid stale content that can't be cleared,
avoid using Cloudflare with [HTTP caching](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes/cache.md).

For routes where Cloudflare is used,
disable HTTP caching using the following configuration:

```yaml  {location=".platform/routes.yaml"}
https://{default}/:
    type: upstream
    ...
    cache:
        enabled: false
```

###### 2. Set up your Cloudflare CDN

To properly configure your Cloudflare CDN,
see the Cloudflare official documentation on [how to get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/get-started/).
Then set up a [custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
To get the [DNS challenge to succeed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/troubleshoot.md#ownership-verification),
have your CDN point to your [project's target URL](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md#1-get-the-target-for-your-project).

###### 3. Handle apex domains

To start routing client traffic through Cloudflare,
you need to [create `CNAME` records for your domain names](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/dns.md)
through your DNS provider.

But `CNAME` records can't point to apex domains.
As a workaround, Cloudflare offers [`HTTPS` records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#svcb-and-https) and [`CNAME` flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/additional-options/cname-flattening/).

###### 4. Mitigate security risks

Like all networks exposed to the internet, your origin server may become the target of security attacks.
The best way to protect your site from threats like on-path attacks, spoofing attacks, or credential stuffing,
is to configure mutual TLS (mTLS).

[mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) not only has both parties in a connection authenticate each other
through the TLS protocol.
It also ensures that requests can't be sent directly to the origin server (Upsun Fixed).
Instead, requests must transit through Cloudflare first.

**Note**: 

mTLS is only compatible with environments where you have attached domains you own, meaning:

 - Your production environment
 - Each preview environment where you have [attached a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/custom-domains-preview-environments.md)

Therefore, mTLS is **not** compatible with preview environments created by a [source code integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md).

If you can't use mTLS, you can still take the following measures to protect your site from on-path attacks:

1. [Enable full strict SSL/TLS encryption](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/). 
   Any communication between a client and Cloudflare or between Cloudflare and your Upsun Fixed server is then encrypted through HTTPS.
   In addition, Cloudflare checks that your Upsun Fixed server's [TLS certificate](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#transport-layer-security-tls)
   was issued by a trusted certificate authority.
   This confirms the client is truly communicating with your Upsun Fixed server.

2. [Enable HTTP strict transport security (HSTS)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/http-strict-transport-security/). 
   This ensures that your HTTPS connections can't be downgraded to HTTP.
### Going Live - Troubleshooting


If your site doesn’t resolve after you’ve made DNS changes, check potential solutions to common issues.

##### Verify DNS

On the command line using macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux, run the following command:

```bash
host www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>
```

If your domain is `example.com`, the response should be something like the following:

```text
www.example.com is an alias for main-abcd123.abcdefgh1234567.eu.platformsh.site
main-abcd123.abcdefgh1234567.eu.platformsh.site has address 192.0.2.1
```

If it isn't, try the following steps:

- Your DNS server might not be correctly configured or the old DNS records are still cached.
  Try removing your local DNS cache.
- Set your computer's DNS server to any Public DNS resolver (like [CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/) or [Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using))
  to see if the issue is with the DNS server you are using.
- Run `ping www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`.
  If the result is different from what you got from running `host www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`,
  you might need to remove your test settings.

##### Verify SSL/TLS encryption

To find out where your domain is pointing to,
you can use [the certificate checker tool](https://certcheck.pltfrm.sh/).
This tool provides guidance on certificates,
including when you use a [CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md).
Check both the apex and the `www` domains to ensure they both point to your project.

For further investigations, run the following command in a shell:

```bash
curl -I -v  https://www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>
```

Look for error messages.
Often the problem is caused by a mismatch between the certificate and the domain name or an expired [custom certificate](steps/tls.md).

###### Error provisioning certificates

When a Let's Encrypt certificate fails to provision after the build hook has completed,
you get output similar to the following:

```bash
Provisioning certificates
  Validating 2 new domains

  E: Error validating domains: urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rejectedIdentifier :: The server will not issue certificates for the identifier :: NewOrder request did not include a SAN short enough to fit in CN
  Unable to validate domains domain a-new-and-really-awesome-feature-abc1234-defghijk56789.eu3.platformsh.site, www.domain a-new-and-really-awesome-feature-abc1234-defghijk56789.eu3.platformsh.site, will retry in the background.
  (Next refresh will be at 2023-04-28 02:22:50.639301+00:00.)

  E: Error: TLS Certificate provisioning failed
 ```

The renewal may fail because of the 64-character limit Let's Encrypt places on URLs.
If you have a branch with a long name, the environment URL is over this limit and the certificate is rejected.
To solve this, shorten your branch name so it doesn't exceed 20 characters.

Generated URLs for environments have the following pattern:

```bash
<ENVIRONMENT>-<PROJECT_ID>.<REGION>.platformsh.site
```

If you have a [default domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md#default) set up, the generated URL has the following pattern:

```bash
<YOUR_DOMAIN>.<ENVIRONMENT>-<PROJECT_ID>.<REGION>.platformsh.site
```

The generated URLs consist of:

- `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` = the amount of characters your domain has
- `<ENVIRONMENT>` = `<BRANCH_NAME>` + 7 character hash
- `<PROJECT_ID>` = 13 characters
- `<REGION>` = 2 to 4 characters, depending on the region
- `platformsh.site` = 15 characters
- extra characters like `.` and `-` = 4 to 5 characters, depending on if you have a default domain

This leaves you with 21 to 23 characters for your branch name (`<BRANCH_NAME>`) without exceeding the 64-character limit,
depending on the region.
To ensure your renewals succeed,
keep your branch names under 20 characters.

###### Ownership verification

To provide a valid TLS-certificate,
the certificate issuer checks that the requester is entitled to receive the requested certificate.
This check is known as the _Challenge_ step.

The certificate request is generated based on your [routes definition](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).
If you want your site to be available with `example.com` and its `www.example.com` subdomain, make sure both are defined in your routes.

To pass this verification, there are requirements you need to meet.

When you use a CDN, to ensure the challenge succeeds, check that:

 - Your domains and subdomains point to your CDN
 - The [_acme-challenge.](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-8.4),
as in ``_acme-challenge.example.com``, points to your CDN
 - The [/.well-known/](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-8.3),
as in ``https://www.example.com/.well-known/``, is accessible with no redirects

If you don’t follow those requirements, you get an error message similar to:

```text {}
  W: Failed to verify the challenge at the gateway for the domain 'www.example.com'
  E: Error validating domain www.example.com: Couldn't complete challenge [HTTP01: The client lacks sufficient authorization]
```

For more information, see how to [setup your CDN](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md).
For more details regarding the challenge step, consult your certificate issuer’s documentation.
A common issuer is [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/).

Make sure that the [apex domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#apex-domain) and its `www` subdomain are both pointing where needed.
Note that it can take up to 72 hours for DNS changes to be effective.
For more information, see how to [set up a custom domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).

If the changes take longer than expected,
[redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy) the impacted environment.

Also make sure that no conflicting DNS records exist for your domain.
For example, a conflicting AAAA (IPv6) DNS record can result in a `[HTTP01: The client lacks sufficient authorization]` error.

If the certificate generation issue persists,
check if an outage is ongoing with your certificate issuer (the most common one is [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.status.io/))
and with your CDN provider if you have one.
If not, [contact Support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

###### Check your routes configuration

Certificates are generated based on your [routes configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md).
When a certificate is renewed, the renewal bot checks that all of the defined routes can be accessed.
If at least one of the routes defined in your `.platform/routes.yaml` file can't be accessed,
the renewal fails and the following error is displayed:

```
Provisioning certificates
  Validating 2 new domains
  W: Failed to verify the challenge at the gateway for the domain 'www.example.com'
  E: Error validating domain www.example.com: Couldn't complete challenge [HTTP01: There was a problem with a DNS query during identifier validation]
  Unable to validate domains www.example.com, will retry in the background.
  (Next refresh will be at 2023-07-04 17:43:10.259891+00:00.)
  Certificates
  - certificate 61bc4c8: expiring on 2023-09-02 01:11:12+00:00, covering sdgs.un.org

E: Error: TLS Certificate provisioning failed
```

For example, if you add `example.com` and `www.example.com` to your routes configuration
but the `www` subdomain doesn't point to your project through [a `CNAME` record](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/dns.md#cname-records),
the certificate renewal fails.
For the renewal to succeed, add the missing `CNAME` record to your DNS
or remove `www.example.com` (and any other `www` route) from your `.platform/routes.yaml` file.

##### Verify your application

Check your app's logs and look for anomalies.
On the command line type `platform logs app` and `platform logs error`.

##### Use ASCII for the domain

Upsun Fixed expects an ASCII representation of your domain.
To use an internationalized domain name (IDN), convert it to ASCII.
Use a tool such as the [conversion tool provided by Verisign](https://www.verisign.com/resources/internationalized-domain-names/idn-conversion-tool/).

##### Something still wrong?

For more general information, see how to [troubleshoot development](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md).

If your website is still not working as expected, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

### Command line interface (CLI)


See how to use and manage your Upsun Fixed projects directly from your terminal. Anything you can do within the Console can be done with the CLI.

The CLI uses the git interface and the [Upsun Fixed REST API](https://docs.upsun.com/api/) to accomplish tasks.
Its source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/cli).

##### 1. Install

To install the CLI, use a [Bash installation script](https://github.com/platformsh/cli#user-content-bash-installer).
You can also install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on Linux, macOS, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux)
or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (on Windows. You must also have the [Extras bucket](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras) already installed for this).

```bash {}
brew install platformsh/tap/platformsh-cli

```
```bash {}
scoop bucket add platformsh https://github.com/platformsh/homebrew-tap.git
scoop install platform

```

If you have issues with installation on a Mac, such as missing libraries, see how to [troubleshoot CLI installation on M1 Macs](https://community.platform.sh/t/troubleshoot-cli-installation-on-m1-macs/1202).

##### 2. Authenticate

To list and manage your projects, authenticate by running the following command:

```bash
platform
```

This process opens a browser tab for you to log in.
It also creates certificates on your computer for [SSH](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md).

Once you are logged in, a list of your projects appears, along with some tips for getting started.
If you experience authentication issues or want to force a login, run the command `platform login`.

##### 3. Use

Now you can run actions on your projects such as branching and merging.
You can also simulate a local build of your codebase as if you were pushing a change to Upsun Fixed,
including your services and data.

Get a list of all available commands with:

```bash
platform list
```

To get more information on a specific command, preface it with `help`:

```bash
platform help get
```

You get output similar to the following:

```bash
Command: project:get
Aliases: get
Description: Clone a project locally

Usage:
 platform get [-e|--environment ENVIRONMENT] [--depth DEPTH] [--build] [-p|--project PROJECT] [--host HOST] [-i|--identity-file IDENTITY-FILE] [--] [] []

Arguments:
  project                            The project ID
  directory                          The directory to clone to. Defaults to the project title

Options:
  -e, --environment=ENVIRONMENT      The environment ID to clone. Defaults to the project default, or the first available
                                     environment
      --depth=DEPTH                  Create a shallow clone: limit the number of commits in the history
      --build                        Build the project after cloning
  -p, --project=PROJECT              The project ID or URL
      --host=HOST                    The project's API hostname
  -i, --identity-file=IDENTITY-FILE  An SSH identity (private key) to use
  -h, --help                         Display this help message
  -q, --quiet                        Do not output any message
  -V, --version                      Display this application version
  -y, --yes                          Answer "yes" to any yes/no questions; disable interaction
  -n, --no                           Answer "no" to any yes/no questions; disable interaction
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose               Increase the verbosity of messages

Examples:
 Clone the project "abc123" into the directory "my-project":
   platform get abc123 my-project
```

###### Select the right project and environment

When you are in an empty directory or a directory not associated with a specific Upsun Fixed project,
if you run a command that requires a specific project and environment, you are prompted to select them.

For example, if you run the following command:

```bash
platform environment:info
```

You get the following output:

```bash
Enter a number to choose a project:
  [0] My project (xb3pfo734qxbeg)
  [1] A great project (3p5fmol45kxp6)
  [2] An even better project (rjify4y564xaa)
>
```

If your working directory is inside a local checkout of your project repository,
your project and environment are detected automatically.

You can always specify the project and environment in two ways:

* As arguments for the command:

  ```bash
  platform environment:info --project=my-project --environment=staging
  ```
* With environment variables:

  ```bash
  export PLATFORM_PROJECT=my-project;
  export PLATFORM_BRANCH=staging;
  platform environment:info
  ```

In [multi-app](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md) projects, this applies also to selecting the right app
(the environment variable would be `PLATFORM_APPLICATION_NAME`).

####### RootNotFoundException

If you check out a project via Git directly and not using the `platform get` command,
the CLI may be unable to determine what project it's in.
You might run a CLI command from within a project directory you've checked out and get an error like this:

```text
[RootNotFoundException] Project root not found. This can only be run from inside a project directory.
```

Then the CLI hasn't been able to determine the project to use.
To fix this, run:

```bash
platform project:set-remote --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your project.
You can find that in the Console or by running `platform projects` to list all accessible projects.

###### Choose between the CLI and Git commands

Some CLI commands (especially many within the `environment` namespace) have some overlap with Git commands.
Generally, they offer more options than the Git commands alone.
For example, `platform push` offers options such as `--activate` (to activate an environment before pushing)
and `--no-wait` (so you can continue working without waiting for the push to complete).

For all of them, you don't need to configure a Git remote.
It's enough to have a project ID.

An example of how this affects commands is that when you run `platform merge`,
it doesn't affect your local codebase.
You don't even need the code locally.
The code is only merged between environments remotely.

###### Customize the CLI

You can customize how the CLI operates and what it returns with a configuration file (`~/.platformsh/config.yaml`) or environment variables. For details, see the [customization instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/legacy-cli#user-content-customization).

####### Automate repetitive tasks

You might want to use the CLI in a script to automate repetitive tasks such as synchronizing your files locally.
In such cases, you want to customize the CLI to bypass any confirmation questions.
You can set the answer to every question as `yes` using the `PLATFORMSH_CLI_NO_INTERACTION` environment variable.

For instance, to locally sync every mount point for your app named `myapp`, you could use this command:

```bash
export PLATFORM_PROJECT=my-project;
export PLATFORM_BRANCH=main;
export PLATFORMSH_CLI_NO_INTERACTION=1;
platform mount:download --all --app myapp --target local-backup
```

###### Autocomplete commands

The CLI provides tab autocompletion for commands, options, and some values (your projects, valid regions).
To enable autocompletion, follow this step:

Add the following to your shell’s startup (``.bashrc``, ``.zshrc``, or the equivalent):

```bash {}
eval $(platform completion)
```

###### Run commands on your container

You can use the Upsun Fixed CLI to run commands on your container.
You can use any command you've added in [dependencies](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#dependencies)
or a [hook](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#hooks).

The syntax looks like the following:

```bash
platform ssh -- <COMMAND> <ARGUMENTS>
```

For example, to run a specific Python script named `my-script.py` on your current environment,
run the following command:

```bash
platform ssh -- python my-script.py
```

Or to use [Drush](https://www.drush.org/latest/install/) to rebuild the cache on the `feature` environment,
run this command:

```bash
platform ssh -e feature -- drush -y cache-rebuild
```

###### Update the CLI

To update to the latest version, use the same tool as for [installation](#1-install):

```bash {}
$ scoop update platform

```

##### Upgrade from the legacy CLI

To upgrade from the legacy CLI, follow the [installation instructions](#1-install).
Once you've installed the latest version, the CLI guides you through removing the installed legacy CLI.
#### Authenticate the CLI using an API token

You need to set up an API token to authenticate the Upsun Fixed CLI for any of the following tasks:
- Running automated tasks on a CI system
- Running automated tasks directly on app container, for example in a cron job

###### Before you begin

You might need the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md) to perform certain tasks.
For example, you need the CLI to do the following:
- [Check the validity of an API token](#optional-check-the-validity-of-your-api-token).
- [Load the CLI SSH certificate for non-CLI commands](#use-the-cli-ssh-certificate-for-non-cli-commands).

###### 1. Create a machine user

To safely run automated tasks, first create machine users.
Each machine user has their own Upsun account associated with a unique email address.
You can grant them restrictive [access permissions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md) to handle specific automated tasks.
For security purposes, create a machine user for each type of task you want to automate.

To create a machine user, follow these steps:

This sets your machine user as a viewer on your project and a contributor on development environments,
with no access to other environment types.
Note that you can further [adjust user roles](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#environment-type-roles) depending on your needs and each environment type.

 - In the email invitation, click **Create account**.

 - To create an Upsun account for the machine user, click **Sign up** and follow the instructions.

 - Go to your project and click Settings **Settings**.
 - In the **Project Settings** menu, click **Access**.
 - Click **Add**.
 - Enter your machine user’s email address.
 - For each [environment type](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#environment-type-roles), assign a role to your machine user and click **Save**.

**Note**: 

Machine users with an email address under your single sign-on (SSO) domain can be excluded from the SSO enforcement rule so they aren’t required to authenticate through your identity provider. See the [SSO documentation](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/security/sso.md#service-users) for more information.

###### 2. Create an API token

1. Log in to the Console as your machine user.
2. Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
3. Click **My profile**.
4. Go to the **API tokens** tab and click **Create API token**.
5. Enter a name for your API token and click **Create API token**.
6. To copy the API token to your clipboard, click ** Copy**.
   Note that after you close the **API tokens** tab, you can't display the API token again.
7. Store the API token somewhere secure on your computer.

####### Optional: check the validity of your API token

To check that your API token is valid, run the following command:

```bash
platform auth:api-token-login
```

When prompted, enter your API token.
You get output similar to this:

```bash
The API token is valid.
You are logged in.
```

For security reasons, rotate your API tokens regularly.
When an API token is compromised, revoke it immediately.

###### 3. Authenticate the CLI using your API token

After you create your API token, you can use it to do the following:

-  Allow a CI system to run automated tasks using the Upsun Fixed CLI.
-  Run automated tasks on an app container using the Upsun Fixed CLI,
   for example in a cron job.

Note that when running CLI commands in these cases,
some operations might take time to complete.
To avoid waiting for an operation to complete before moving on to the next one,
use the `--no-wait` flag.

####### Authenticate in a CI system

You can allow your CI system to run automated tasks using the Upsun Fixed CLI.
To do so, create an environment variable named `PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN` with your API token as its value.
For more information, see your CI system's official documentation.

To run SSH-based commands that aren't specific to the Upsun Fixed CLI,
see how to [load the proper SSH certificate](#use-the-cli-ssh-certificate-for-non-cli-commands).

####### Authenticate in an environment

You can run automated tasks on an app container using the Upsun Fixed CLI.
To do so, set your API token as a [top-level environment variable](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md#top-level-environment-variables).

**Note**: 

Once you add the token as an environment variable,
anyone with [SSH access](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh.md) can read its value.
Make sure your [machine user has only the necessary permissions](#1-create-a-machine-user).

 - Open the environment where you want to add the variable.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Variables**.
 - Click **+ Add variable**.
 - In the **Variable name** field, enter ``env:PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN``.
 - In the **Value** field, enter your API token.
 - Make sure the **Available at runtime** and **Sensitive variable** options are selected.
 - Click **Add variable**.

Then add a build hook to your app configuration to install the CLI as part of the build process.

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
hooks:
  build: |
    set -e
    echo "Installing Upsun Fixed CLI"
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/cli/main/installer.sh | bash

    echo "Testing Upsun Fixed CLI"
    platform
```

You can now call the CLI from within the shell on the app container or in a cron job.

To run SSH-based commands that aren't specific to the Upsun Fixed CLI,
see how to [load the proper SSH certificate](#use-the-cli-ssh-certificate-for-non-cli-commands).

You can set up a cron job on a specific type of environment.
For example, to run the `update` source operation on your production environment,
use the following cron job:

```yaml  {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
crons:
  update:
    spec: '0 0 * * *'
    commands:
      start: |
        if [ "$PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE" = production ]; then
           platform backup:create --yes --no-wait
           platform source-operation:run update --no-wait --yes
        fi
```

###### Use the CLI SSH certificate for non-CLI commands

When you set a `PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable,
the CLI authentication isn't complete until your run a CLI command
or load the CLI SSH certificate.

For example, after setting a `PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable,
you might need to run `ssh`, `git`, `rsync`, or `scp` commands before you run any CLI commands.

In this case, to ensure all your commands work, load the CLI SSH certificate first.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
platform ssh-cert:load --no-interaction
```

###### `integration:validate`

Validate an existing integration

####### Usage

```
platform integration:validate [-p|--project PROJECT] [--] []
```

This command allows you to check whether an integration is valid.

An exit code of 0 means the integration is valid, while 4 means it is invalid.
Any other exit code indicates an unexpected error.

Integrations are validated automatically on creation and on update. However,
because they involve external resources, it is possible for a valid integration
to become invalid. For example, an access token may be revoked, or an external
repository may be deleted.

###### `ssh-cert:load`

Generate an SSH certificate

####### Usage

```
platform ssh-cert:load [--refresh-only] [--new] [--new-key]
```

This command checks if a valid SSH certificate is present, and generates a
new one if necessary.

Certificates allow you to make SSH connections without having previously
uploaded a public key. They are more secure than keys and they allow for
other features.

Normally the certificate is loaded automatically during login, or when
making an SSH connection. So this command is seldom needed.

If you want to set up certificates without login and without an SSH-related
command, for example if you are writing a script that uses an API token via
an environment variable, then you would probably want to run this command
explicitly. For unattended scripts, remember to turn off interaction via
--yes or the PLATFORMSH_CLI_NO_INTERACTION environment variable.

######## Options

* `--refresh-only`
  Only refresh the certificate, if necessary (do not write SSH config)

###### `tunnel:open`

Open SSH tunnels to an app's relationships

####### Usage

```
platform tunnel:open [-g|--gateway-ports] [-p|--project PROJECT] [-e|--environment ENVIRONMENT] [-A|--app APP]

Connections can then be made to the application's services as if they were
local, for example a local MySQL client can be used, or the Solr web
administration endpoint can be accessed through a local browser.

This command requires the posix and pcntl PHP extensions (as multiple
background CLI processes are created to keep the SSH tunnels open). The
tunnel:single command can be used on systems without these
extensions.

### Console


Upsun Fixed provides a web console so you can interact with your projects and manage your environments.

![Overview of projects in the Console](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/psh-console-main-view.png "0.6")

This Console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).

##### Project list

Opening the [Console](https://console.upsun.com) takes you to the first organization you joined as an Upsun Fixed user.
You get an overview of all your projects within that organization.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects,
or switch to a different organization from the menu in the top left-hand corner.

Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-project.md).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/web/configure-environment.md).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.

##### Display settings

You can personalize the display settings for the Console.
To do so:

1. Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
2. Click **My Profile**.
3. Choose the mode you want.
4. Click **Save**.

The Console can be displayed in three ways:

* Light mode (default)
* High contrast mode
* Dark mode

To meet our [commitment to accessibility](https://upsun.com/trust-center/legal/),
all three options are compliant with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.
#### Configure a project

Each project has settings that apply to everything within that project, including all its environments.
You can only see and update settings for projects where you are a [Project Admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md).
To access the settings, click Settings **Settings** from the main project page.

The settings are divided into several sections.

###### General

The **General** section shows you the project's region and allows you to update the project name and [timezone](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/projects/change-project-timezone.md).

![configure project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-general.png "0.5")

###### Access

The **Access** section allows you to [manage user access to the project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md).

![A list of certificates in a project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-certificates.png "0.7")

###### Domains

The **Domains** section allows you to manage the domains where your project is accessible.
See how to [set up your domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).

![project domain](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-domains.png "0.7")

###### Deploy Key

The **Deploy Key** section shows you the public SSH key you can add to your private repositories.
Adding it lets Upsun Fixed access the repositories during the build process.
This is useful if you want to reuse some code components across multiple projects and manage those components as dependencies of your project.

![Project deploy key](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-deploy-key.png "0.7")

###### Integrations

The **Integrations** section allows you to manage all of your [integrations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations.md).

![Integrations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-integrations.png "0.7")

###### Variables

The **Variables** section allows you to manage all project-wide [variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/variables.md).

![Project variables](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/settings-variables-project.png "0.7")
#### Configure environments

From your project's main page in the Console, you can see all your environments as a list or a project tree:

![List of all environments as a tree](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/environments.png "0.5")

In this overview, the names of inactive environments are lighter.
Selecting an environment allows you to see details about it,
such as its [activity feed](#activity-feed), [services](#service-information),
[metrics](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/metrics.md), and [backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md).

###### Activity Feed

When you access an environment in the Console, you can see its [activity feed](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#activity-logs).
This allows you to check which activities have happened or are currently happening on the selected environment:

![Environment activity list](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/management-console/activity.png "0.5")

You can filter activities by type (such as merge, sync, or redeploy).

###### Actions on environments

Each environment offers ways to keep environments up to date with one another:

* [Branch **Branch**](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#branch) to create a new child environment.
* [Merge

       **Merge**](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#merge) to copy the current environment into its parent.
* [ **Sync**](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#sync)
  to copy changes from its parent environment into the current environment.

There are also additional options:

* Settings **Settings** to [configure the environment](#environment-settings).
* More **More** to get more options.
* **URLs** to access the deployed environment from the web.
* **SSH** to access your project using SSH.
* **Code**
  * **CLI** for the command to get your project set up locally with the [Upsun Fixed CLI](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.md).
  * **Git** for the command to clone the codebase via Git.

    If you're using Upsun Fixed as your primary remote repository, the command clones from the project.
    If you have set up an [external integration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md),
    the command clones directly from the integrated remote repository.

    If the project uses an external integration to a repository that you haven't been given access to,
    you can't clone until your access has been updated.
    See how to [troubleshoot source integrations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/troubleshoot.md).

###### Environment URL

When you access an environment in the Console, you can view its URL. While the environment is loading in the Console, a `Waiting for URL...` message is displayed instead of the URL. If this message isn't updated once your [default environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/_index.md#default-environment)'s information is loaded, follow these steps:

1. Check that [you have defined routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) for your default environment.
2. Verify that your [application](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md), [services](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md), and [routes](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) configurations are correct.
3. Check that your default environment is [active](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/deactivate-environment.md#reactivate-an-environment).

###### Environment settings

You can also see a summary of [metrics for the environment](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/metrics.md).

To view the configuration file where your services are set up, click **Configuration**.
### Organizations

Organizations allow you to manage your Upsun Fixed projects, users, and billing.
You can group multiple projects in one organization and manage them together.

To manage users within your organization, see how to [manage organization users](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#manage-organization-users).

##### Manage your organization settings

As an organization owner, you can manage the basic settings for your organization such as its name and URL.

To change the name (URL) and label of the ``acme`` organization, run:

```bash {}
platform organization:info --org acme label "Acme Corp" name acme-corp
```

To verify the changes, run:

```bash {}
platform organization:info --org acme-corp
```

##### Manage your organization billing

As an organization owner or an organization user with the **Manage billing** permission,
you can access and download invoices and edit billing information such as the stored credit card and billing address.

##### Create a new organization

You can create new organizations with different payment methods and billing addresses
and organize your projects as you want.

To create an organization with the label ``Acme`` and the name (URL) ``acme``, run:

```bash {}
platform organization:create --label "Acme" --name acme --country "United States"
```

To verify the changes, run:

```bash {}
platform organization:info --org acme
```

##### Delete an existing organization

As an organization owner, you can delete your own organization.

Note that if your organization owns projects or owes remaining invoices, you can not delete it yourself.
To have it deleted, [contact support](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

To delete the organization ``acme``, run:

```bash {}
platform organization:delete --org acme
```

##### Transfer project ownership

You can transfer your plan ownership to a different organization at anytime.
You have to be an organization owner or have the [manage plan permission](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions).

1. Make the new organization owner a [project admin](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#)
   for the project you want to transfer.
2. To ask for the transfer, from your organization account open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

Once the transfer is completed, the new organization can administer all project settings and billing and receives future invoices.
Ownership transfer automatically transfers subscription charges to the new organization.

##### Transfer organization ownership

To transfer an organization to a different owner, first make sure that user is part of the organization.
If they aren't yet, [add them](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#add-a-user-to-an-organization).
Then open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) from the current organization to ask for the transfer.

##### Fixed and Flex organizations

###### What is an Upsun Fixed organization?
Ideal for workloads that have consistent resource requirements with stable and predictable usage.
Users can select a plan with predefined CPU and Memory resources. You can not adjust these resources, nor scale them automatically. To increase capacity, you’ll need to upgrade to a higher plan.

**Fixed resources**: 

**Fixed:** Resource from the plan is applied to the production environment. For preview, the user has the default small size for all containers.

###### What is an Upsun Flex organization?
Ideal for workloads that evolve over time or have dynamic resource requirements. Flex will suit most use cases. Users will be able to allocate the exact CPU and Memory resources that your applications and services need. You can adjust these resources at any time, or configure them to adapt automatically. You are charged based on the resources you allocate.

**Flex resources**: 

**Flex:** Users can customize resources per container (per app or service) for **all** environments.

###### What can you do?
When creating a new organization, users will be able to select the organization type from a drop-down option based on their preference. Once the organization is created, users can manage their organizations like they do today.

Organizations on Upsun Fixed are made up of both [projects](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/projects/) and [users](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md).
While organizations by themselves allow you to assign project and environment type permissions to individual users on individual projects,
having many users and many projects calls for another method to group common access control settings.

**Teams** provide a grouping that connects a subset of an organization's users to another subset of that organization's projects.
That relationship enables organization owners to set default project and environment type access settings for each user and project from one place.

There is no limit to the number of teams that can be defined within a single organization.

##### Create a new team

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can create new teams.

Teams must belong to an organization, so [create one](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/organizations.md#create-a-new-organization) first.
You can create new organizations with different payment methods and billing addresses
and organize your projects as you want, but keep in mind that both users and teams are restricted to single organizations.

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:create -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Enter a team name.

 - Define your team’s project role (admin or viewer).

 - If your team has viewer rights on the project, define its role on each type of environment.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

**Note**: 

To view a list of all the existing teams in your organization, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:list -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

##### Delete an existing team

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can delete existing teams.

Note that deleting teams and deleting users are not equivalent.
Deleting a team will remove member access permissions to projects described by the team,
but it will _not_ [remove users from the organization](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#remove-a-user-from-an-organization) (or your billing).

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:delete -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select the team you want to delete.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

##### Manage team settings

As an organization owner or member with **Manage users** permissions, 
you can manage the settings of existing teams such as:

- [It's name](#team-name)
- [The environment type permissions granted to members on individual projects](#project--environment-type-permissions)
- [Team members](#team-members)
- [Project access](#team-access-to-projects)

###### Team name

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:update -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select the team you want to rename.

 - Enter the new name.

 - Confirm or adjust the team permissions.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

###### Project & environment type permissions

The primary purpose of teams is to allow organizations to quickly apply, audit, and update project and environment type permissions for groups of users. 

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:update -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select the team whose permissions you want to update.

 - Confirm or adjust the team name.

 - Adjust the team permissions.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

###### Team members

####### Add users to a team

To join a team, a user must already have been added [to the organization](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#manage-organization-access),
where their [organization permissions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions) are defined.

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:user:add -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select the team you want to add a user to.

 - Enter the user’s email address.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

**Note**: 

To view a list of all the users on a team, follow these steps:

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:user:list -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select the team whose users you want to display.

####### Remove users from a team

Note that deleting users from teams and deleting users from organizations are not equivalent.
Deleting users from a team will remove member access permissions to projects described by the team,
but it will _not_ [remove users from the organization](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#remove-a-user-from-an-organization) (or your billing).

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:user:delete -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select a team.

 - Select the user you want to remove from the team.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

###### Team access to projects

####### Adding projects to a team's access

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:project:add -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select a team.

 - Select the project you want the team to access.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

**Note**: 

To view a list of all the projects added to a team, follow these steps:

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:project:list -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select the team whose projects you want to display.

####### Remove project from team's access

 - Run the following command:

```bash {}
platform team:project:delete -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME>
```

 - Select a team.

 - Select the project whose access you want to revoke for the team.

 - Enter ``Y`` to confirm.

### Administer users

Upsun Fixed offers fine-grained and flexible user permissions across projects and organizations.
When a user is added to a project, they are automatically added to your organization.

##### Manage project access

If you have set up an external integration to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and your users can't clone the project locally,
see how to [troubleshoot source integrations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source/troubleshoot.md).

###### Project roles

A user can have one of the following roles to control their access at project level:

| Role           | View environment | Push code | Manage user access | Change settings | Execute actions on all environments |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Project admin  | Yes              | Yes       | Yes                | Yes             | Yes                                 |
| Project viewer | Yes              | No        | No                 | No              | No                                  |

By default, organization owners have **Project admin** access on all of the projects within their organization.

###### Environment type roles

An environment type (Production, Staging, and Development) groups one or more environments together so that you can manage access for all environments of that type:

- A role assigned to an environment type applies to all environments of that type.
- Only one environment per project can be of the type: Production.
  It is set automatically as the default branch and can't be overridden separately.
- You can change an environment's type (except for the Production environment).
- You can have multiple preview (staging and development) environments.

A user can have one of the following roles on an environment type which grants them permissions on all environments of this type:

| Role        | View environment | Force push | Push code | Branch environment | SSH access | Change settings | Execute actions |
|-------------|------------------|------------|-----------|--------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Admin       | Yes              | Yes        | Yes       | Yes                | Yes        | Yes             | Yes             |
| Contributor | Yes              | No         | Yes       | Yes                | Yes        | No              | No              |
| Viewer      | Yes              | No         | No        | Yes                | No         | No              | No              |

To customize which roles can use SSH, set [`access` in your app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#access).

###### View a user's permissions across all of the projects in your organization

For each user, you can view a summary of their roles and permissions
across all projects in your organization.

 - Open the organization menu (your organization name in the upper-left).
 - Click **Users**.
 - For the user whose user permissions you want to view, click **More More**.
 - Click **Edit user**.

###### Add a user to a project

To invite a user, you need to be a [project admin](#project-roles).

To add a user, follow these steps:

For example, if you want to add ``user1@example.com`` to the project as a project admin,
run the following command:

```bash {}
platform user:add user1@example.com -r admin
```

If you want to add ``user2@example.com`` to the project as a contributor for Development environments
and a viewer for Staging environments,
run the following command:

```bash {}
platform user:add user2@example.com -r development:contributor -r staging:viewer
```

 - Select the project where you want to add a new user.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Access**.
 - Click **+ Add**.
 - Add the user’s details and choose their permissions.
 - Click **Save**.

The user has to create an account before they can access the project.
Once you add a user to a project, they receive an invitation email with instructions.

To apply SSH access changes after you add a user to a project,
[trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

###### Manage project users

To manage user permissions on a project, you need to be a [project admin](#project-roles),
be an organization owner, or have the [**Manage users** permission for the organization](#organization-permissions).

To change user permissions, follow these steps:

If you want ``user1@example.com`` to be a viewer for Production environments
and a contributor for Development environments,
run the following command:

```bash {}
platform user:update user1@example.com -r production:viewer,development:contributor
```

 - Select the project where you want to update user access.
 - Click Settings **Settings**.
 - Click **Access**.
 - Click the user you want to update permissions for.
 - Update environment type permissions, or click **Remove user**.
 - Click **Accept**.

To apply SSH access changes after you add a remove a user from a project or environment type,
[trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

###### Remove a user from a project

To remove a user from a project, you need to be a [project admin](#project-roles),
be an organization owner, or have the [**Manage users** permission for the organization](#organization-permissions).

To remove a user, follow these steps:

 - Open the organization menu (your organization name in the upper-left).
 - Click **Users**.
 - For the user you want to remove, click **More More**.
 - Click on the **Projects** tab.
 - For the project you want to remove them from, click **More More**.
 - Click **Remove from project**.
 - Click **Yes**.

To apply SSH access changes after changing a user's permissions for an environment type,
[trigger a redeploy](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/troubleshoot.md#force-a-redeploy).

##### Manage organization access

All users who are added to any project within an organization become members of that organization.
By default, such users have no [organization permissions](#organization-permissions).
You can also have organization users who aren't part of any projects.

Users who are a part of an organization with the **List projects** permission can see all projects in that organization at the organization's URL,
which takes the form `https://console.platform.sh/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>`.
They can only access projects they've been explicitly invited to.
For more information on project access control, see how to [manage project users](#manage-project-users).

###### Organization permissions

As an organization owner or an organization user with the **Manage users** permission, you can invite other users to your organization and grant them the following permissions:

- **Admin** (`owner`):
  Manage the organization and access all organization permissions, including all listed below.
- **Manage billing** (`billing`):
  Add, remove, and edit billing information.
  Access invoices and vouchers.
  Users with this permission receive monthly invoices by email.
- **Manage plans** (`plans`):
  View and edit plans and plan options for existing projects.
  Plan options include the amount of storage, number of environments, and number of user licenses on a project.
- **Manage users** (`members`):
  Add, remove, and edit organization-level users and permissions, except their own.
  Users with this permission can't grant other users permissions that they themselves don't have.
- **Create projects** (`projects:create`):
  Create new projects within the organization.
- **List projects** (`projects:list`):
  See all projects in an organization, even those the user can't access.

**Note**: 

Users with the **Manage users** (``members``) permission can add, edit, or remove any user’s permissions except their own.

Users with the **Manage billing** (``billing``) or **Manage Plans** (``plans``) permission automatically are granted **List projects** (``projects:list``) permission.
That is, they are able to see all organization projects once given billing or plans rights.

Users without any of these permissions can only access [projects where they're users](#project-roles).
They can't access or manage the rest of the organization.

Organization owners have all permissions within their organization.
Their permission level can't be edited.
Organization owners can't be removed from their organization,
except through an [ownership transfer](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/organizations.md#transfer-project-ownership).

###### Add a user to an organization

For example, to invite ``alice@example.com`` to the ``acme`` organization
with the **Manage billing** and **Create projects** permissions, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform organization:user:add alice@example.com --org acme --permission billing,projects:create
```

 - Open the organization menu (your organization name in the upper-left).
 - Click **Users**.
 - Click **+ Invite users**.
 - Enter the users’ email addresses separated by commas.
 - Select which organization-wide permissions they should have.
 - Click **Invite**.

All users you invite receive an invitation email with instructions.

###### Manage organization users

For example, to update the permissions for ``alice@example.com`` in your ``acme`` organization
so that she has only the **Manage billing** permission, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform organization:user:update alice@example.com --org acme --permission billing
```

 - Navigate to the organization you want to manage (or a project in it).
 - Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
 - Click **Users**.
 - Next to the user you want to manage, click **More More**.
 - Click **Edit user**.

You see all the projects the user is a part of and their permissions in those projects.
You also see their permissions across the organization.
To edit their organization permissions, follow these steps:

 - Select or clear the checkboxes for the relevant permissions.
 - Click **Save**.
 - Click **Yes**.

###### Remove a user from an organization

For example, to remove ``alice@example.com`` from your ``acme`` organization, run the following command:

```bash {}
platform organization:user:delete alice@example.com --org acme
```

 - Navigate to the organization you want to manage (or a project in it).
 - Open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
 - Click **Users**.
 - Next to the user you want to remove, click **More More**.
 - Click **Remove from organization**.

To delete users in bulk, select the users to remove and click **Remove users from organization**.

Remove a user from an organization will remove them from all projects they were a member of.
### Pricing

Upsun Fixed offers a variety of plans to fit your needs, including a free trial.

Full pricing information is available at https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/.
The resources listed there are for [production environments](#production-environments).

You can switch between plans freely, adding or removing resources, including [extras](#extras).
You are always billed for the prorated cost over the period it was used.

You may cancel your plan at any time.
You are only billed for the actual period used.

##### Plans

###### Production plans

Any plan larger than a Development plan counts as a Production plan:
it comes with a [production environment](#production-environments).

###### Development plans

A Development plan provides all the tools you need to build your website
before it's ready to go live.

With a Development plan, you can't use [custom domain names](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).
You also can't use a Development plan for production
since it doesn’t allow for full production-level resources.

After your project is complete and ready for production,
choose [another plan](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/pricing.md) to go live.

###### Production environments

Production environments are the live environments available to your users.
Each Production plan has one Production environment that can be mapped to a [custom domain name](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps.md).

The production environment has more resources than the project's preview environments.
See the main [pricing page](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) for the resources available per plan for Production environments.

###### Preview environments

Preview environments can't use the same custom domain as a production environment.
Instead, you can set up specific [custom domains for each of your preview environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/steps/custom-domains-preview-environments.md).

Preview environments use resources that are separate from production environments.

App containers on preview environments default to a size of Standard
.
If you have the [manage plans permission](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/users.md#organization-permissions),
you can increase the size to match your production environment.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. In your project in the Console, click **Settings Settings**.
2. Click **Edit plan**.
3. Under **Environments application size**, select a new size.
4. Click **Save** to accept the new plan cost.

This increases the size for all app containers.
It doesn't affect service containers.

##### Switch plans

To switch plans, follow these steps:

1. In your project in the Console, click **Settings Settings**.
2. Click **Edit plan**.
3. Under **Plans**, select a new plan.
4. Click **Save** to accept the new plan cost.

##### Extras

In addition to the included resources for a plan, you can add extras to help scale your project.

All extra consumption is prorated to the time it was actually used.
For example, if you add an extra user for 10 days,
you're billed around 1/3 of the current price for a full month.

You can add the following extras:

* Users -- for an additional fee per user, except at certain [agency levels](#agencies).
* Environments -- extra preview environments can be added in multiples of 3.
* Storage -- extra storage can be added for a fee per 5 GB per environment.
  So if you have added 3 additional environments for a total of 6 preview environments,
  the fee is multiplied by 6.
  To ensure environments are available on demand, the fee applies to all environments you have added
  even if you aren't currently actively using them.

  You can make any changes up to 100 GB yourself.
  For storage over 100 GB, open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

  You currently can't reduce your storage on your own for technical reasons.
  If you need to reduce storage, open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### Multiple apps in a single project

All plans support multiple containers, but the containers share the plan's global resources.

The resources of a Standard plan can support a single app with services.
But they **aren't sufficient to run more than one app** with a service.
Useful multi-app projects start at Medium
.
For example, a Medium
 plan can support 3 apps
with a MySQL service and a Redis service.

If you aren't sure whether a specific setup would fit into a plan,
don't hesitate to [contact support](https://console.upsun.com/-/users/~/tickets).

##### Enterprise overages

**The following applies to all Enterprise and Elite subscriptions.**

If your apps happen to receive and send more traffic during the month than your plan includes,
you are charged the overage rate for additional bandwidth consumption.

If you experience repeated overages, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager to review your existing contract.

Plans with a Fastly CDN service include the following:

- 1 TB of egress (outgoing) bandwidth on the CDN (Fastly) per month
- 50 million ingress (incoming) requests on the CDN per month

###### Overage prices

| SKU             | Description                                                                             | USD  | EUR  | AUD    | CAD    | GBP  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|--------|--------|------|
| `EDGE-ORN-OVERAGE-1TB`    | Origin Egress Bandwidth: 1TB               | $209  | €155  | AU$303 | CA$284 | £161  |
| `EDGE-BDW-OVERAGE-1TB`    | Edge Egress Bandwidth: 1TB               | $88  | €65  | AU$128 | CA$119 | £68  |

###### Monitor monthly traffic usage

You can access a summary of your monthly traffic usage under the "Traffic this month" section at the Project level inside [Console](https://console.upsun.com/). This will help you monitor your monthly bandwidth and requests consumption. 

In this summary, you will find specific details about:

- **Origin Bandwidth:** Data transferred from origin servers (in TB).

- **Origin Requests:** Requests served by origin servers (in millions of requests).

- **CDN Bandwidth & CDN Requests:** Shown if you have Fastly CDN enabled.

This data is updated daily and will reflect your traffic usage throughout the billing period. 

###### Monthly traffic alerts

You can also set up consumption alerts for your resource usage. To do so, click the Alert button in the ["Traffic this month" block within Console](#monitor-monthly-traffic-usage):

![Access the alert settings from the traffic usage section](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/traffic-block.png "0.4")

This will open a modal, as shown below. 

![Set your alert notifications](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/metrics/alerts-modal.png "0.4")

Here you can configure usage thresholds for Origin bandwidth, Origin requests, CDN bandwidth and CDN requests (if applicable).

If a threshold is exceeded during the month, you’ll receive an email notification.

####### Alert access and duration

For all projects where an alert has been defined and enabled, if monthly usage rises above the defined threshold, an email is sent to the same list of users who receive billing alerts:

- Organization owner
- Organization members with billing role
- Billing contact of the organization (if there is one)

Alerts are sent once a day, after the job that pulls usage data into Accounts has finished.
Once a threshold is crossed, we send a maximum of 3 alerts, on 3 consecutive days (1 per day). After this, alerts will stop.

###### DDoS surge protection

If your site is suffering from a DDoS attack, overages may apply.
You can contact your Customer Success Manager to add DDoS surge protection to your plan.

| SKU                    | Description                                | USD    | EUR    | AUD      | CAD      | GBP    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| `EDGE-DDOS-PROTECTION` | Surge protection for DDoS related overages | $2,400 | €1778 | AU$3,480 | CA$3,257 | £1,847 |

### Server upgrades

Upsun Fixed runs a variety of servers to deliver its services.
To ensure your projects get the newest features, these servers are occasionally updated.

You don't have to do anything to get the updates.
When they're ready for your project, you see an activity about the server being updated in your [activity logs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md#activity-logs).
These activities don't cause downtime for your project.

The log of the specific activity includes a description of what has changed with the update.

##### Affected servers

###### Project API server

The project API server responds to API calls to make the CLI and Console work for your project.
It acts as the Git server, mirroring the source repository in the case of [source integrations](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/integrations/source.md).

It stores your app code and project configuration, provides API interfaces,
and orchestrates the build and deploy process and other tasks for your environments.

###### Project metrics server

The project metrics server retrieves information about your environments' use of RAM, CPU, and disk.
You can view this information as part of [environment metrics](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/metrics.md).
### Security
#### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Multifactor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by protecting both your organization and every user account that interacts with it
through SSH or the Upsun Fixed API.

When MFA is enforced within an organization, every project contributor **must** enable MFA on their user account so they can run Git commands,
SSH into an environment, or trigger actions through the Upsun Fixed API.

###### Enable MFA on your user account

To access an organization that enforces MFA or any of its projects,
you **must** enable MFA on your user account.
Failure to do so results in forbidden access to the organization from the Console or API,
and an [error message](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/ssh/troubleshoot-ssh.md#mfa-related-error-message) when trying to SSH into its environments.

To enable MFA on your user account, follow these steps:

1. In the Console, open the user menu (your name or profile picture).
1. Click **My profile**.
1. On the **Authentication Settings** tab, click **Set up application**.
1. Follow the instructions for the chosen authentication app.
1. Click **Verify & save**.
1. Refresh your SSH credentials by running `platform login -f` in the CLI.

###### Enforce MFA within your organization

  **Tier availability**
  This feature is available for
  **Elite and Enterprise** customers. [Compare the  tiers](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/) on our pricing page, or [contact our sales team](https://upsun.com/contact-us/
  ) for more information.

Prerequisites:
- You must be an **organization owner** or **admin user**.
- You must first [enable MFA on _your own_ user account](#enable-mfa-on-your-user-account) as described above. 

To enforce MFA within your organization, follow these steps:

1. In the Console, select an organization from the organization menu in the upper left of the page.
1. Click the organization name again, and from the expanded menu, click **Security**. 

   On the **Security** tab, in the **User security settings** section, you can see which users in your organization have [activated MFA for their user accounts](#enable-mfa-on-your-user-account).

1. In the **MFA required** section, click the **Enable MFA** toggle to the on position.

####### Send email reminders

To send email reminders to users who haven't enabled MFA on their account:

1. In the Console, select an organization from the organization menu in the upper left of the page.
2. Click the organization name again, and from the expanded menu, click **Security**. 
3. On the **Security** tab, in the **User security settings** section, complete the steps below based on the action you want to take.

   - To send an email reminder to an individual user, click **More More** beside the user's name and then click **Remind**. 

   - To send an email reminder to multiple users at once, select the checkbox beside the names of the users you want to remind. To remind _all_ of the users who do not have MFA enabled, select the **Name** checkbox at the top of the list. Then, near the **Name** checkbox, click **Remind**.

An email is sent to the user with instructions on how to enable MFA on their user account.
#### Single Sign-On (SSO)


Upsun Fixed enables you to set up mandatory SSO with a third-party identity provider (IdP) for all your users.

Your SSO provider can be enabled for a specific email domain, for example `@example.com`. Every user with a matching email address needs to log in or register on Upsun Fixed using your SSO provider. Such users can't use an alternative provider, or register a password, or change their email address.

###### Mitigation controls

If you deactivate a user on your identity provider, they can't log in or register on Upsun Fixed.

If the user is already logged in to Upsun Fixed, they are automatically deactivated after their access token has expired (generally after 1 hour).

A deactivated user can no longer use SSH, Git, or other Upsun Fixed APIs.

###### Service users

If you have a service user with an email address under your SSO domain, such as `machine-user@example.com`, you can exclude that user from the SSO enforcement rule so they aren't required to authenticate through your identity provider.

Please open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md) if you need to exclude a service user.

###### SSO providers

####### Google

  **Tier availability**

Enforce your users to authenticate with Google. To enable Google SSO, please [create a Support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md#create-a-support-ticket). 

######## Issue with re-authenticating every 15 minutes

If your organization has Google SSO enabled on Upsun Fixed, you may be required to re-authenticate with Google every 15 minutes. This happens when Upsun Fixed doesn't possess a valid refresh token from your Google account.

To resolve this issue:

1. Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and revoke the access from the `Upsun Fixed` application that has `Access given to auth.api.platform.sh`.
2. Go to [https://auth.upsun.com/auth/authorize/google?prompt=consent](https://auth.upsun.com/auth/authorize/google?prompt=consent) for the system to obtain a valid refresh token for your Google account.

####### OpenId Connect

### Data retention


Upsun Fixed logs and stores various types of data as a normal part of its business. This information is only retained as needed to perform relevant business functions. Retention periods vary depending on the type of data stored. If a legal obligation, law enforcement request, or ongoing business need so requires, data may be retained after the original purpose for which it was collected ceases to exist.

##### Account information

Information relating to customer accounts (login information, billing information, etc.) is retained for as long as the account is active with Upsun Fixed.

Customers may request that their account be deleted and all related data be purged by opening a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### System logs

System level access and security logs are maintained by Upsun Fixed for diagnostic purposes.
These logs aren't customer-accessible.
These logs are retained for at least 6 months and at most 2 years depending upon legal and standards compliance required for each system.

##### Application logs

Application logs on each customer environment are retained with the environment.
Individual log files are truncated at 100 MB, regardless of their age.
See how to [access logs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md).

When an environment is deleted, its application logs are deleted as well.

##### Grid Backups

[Automated backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md#use-automated-backups) are retained for a specific amount of time
depending on their type and your [backup schedule](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md#backup-schedule).

| Type     | Basic  | Advanced | Premium |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |

| Daily    | 2 days | 1 week   | 1 month |
| Weekly   | –      | 4 weeks  | –       |
| Monthly  | –      | 1 year   | 1 year  |

[Manual backups](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md#create-a-manual-backup) are retained until you delete them or replace them with another backup.

For example, if you currently have 10 manual backups and are on the Advanced schedule,
you keep all 10 manual backups until there are 15 automated backups.
Then the automated backups start replacing the manual ones until you have only your allocated 4 manual backups.

Backups associated with an environment are retained according to the [backup cycles](#backup-cycles) outlined below, so long as the environment still exists in the project.
That is, backups are deleted when the corresponding environment is deleted.

###### Backup cycles

Backups are created and retained in a cycle.
As the cycle restarts, the first backup of that stage passes down to the next stage.
The following is an example of the cycle using the shortest stage (6-hourly backups) from the Premium schedule.
The times are just for understanding as actual backup times vary by project.

The first cycle is 4 backups (6-hourly backups) made in one day.

![Four 6-hourly backups get taken on a Monday.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/backup-cycles/first-cycle.png "0.215-inline")

The first backup doesn’t expire after one day but is retained for the next cycle.

![The first 6-hourly backup is a daily backup.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/backup-cycles/retain.png "0.215-inline")

As additional backups are created, the oldest backups are replaced and no longer available.

![When two backups are taken on Tuesday, the 6-hourly backups from Monday start becoming unavailable.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/backup-cycles/replace-backup.png "0.3-inline")

When the next cycle completes, it has replaced the previous cycle.

![When two backups are taken on Tuesday, the 6-hourly backups from Monday start becoming unavailable.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/backup-cycles/replace-cycle.png "0.375-inline")

####### Advanced schedule retention

The following diagram shows how the cycle works for the entire Advanced schedule:

![Daily backups are retained for 1 week. The first daily backup is the weekly backup. Weekly backups are retained for 1 month. The first weekly backup is the monthly backup. Monthly backups are retained for 1 year.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/backup-cycles/advanced-retention.png "0.6")

####### Premium schedule retention

The following diagram shows how the cycle works for the entire Premium schedule:

![Each 6-hourly backup is retained for 1 day. The first 6-hourly backup is the daily backup. Daily backups are retained for 30 days. The first daily backup is the monthly backup. Monthly backups are retained for 1 year.](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/backup-cycles/premium-retention.png "0.6")

##### Dedicated Gen 2 backups

Backups for Dedicated Gen 2 environments are retained based on when they were taken.

| When taken   | Retention            |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| Days 1--3    | Every backup         |
| Days 4--6    | One backup per day   |
| Weeks 2--6   | One backup per week  |
| Weeks 8--12  | One bi-weekly backup |
| Weeks 12--22 | One backup per month |

See more about [backups of Dedicated Gen 2 environments](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/environment-differences.md#backups).

##### Tombstone backups

When a project is deleted, Upsun Fixed takes a final backup of active environments, as well as the Git repository holding user code.
This final backup is to allow Upsun Fixed to recover a recently deleted project in case of accident.

These "tombstone" backups are retained for between 7 days and 6 months depending upon legal and standards compliance required for each system.

##### Analytics

Upsun Fixed uses Google Analytics on various web pages, and so Google Analytics stores collected data for a period of time.
We have configured our Google Analytics account to store data for 14 months from the time you last accessed our site, which is the minimum Google allows.
### Project isolation

Upsun Fixed handles project isolation slightly differently based on which underlying architecture your project lives on.

All Dedicated Gen 2 clusters are single-tenant.
They provide three hosts that are exclusively used by a single customer.
Each cluster is launched into its own isolated network (VPC on AWS, equivalent on other providers).

**For all projects**, regardless of the underlying architecture:

- The network is behind a firewall for incoming connections.
  Only a few ports are opened to incoming traffic by default: ports 22, 80, and 443.

- Outgoing TCP traffic is not blocked, **with the exception of port 25**.

- Both incoming and outgoing UDP traffic is blocked.

**Note**: 

For containers to be allowed to connect to each other, the following requirements must be met:

 - The containers must live in the same environment.
 - You need to define an explicit relationship between the containers in your app configuration.

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

To protect your app from common security threats,
Upsun Fixed provides its own Web Application Firewall (WAF).
You can also subscribe to the Fastly Next-Gen WAF through Upsun Fixed.#### Upsun Fixed WAF

Enterprise and Elite projects on Upsun Fixed come with a web application firewall (WAF) at no additional cost.
This WAF monitors requests to your app and blocks suspicious ones.

All traffic to Upsun Fixed endpoints is also filtered
using a system that takes into account traffic patterns and abuse scores.

**Note**: 

The Upsun Fixed WAF is not configurable.
If you are looking for more advanced, configurable options that can be added to the Upsun Fixed WAF, see [the Fastly Next-Gen WAF](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/security/web-application-firewall/fastly-waf.md).

###### CRLF injection prevention

Carriage return and line feed (CRLF) injection occurs when an attacker injects a CRLF character sequence to manipulate HTTP requests.
CRLF injection can lead to [request smuggling](#request-smuggling),
[header injection](#header-injection), and [response splitting](#response-splitting) attacks.

To protect your app from such attacks, the WAF detects and blocks requests containing CRLF character sequences.

####### Request smuggling

When a frontend server forwards HTTP requests to a backend server,
it usually sends a series of requests at once.
The backend server then parses the request headers
to determine where one request ends and the next one begins.

The [HTTP protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) provides two different headers
to specify where an HTTP request ends: `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.

When the frontend and backend servers don’t agree on which header they should interpret as the end of a request,
attackers can smuggle requests. If a malicious request is injected, the backend server may misinterpret the boundaries
of the individual requests within the concatenated request, thereby processing a request differently from what was
intended. This can lead to various security risks such as data leakage, privilege escalation, and even remote code
execution.

The WAF detects and blocks requests that contain [both the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers](#content-length-and-transfer-encoding-headers-together).
It also detects and blocks requests that include **both** of the following features of an attempt to inject a malicious request:

- A [CRLF character](#crlf-injection-prevention) or `http/\d`
- An `HTTP` or `WEBDAV` method name

####### Header injection

During a header injection attack, the attacker tricks your app
into inserting extra HTTP headers into legitimate HTTP responses.
These attacks can happen when HTTP response headers are generated based on user input.

Header injection attacks can have various impacts,
including cookie injection, [cross-origin resource sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) header injection,
and bypassing your content security policy.
Such attacks enable [response splitting](#response-splitting),
which in turn can lead to [cross-site scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting),
web cache poisoning, and so on.

The WAF detects header injection attempts occurring through the payload and the header itself.
By [blocking requests containing CRLF](#crlf-injection-prevention) character sequences,
the WAF prevents malicious data from being returned in a response header and interpreted by the client.

####### Response splitting

When a user makes an HTTP request, the web server usually returns a single HTTP response.
But when an attacker succeeds in [injecting headers](#header-injection),
they can launch a [response splitting attack](https://www.cs.montana.edu/courses/csci476/topics/http_response_splitting.pdf).

During a response splitting attack, the attacker uses CRLF characters to inject additional HTTP responses into legitimate user requests.
This enables further attacks such as [cross-site scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting),
web cache poisoning, browser cache poisoning, and cross-user attacks.

As the WAF [blocks requests containing CRLF](#crlf-injection-prevention) character sequences,
your app is protected from response splitting attacks.

###### HTTP protocol enforcement

In addition to protecting your site against [CRLF injection-related](#crlf-injection-prevention) attacks,
the WAF implements additional rules to enforce the HTTP protocol.

####### Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) syntax

[RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) defines the generic syntax for URIs.
When the WAF detects a URI with incorrect syntax, the incoming connection is terminated.
The request is then reconstructed on the internal Upsun Fixed network,
enforcing the valid format in transit.

####### File upload limit

The WAF enforces a file upload limit.
By default, this limit is set at 250 MB.

You can customize the file upload limit by amending your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).
In the [`web.locations` dictionary](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations),
add your desired value for the `max_request_size` property.

####### File extension restriction

The WAF enforces any file extension restriction you may have defined in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps.md).

To set up a file extension restriction,
adjust the [`web.locations` dictionary](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations).
Set up [rules](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#rules) to allow only certain file extensions on a given path.

####### Disallowed requests and headers

######## `GET` requests with a body

The [HTTP specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) allows for `GET` requests to have a body.
This enables attackers to try and force a request body on unsuspecting applications,
which could result in a [request smuggling attack](#request-smuggling).

To prevent such attacks, when the WAF detects a `GET` request,
it scans the request for a potential `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` header.

If one of those headers is found and the payload isn't `0` or empty,
all body-related headers are removed from the request.
The request is then passed through otherwise unaltered.

######## `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers together

According to the [HTTP specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616),
requests mustn't contain [both a `Content-Length` and a `Transfer-Encoding` header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2).
This rule helps protect apps from [request smuggling](#request-smuggling).

The WAF detects and blocks requests featuring both headers
and forces requests to use [chunked transfer encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding)
only on the internal Upsun Fixed network.

######## Missing or empty `host` headers

As [routes are mapped](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/define-routes.md) based on host names,
the Upsun Fixed WAF blocks requests with an empty or absent `host` header.

######## Other restricted HTTP headers

The following headers are disallowed: `Connection`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `TE`, and `Upgrade`.

###### Slowloris DDoS attack prevention

Slowloris DDoS attacks use partial HTTP requests to open connections between a single computer and a targeted web server.
These connections are then kept open for as long as possible to overwhelm the web server.

While Apache web servers are vulnerable to Slowloris attacks, Nginx servers aren't.
Since Upsun Fixed router services use Nginx processes,
your projects are protected against such attacks.

### Overview


Our Dedicated Environments are well-suited for those who need more resources and redundancy, along with stricter isolation requirements.

When you create an Upsun Fixed project, you can choose to deploy it using one of the following types of architecture offerings: Professional (known as [Grid](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#grid)) or [Dedicated Generation 2](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2.md) (DG2). 

##### What is Dedicated?

DG2 is classified as a Dedicated Environment (Dedicated). This is because your production environment is replicated across at least three virtual servers that are dedicated solely to your project.

In the diagram below, we can see that the Dedicated architecture provides three virtual servers that act as isolated hosts for a site in a failover configuration. Within each server, all the data of your site is synced.

![The dedicated architecture](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/dedicated/dedicated-architecture.svg "0.50")

Having three isolated hosts means that when one becomes unavailable, the others take over, so your site will always remain up and running. This differs from the Grid architecture, where a single host runs multiple projects from various customers simultaneously. 

From the Grid architecture diagram below, we can see that projects hosted in Grid share resources. The CPU, memory, and networking with other projects are all running on the same host. There is only one host that can be relied on in a failover configuration, and this host also holds the resources of various other sites. There is also a [Ceph](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#ceph) storage dependency.

![The grid architecture](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/dedicated/grid-architecture.svg "0.50")

##### Deployment

With a Dedicated Environment, you are given the freedom to deploy into **any public region of supported IaaS providers** (currently **AWS, Azure, GCP, OVH**). This differs from the Grid architecture, which is solely available in [public regions](https://upsun.com/regions/).

For a full list of public regions and IP addresses, visit the [Regions page](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md#regions).

In a Grid region, incoming and outgoing traffic is handled via central region gateways, and [publicly available IP addresses](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/regions.md#public-ip-addresses) can be used for external firewalls. The public IP addresses for these public regions are stable but not guaranteed never to change.

##### Grid vs Dedicated

Whether you choose a Grid or Dedicated Environment depends on the needs you have. In the table below, you can see the different ways in which either might work for you:

### {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}}
#### Dedicated Gen 2 Overview


Dedicated Generation 2 is a robust, redundant layer. It’s well-suited for those who like the Upsun Fixed development experience but need more resources and redundancy for their production environment.

Dedicated Generation 2 consists of two parts: a development environment and a Dedicated Gen 2 cluster.

####### Key features

-   **High Availability:** 99.99% SLA (service-level agreement) with [Enterprise or Elite](https://upsun.com/fixed-pricing/)
-   **Dedicated hosts:** Each DG2 cluster is provisioned with 3 dedicated hosts as the typical configuration
-   **Headless architecture:** Seamless headless architecture with multi-app support
-   **Isolation:** On DG2, services run as processes on the base operating system (OS)
-   **Storage:** Storage allocation between mounts, DB and services is done through Upsun once a ticket is raised. Storage management is not self-service

###### Dedicated Generation 2 vs Grid

Much of the tooling used on Grid is used for DG2, but there are still some differences. Please find a list of the similarities and differences between these two environments below:

####### Optional features

You can enable the following features on your Dedicated Gen 2 projects. To enable an optional feature or get more information on potential fees, [contact Sales](https://upsun.com/contact-us/).

######## Multiple applications

You can create multiple apps within a single project so they can share data. This can be useful if you have several apps that are closely related, such as a backend-only CMS and a frontend system for content delivery and display.

For more information, see how to [configure multiple apps in a single project](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/multi-app.md).

######## Staging environments 

A dedicated single-node staging machine is provisioned for your application with an identical software configuration to your production hardware, but reduced hardware specs. This gives the advantages of isolating the staging load from the production hardware as well as having an identical software configuration to perform UAT, but this option doesn’t provide a bed for performance testing as the physical hardware configuration isn’t the same as production.

######## Additional application servers (Split Architecture)

For especially high-traffic sites we can also add additional application-only servers. These servers contain just the application code; data storage services (such as SQL, Solr, Redis) are limited to the standard three. The cluster begins to look more like a standard N-Tier architecture at this point, with a horizontal line of web application servers in front of a 3 node (N+1) cluster of Galera database servers.

Speak to your sales representative about the costs associated with adding additional application servers. This configuration requires a separate setup from the default so advanced planning is required.

######## SFTP 

In addition to SSH accounts, you can create SFTP accounts with a custom user/password that are restricted to certain directories. These directories must be one of the writeable mounts.

There is no cost for this configuration, and you can request it at any time via a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md). SSH public key based authentication is also supported on the SFTP account.

See how to [transfer files through sftp](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/file-transfer.md).

######## Error handling 

On Grid projects, incoming requests are held at the edge router temporarily during a deploy. That allows a site to “respond slowly” rather than be offline during a deploy, provided the deploy time is short (a few seconds).

On Dedicated Gen 2 projects, incoming requests aren’t held during deploy and receive a 503 error. As the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster is almost always fronted by a CDN, the CDN continues to serve cached pages during the few seconds of deploy, so for the vast majority of users there is no downtime or even slow down. If a request does pass the CDN during a deploy, it isn’t counted as downtime covered by our Service Level Agreement.

By default, Upsun Fixed serves generic Upsun-branded error pages for errors generated before a request reaches the application. (5XX errors, some 4XX errors, etc.) Alternatively you may provide a static error page for each desired error code via a ticket for us to configure with the CDN. This file may be any static HTML file but is limited to 64 KB in size.

######## Remote logging 

Dedicated Gen 2 supports sending logs to a remote logging service such as Loggly, Papertrail, or Logz.io using the rsyslog service. This is an optional feature and you can request that it be enabled via a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md). Once enabled and configured your application can direct log output to the system syslog facility and is replicated to the remote service you have configured.

When contacting support to enable rsyslog, you need:

-   The name of the remote logging service to use.
-   The message template format used by your logging service.
-   The specific log files you want forwarded to your logging service.

There is no cost for this functionality.

######## IP restrictions 

Upsun Fixed supports [project-level IP restrictions (allow/deny) and HTTP Basic authentication](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/http-access-control.md). These may be configured through the development environment and are automatically replicated from the production and staging branches to the production and staging environments, respectively.

Changing access control triggers a new deployment of the current environment. However, the changes aren’t propagated to child environments until they’re manually redeployed.

####### Updates

Upsun Fixed updates the core software of the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster (operating system, web server, PHP, MySQL, etc.) periodically, and after any significant security vulnerability is disclosed.

These updates are deployed automatically with no additional work required by you. We attempt to maintain parity with your development environment, but we don’t guarantee absolute parity of point versions of your Dedicated Gen 2 Environments with their corresponding development environments. For example, your development environment may have a PHP container running 8.1.30, but your production environment may lag behind at 8.1.26.

We can upgrade point releases on request and always upgrade the underlying software in the event of security release.

Updates to application software (PHP code, JavaScript, etc.) are the responsibility of the customer.

#### Dedicated Gen 2 Development

Learn about the [cluster infrastructure](#cluster-infrastructure) of Dedicated Generation 2, and discover key details about [split architecture](#split-architecture), [deployment](#deployment), [storage limits](#storage) and [memory](#memory).

####### Cluster infrastructure

Dedicated Gen 2 clusters (sometimes referred to below as DG2) are launched into a Triple Redundant configuration consisting of 3 hosts. This is an N+1 configuration that’s sized to withstand the total loss of any one of the 3 members of the cluster without incurring any downtime. Every service is replicated across all three hosts in a failover configuration (as opposed to sharding), allowing a site to remain up even if one of the hosts is lost entirely.

Each instance hosts the entire application stack, allowing this architecture superior fault tolerance to traditional N-Tier installations. Moreover, the Cores assigned to production are solely for production. 

######### Build process

The build process for your application is identical for both the Grid Environment and the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster. However, because the hosts are provisioned by Upsun Fixed, not as a container, service configuration must be done by Upsun’s Customer Success team.

For more information, learn about [default storage settings](#storage) and how your app can connect to services.

####### Split architecture

Split architecture works under Dedicated Generation 2 and allows you to give more resources globally to a project. Services (data services, caching service or search engines) are split from application runtimes. Services will be running on a cluster of core nodes, and the application will be running on a cluster of web nodes.

This allows us to grant more room for the application or the services regarding resources. Both clusters can differ in size. Split architecture clusters can horizontally scale the application by adding additional nodes. 

![Split architecture](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/images/dedicated/split-architecture.svg "0.50")

####### Deployment

The production branch of your Git repository is designated for production and a staging branch is designated for staging. Any code merged to those branches automatically triggers a rebuild of the production or staging environment in the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster. 

Any defined users or environment variables are also propagated to the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster.

**Note**: 

There is no automatic cloning of data from the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster to the development environments like there is between the grid-based development branches.

 

Production data may still be replicated to the development environment [manually](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/administration/cli/reference.md#environmentsynchronize). Deployments of other branches don’t trigger rebuilds of the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster Environments.

######## Deployment process 

When deploying to the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster the process is slightly different than when working with Upsun Fixed on the Grid.

-   The new application image is built in the exact same fashion as for the Grid.
-   Any active background tasks on the cluster, including cron tasks, are terminated.
-   The cluster (production or staging) is closed, meaning it doesn’t accept new requests. Incoming requests receive an HTTP 503 response.
-   The application image on all three servers is replaced with the new image.
-   The deploy hook is run on one, and only one, of the three servers.
-   The cluster is opened to allow new requests.

**Note**: 

Note that hooks still run without containers. For example, [commands like ](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#web-commands) and other hooks run directly on the app docroot or worker service.

The deploy usually takes approximately 30-90 seconds, although that is dependent on how your deploy hook has been configured.

During the deploy process the cluster is unavailable. All Dedicated Gen 2 instances are fronted by the Fastly Content Delivery Network (CDN) unless you decide to bring your own CDN. You can also decide that you'd rather not use Fastly. Fastly can be configured to allow a “grace period”, meaning that requests to the origin that fail are served from the existing cache, even if that cache item is stale. We configure a default grace period that is longer than a typical deployment, and can extend that time upon request. That means anonymous users should see no interruption in service at all. Authenticated traffic that can’t be served by the CDN still sees a brief interruption.

For more information about deployment, see the [overview of the build and deploy phases](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/build-deploy.md).

####### Storage

The development environment for a Dedicated Gen 2 project provides production and staging branches linked to the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster and 3 additional active environments for development. This number can be increased if needed for an additional fee.

The default storage for Dedicated Gen 2 contracts is 50GB per environment (production, staging, and each development environment). This comprises total storage for your project and is inclusive of any databases, uploaded files, writable application logging directories, search index cores, and so on. The storage amount for your development environment reflects the amount in your Enterprise contract and can be altered based on the terms you agree.

A project may have up to six users associated with it at no additional charge. Additional users may be added for an additional fee. These users have access to both the development environment and the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster.

**Note**: 

While your DG2 production and staging Environments are on dedicated virtual machines, your development environments run on the [Grid](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#grid). This means that, by default, all containers in development environments are standard sized, as they have limited traffic needs. For more resource-intensive applications this size can be increased for an additional fee.

####### Memory

Dedicated Generation 2 includes a single node dedicated staging with 2 CPUs. This runs the same software configuration as the production cluster but only on a single node. This is usually enough for functional testing before moving to production. You can choose to upgrade your staging to a more powerful machine or add more than one dedicated staging system. Those will still be a single machine.
#### Environment differences

With Dedicated Gen 2 plans, your Production and Staging environments are on dedicated virtual machines, while your development environments run on the [Grid](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#grid), meaning shared redundant infrastructure. This difference means a few configuration options and tools function differently in the different environments.

###### Syncing data between environments

Because of the differences between Dedicated Gen 2 and Grid Environments,
basic [syncs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary/_index.md#sync) and [merges](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/glossary.md#merge) aren't available between development environments and production or staging environments. So you don't see working buttons with those options in the Console.

To transfer data between environments, backup your Production/Staging data and then synchronize Development data. See how to [back up and transfer data](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/development/transfer-dedicated.md#synchronize-files-from-development-to-stagingproduction).

###### Backups

Production environments are [backed up automatically](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md#backup-schedule).
For other environments, trigger a [manual backup](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/environments/backup.md).

###### PHP

####### Configuration options

**Note**: 

Most Dedicated Gen 2 projects allow you to use custom ``php.ini`` files on your production or staging environments. However, **for a small set of projects**, this isn’t supported yet.

If your project doesn't support PHP configuration through a `php.ini` file,
you can still change all PHP options that can be changed at runtime.
For example, change the memory limit using `ini_set('memory_limit','1024M');`.

For other PHP options, such as the following, [open a support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md):

* `max_execution_time`
* `max_input_time`
* `max_input_vars`
* `memory_limit`
* `post_max_size`
* `request_order`
* `upload_max_filesize`

####### Xdebug

All Dedicated Gen 2 clusters that have [Xdebug](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/xdebug.md) enabled have a second PHP-FPM process. This second process is used only when requests include the correct Xdebug key in a header.

So you can keep Xdebug always on and not worry about performance issues as it's ignored on most requests.

**To obtain the Xdebug key:**

1. Open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

**Note**: 

Staging and Production environments have separate keys.

2. Set that key in the Xdebug helper for your browser. Whenever you have Xdebug enabled, the request uses the alternate development PHP-FPM process with Xdebug.

###### Solr

On Grid environments, [Solr](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services/solr.md) runs as a standalone instance.
On Dedicated Gen 2 Environments, it runs as [SolrCloud](https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/solrcloud.md): a cluster of Solr servers to ensure high availability. This shouldn't affect you most of the time, but may influence certain advanced use cases.

###### Cron tasks interrupted by deploys

How [cron tasks](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#crons) interact with deploys changes based on the environment.

On Grid environments, a running cron task blocks a deploy until the cron is complete.
On Dedicated Gen 2 environments, a deploy terminates a running cron task.

Specifically, when a deploy to either Production or Staging begins,
any active cron tasks are sent a `SIGTERM` message so that they can terminate gracefully.
If they're still running 2 seconds later, a `SIGKILL` message is sent to forcibly terminate the process.

So it's best to ensure your cron tasks can receive a `SIGTERM` message and terminate gracefully.

###### Configuration & change management

You can't manage some configuration settings via YAML configuration files on Dedicated Gen 2 Environments.
In these cases, you need to open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).
You can have some settings different between staging and production environments.
It's assumed you want the settings the same, unless you state otherwise in the ticket.

The following settings require a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md):

* [Worker instances](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#workers)
* [Service configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/add-services.md)
* Relationships among services and apps
* Plan upsizing
* Increasing storage
* Allocating storage among mounts and services
* [PHP extensions](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/languages/php/extensions.md)
* Web server configuration (the [`web.locations` section of your app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#locations))

###### Logs

Dedicated Gen 2 Environments have a slightly different location for [container logs](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/logs/access-logs.md). The difference shouldn't be noticeable if you use the CLI.
### Security and monitoring

We use a combination of three trusted methods to ensure your site is secure and running at all times: 

- [Project isolation](#project-isolation)
- [Encryption](#encryption)
- [Performance monitoring](#performance-monitoring)

Security is handled in a similar way for both Dedicated Gen 2 and Dedicated Gen 3 projects, with strict procedures that are followed to handle incidents.

###### Project isolation 

All Dedicated clusters are single-tenant. The [three hosts](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/dedicated-environments/dedicated-gen-2/overview.md) are exclusively used by a single customer and each cluster is launched into its own isolated network (VPC on AWS, equivalent on other providers). The network is behind a firewall for incoming connections. Only ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS), and 2221 (SFTP) are opened to incoming traffic.

There are no exceptions for this rule, so any incoming web service requests, ETL jobs, or otherwise need to transact over one of these protocols. Outgoing TCP traffic isn’t behind a firewall. Outgoing UDP traffic is disallowed. For containers to be allowed to connect to each other, the following requirement must be met:

-   The containers must live in the same environment
-   You need to define an explicit relationship between the containers in your [app configuration](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#relationships)

All Dedicated projects are isolated and their data is fully encrypted. Should a security breach occur, Upsun follows a strict security incident handling procedure to deal with the issue as promptly and efficiently as possible.

###### Encryption 

All sites and tools supported and maintained by Upsun are fully encrypted by default. 

For more information about Encryption at Upsun, visit the [Upsun Trust Center](https://upsun.com/trust-center/security/encryption/).

###### Performance monitoring

All of our Dedicated clusters are monitored 24/7 to ensure uptime and to measure server metrics such as available disk space, memory and disk usage, and several dozen other metrics that give us a complete picture of the health of your application’s infrastructure. 

As soon as a metric goes out of bounds (i.e., an outage is detected), Support and Operations teams are alerted, a Point in Time report is generated, and the Upsun teams can triage the cause of the outage.

####### Automated monitoring

On top of internal Upsun Fixed tools, a third-party availability monitoring system is configured for every Dedicated project. This further guarantees that issues are spotted and addressed as quickly as possible. If you’re using a CDN, [make sure it’s configured](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/domains/cdn.md#configure-your-cdn-to-support-high-sla) to support automated monitoring and guarantee high SLA.

Automated monitoring is used to keep an eye on your production environment at all times. If automated monitoring triggers an alert, or if a customer files an urgent priority ticket, an on-call engineer is immediately paged so they can respond and begin to triage the issue.
Cloud infrastructure issues are handled by the Upsun Customer Success team. Note that application problems are returned to the user and may be downgraded.

####### Observability services

As the official, in-house Upsun Fixed observability tool, [Blackfire](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/blackfire.md) provides unparalleled monitoring, profiling, and performance testing technologies. Using Blackfire on Upsun Fixed enhances your experience and allows you to enjoy greater support as well as unique upcoming features.

As an Enterprise or Elite customer, you can use the Upsun [Observability](https://upsun.com/product/) feature, which offers application performance monitoring by Blackfire packaged with infrastructure monitoring. The Observability feature includes all Blackfire features, support, and usage that scales with your needs. 

Upsun Fixed also supports third-party observability services such as [New Relic](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/new-relic.md) and [Tideways](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/increase-observability/integrate-observability/tideways.md). You need to get your own license for them. These third-party services have their own associated cost, are language-specific, and may not be available for all languages.### Dedicated backup and restores


Backups are retained for different periods depending on various factors. These processes can be either manual or automated.

##### Dedicated Generation 2 Backups

Upsun Fixed takes a byte-for-byte snapshot of Dedicated Gen 2 production environments every 6 hours. Backups are retained for different durations depending on when they were taken. 

| Backup retention period     | Retention            |  # of backups from time period available |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1–3 days ago          | Every backup taken in that period | 6 (1 day) to 18 (3 days) |  
| 4-6 days ago         | One backup per day in that period  |   1 (4 days) to 3 (6 days) |
| 2–6 weeks ago      | One backup per week | 1 (2 weeks) to 5 (6 weeks) |
| 8–12 weeks ago   | One bi-weekly backup | 1 (8 weeks) to 3 (12 weeks) |    
| 12–22 weeks ago    | One backup per month | 1 (12 weeks) to 3 (22 weeks)  |

Put another way, the number of backups available for restoration - in each of the backup age groupings described above - might look as follows for a few Dedicated environment ages:

|  Environment age    | 72 hours old or younger  | 4-6 days old | 2-6 weeks old | 8-12 weeks old | 12-22 old  | Total |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| 1 week               |         18            |        3             |          0                |            0              |              0                |   21  |
| 12 weeks           |         18            |        3              |            5            |         3                   |               0               |  29  |
| 52+ weeks        |         18            |        3              |            5            |         3                  |           3                    |   32 |

Backups are created using snapshots saved to encrypted elastic block storage (EBS) volumes. An EBS snapshot is immediate, but the time it takes to write to the storage service depends on the volume of changes.

-   Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is 6 hours (maximum time to last backup).
-   Recovery Time Objective (RTO) depends on the size of the storage. Large EBS volumes take more time to restore.

These backups are only used in cases of catastrophic failure and can only be restored by Upsun. To request a restoration, open a [support ticket](https://fixed.docs.upsun.com/learn/overview/get-support.md).

##### Dedicated Generation 2 restoration
 
The restoration process for Dedicated Generation 2 Environments may take a few hours, depending on the infrastructure provider in use. In the ticket, specify if you want backups of files, MySQL, or both. Uploaded files are placed in an SSH-accessible directory on the Dedicated Gen 2 cluster. 

MySQL is provided as a MySQL dump file on the server. You may restore these to your site at your leisure. You are also free to make your own backups using standard tools (mysqldump, rsync, etc.).

**Note**: 

Upsun Fixed does not proactively overwrite your production site with a backup. You are responsible for determining a “safe” time to restore the backup, or for selectively restoring individual files if desired.
