# Image properties

**Note:** The properties below are available in **both** [single-runtime image](https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#) and [composable image](https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#) types. 

For most of these properties, the syntax and details are the same for both image types. Differences in meaning and syntax are noted as needed for each property.

To learn about the properties that are **unique to each image type**, refer to the top-level properties described in the [single-runtime image](https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/single-runtime-image.md#) topic or the primary application properties described in the [composable image](https://docs.upsun.com/create-apps/app-reference/composable-image.md#) topic.
