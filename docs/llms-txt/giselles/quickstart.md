      <Accordion title="Set the Prompt" defaultOpen={true}>
        In the right panel, open the "Prompt" tab and enter your prompt in the text area. This text will guide how the node works.

        Suggest one interesting topic related to animals.
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Select a Model" defaultOpen={true}>

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Connect the Nodes" defaultOpen={true}>
        To connect the two nodes, drag from the Output port of the first node to the Input port of the second node.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Set the Second Node's Prompt" defaultOpen={true}>
        Enter the following into the "Prompt" tab of the second node. By feeding the output of the first node into the second node, a continuous workflow is built.

        ```markdown  theme={null}
        Please research on the following topics:
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Run the Workflow" defaultOpen={true}>
        Finally, click the "Run" button in the upper right corner to execute the workflow. This will run both nodes in sequence and generate the final output. Congratulations, you've run your first workflow in Giselle!
