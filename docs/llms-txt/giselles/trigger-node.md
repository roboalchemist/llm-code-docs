# Trigger Node

> Learn about Trigger Nodes, the starting points for workflows in Giselle. Use GitHub Triggers to initiate your AI workflow sequences.

## Trigger Node in Giselle

The **Trigger Node** is the starting point for running the workflow built in the Giselle App. It initiates the execution of the connected nodes in a sequence.

### GitHub Trigger Node

The **GitHub Trigger Node** enables you to automatically start your Giselle workflows based on specific events occurring in your GitHub repositories. This allows for seamless integration between your code management and AI-powered tasks.

#### Setting up a GitHub Trigger

#### 1. Select GitHub Account/Organization

When you add a GitHub Trigger node, you'll first need to choose the GitHub account or organization where your target repository resides (e.g., `giselles-ai`, `liam-hq`).

If you're missing a GitHub account connection or need to adjust permissions, click on "Adjust GitHub App Permissions".

#### 2. Choose a Repository

A list of repositories available under the selected account/organization will be displayed (e.g., `docs`, `giselle`).

Click the **Set up** button next to the desired repository (e.g., `giselle`).

If your repository isn't listed, you might need to "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" to grant Giselle access to it.

#### 3. Configure the Trigger Event

Once a repository is selected (e.g., `giselles-ai/giselle`), you need to specify which GitHub event will trigger the workflow.

Click on the dropdown menu labeled "Choose when you want to trigger the flow."

Select an event from the list, such as:

* **Issue Created**: Triggers the flow when a new issue is created in the repository.
* **Issue Closed**: Triggers when an issue is closed.
* **Issue Labeled**: Triggers when a specific label is added to an issue.
* **Issue Comment Created**: Triggers when a new comment is made on an issue.
* **Pull Request Comment Created**: Triggers on a new pull request comment.
* **Pull Request Opened**: Triggers when a new pull request is opened.
* **Pull Request Ready for Review**: Triggers when a pull request is marked as ready for review.
* **Pull Request Closed**: Triggers when a pull request is closed.
* **Pull Request Labeled**: Triggers when a specific label is added to a pull request.

#### 4. Configure Callsign (for Comment Events)

For some events, like "Issue Comment Created" or "Pull Request Comment Created," you can specify a **Callsign**.

A Callsign is a specific string or command (e.g., `/code-review`, `/deep-research`) that must be present in the comment for the trigger to activate. This prevents the flow from running on every single comment.

Enter your desired Callsign in the provided field. The example shows `/code-review`.

Click **Set up** after configuring the Callsign.

#### 5. Configure Labels (for Label Events)

For some events, like "Issue Labeled" or "Pull Request Labeled," you can specify one or more **Labels**.

When multiple labels are added, the workflow will trigger if *any* of the specified labels are added to the issue or pull request (OR condition). This allows for flexible triggering based on labeling conventions.

Enter your desired labels in the provided input fields. You can add multiple labels using the "Add label" button.

Click **Set up** after configuring the Labels.

#### 6. Enable the Trigger

After configuring the event and any associated options (like Callsign or Labels), the trigger will initially be in a "Disabled" state. The node on the canvas will show "Requires Setup" or display the repository and event type with a "Disabled" status.

On the configuration panel for the trigger (e.g., "On Issue Created" or "On Issue Comment Created"), you will see the current **State** as "Disable".

Click on **Enable** to activate the trigger.

Once enabled, the **State** will change to "Enable", and you will see an option to **Disable Trigger**. The node on the canvas will also reflect its "Enabled" status.

#### 7. Configure In-Progress Comment (Optional)

Once your trigger is set up, you can configure whether Giselle posts an "in-progress" comment to GitHub when the workflow starts executing.

By default, this option is **enabled**, meaning Giselle will automatically post a comment to the issue or pull request indicating that the workflow is running.

To disable in-progress comments, toggle off the **Post In-Progress Comment** option in the trigger's properties panel.

This setting is useful when you want to reduce noise in GitHub discussions or prefer silent workflow execution.

#### 8. Run in the Workspace

For GitHub Trigger Nodes, clicking the "Run" button allows you to test your workflow without waiting for an actual GitHub webhook. You can enter values in a form that simulates the GitHub event, enabling you to verify that your workflow functions correctly before enabling it for real GitHub events.

**Example Workflow after Setup:**

On Issue Created:

* **Trigger**: "On Issue Created" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When a new issue is created in the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository, this Giselle workflow will automatically start.

On Pull Request Comment Created:

* **Trigger**: "On Pull Request Comment Created" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with Callsign `/code-review`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When a comment containing `/code-review [enter your request...]` is posted on a pull request in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this workflow will start. The subsequent nodes can then access information like the comment body, pull request number, the pull request's diff content, etc.

On Issue Labeled:

* **Trigger**: "On Issue Labeled" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with label `bug`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When the label `bug` is added to an issue in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this Giselle workflow will automatically start. The subsequent nodes can access information like the issue number, title, body, and the name of the label that triggered the event.

On Pull Request Labeled:

* **Trigger**: "On Pull Request Labeled" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with labels `feature` or `enhancement`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When either the `feature` or `enhancement` label is added to a pull request in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this workflow will start. The subsequent nodes can access information like the pull request number, title, body, and the name of the label that triggered the event.
