## Model Selection Guide

Guidelines for selecting the optimal OpenAI model within Giselle:

* **For the best overall performance, coding, agentic tasks, and highest reasoning**: `gpt-5` (Pro)
* **For a faster, cost-efficient version of GPT-5 for well-defined tasks**: `gpt-5-mini` (Pro)
* **For the fastest, most cost-effective version of GPT-5 for summarization and classification**: `gpt-5-nano` (Free)
* **For high-quality image generation from text or image inputs**: `gpt-image-1` (Pro)

## Practices for Giselle

We recommend **gpt-5** as the versatile primary model in Giselle for Pro users. It offers an unparalleled balance of capability, intelligence, and features (including web search via tool) across various tasks like complex coding, business document creation, in-depth analysis, and advanced research. GPT-5 is designed to be highly reliable and accurate, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following.

For Pro users requiring a balance of speed and cost-efficiency for well-defined tasks, **gpt-5-mini** is an excellent choice, maintaining strong reasoning and multimodal capabilities.

For Free plan users or those prioritizing the fastest and most cost-effective solution for high-throughput tasks like summarization and classification, **gpt-5-nano** is the recommended model.

**Automatic Fallback for Deprecated Models:**
Giselle now automatically maps previously available OpenAI models to the new GPT-5 series to ensure a seamless transition for existing workflows.

* **Models now mapping to `gpt-5` (Pro)**: `gpt-4o`, `o3`, `gpt-4.1`, `o1`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
* **Models now mapping to `gpt-5-mini` (Pro)**: `o4-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `o3-mini`, `o1-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini`
* **Models now mapping to `gpt-5-nano` (Free)**: `gpt-4.1-nano`

For image generation needs, **gpt-image-1** provides high-quality results and supports both text and image inputs. The model offers different quality tiers to balance cost and detail based on specific requirements.

By combining these models in workflows, you can leverage their specific strengths. For example, use `gpt-5` for its advanced reasoning and coding, `gpt-5-mini` for cost-efficient tasks, or `gpt-5-nano` for rapid, high-volume operations.
