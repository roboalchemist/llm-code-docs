## Practices for Giselle

We recommend **gpt-5.2** as the versatile primary model in Giselle for Pro users. It is OpenAI's most capable model, offering state-of-the-art performance in general intelligence, instruction following, accuracy, multimodality (especially vision), code generation, tool calling, and spreadsheet understanding. GPT-5.2 is designed to be highly reliable and accurate, with 30% fewer errors compared to GPT-5.1 Thinking.

**Configuring GPT-5.2:**

* **Reasoning Effort:** GPT-5.2 supports five reasoning effort levels: `none` (default), `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`. Use `none` for low-latency interactions, and increase to `medium` or higher for tasks requiring deeper reasoning. The new `xhigh` level provides the deepest reasoning for complex problems.
* **Text Verbosity:** Control output length with `low`, `medium` (default), or `high`. Use `low` for concise answers and simple code generation (like SQL queries), and `high` for thorough explanations and extensive code refactoring.

For users who need proven stability, **gpt-5** remains an excellent choice with strong overall performance, coding, and agentic capabilities.

For Pro users requiring a balance of speed and cost-efficiency for well-defined tasks, **gpt-5-mini** is an excellent choice, maintaining strong reasoning and multimodal capabilities.

For Free plan users or those prioritizing the fastest and most cost-effective solution for high-throughput tasks like summarization and classification, **gpt-5-nano** is the recommended model.

**Automatic Fallback for Deprecated Models:**
Giselle now automatically maps previously available OpenAI models to the new GPT-5 series to ensure a seamless transition for existing workflows.

* **Models now mapping to `gpt-5` (Pro)**: `gpt-4o`, `o3`, `gpt-4.1`, `o1`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
* **Models now mapping to `gpt-5-mini` (Pro)**: `o4-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `o3-mini`, `o1-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini`
* **Models now mapping to `gpt-5-nano` (Free)**: `gpt-4.1-nano`

For image generation needs, **gpt-image-1** provides high-quality results and supports both text and image inputs. The model offers different quality tiers to balance cost and detail based on specific requirements.

For developers and teams working on complex, long-horizon coding projects, **gpt-5.2-codex** is the optimal choice. It is specifically optimized for agentic coding tasks in Codex-like environments, offering the same pricing as GPT-5.2 with specialized capabilities for sustained coding workflows. Note that text verbosity is fixed to `medium` for this model.

By combining these models in workflows, you can leverage their specific strengths. For example, use `gpt-5.2` for its state-of-the-art reasoning and general capabilities, `gpt-5.2-codex` for agentic coding tasks, `gpt-5-mini` for cost-efficient tasks, or `gpt-5-nano` for rapid, high-volume operations.
