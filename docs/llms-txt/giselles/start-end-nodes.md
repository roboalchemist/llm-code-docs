# Start Node & End Node

> Learn how Start and End Nodes in Giselle define the boundaries of your workflow, establishing where user input enters and where the final output is collected.

## Start Node & End Node in Giselle

**Start Node** and **End Node** are the essential boundary nodes that define the entry and exit points of any workflow in Giselle. They work as a pair to establish the complete flow of your app, from receiving user input to delivering the final output.

## Start Node

The **Start Node** is the entry point of your workflow. It defines the input parameters that users will provide when running your app in the Playground.

### Key Features

* **Entry Point**: The Start Node marks where workflow execution begins. All data flows from this node to downstream nodes.
* **Parameter Definition**: Define the input parameters that users will fill in when running your app, such as text input fields or file uploads.
* **Single Instance**: Each workflow can have only one Start Node. It cannot be duplicated.
* **Paired with End Node**: Start and End Nodes are always created together as a pair.

### Default Parameters

When you create a new app, the Start Node comes with two default input parameters:

1. **Input(Text)**: A multiline text field for users to enter text content. This is marked as required.
2. **Input(File)**: A file upload field that allows users to attach multiple files. This is optional by default.

The Start Node has a single output port that provides the user's input to downstream nodes in your workflow.

### Configuring the Start Node

1. **Select the Node**: Click on the Start Node to open its configuration panel.
2. **Edit App Description**: Customize the app description.

### Output of the Start Node

The Start Node has a single **output** that contains the values provided by the user when running the app. This output can be connected to any compatible node's input.

## End Node

The **End Node** is the endpoint of your workflow and the place where you define the app's final output. It collects processed data from upstream nodes and presents them as the app's results.

### Key Features

* **Workflow Endpoint**: The End Node is where workflow execution completes. Data connected here becomes the app's final result.
* **Output Definition**: Specify which node's output to include in the app's final result. You can connect multiple upstream nodes.
* **Single Instance**: Each workflow can have only one End Node. It cannot be duplicated.
* **Dynamic Input**: The End Node's input is created dynamically when you connect upstream nodes.

### Configuring the End Node

1. **Select the Node**: Click on the End Node to open its configuration panel.
2. **Add Output**: Click the "Add Output" button to select which upstream node's output should be included in the final result.
3. **Manage Connections**: View and disconnect connected nodes as needed.

### Connection Rules

When connecting nodes to the End Node:

* The End Node itself cannot be selected as a source
* Nodes already connected cannot be selected again
* Nodes without an output cannot be connected

### Input of the End Node

The End Node has a single **input** that receives data from connected upstream nodes. The connected data is then presented as the final output of your app.

## Visual Appearance

Both Start and End Nodes share a distinctive **capsule-shaped design** that sets them apart from other nodes:

* **Start Node**: Has an output handle on the right side for connecting to downstream nodes
* **End Node**: Has an input handle on the left side for receiving data from upstream nodes
* Both display their respective icons and names ("Start" and "End" by default)

### Connection Status Indicator

When the Start Node is properly connected to the End Node through the workflow:

* Both nodes display with full opacity
* The "Try App in Playground" button becomes enabled

When there's no valid path from Start to End:

* Both nodes appear slightly faded with dashed borders
* The "Try App in Playground" button is disabled

## How They Work Together

1. **User Input**: When someone runs your app, they fill in the parameters defined in the Start Node.
2. **Data Flow**: Input values flow from the Start Node through connected nodes.
3. **Processing**: Data is processed by various nodes (text, file, query, action nodes, etc.).
4. **Collection**: Processed results are collected by the End Node.
5. **Output**: The End Node presents the final output to the user.

### Connection Requirement

For your app to be runnable, there must be a valid path from the Start Node to the End Node. The system verifies this connection using a breadth-first search algorithm. Without a valid path, your app cannot be executed in the Playground.

## Start & End Nodes vs. Other Nodes

| Feature                | Start & End Nodes   | Other Nodes      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Instances per workflow | Exactly one each    | Multiple allowed |
| Can be duplicated      | No                  | Yes              |
| Visual style           | Capsule-shaped      | Card-shaped      |
| Purpose                | Workflow boundaries | Data processing  |
| Created automatically  | Yes, as a pair      | No               |

Start and End Nodes are essential for creating functional apps that accept user input and deliver processed results.
