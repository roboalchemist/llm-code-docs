# Build Apps FAQ

> Frequently asked questions about building apps in Giselle

## What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is a visual canvas-based editor where you design AI workflows by connecting nodes together. Each node performs a specific function, and data flows between nodes through connections.

## How do I create a new app?

Click "+ Create App" in the left menu. Enter a name and description for your app, and you'll be taken to the Workspace editor where you can build your workflow.

## What are nodes?

Nodes are the building blocks of your workflow. Each node performs a specific function:

* **Start/End Nodes**: Define the entry point and output of your app
* **Generator Node**: Performs AI text or image generation
* **Text/File/Web Page Nodes**: Provide content to your workflow
* **Vector Store/Query Nodes**: Enable semantic search with RAG
* **Trigger/Action Nodes**: Connect to external services like GitHub

For more details, see the [Workspaces guide](/en/guides/workspaces).

## How do I connect nodes?

1. Hover over a node to see its output port (right side)
2. Click and drag from the output port
3. Drop the connection on another node's input port (left side)

## How do I run my workflow?

Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the Workspace. You'll be redirected to the task execution result page where you can see the output.

## What's the difference between running in Workspace vs Playground?

* **Workspace**: Run your workflow directly to test during building. Useful for iterating and debugging.
* **Playground**: Run completed apps with a simple interface. Best for regular use by you and your team.

## How do I turn my workflow into an app?

Connect a [Start Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#start-node) and [End Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#end-node) to your workflow. Once these are connected, your app will appear in the [Playground](https://studio.giselles.ai/playground).

## Can I duplicate a workflow?

Yes. You can copy an existing app to create a new one based on it. This is useful for creating variations of your workflows.

## How do I delete an app?

Navigate to the app settings and look for the delete option. Note that deleted apps cannot be recovered.

## Can team members edit the same workspace?

Team members with access to the team can view and edit apps within that team. Changes are saved automatically.

## What file types can I upload to a File Node?

File Nodes support PDF, text files, and images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP).

## How do I use external data in my workflow?

You can bring external data into your workflow using:

* **File Node**: Upload documents directly
* **Web Page Node**: Fetch content from URLs
* **GitHub Vector Store Node**: Index GitHub repositories
* **Trigger Node**: Receive data from external events

## What happens if my workflow fails?

If a workflow fails, you can see the error details on the task execution result page. Common issues include:

* Missing required inputs
* Invalid node configuration
* API errors from AI providers

Check the error message and update your workflow accordingly.

## Where can I learn more about building workflows?

See the [Workspaces guide](/en/guides/workspaces) for detailed instructions on building workflows, and the [Glossary](/en/glossary/node) for information about each node type.
