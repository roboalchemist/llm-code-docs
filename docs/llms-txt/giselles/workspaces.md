# Workspaces

> Learn how to build AI workflows visually in the Workspace editor

## Overview

A **Workspace** is a visual canvas-based editor where you design AI workflows by connecting nodes together. Each node performs a specific function, and data flows between nodes through connections.

## The Workspace Editor

The Workspace editor consists of several key components:

* **Canvas**: The main area where you build your workflow by placing and connecting nodes
* **Toolbar**: Located at the bottom, provides access to all available node types
* **Properties Panel**: Appears on the right when a node is selected, allowing you to configure its settings

## Adding Nodes

To add a node to your workflow:

1. Click a category in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen
2. Select the desired node type from the menu
3. The node appears on the canvas
4. Drag the node to position it where you want

### Available Node Types

Nodes are organized into categories:

**App**

* **[Start Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#start-node)**: Defines the workflow entry point and input parameters
* **[End Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#end-node)**: Marks the workflow completion and output

**Model**

* **[Generator Node](/en/glossary/generator-node)**: Performs AI text or image generation using various LLM providers

**Context**

* **[Text Node](/en/glossary/text-node)**: Stores static text content
* **[File Node](/en/glossary/file-node)**: Attaches files (PDF, text, images) to your workflow
* **[Web Page Node](/en/glossary/webpage-node)**: Fetches and provides web page content
* **[Document Vector Store Node](/en/glossary/document-vector-store-node)**: Creates searchable indexes from documents
* **[GitHub Vector Store Node](/en/glossary/github-vector-store-node)**: Creates searchable indexes from GitHub repositories
* **[Vector Query Node](/en/glossary/vector-query-node)**: Searches vector stores for relevant content

**Integration**

* **[Trigger Node](/en/glossary/trigger-node)**: Starts workflows from external events (e.g., GitHub webhooks)
* **[Action Node](/en/glossary/action-node)**: Executes external actions (e.g., GitHub operations)

## Connecting Nodes

To connect nodes and create data flow:

1. Hover over a node to see its output port (right side)
2. Click and drag from the output port
3. Drop the connection on another node's input port (left side)
4. A connection line appears showing the data flow direction

Connections define how data passes between nodes. The output of one node becomes available as input to the connected node.

## Configuring Nodes

To configure a node:

1. Click on a node to select it
2. The Properties Panel opens on the right side
3. Edit the node name in the header if needed
4. Configure node-specific settings:
   * **Generator Node**: Select an AI model, write prompts, enable tools
   * **Text Node**: Enter your text content
   * **File Node**: Upload files
   * **Trigger/Action Nodes**: Configure integration settings

## Running Your Workflow

You can run your workflow directly in the Workspace to test it:

1. Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner
2. Enter any required input values
3. The workflow executes and you're redirected to the task execution result page

On the result page, you can see:

* Execution progress and status for each step
* Generated outputs from each node
* Token usage and execution duration

This allows you to quickly test and iterate on your workflow during development.

## Creating an App

By connecting a [Start Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#start-node) and [End Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#end-node), your workflow becomes an **App** that can be run from the [Playground](https://studio.giselles.ai/playground).

1. Add a Start Node
2. Build your workflow with the nodes you need
3. Add an End Node to define the output
4. Connect all nodes in your workflow

Once configured, your app appears in the Playground where you and your team can run it without accessing the Workspace editor.

## Next Steps

* Learn about [Generator Node](/en/glossary/generator-node) configuration
* Explore [AI Parameters](/en/glossary/ai-parameters) for fine-tuning generation
* Set up [Integrations](/en/guides/settings/team/integrations) for external services
