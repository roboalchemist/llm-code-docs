# Run Apps FAQ

> Frequently asked questions about running apps in Giselle

## How do I run an app?

There are two ways to run an app:

* **[Playground](https://studio.giselles.ai/playground)**: Select an app, enter your input, and press Enter
* **Workspace**: Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner

## What is the Playground?

The [Playground](https://studio.giselles.ai/playground) is where you run completed apps with a simple interface. It displays all apps available to you, including your own apps and team apps.

## What is the Workspace?

The Workspace is a visual canvas-based editor where you design AI workflows by connecting nodes together. You can also run and test your workflows directly from the Workspace. For more details, see the [Workspaces guide](/en/guides/workspaces).

## What is the Tasks page?

The [Tasks](https://studio.giselles.ai/tasks) page shows your execution history. You can see all past runs, their status, and results.

## How do I view my execution history?

Go to [Tasks](https://studio.giselles.ai/tasks) to see a list of all your past executions. Click on any task to view its details.

## What information is shown on the task result page?

The task execution result page shows:

* **Status**: Whether the task completed, failed, or is still running
* **Steps**: Each node's execution progress
* **Output**: The generated results from each node
* **Duration**: How long the execution took
* **Token Usage**: AI model token consumption

## Can I re-run a previous task?

You can run the same app again from the Playground with new inputs. The original task results are preserved in your history.

## How do I share an app with my team?

Apps created within a team are automatically available to all team members in the Playground. Team members can run the app without accessing the Workspace editor.

## What happens if an app fails?

If an app fails during execution:

1. Check the task result page for error details
2. Look at which step failed
3. Open the app in Workspace to fix the issue
4. Run the app again

## Can I cancel a running task?

Currently, once a task starts, it will run until completion or failure.

## How is app usage billed?

App executions consume AI model tokens, which are billed based on usage. You can check your billing amount from [Team Settings](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team) by clicking "Manage Subscription" to access the Stripe portal.
