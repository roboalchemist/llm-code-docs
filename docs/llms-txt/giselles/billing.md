# Billing

> Manage your personal account billing and payments

## Payment Guide

This guide explains how Giselle's pricing system works, including subscription management, billing cycles, and secure payments. Giselle uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for simplified billing to ensure safe and reliable transactions.

***

## How to Access Billing Settings

After logging in, you can access　[Settings > Team > Billing](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/billing) by selecting "Billing" from the sidebar menu.

From this page, you can access the dedicated billing portal provided by Stripe.
In the Stripe billing portal, you can:

View your current subscription details
Update your payment method
View invoice history
Cancel your subscription

Subscription cancellation is possible through the Stripe management screen. You cannot cancel directly from the Giselle management interface.

***

## About the Billing Cycle

* Subscriptions are billed on a monthly recurring basis, starting from your subscription date
* Your subscription automatically renews on the same day each month (e.g., May 5)
* Payments are processed automatically through your registered payment method

***

## Current Plans and Pricing

For detailed information about our current plans and pricing options, please visit [Our Pricing page](https://giselles.ai/pricing)

Alternatively, you can refer to our documentation at [Plan](plan) for comprehensive plan details and feature comparisons.

For any specific pricing questions not covered on these pages, please contact our support team.

## How AI Model Usage is Billed

* The Free Plan includes 30 minutes of AI usage per month (limited-time offer)
* The Pro Plan includes unlimited AI model usage during the promotional period
* Users will be notified one month before the promotion ends

***

## How to View and Download Invoices

You can view and download your invoice history in the Stripe billing portal. Each invoice shows:

* Date of payment
* Amount charged
* Payment status
* Description of services

From the Stripe portal, you can download both invoices and receipts for your records or accounting purposes. Simply locate the invoice you need and use the download options provided.

***

## How to Update Payment Method

To update your payment information:

1. Go to the [Billing section](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/billing) in Settings
2. Access the Stripe billing portal
3. Look for the "Payment Method" section
4. Modify your payment details, where you can:
   * Update your credit card information
   * Change to a different payment method

All changes to your payment information will be securely processed and stored by Stripe.

***

## How to Cancel a Subscription

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to [Billing settings](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/billing)
2. Click "Cancel subscription"
3. Review the cancellation information
4. Click the "Cancel subscription" button to confirm

Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period. If you change your mind before the end date, you can renew your subscription.

***

## Payment Processing

* All payments are processed securely through Stripe
* Supported payment methods include major credit cards
* Payment information is stored securely by Stripe, not by Giselle
