# AI Models FAQ

> Frequently asked questions about AI models and their usage in Giselle

## What AI providers are available in Giselle?

Giselle integrates with multiple AI providers:

* **Anthropic**: Claude models for nuanced understanding and safe outputs
* **Google AI**: Gemini models with multimodal capabilities and large context windows
* **OpenAI**: GPT models for code generation, creative content, and structured outputs
* **Fal AI**: Image generation models (Open Source version only)

## What models are available on the Free plan?

The following models are available on the Free plan:

* **Anthropic**: Claude Haiku 4.5
* **Google**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
* **OpenAI**: GPT-5-nano

## What additional models are available on the Pro plan?

Pro plan users have access to all Free plan models plus:

* **Anthropic**: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5
* **Google**: Gemini 3 Pro Preview, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
* **OpenAI**: GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1-thinking, GPT-5.1-codex, GPT-5, GPT-5-mini

## How do I select an AI model?

In the Workspace, add a [Generator Node](/en/glossary/generator-node) and click on it to open the Properties Panel. You can select your preferred AI model from the model dropdown menu.

## Which model should I choose?

Here are general recommendations:

* **For coding and complex reasoning**: Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, or Gemini 2.5 Pro
* **For balanced performance and cost**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Gemini 2.5 Flash
* **For speed and cost-efficiency**: Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5-nano, or Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
* **For image generation**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

## What is the context window?

The context window is the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that a model can process in a single request. Larger context windows allow you to include more information in your prompts.

* **Anthropic models**: 200k tokens
* **Google Gemini models**: 1M tokens
* **OpenAI models**: 400k tokens

## Do the models support image input?

Yes, most models support image input:

* **Anthropic Claude**: All Claude models support image and PDF input
* **Google Gemini**: All Gemini models support image, PDF, audio, and video input
* **OpenAI GPT**: GPT-5 series models support image input

## What is the Reasoning capability?

Reasoning (also called Extended Thinking) allows models to spend more time thinking through complex problems before responding. This improves accuracy for multi-step reasoning tasks. Models with reasoning capability include:

* Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku 4.5
* Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
* GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1-thinking

## What is Web Search?

Web Search allows models to access real-time information from the internet. You can enable this feature from the Generator Node's Tools tab. Models supporting web search include most Claude, Gemini, and GPT models.

## How is AI model usage billed?

AI model usage is billed based on the number of tokens processed (input and output). Different models have different pricing. You can view your usage from [Team Settings > Usage](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/usage).

## Can I use multiple models in one workflow?

Yes! One of Giselle's strengths is combining different AI providers in a single workflow. You can use different models at different stages to optimize for cost, speed, or capability.

## Where can I learn more about each model?

For detailed model specifications, visit the [Models documentation](/en/models/providers/overview) or the official provider documentation:
