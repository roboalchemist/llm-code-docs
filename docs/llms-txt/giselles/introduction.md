## Core Features

### Visual Node Editor

Design AI workflows by placing and connecting nodes with drag-and-drop, just like drawing a flowchart. Build complex AI processes visually without any programming experience.

### Long-Running Task Execution

Run your AI apps in a dedicated execution environment separate from the build environment. Monitor real-time progress of long-running AI apps, with clear display of multiple outputs and lengthy results.

### Multi-Model AI Collaboration

Freely combine world-leading AI models like OpenAI (GPT-5.2), Anthropic (Claude Opus 4.5), and Google (Gemini 3 Flash) within a single workflow. Assign roles that leverage each model's strengths for consistent results even on complex tasks.

### GitHub Integration

Automatically trigger AI apps based on GitHub events like Issues, Pull Requests, and comments. Enable processing that understands the context and intent of PRs and Issues—context-aware code reviews, documentation generation, issue classification, and more.

### Custom Knowledge

Incorporate your own data—PDFs, documents, GitHub repository code, Issues, and PRs—as knowledge for your AI apps. Achieve answers based on organization-specific information that general AI cannot provide. Leverage advanced technologies like RAG and Vector Store without specialized knowledge.
