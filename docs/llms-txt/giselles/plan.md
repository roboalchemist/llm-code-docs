2. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
3. Complete the checkout process with Stripe
4. Your team is upgraded immediately

## Can I try Pro before committing?

For trial options, please contact our support team at [support@giselles.ai](mailto:support@giselles.ai).

## How do I downgrade from Pro to Free?

To downgrade, cancel your Pro subscription through the Stripe billing portal:

1. Go to [Team Settings](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team)
2. Click "Manage Subscription" to open the billing portal
3. Cancel your subscription

Your Pro features remain active until the end of the current billing period, after which your team reverts to the Free plan.

## What happens to my team when I downgrade?

When your Pro subscription ends:

* Your team reverts to the Free plan
* Team membership is adjusted to fit Free plan limits
* Your apps and data are preserved

## Can I switch teams between plans?

Each team has its own plan. You can have multiple teams on different plans. To upgrade a specific team, make sure you've selected that team before upgrading.

## Is there an annual plan?

For annual billing options, please contact our support team at [support@giselles.ai](mailto:support@giselles.ai) or check [giselles.ai/pricing](https://giselles.ai/pricing).

## How does usage-based billing work?

AI model usage (text generation, image generation) is metered and billed based on actual usage. You can monitor your usage from [Team Settings > Usage](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/usage).

## Are there usage limits?

The Pro plan uses pay-as-you-go billing for AI model usage, so there are no hard limits. You're billed for what you use.

## How do I check my current plan?

Go to [Team Settings](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team) to see your current plan status and subscription details.
