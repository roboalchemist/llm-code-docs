# My Apps

> Create and manage your personal AI applications

My Apps are personal AI applications that you can create and manage on the Giselle App Builder platform. You can build powerful AI applications by combining multiple AI models and data sources, and run them as many times as needed.

## Key Features

### Application Building

* **AI Model Integration**: Combine various AI models to create custom applications
* **Data Source Connectivity**: Leverage information from multiple data sources to enhance AI capabilities
* **Repeated Execution**: Run your built applications as many times as necessary

### Team Utilization through GitHub Integration

While My App is primarily intended for personal use, you can utilize it with teams through GitHub integration:

* **Repository Integration**: Connect with repositories such as GitHub
* **Automatic Execution Triggers**: Set up automatic application execution triggered by issue creation or pull request submission
* **Output Sharing**: Functions as a GitHub App, allowing all team members with access to the connected repository to share output results

This enables you to incorporate functions from your personally created My App into your entire team's workflow.

## Differences Between My App and Team App

My App has the following limitations:

* **Editing Permissions**: Only the creator of the app can edit the application itself
* **Viewing Restrictions**: Viewing the application settings and configuration is also limited to the creator

To remove these restrictions and enable collaborative editing and viewing of applications with multiple members, you need to become a Pro user and create a team. After creating a team, collaborative management becomes possible as a Team App.

## Use Cases for My App

* **Personal Productivity Enhancement**: Create AI applications that assist with daily work and research
* **Project Automation**: Automate development processes through GitHub integration
* **Code Review Support**: Automatically run code analysis when pull requests are created
