# Blog Post & Social Media Generator

> Learn both sequential and parallel processing in one workflow. Generate blog articles from topics and create optimized social media posts for multiple platforms.

This recipe shows you how to build an app where you enter a topic (and optionally an image), and AI creates an outline, writes a full blog article, then generates optimized posts for X, Instagram, and LinkedIn in parallel based on the article content.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Generate blog articles from topics and create social media posts in parallel based on the article content.

| Node                    | Role                                                    | Model                 |

| App Request             | Topic input + image (optional)                          | -                     |
| Text Node               | Article structure prompt                                | -                     |
| Generator 1 (Outline)   | Generate article structure                              | gpt-5-nano            |
| Generator 2 (Article)   | Generate body from outline                              | claude-haiku-4.5      |
| Generator 3 (X)         | Generate short text for X from article                  | gpt-5-nano            |
| Generator 4 (Instagram) | Generate Instagram caption from article (image support) | gemini-2.5-flash-lite |
| Generator 5 (LinkedIn)  | Generate professional LinkedIn post from article        | claude-haiku-4.5      |

**What you'll learn**: Node chaining (sequential processing), parallel processing, prompt design, multimodal input (optional)
