# Types of LLM vulnerabilities

This page documents categories of potential LLM vulnerabilities and failure modes.

Each vulnerability type is supported by Promptfoo's open-source plugins. [Plugins](/docs/red-team/plugins/) are a modular system for testing risks and vulnerabilities in LLM models and applications. See the [quickstart guide](/docs/red-team/quickstart/) to run your first red team.
