# Red teaming

## Red teaming

[📄️ Intro](/docs/red-team/)  
Red team LLM systems through systematic adversarial testing to detect content policy violations, information leakage, and API misuse before production deployment

[📄️ Quickstart](/docs/red-team/quickstart/)  
Start red teaming LLMs in minutes by scanning 50+ vulnerabilities including jailbreaks, prompt injection, and data exfiltration

[📄️ Configuration](/docs/red-team/configuration/)  
Red team your LLM configuration settings using automated vulnerability scanning to detect misconfigurations and prevent unauthorized access to AI system parameters

[📄️ Architecture](/docs/red-team/architecture/)  
Red team AI systems by analyzing architecture components and attack surfaces to protect LLM applications through systematic vulnerability assessment and threat modeling

[📄️ Types of LLM vulnerabilities](/docs/red-team/llm-vulnerability-types/)  
Red team LLM systems for security, privacy, and criminal vulnerabilities using modular testing plugins to protect AI applications from exploitation and data breaches

[📄️ Risk Scoring](/docs/red-team/risk-scoring/)  
Promptfoo provides a risk scoring system that quantifies the severity and likelihood of vulnerabilities in your LLM application. Each vulnerability is assigned a risk score between 0 and 10 that helps you prioritize remediation efforts.
