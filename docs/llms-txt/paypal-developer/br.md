# PayPal Plus - Brazil

PayPal Plus provides a flexible credit-card processing solution for merchants that do not require buyers to have a PayPal account and does not direct them away from the merchant website to collect and process payment information.

**Important:**

- PayPal Plus requires a vetting process and a verified PayPal merchant account. Contact us at [PayPal Brazil help center](https://www.paypal.com/br/smarthelp/contact-us)
- Pay upon Invoice may not be available for all merchants.
- By default, PayPal Plus is enabled for all sandbox accounts in Brazil.
- Nothing in this guide constitutes legal advice.
