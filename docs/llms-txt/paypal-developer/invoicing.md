# Simplify Invoicing with PayPal's Invoicing API

Integrate Invoicing API to your product UI to create invoices that resonate with your brand.

You can create, send, and manage invoices using the invoicing API. It also supports refund requests, QR payment options, and customer reminders.

## How it works

1. Merchant creates a draft invoice.
2. Merchant sends a draft invoice and PayPal emails the customer an invoice link. Optionally, merchants can share the invoice link in an email they send to their customers.
3. Customer clicks the invoice link in the email to view the invoice.
4. Customer securely pays with a credit card, debit card, PayPal, or PayPal Credit.
