# Settlement and transaction detail reports

**Note:** Only approved merchants and processing partners can use the Settlement and Transaction Detail reports. Contact your PayPal account manager for more information.

The Settlement and Transaction Detail reports identify different types of payouts (Mass Payment) transactions with transaction event codes (T-codes). Payouts transactions display these T-codes:

- T0001 - Mass Payment (successful)
- T0104 - Mass Payment batch fee
- T1105 - Account hold released
- T1114 - Mass Payment reversal transaction
- T1115 - Mass Payment refund transaction
- T1503 - Temporary hold on funds during processing

While the transaction is being processed, the transaction event code is `T1503`. This means PayPal placed a temporary hold on funds to reserve the total payout amount plus fees. When the batch transaction completes, the hold releases, and the transaction event code becomes `T1105`.

Your PayPal account balance reflects each payment. If any payments are declined, your balance may exceed the balance shown during the hold.

You can track transactions with the Transaction ID in the PayPal Reference ID column.
