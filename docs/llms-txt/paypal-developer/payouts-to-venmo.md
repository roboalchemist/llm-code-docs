# Use Payouts to Venmo

You can use a mobile number or an email ID to send payments to a [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) recipient. If they don't have a Venmo account, it's easy to open one. Payouts to Venmo is available in the US only.

**info**
**Important:** Now you can send payouts to [Venmo handles](/docs/payouts/standard/payouts-to-venmo/#payouts-to-venmo-handles).

## Payouts to Venmo features
- Access Venmo's active network of over 40 million users
- Customize brand messages in recipients' feeds
- Leverage the same Payouts integration as PayPal
- Send to any US mobile number
- Use a Venmo handle to send a payment to a Venmo account

## Recipient experience
When you send the payout, the recipient's phone notifies them that the payment is in their Venmo account. If recipients don't have Venmo, they receive a text message to create an account and claim their payout. The notification includes the note you sent.

When the recipient selects the notification, their Venmo profile opens.

Your message shows up in the recipient's Venmo feed. The message inherits the recipient's privacy settings.

## Payouts to Venmo handles
You can use a recipient's Venmo handle to send a payment. A Venmo handle is a unique username the customer chooses to send and receive payments.

Offering Venmo as a payout option may improve participation in rewards programs or social campaigns. You can encourage users to share their Venmo handles to receive payments.

You can direct payouts to a recipient's Venmo handle by setting `recipient_type` to `USER_HANDLE` and passing their handle using `receiver`, as described in the [Payouts API](/docs/payouts/standard/payouts-to-venmo/#payouts-api) process.

You can use the Payouts API or Payouts Web to send payments to Venmo recipients.
