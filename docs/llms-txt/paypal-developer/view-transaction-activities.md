# View transactions on the activities page

Use the Activities page to view payouts transactions that are processed for your account. By default, the Activities page displays a list of the transactions from the last 30 days, but you can also specify a different date range. Payouts transactions are identified by `Payout` in the transaction title.

## Get payouts transaction logs

To get a list of payouts transaction logs:

1. Log in to your [PayPal business account](https://www.paypal.com).
2. Under Activity, select **All Reports**.
3. Select **Activity download**, and set the following:

The page displays a list of transaction logs that match your search criteria.

A transaction log contains a summary of a payout transaction, such as the date and time processed, and transaction status. It also contains detailed transaction information for each recipient.
