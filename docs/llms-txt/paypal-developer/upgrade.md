# Upgrading to FPA

This flow applies to existing merchants looking to upgrade from the [Fraud Protection](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/advanced/customize/fraud-protection/) (FP) tool to the Fraud Protection Advanced (FPA) tool. Your merchants should use the following steps:

1. Go to **Account settings** → **Payment preferences** → **Manage fraud**. Select **Change fraud tool**. ![Image 1](https://www.paypalobjects.com/devdoc/Change_fraud_tool.png)
2. Ensure you select **Fraud Protection Advanced** from the options provided based on your business characteristics. Select **Next** to go to the Fraud Protection Advanced tool and begin customizing your fraud tool. ![Image 2](https://www.paypalobjects.com/devdoc/protect_FPATool.png)
