# Billing cycles

When you create a plan, you set the regular period billing cycle duration. A plan’s billing cycle defines the recurring frequency with which the subscriber is charged. For example, a plan with a weekly billing cycle charges the subscriber on a recurring frequency of one week.

You can choose from the following billing cycles:

- Day
- Week
- Month
- Year
- Custom: customize the billing cycle for more flexible options like two weeks or three months.

## Finite and infinite

Billing cycles can continue for a specified period of time, a finite plan, or until the user cancels the subscription, an infinite plan.

- **Finite plan** - A plan with a fixed number of billing cycles. Create a finite plan if you want to associate a pre-defined number of cycles to the plan. Once a buyer subscribes to a finite plan, the subscription remains active for the specified number of billing cycles. You create a finite plan by specifying the `total_cycles` of billing cycles when you create the plan.

  Example: An online tutorial course priced at $10 per month and scheduled to last for five monthly cycles. The subscriber is charged $10 for five monthly cycles with the subscription ending after the fifth cycle.

- **Infinite plan** - A plan without a fixed number of cycles. Create an infinite plan if you don’t want to associate a pre-defined number of cycles to the plan. Once a buyer subscribes to an infinite plan, the subscription remains active until cancelation. You create an infinite plan by specifying the `total_cycles` of billing cycles as 0 when you create the plan.

  Example: A plan for video streaming service priced at $20 per month. The subscriber is charged $20 per month until they cancel the subscription.

### Example: finite plan

This example sets a finite plan with the following characteristics:

- Five cycles
- Each billing cycle is one month
