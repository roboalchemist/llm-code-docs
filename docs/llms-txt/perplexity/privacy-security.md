## Data Privacy & Retention

### Zero Data Retention Policy

Perplexity maintains a strict **Zero Data Retention Policy** for the Sonar API. We do not retain any data sent via the Sonar API, and we absolutely do not use any customer data to train our models or for any other purposes beyond processing your immediate request.

### Data We Collect

The only data we collect through the Sonar API consists of essential billable metrics required for service operation:

* Number of tokens processed
* Model used for each request
* Request timestamp and duration
* API key identification (for billing purposes)

This billing metadata does not include any content from your prompts, responses, or other user data.
