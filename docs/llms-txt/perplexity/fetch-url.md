# Fetch URL

> Fetch and extract content from specific URLs using the fetch_url tool in the Agentic Research API.

## Overview

The `fetch_url` tool fetches and extracts content from specific URLs. Use it when you need the full content of a particular web page, article, or document rather than search results.

## Pricing

URL fetch costs **\$0.50 per 1,000 requests** (\$0.0005 per fetch). You're also charged for tokens consumed when fetched content is embedded in the model's context.

<Accordion title="Cost Example">
  If a model fetches 2 URLs with 3,000 tokens of content, plus your original 80-token query, using `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`:

  | Component     | Calculation              | Cost          |
  | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
  | Tool calls    | 2 fetches × \$0.0005     | \$0.001       |
  | Input tokens  | 3,080 tokens × \$3.00/1M | \$0.00924     |
  | Output tokens | 500 tokens × \$15.00/1M  | \$0.0075      |
  | **Total**     |                          | **\$0.01774** |

## Basic Usage

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  from perplexity import Perplexity

  client = Perplexity()

  response = client.responses.create(
      model="openai/gpt-5.2",
      input="Summarize the content at https://example.com/article",
      tools=[
          {
              "type": "fetch_url"
          }
      ],
      instructions="Use fetch_url to retrieve and summarize the article."
  )

  print(response.output_text)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import Perplexity from '@perplexity-ai/perplexity_ai';

  const client = new Perplexity();

  const response = await client.responses.create({
      model: "openai/gpt-5.2",
      input: "Summarize the content at https://example.com/article",
      tools: [
          {
              type: "fetch_url"
          }
      ],
      instructions: "Use fetch_url to retrieve and summarize the article."
  });

  console.log(response.output_text);
  ```

  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl https://api.perplexity.ai/v1/responses \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.2",
      "input": "Summarize the content at https://example.com/article",
      "tools": [
        {
          "type": "fetch_url"
        }
      ],
      "instructions": "Use fetch_url to retrieve and summarize the article."
    }' | jq
  ```

## Combining with Web Search

Use `fetch_url` together with `web_search` for comprehensive information gathering—search to find relevant pages, then fetch full content from the most relevant results:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  from perplexity import Perplexity

  client = Perplexity()

  response = client.responses.create(
      model="openai/gpt-5.2",
      input="Find recent articles about quantum computing and summarize the top result",
      tools=[
          {
              "type": "web_search",
              "filters": {
                  "search_recency_filter": "week"
              }
          },
          {
              "type": "fetch_url"
          }
      ],
      instructions="First use web_search to find recent articles, then use fetch_url to retrieve the full content of the most relevant article and provide a detailed summary."
  )

  print(response.output_text)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import Perplexity from '@perplexity-ai/perplexity_ai';

  const client = new Perplexity();

  const response = await client.responses.create({
      model: "openai/gpt-5.2",
      input: "Find recent articles about quantum computing and summarize the top result",
      tools: [
          {
              type: "web_search",
              filters: {
                  search_recency_filter: "week"
              }
          },
          {
              type: "fetch_url"
          }
      ],
      instructions: "First use web_search to find recent articles, then use fetch_url to retrieve the full content of the most relevant article and provide a detailed summary."
  });

  console.log(response.output_text);
  ```

  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl https://api.perplexity.ai/v1/responses \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.2",
      "input": "Find recent articles about quantum computing and summarize the top result",
      "tools": [
        {
          "type": "web_search",
          "filters": {
            "search_recency_filter": "week"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "fetch_url"
        }
      ],
      "instructions": "First use web_search to find recent articles, then use fetch_url to retrieve the full content of the most relevant article and provide a detailed summary."
    }' | jq
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### When to Use fetch\_url vs web\_search

| Use `fetch_url` when...         | Use `web_search` when...                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| You have a specific URL         | You need to find relevant pages         |
| You need full page content      | You need snippets from multiple sources |
| Analyzing a particular document | Researching a broad topic               |
| Verifying specific claims       | Finding current news or events          |

### Effective Instructions

Guide the model on when to fetch URLs:

```python  theme={null}
instructions = """You have access to web_search and fetch_url tools.

Use fetch_url when:
- You need detailed content from a specific URL
- You want to analyze a particular article or document
- You need to verify specific claims from a URL

Use web_search first to find URLs, then fetch_url to get full content."""
```
