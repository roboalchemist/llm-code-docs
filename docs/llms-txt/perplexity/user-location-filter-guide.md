# User Location Filter Guide

<Note>
  The `user_location` parameter within `web_search_options` allows you to refine search results based on the user's approximate geographic location. This helps provide more contextually relevant information.
</Note>

<Info>
  You can specify the location using latitude/longitude coordinates, country code, city, and region. For the most accurate results, we recommend providing as much location information as possible, including `city` and `region` fields. For supported country codes, please refer to the list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).
</Info>

<Tip>
  The `city` and `region` fields significantly improve location accuracy. We strongly recommend including them alongside coordinates and country code for the best results.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Latitude and longitude must be provided alongside the country parameter, they cannot be provided on their own.
</Warning>

## Overview

The `user_location` filter helps tailor search results by incorporating geographic context. This is particularly useful for queries where location significantly impacts relevance, such as:

* Finding local businesses or services.
* Getting information about regional events or news.
* Understanding location-specific regulations or customs.

To refine search results by location, include the `user_location` object within the `web_search_options` in your request payload. You can provide coordinates, country code, city, region, or combine them for maximum accuracy:

**Using All Available Fields (Recommended for Best Accuracy):**

```json  theme={null}
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "country": "US",
    "region": "California",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

**Using City and Region with Country:**

```json  theme={null}
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "country": "US",
    "region": "New York",
    "city": "New York City"
  }
}
```

**Using Latitude/Longitude:**

```json  theme={null}
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "country":"US",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

**Using Country Code Only:**

```json  theme={null}
"web_search_options": {
  "user_location": {
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

These filters work alongside other search parameters like date range or domain filters.

          {"role": "user", "content": "What major events are happening in the capital this week?"}
      ],
      model="sonar-pro",
      web_search_options={
          "user_location": {

              "longitude": 2.3522
          }
      }
  )

  print(f"Response: {completion.choices[0].message.content}")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import Perplexity from '@perplexity-ai/perplexity_ai';

  const client = new Perplexity();

  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on French news and events."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What major events are happening in the capital this week?"}

## Best Practices

**Choosing the Right Specificity**

* **All Fields (Recommended):** For maximum accuracy, provide country, region, city, latitude, and longitude. This combination gives the best results for location-specific queries.
* **City and Region:** Use these fields to significantly improve location accuracy without needing exact coordinates. Particularly useful for metropolitan areas and regional searches.
* **Latitude/Longitude:** Use for high precision when the exact location is known and relevant (e.g., finding nearby points of interest).
* **Country Code:** Use for broader context when country-level relevance is sufficient (e.g., national news, country-specific regulations).
* **Combining Fields:** We strongly recommend providing as many location fields as possible. Each additional field improves search accuracy and relevance.

**Data Accuracy**

* Ensure the provided location data is as accurate as possible. Incorrect data may lead to irrelevant results.
* Latitude values must be between -90 and 90. Longitude values must be between -180 and 180.
* Country codes should be valid two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (e.g., "US", "GB", "DE").
* City names should match commonly used names (e.g., "New York City" or "NYC" for New York).
* Region names should match standard administrative divisions (states, provinces, etc.).

**Privacy Considerations**

* Be mindful of user privacy when collecting and transmitting location data. Only use location when necessary and with user consent where applicable.

**Client-Side Validation**

* Consider validating location inputs before sending the request:
  * Check latitude/longitude ranges.
  * Validate country code format (two uppercase letters).
  * Sanitize city and region inputs for special characters.
