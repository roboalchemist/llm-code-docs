# Humanloop is the LLM Evals Platform for Enterprises

> Learn how to use Humanloop for prompt engineering, evaluation and monitoring. Comprehensive guides and tutorials for LLMOps.

<Callout intent="warning">
  The Humanloop platform will be sunset on **September 8th, 2025**. If you need
  to export your data, please see our [Migration
  Guide](/docs/guides/migrating-from-humanloop).
</Callout>

Humanloop enables product teams to build robust AI features with LLMs, using best-in-class tooling for **Evaluation**, **Prompt Management**,
and **Observability**.

<img src="file:ce052f15-4d42-4caa-a9a8-bc4274af9113" alt="Humanloop" />

The most successful AI teams focus on two best practices:

**Evals-driven development**<br />
They put evals at the heart of product development, continuously refining and enhancing AI features through feedback and iteration.

**Collaborative development**<br />
They enable non-technical domain experts and PMs to work seamlessly with engineers on prompt engineering and evaluation.

### Get started with Humanloop

Humanloop enables you to adopt these best practices. Our evals, prompt engineering and observability are designed to work together in a fast feedback loop. It works both UI-first and code-first so that the experience is great for developers and subject matter experts (SMEs).

# Evals in code

> Getting up and running with Humanloop is quick and easy. This guide will explain how to set up evaluations on Humanloop and use them to iteratively improve your applications.

## Prerequisites

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

This quickstart will take you through running your first Eval with Humanloop.

You'll learn how to trigger an evaluation from code, interpret an eval-report on Humanloop and use it to improve your AI features.

## Create an evals script

Add the following code in a file:

<CodeBlock>
  ```python maxLines=100
  from humanloop import Humanloop

  humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

  checks = humanloop.evaluations.run(
    name="Initial Test",
    file={
        "path": "Scifi/App",
        # Replace with your AI model
        "callable": lambda messages: (
            "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
            if messages[-1]["content"].lower() == "hal"
            else "Beep boop!"
        )
    },
    # Replace with your test dataset
    dataset={
        "path": "Scifi/Tests",
        "datapoints": [
          {
            "messages": [
              {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an AI that responds like famous sci-fi AIs."
              },
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "HAL"
              }
            ],
            "target": {
              "output": "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
            }
          },
          {
            "messages": [
              {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an AI that responds like famous sci-fi AIs."
              },
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "R2D2"
              }
            ],
            "target": {
              "output": "Beep boop beep!"
            }
          }
        ]
    }, 
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Exact match"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity"},
    ],
  )
  ```

  ```typescript maxLines=100
  import { HumanloopClient } from "humanloop";

  const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({
    apiKey: "<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>",
  });

  const checks = humanloop.evaluations.run({
    name: "Initial Test",
    file: {
      path: "Scifi/App",
      // Replace with your AI model
      callable: (inputs, messages) =>
        messages && messages[messages.length - 1].content.toLowerCase() === "hal"
          ? "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
          : "Beep boop!",
    },
    // Replace with your test dataset
    dataset: {
      path: "Scifi/Tests",
      datapoints: [
        {
          messages: [
            {
              role: "system",
              content: "You are an AI that responds like famous sci-fi AIs.",
            },
            {
              role: "user",
              content: "HAL",
            },
          ],
          target: { output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." },
        },
        {
          messages: [
            {
              role: "system",
              content: "You are an AI that responds like famous sci-fi AIs.",
            },
            {
              role: "user",
              content: "R2D2",
            },
          ],
          target: { output: "Beep boop beep!" },
        },
      ],
    },
    evaluators: [
      { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Exact match" },
      { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency" },
      { path: "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity" },
    ],
  });
  ```
</CodeBlock>

This sets up the basic structure of an [Evaluation](/docs/guides/evals/overview):

1. A **callable** function that you want to evaluate. The callable should take your inputs and/or messages and returns a string. The `file` argument defines the callable as well as the location of where the evaluation results will appear on Humanloop.
2. A test [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets) of inputs and/or messages to run your function over and optional expected targets to evaluate against.
3. A set of [Evaluators](/docs/explanation/evaluators) to provide judgments on the output of your function. This example uses default evaluators that come with every Humanloop workspace. Evaluators can also be defined locally and pushed to the Humanloop runtime.

It returns a `checks` object that contains the results of the eval per Evaluator.

## Run your script

Run your script with the following command:

<CodeBlock>
  ```python
  python main.py
  ```

  ```typescript
  npx tsx index.ts
  ```
</CodeBlock>

You will see a URL to view your evals on Humanloop. A summary of progress and the final results will be displayed directly in your terminal:

<img src="file:8868cba5-765c-4d89-8dda-bf19a9bfee63" alt="Eval progress and url in terminal" />

<img src="file:b838de78-6a84-4ebd-bcd7-d062d6a752c9" alt="Eval results in terminal" />

## View the results

Navigate to the URL provided in your terminal to see the result of running your script on Humanloop.
This `Stats` view will show you the live progress of your local eval runs as well summary statistics of the final results.
Each new run will add a column to your `Stats` view, allowing you to compare the performance of your LLM app over time.

The `Logs` and `Review` tabs allow you to drill into individual datapoints and view the outputs of different runs side-by-side to understand how to improve your LLM app.

<img src="file:fc172b49-0ffd-45f2-876b-fc8a1890f58b" alt="Eval results in terminal" />

## Make a change and re-run

Your first run resulted in a `Semantic similarity` score of 3 (out of 5) and an `Exact match` score of 0. Try and make a change to your `callable` to improve
the output and re-run your script. A second run will be added to your `Stats` view and the difference in performance will be displayed.

<img src="file:94ad5710-d404-4075-927a-b99a94756be9" alt="Re-run eval results in UI" />

## Next steps

Now that you've run your first eval on Humanloop, you can:

* Explore our detailed [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag-evaluation) on evaluating a real RAG app where you'll learn about versioning your app, customizing logging, adding Evaluator thresholds and more.
* Create your own [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets) of test cases to evaluate your LLM app against.
* Create your own [Evaluators](/docs/explanation/evaluators) to provide judgments on the output of your LLM app.


# Agent Evals in the UI

> Getting up and running with Humanloop is quick and easy. This guide will explain how to set up evaluations through the Humanloop UI.

For this quickstart, we're going to evaluate **Outreach Agent**, which is designed to compose personalized outbound messages to potential customers. The Agent uses a [Tool](/docs/explanation/tools) to research information about the lead before writing a message.

We will assess the quality of the Agent using a [Dataset](https://humanloop.com/docs/evaluation/guides/create-dataset) and [Evaluators](/docs/explanation/evaluators).

<Accordion title="Account setup">
  <p>
    Create a Humanloop Account
  </p>

  If you haven't already, [create an account](https://app.humanloop.com/signup) or [log in](https://app.humanloop.com/login) to Humanloop

  <p>
    Add an OpenAI API Key
  </p>

  If you're the first person in your organization, you'll need to add an API key to a model provider.

  1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
  2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

  <Info>
    Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
    OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
    providers private.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Running an Evaluation

<Steps>
  ### Clone an Agent

  In this quickstart, we will use a pre-configured Agent from the Humanloop Library.

  Navigate to the Library by clicking the Library button in the upper-left corner. Select the **Outreach Agent** and click the **Clone to Workspace** button in the upper-right corner.

  <Frame background="subtle">
    <img src="file:64a1e96b-2cef-4e4b-82e0-39aa44c7944a" />
  </Frame>

  This will create an **Outreach Agent** folder in your workspace. Inside the folder, you'll find:

  * The **Outreach Agent**.
  * **Hacker News Search** Tool used by the Agent to research potential customers.
  * A **Customer Outreach** Dataset and three **Evaluators** that we will use to assess the Agent.

  ### Try out the Agent

  The **Outreach Agent** looks up information about the lead on Hacker News and composes an outbound message to them.

  Before we kick off the first evaluation, run the Agent in the Editor to get a feel for how it works:

  1. Click on the **Outreach Agent** file.
  2. On the left-hand side, you can configure your Agent's Parameters, Instructions, and add Tools.
  3. On the right-hand side, you can specify Inputs and run the Agent on demand.
  4. Enter *Coca-Cola* as the organization and *Humanloop* as the lead in the Inputs section in the top right-hand side.
  5. Click the Run button.

  <Frame caption="The Agent used the Hacker News Tool to get more information about Humanloop composed a personal outbound message." background="subtle">
    <img src="file:37ce592a-f0e9-4bd0-a7a8-14878c56e4dd" />
  </Frame>

  ### Run Eval

  Evaluations are an efficient way to improve your Agent iteratively. You can test versions of the Agent against a [Dataset](https://humanloop.com/docs/evaluation/guides/create-dataset) and see how changing the Agent's configuration impacts the performance.

  To test the **Outreach Agent**, navigate to the **Evals** tab and click on the **+ Evaluation** button.

  Create a new Run by clicking on the **+ Run** button. Then, follow these steps:

  1. Click on the **Dataset** button and select **Customer Outreach** Dateset.
  2. Click on the **Agent** button and select the "v1" version.
  3. Click on **Evaluators** and add the three Evaluators included in the Output Agent folder: **Friendly Tone**, **Tool Call** and **Message Length**

  The first two Evaluators will check if the message is friendly and if the Tool was used.
  The **Message Length** Evaluator will show the number of words in the output, providing a baseline value for all further evaluations.

  Click **Save**. Humanloop will start generating Logs for the Evaluation.

  <Frame caption="For each test case in the Dataset, Humanloop runs the Agent, which produces Logs that are evaluated using the selected Evaluators.">
    <img src="file:f51e2e1a-38c0-42a7-bd22-733442e6b623" />
  </Frame>

  ### Review results

  After the Run is completed, you can review the Logs produced and corresponding judgments in the **Review** tab.

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:ac7a22a0-068d-4546-bea6-c4b5d81e9b2a" />
  </Frame>

  The summary of all Evaluators is displayed in the **Stats** tab.

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:e04c14e9-858e-455c-94b9-37ff538821eb" />
  </Frame>
</Steps>

<Callout>
  The evaluation is most useful when you iteratively improve the Agent, as it allows you to compare several versions
  side by side. Follow our [tutorial](/docs/v5/tutorials/evaluate-agent-in-ui) where we add the **Google Search Tool**
  to this Agent and compare the results with this version.
</Callout>

In this quick guide, you've created an Agent that can help your organization compose personalized messages to your leads. You've evaluated the initial version to see how this Agent performs across multiple inputs.

## Next steps

Now that you've successfully run your first Eval, you can explore how you can make your Agent more powerful:

* Add **Google Search** Tool to the Outbound Agent and compare two versions side by side. We explain the steps in our [Evaluate an Agent tutorial](/docs/v5/tutorials/evaluate-agent-in-ui)
* Learn how your subject-matter experts (such as your sales team) can [review and evaluate model outputs](/docs/evaluation/guides/manage-multiple-reviewers) in Humanloop to help improve your AI product.


# Create a Prompt in the UI

> This guide will show you how you can use Humanloop to quickly create a new prompt and experiment with it.

In this quickstart you'll create a prompt in the UI, experiment with it and then see logs from your experimentation.

{/* This is just a taste of what you can do through the UI in Humanloop. Once you've got started, check out our guides on how to use production logs and evaluators to [systematically improve your products](../tutorials/systematically-improve.mdx). */}

<Accordion title="Account setup">
  #### Create a Humanloop Account

  If you haven’t already, create an account or log in to Humanloop

  #### Add an OpenAI API Key

  If you’re the first person in your organization, you’ll need to add an API key to a model provider.

  1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

    Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
    OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
    providers private.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Get Started

<Steps>
  ### Create a Prompt File

  When you first open Humanloop you’ll see your File navigation on the left. Click ‘**+ New**’ and create a **Prompt**.

  <img src="file:82ffcfb5-78f2-453b-9074-25a4a61a14f3" />

  In the sidebar, rename this file to "Comedian Bot" now or later.

  ### Create the Prompt template in the Editor

  The left hand side of the screen defines your Prompt – the parameters such as model, temperature and template. The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.

  <img src="file:667cf910-a5c4-498a-a279-bba9606e0fb0" />

  In the editor, update the system message to:

  ```
  You are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.
  ```

  <img src="file:9bc5b928-b2c5-408f-a9cd-ab369a18a940" />

  This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called `topic` (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.

  On the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the **Inputs** section for `topic`.

  1. Add a value for `topic` e.g. music, jogging, whatever
  2. Click **Run** in the bottom right of the page

  This will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is *very* funny.

  You now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.

  ### Save your first version of this Prompt

  1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the editor
  2. Enter **Initial Comedian Setup** in the version name field
  3. Enter **Prompt for making (not so) funny jokes!** in the description field
  4. Click **Save**

  <img src="file:89549dd4-7507-4834-9854-5c1278838547" />

  ### View the logs

  Under the Prompt File, click ‘Logs’ to view all the generations from this Prompt

  Click on a row to see the details of what version of the Prompt generated it. From here you can give feedback to that generation, see performance metrics, open up this example in the Editor, or add this log to a Dataset.

  <img src="file:941bea3b-e28c-4a73-93fb-21265396d0d5" />
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Well done! You've now created your first Prompt.

## Log to Humanloop

<Info>
  If you use a programming language not supported by the SDK, or want more control, see our guide on 

  [logging through the API](/docs/v5/guides/observability/logging-through-api)

   for an alternative to decorators.
</Info>

Use the SDK decorators to enable logging. At runtime, every call to a decorated function will create a [Log](/docs/v5/explanations/logs) on Humanloop.

<CodeBlock>
  ```python maxLines=50 highlight={1,5,10}
  @humanloop.tool(path="Logging Quickstart/Calculator")
  def calculator(operation: str, num1: int, num2: int) -> str:
      ...

  @humanloop.prompt(path="Logging Quickstart/QA Prompt")
  def call_model(messages: list[str]) -> str:
      ...


  @humanloop.flow(path="Logging Quickstart/QA Agent")
  def conversation():
      ...

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      conversation()
  ```

  ```typescript maxLines=50 highlight={1-12, 17-20, 25-28}
  const calculator = humanloop.tool({
    path: "Chat Agent/Calculator",
    version: {function: CALCULATOR_JSON_SCHEMA},    
    callable: ({
      operation,
      num1,
      num2,
    }: {
      operation: string;
      num1: number;
      num2: number;
    }) => {
      ...
    },
  });

  const callModel = (messages: MessageType[]) =>
    humanloop.prompt({
      path: "Chat Agent/Call Model",
      callable: async (inputs: any, messages: MessageType[]) => {
        ...
      },
    })(undefined, messages);

  const conversation = () =>
    humanloop.flow({
      path: "Chat Agent/Conversation",
      callable: async () => {
        ...
      },
  })(undefined, undefined);
  ```
</CodeBlock>

## Run the code

Have a conversation with the agent. When you're done, type `exit` to close the program.

<CodeBlock>
  ```python
  > python main.py
  You: Hi dude!
  Agent: Tubular! I am here to help with math and science, what is groovin?
  You: How does flying work?
  Agent: ...
  You: What is 5678 * 456?
  Agent: [TOOL CALL] 2587968
  You: exit
  ```

  ```typescript
  > npx tsx index.ts
  You: Hi dude!
  Agent: Tubular! I am here to help with math and science, what is groovin?
  You: How does flying work?
  Agent: ...
  You: What is 5678 * 456?
  Agent: [TOOL CALL] 2587968
  You: exit
  ```
</CodeBlock>

## Check your workspace

Navigate to [your workspace](https://app.humanloop.com) to see the logged conversation.

Inside the **Logging Quickstart** directory on the left, click the **QA Agent** [Flow](/docs/v5/explanation/flows). Select the **Logs** tab from the top of the page and click the Log inside the table.

You will see the conversation's trace, containing Logs corresponding to the [Tool](/docs/v5/explanation/tools) and the [Prompt](/docs/v5/explanation/prompts).

<img src="file:127793e8-2f9c-4d24-ac00-0c7281e762f1" />

## Change the agent and rerun

Modify the `call_model` function to use a different model and temperature.

<CodeBlock>
  ```python maxLines=30 highlight={6-11}
  @humanloop.prompt(path="Logging Quickstart/QA Prompt")
  def call_model(messages: list[str]) -> str:
      output = openai.chat.completions.create(
          messages=messages,
          model="gpt-4o-mini",
          tools=[
              # The @tool utility adds a .json_schema attribute
              # to avoid redefining the schema
              calculator.json_schema
          ],
          temperature=0.2,
      )

      # Check if model asked for a tool call
      if output.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
          for tool_call in output.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
              arguments = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
              if tool_call.function.name == "calculator":
                  result = calculator(**arguments)
                  return f"[TOOL CALL] {result}"

      # Otherwise, return the LLM response
      return output.choices[0].message.content
  ```

  ```typescript maxLines=30 highlight={8-14}
  const callModel = (messages: MessageType[]) =>
    humanloop.prompt({
      path: "Chat Agent/Call Model",
      callable: async (inputs: any, messages: MessageType[]) => {
        const output = await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({
          messages: messages,
          model: "gpt-4o-mini",
          tools: [
              // The tool utility adds a .jsonSchema attribute
              // to avoid redefining the schema
              {
                  type: "function",
              function: calculator.jsonSchema,
            } as OpenAI.ChatCompletionTool,
          ],
          temperature: 0.2,
        });

        let llmResponse = "";

        // Check if the agent made a tool call
        if (output.choices[0].message.tool_calls) {
          for (const toolCall of output.choices[0].message.tool_calls) {
            const toolCallArgs = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);
            const result = await calculator(toolCallArgs);
            llmResponse = `[${toolCall.function.name}] ${result}`;
          }
        } else {
          llmResponse = output.choices[0].message.content || "";
        }

        return llmResponse;
      },
    })(undefined, messages);
  ```
</CodeBlock>

Run the agent again, then head back to your workspace.

Click the **QA Prompt** [Prompt](/docs/v5/explanation/prompts), select the **Dashboard** tab from the top of the page
and you should find a new version of the Prompt at the top of the list.

By changing the hyperparameters of the OpenAI call, you have tagged a new version of the Prompt.

## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account setup">
    <p>
      Create a Humanloop Account
    </p>

    1. [Create an account](https://app.humanloop.com/signup) or [log in](https://app.humanloop.com/login) to Humanloop

    2. Get a Humanloop API key from [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys).

    <p>
      Add an OpenAI API Key
    </p>

    If you're the first person in your organization, you'll need to add an API key to a model provider.

    1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

    <Info>
      Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
      OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
      providers private.

## Create the agent

<Steps>
  ### Create a Route Handler

  We start with a backend route that handles a chat request and streams back a response from a model. This model can call a function to get the weather in a given location.

  ```typescript title="app/api/chat/route.ts" maxLines=50
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
  import { streamText, tool } from "ai";
  import { z } from "zod";

  export const maxDuration = 30;

  export async function POST(req: Request) {
    const { messages } = await req.json();

    const result = streamText({
      model: openai("gpt-4o"),
      messages,
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: "Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)",
          parameters: z.object({
            location: z.string().describe("The location to get the weather for"),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => {
            const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
            return {
              location,
              temperature,
            };
          },
        }),
      },
    });

    return result.toDataStreamResponse();
  }
  ```

  ### Wire up the UI

  Now that you have a Route Handler that can query an LLM, it's time to setup your frontend. The AI SDK's [UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui) package abstracts the complexity of a chat interface into one hook, `useChat`.
  Update your root page to show a chat interface and provide a user message input.

  <Note>
    The `maxSteps` prop allows the model to take multiple "steps" for a given
    generation, using tool calls to refine its response.
  </Note>

  ```typescript title="app/page.tsx" maxLines=50
  'use client';

  import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

  export default function Chat() {
    const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
      maxSteps: 5,
    });

    return (
      <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
        {messages.map(m => (
          <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
            {m.parts.map((p, idx) =>
              p.type === "tool-invocation" || p.type === "source" ? (
                <pre key={idx}>{JSON.stringify(p, null, 2)}</pre>
              ) : p.type === "text" ? (
                <p key={idx}>{p.text}</p>
              ) : (
                <p key={idx}>{p.reasoning}</p>
              )
            )}
          </div>
        ))}

        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <input
            className="fixed dark:bg-zinc-900 bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-800 rounded shadow-xl"
            value={input}
            placeholder="Say something..."
            onChange={handleInputChange}
          />
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  ### Run the agent

  Start your app and give the agent a try.

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash title="npm"
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash title="pnpm"
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash title="yarn"
    yarn dev
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>

  <Frame caption="The agent calls its tools to answer the user's question.">
    <img src="file:c32e9ddc-c577-4c51-9a9a-535f188df3db" />
  </Frame>
</Steps>

## Log to Humanloop

The agent works and is capable of function calling. However, we rely on inputs and outputs to reason about the behavior.

Humanloop logging allows you to observe the steps taken by the agent, which we will demonstrate below.

We'll use Vercel AI SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry tracing to log to Humanloop.

<Steps>
  ### Set up OpenTelemetry

  Install dependencies.

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash wordWrap title="npm"
    npm install @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/instrumentation
    ```

    ```bash wordWrap title="pnpm"
    pnpm add @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/instrumentation
    ```

    ```bash wordWrap title="yarn"
    yarn add @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/instrumentation
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>

  Create a file called `instrumentation.ts` in your root or /src directory and add the following code:

  ```typescript title="instrumentation.ts"
  import { registerOTel } from "@vercel/otel";

  export function register() {
    registerOTel({
      serviceName: "humanloop-ai-sdk-agent",
    });
  }
  ```

  Configure the [OpenTelemetry exporter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/) to forward logs to Humanloop.

  ```plaintext highlight={4-6} title=".env.local" wordWrap
  HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>

  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.humanloop.com/v5/import/otel
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="X-API-KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>" # Humanloop API key
  ```

  ### Trace AI SDK calls

  The telemetry metadata associates Logs with your Files on Humanloop.

  We will use a Humanloop [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) to log LLM calls, and a Humanloop [Flow](/docs/explanation/flows) to group related generation calls into a trace.

  The `humanloop.directoryPath` specifies the path to a Directory where your Files and Logs will be located.

  ```typescript title="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight={13-19} maxLines=50
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
  import { streamText, tool } from "ai";
  import { z } from "zod";

  export const maxDuration = 30;

  export async function POST(req: Request) {
    const { messages } = await req.json();

    const result = streamText({
      model: openai("gpt-4o"),
      messages,
      experimental_telemetry: {
        isEnabled: true,
        metadata: {
          "humanloop.directoryPath": "path/to/directory",
        },
      },
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: "Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)",
          parameters: z.object({
            location: z.string().describe("The location to get the weather for"),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => {
            const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
            return {
              location,
              temperature,
            };
          },
        }),
      },
    });

    return result.toDataStreamResponse();
  }
  ```

  Restart your app, and have a conversation with the agent.

  ### Explore logs on Humanloop

  Now you can explore your logs on the [Humanloop platform](https://app.humanloop.com), and see the steps taken by the agent during your conversation.

  <Frame caption="The logs capture the agent calling its tools to answer the user's question.">
    <img src="file:14431cde-9f01-45a2-beec-205acd7569b6" />
  </Frame>
</Steps>

## Debugging

If you run into any issues, add OpenTelemetry debug logging to ensure the Exporter is working correctly.

<CodeBlocks>
  ```bash title="npm"
  npm install @opentelemetry/api
  ```

  ```bash title="pnpm"
  pnpm add @opentelemetry/api
  ```

  ```bash title="yarn"
  yarn add @opentelemetry/api
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

```typescript title="instrumentation.ts"
import { registerOTel } from "@vercel/otel";
import { diag, DiagConsoleLogger, DiagLogLevel } from "@opentelemetry/api";

diag.setLogger(new DiagConsoleLogger(), DiagLogLevel.DEBUG);
export function register() {
  registerOTel({
    serviceName: "humanloop-ai-sdk-agent",
  });
}
```

## Next steps

Logging is the first step to observing your AI product. Read these guides to learn more about evals on Humanloop:

* Add [monitoring Evaluators](/docs/v5/guides/observability/monitoring) to evaluate Logs as they're made against a File.

* See evals in action in our [tutorial on evaluating an agent](/docs/v5/tutorials/agent-evaluation).


# Observability in Node.js

> Add logging to your Vercel AI SDK application with Humanloop.

Add Humanloop observability to a chat agent by calling the tool built with Vercel AI SDK. It builds on the AI SDK's [Node.js example](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started/nodejs).

## Create the agent

We start with a simple chat agent capable of function calling.

```typescript title="agent.ts" maxLines=50
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { CoreMessage, streamText, tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";
import * as readline from "node:readline/promises";

async function exit() {
  console.log("Assistant: Shutting down...");
  process.exit(0);
}

const terminal = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const messages: CoreMessage[] = [
  {
    role: "system",
    content:
      "You are a helpful assistant. If the user asks you to exit, you should exit the program.",
  },
];

async function main() {
  while (true) {
    const userInput = await terminal.question("You: ");

    if (userInput === "exit") {
      break;
    }

    messages.push({ role: "user", content: userInput });

    const result = streamText({
      model: openai("gpt-4o"),
      messages,
      maxSteps: 5,
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: "Get the weather in a location (in Celsius)",
          parameters: z.object({
            location: z
              .string()
              .describe("The location to get the weather for"),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => ({
            location,
            temperature: Math.round((Math.random() * 30 + 5) * 10) / 10, // Random temp between 5°C and 35°C
          }),
        }),
      },
    });

    let fullResponse = "";
    process.stdout.write("\nAssistant: ");
    for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
      fullResponse += delta;
      process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    process.stdout.write("\n\n");

    messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: fullResponse });
  }

  await exit();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

This agent can provide weather updates for a user-provided location.

```plaintext
$ npx tsx agent.ts
You: What's the weather like in London?
Assistant: The current temperature in London is 20°C.
You: exit
Assistant: Shutting down...
```

## Log to Humanloop

The agent works and is capable of function calling. However, we rely on inputs and outputs to reason about the behavior. Humanloop logging allows you to observe the steps taken by the agent, which we will demonstrate below.

We'll use Vercel AI SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry tracing to log to Humanloop.

<Steps>
  ### Set up OpenTelemetry

  Install dependencies.

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash title="npm"
    npm install dotenv @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
    ```

    ```bash title="pnpm"
    pnpm add dotenv @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
    ```

    ```bash title="yarn"
    yarn add dotenv @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>

  Configure the [OpenTelemetry exporter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/) to forward logs to Humanloop.

  ```plaintext highlight={4-6} title=".env" wordWrap
  HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>

  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.humanloop.com/v5/import/otel
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="X-API-KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>" # Humanloop API key
  ```

  ### Trace AI SDK calls

  Vercel AI SDK will now forward OpenTelemetry logs to Humanloop.

  The telemetry metadata associates Logs with your Files on Humanloop. The `humanloop.directoryPath` specifies the path to a Directory where your Files and Logs will be located.

  ```typescript title="agent.ts" maxLines=50 highlight={6-16,20,51-57}
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
  import { CoreMessage, streamText, tool } from "ai";

  import * as readline from "node:readline/promises";

  import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
  import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";
  import dotenv from "dotenv";

  dotenv.config();

  const sdk = new NodeSDK({
    instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  });

  sdk.start();

  async function exit() {
    console.log("Assistant: Shutting down...");
    await sdk.shutdown();
    process.exit(0);
  }

  const terminal = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout,
  });

  const messages: CoreMessage[] = [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a helpful assistant. If the user asks you to exit, you should exit the program.",
    },
  ];

  async function main() {
    while (true) {
      const userInput = await terminal.question("You: ");

      if (userInput === "exit") {
        break;
      }

      messages.push({ role: "user", content: userInput });

      const result = streamText({
        model: openai("gpt-4o"),
        messages,
        maxSteps: 5,
        experimental_telemetry: {
          isEnabled: true,
          metadata: {
            "humanloop.directoryPath": "Vercel AI/Weather",
          },
        },
        tools: {
          weather: tool({
            description: "Get the weather in a location (in Celsius)",
            parameters: z.object({
              location: z
                .string()
                .describe("The location to get the weather for"),
            }),
            execute: async ({ location }) => ({
              location,
              temperature: Math.round((Math.random() * 30 + 5) * 10) / 10, // Random temp between 5°C and 35°C
            }),
          }),
        },
      });

      let fullResponse = "";
      process.stdout.write("\nAssistant: ");
      for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
        fullResponse += delta;
        process.stdout.write(delta);
      }
      process.stdout.write("\n\n");

      messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: fullResponse });
    }

    await exit();
  }

  main().catch(console.error);
  ```

  ### Run the agent

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash title="npm"
    npx tsx agent.ts
    ```

    ```bash title="pnpm"
    pnpm tsx agent.ts
    ```

    ```bash title="yarn"
    yarn tsx agent.ts
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>

  Have a conversation with the agent, and try asking about the weather in a city (in Celsius or Fahrenheit). When you're done, type `exit` to close the program.

  ### Explore logs on Humanloop

  Now you can explore your logs on the [Humanloop platform](https://app.humanloop.com), and see the steps taken by the agent during your conversation.

  You can see below the full trace of prompts and tool calls that were made.

  <Frame caption="The trace captures the agent calling its tools to answer the user's question.">

  </Frame>
</Steps>

## Debugging

If you run into any issues, add OpenTelemetry debug logging to ensure your Exporter is working correctly.

<CodeBlocks>
  ```bash title="npm"
  npm install @opentelemetry/api
  ```

  ```bash title="pnpm"
  pnpm add @opentelemetry/api
  ```

  ```bash title="yarn"
  yarn add @opentelemetry/api
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

```typescript title="agent.ts"
import { diag, DiagConsoleLogger, DiagLogLevel } from "@opentelemetry/api";

diag.setLogger(new DiagConsoleLogger(), DiagLogLevel.DEBUG);
```

# Integrating Humanloop

> Best practices for integrating Humanloop into your software development life cycle

Humanloop is the central registry for your AI features. It versions the key artifacts — the Prompts, Tools, Flows, and Datasets — while capturing logs to enable you to run evals and monitor performance to make reliable AI applications.

Humanloop is flexible on how you integrate it into your applications, you can:

* Store the artifacts in your codebase or within Humanloop
* Execute AI logic in code or on Humanloop
* Run evals in your runtime or on Humanloop

This facilitates collaboration on AI features with non-technical subject matter experts while maintaining your software development practices.

## Choosing an integration approach

Your integration approach will depend on the complexity of your project, the structure of your team, and your deployment requirements.

### UI vs Code Prompt Management

You should choose one of two ways for managing prompts and AI artifacts: "UI first" or "code first". You’ll likely want to use UI-first approach if your domain experts are involved in prompt development.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="UI-first prompt management">
    You create and iterate on your Prompts, Tools, Flows and Datasets in the Humanloop UI. Prompts can be synced back to your codebase or called directly via the API.

    This is ideal for situations where you have subject matter experts or project managers who are primarily responsible for the "how it works" of your AI features.

    **Benefits:**

    * ✅ Faster iteration which can be decoupled from code releases
    * ✅ Easier collaboration with subject matter experts

    **Drawbacks:**

    * ❌ Does not support complex prompt chains or flows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code-first prompt management">
    You define and maintain prompts, tools and agents in code and then log to Humanloop.

    **Benefits:**

    * ✅ Full flexibility of code for developing your prompts or complex agents
    * ✅ Maintains a point-in-time snapshot of both code and prompts
    * ✅ Maintains your existing CI/CD practices

    **Drawbacks:**

    * ❌ Harder for domain experts to collaborate
    * ❌ Less convenient for iterating on prompts and running evaluations
    * ❌ Tightly coupled to code releases, means slower iteration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Proxy vs Direct Calls

You have two options for calling your Prompts: "Proxy via Humanloop" or "Direct Calls + Logging".
You'll likely want to use the proxy approach if you want to centralize your logging and versioning and the direct call approach if you want to minimize latency.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Proxy via Humanloop">
    Your calls to large language models go via Humanloop, which forwards requests to model providers and logs the results automatically.

    **Benefits:**

    * ✅ Simplifies integration
    * ✅ Centralized logging and versioning
    * ✅ Easier hot-swapping of Prompts

    **Drawbacks:**

    * ❌ Adds a slight latency overhead
    * ❌ Adds Humanloop as a dependency to your critical path
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Direct Calls + Logging">
    Your app calls the model provider directly, then logs results to Humanloop.

    **Benefits:**

    * ✅ No extra latency
    * ✅ Can call custom providers and services

    **Drawbacks:**

    * ❌ Requires additional logging logic
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The rest of this guide gives more details on the different approaches.

## Prompt Management

Prompt management is the process of creating, updating, and versioning your Prompts, Tools, Flows and Datasets. AI artifacts should be version-controlled just like application code, however unlike application code, often the people that best understand how they should work are domain experts, not developers. Humanloop provides a UI-based environment for domain expert involvement, while still being able to sync the back to your codebase and version control.

### Versioning

Humanloop automatically tracks all versions of your Tools, Flows, Agents and Datasets, whether created in the UI or in code. Each version is uniquely identified by hashing its parameters. Humanloop computes this hash based on the template, the temperature and other parameters and logs accordingly. Every time a Prompt is called or an LLM response is logged, the resulting [Log](/docs/explanation/logs) is associated with a specific version.

This versioning allows you to:

* **Evaluate:** compare the performance of different versions
* **Auditability:** review changes over time
* **Deployment control:** manage rollbacks and staged releases

## Create and manage your Prompts in code or in the UI

Humanloop supports both UI and code-based prompt management, giving you flexibility for your team's needs. You can always mix both approaches — starting in the UI and syncing to code, or vice versa.

### Use code-first management if:

* **You are creating a complex agent or workflow**

  If an LLM call is embedded within a structured workflow with dependencies on the schemas before and after the step, managing it in code is usually more practical.

* **You are creating your Prompts dynamically**

For example, if you are dynamically setting the template or available tools based on app state or user inputs, you’ll find it easier to set this in code.

<Tip>
  Note that with template variables (`{{ variable }}`) and jinja syntax, you
  should put the dynamic state as inputs into the template.
</Tip>

### Use the UI for AI development if:

* **Your domain experts are responsible for prompt iteration.**

  The UI enables non-technical team members to contribute effectively.

* **You want an interactive environment for prompt engineering**

  Your domain experts can load in examples, replay interesting datapoints, and run evaluations with ease.

* **You’re iterating on existing Prompts**

  Even if the Prompt was initially developed in code, the UI is a more convenient place to iterate on it

## Syncing Humanloop to your codebase

If Humanloop is the **source of truth**, and you wish to have the state of your Prompts in your codebase, you can sync the latest versions back to your codebase.

Each file can be serialised and stored in version control. The [`.prompt` format](/docs/v5/reference/serialized-files#prompt-format) is a human-readable representation of your Prompts that can be stored in git, and all other files can be serialised as JSON.

You can use the [List Files](/docs/api/files/list-files) API to fetch the latest versions of your files and store them in your codebase.

{/* TODO: add some guides on how to sync */}

{/* ### How to Sync */}

{/* **Export from Humanloop:** You can manually download or programmatically fetch the latest `.prompt` files using the API. */}

{/* **Use the CLI (Coming Soon):** Humanloop will offer a CLI tool to fetch and sync the latest state of your files effortlessly. */}

{/* For detailed instructions, refer to Guide */}

## Decoupling AI updates from your software lifecycle

For many applications you want to update your AI behavior faster than your traditional software release process. Humanloop allows you to iterate on prompts separately while maintaining control over which versions are used in production.

### Environment labels

Humanloop supports **environment labels** (e.g., `"development"`, `"staging"`, `"production"`) that allow you to deploy specific prompt versions without modifying code.

How it works:

1. When calling/fetching your Prompts in code, specify the environment e.g. `production` instead of a fixed version ID.
2. In the UI (or via API), promote a new version to the desired environment.
3. Your application now uses the updated Prompt without any code changes ✨

## Calling your Prompts, Agents and Flows

You have two options for calling LLMs with your prompts in production:

### 1. Use the Humanloop Proxy for simplicity

Proxying your LLM calls via Humanloop simplifies logging, versioning, and provider management. Humanloop provides a **unified API** that forwards requests to the LLM provider and automatically logs the results.

**How it works:**

1. You call the Humanloop API (e.g.`Prompts.call()`) instead of each model provider.
2. Humanloop fetches/creates the prompt, calls the provider and logs and returns the result.

✅ **Easier integration** – fetches latest version, calls provider and logs result in one call <br />
✅ **Unified interface** – easy swapping between model providers <br />
✅ **Automatic versioning** – ensures all interactions are versioned <br />
⚠️ **Adds slight latency** – due to the extra network hop <br />
⚠️ **Adds to the critical path** - for uptime critical applications you may want an enterprise SLA

Using the Humanloop proxy can accelerate development since you can swap out models or adjust prompt templates on the platform side without changing code.

### 2. Direct call and logging

With this you call the model provider directly and log results manually to Humanloop. This minimizes latency and allows custom models.

**How it works:**

1. You fetch the latest version of the prompt from Humanloop (or have it in code)
2. You send the requests to OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
3. You log responses separately to Humanloop.

{/* TODO: add a link to the logging docs */}

{/* <Tip> You can use the decorators [TODO: link] in the SDK to simplify the logging </Tip> */}

{/* TODO: I'd like here to be able to explain how we can make this convenient with fetching the latest version of the prompt */}

* ✅ **No extra network hop** – ideal for latency-sensitive use cases<br />
* ✅ **Supports proprietary/custom models**<br />
* ⚠️ **Requires manual logging** – you must track metadata yourself

### Choosing the Right Approach

For most teams, **proxying via Humanloop is the easiest choice**. If performance is critical, use **direct calls** but ensure proper logging.

| **Use Case**                         | **Best Approach**          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Fast iteration & centralized logging | **Proxy via Humanloop**    |
| Low-latency, mission-critical apps   | **Direct calls + logging** |
| Using a custom/proprietary model     | **Direct calls + logging** |

## Running Evals

Given the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and the challenging subjective tasks they're applied to, evaluation is integral to the development of AI features.

Evaluations are where [Evaluators](/docs/concepts/evaluators) are run on the Logs of your Prompts, Flows and Agents. The Logs can be production data, or created by running a [Dataset](/docs/concepts/datasets) through the application you're testing.

### Evaluators in Humanloop runtime versus your runtime

Evaluators are used to evaluate the performance of your Prompts, Flows and Agents. They can be defined on Humanloop as a Python function, an LLM call, or as a “human" feedback.

Your Evaluators and Datasets can be stored in code, or in Humanloop. Evaluations can be run in code or through the UI.

Evaluators which are defined within the Humanloop UI can be executed in the Humanloop runtime, whereas Evaluators defined in your code can be executed in your runtime and the results posted back to Humanloop. This provides flexibility for supporting more complex evaluation workflows.

Our recommendation is to store them on Humanloop where possible so that you can benefit from:

* ✅ Parallel execution
* ✅ Automatic logging of results
* ✅ Versioning of evaluators
* ✅ Integration with your existing CI/CD
* ✅ Easy triggering of evals from the UI or from your CI/CD
* ✅ Re-use of your evaluators as online monitoring evaluators

{/* TODO! */}

{/* ## CI/CD Automation */}

{/* Humanloop can be integrated into CI/CD to ensure **AI regressions are caught before deployment**. This helps teams continuously improve prompts and models. */}

{/* For a detailed guide, see [**Humanloop CI/CD Setup**](https://www.notion.so/Doc-Integrating-Humanloop-1a0b02063acd80efa2e3fae864e1aafb?pvs=21). */}

## What's Next?

You should now have an understanding of the flexibility of Humanloop’s integration patterns, that can cater for subject matter experts and developers to collaborate on AI features.

# Humanloop Files

> Discover how Humanloop manages datasets, with version control and collaboration to enable you to evaluate and fine-tune your models.

<img src="file:778c1e27-9a9d-4a11-8e5b-cf9f4c4a18a1" />

Files represent the core building blocks of your AI features on Humanloop. They exist within a flexible filesystem in an Organization.

### Function Files

[**Prompts**](./prompts)<br />
Prompts define a task for a Large Language Model.

[**Agents**](./agents)<br />
Agents are multi-step AI systems that leverage an LLM, external information sources and tool calling to accomplish complex tasks automatically.

[**Evaluators**](./evaluators)<br />
Evaluators judge the output of Prompts, Tools, Flows, or other Evaluators.

[**Tools**](./tools)<br />
Tools extend Prompts and Agents with access to external data sources and enable them to take action.

[**Flows**](./flows)<br />
Flows are orchestrations of Prompts, Tools, and other code — enabling evaluation and improvement of complete AI pipelines.

### Static Files

[**Datasets**](/docs/v4/datasets)<br />
Datasets are collections of Datapoints used for evaluation and fine-tuning.

***

## File properties

### Files are managed in the UI or code

Files can be managed in the [Humanloop UI](https://app.humanloop.com/), or via the [API](/docs/api). Product teams and their Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) may prefer using the UI for convenience, whereas AI Teams and Engineers may prefer to use the API for greater control and customization.

### Files are version-controlled

Files have immutable Versions that are uniquely determined by their parameters that characterise the behavior of the system. For example, a Prompt Version is determined by the prompt template, base model, and hyperparameters. Within the Humanloop Editor and via the API, you can save new Versions of a File, view the history of changes, and revert to a previous version via deployments.

### Files have a serialized form

All Files can be exported and imported in a serialized form. For example, Prompts and Agents are serialized to our [.prompt and .agent file formats](/docs/reference/serialized-files). This allows technical teams to maintain the source of truth within their existing version control systems, such as Git.

### Files support deployments

You can tag File Versions with specific Environments and target these Environments via the UI and API to facilitate robust deployment workflows.

### Function Files are callable

Function Files can be called when using the Humanloop runtime. Or logged to when using your own runtime.

*Example:* When a Prompt is called, Humanloop acts as a proxy to the [model provider](/docs/reference/models#providers), logs and returns the output. If you manage the model calls yourself, the results can be logged to the Prompt File.

Using the Humanloop runtime is easier and lets you run files directly in the UI, while managing your own runtime gives you more control.

### Function Files have Logs

Every time a Function File is called, a [Log](/docs/explanation/logs) is created. Logs can also be posted via the API.

***

| File                                       | Versioned | Callable | Logs |

# Prompts

> Discover how Humanloop manages prompts, with version control and rigorous evaluation for better performance.

<img src="file:3f42058a-0ebe-481b-9a88-426cc334251c" />

A Prompt on Humanloop defines the instructions and configuration for guiding a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform a specific task.

Each change in any of the following properties creates a new Version of the Prompt:

* the **template** such as `Write a song about {{topic}}`.<br />For chat models, the template contains an array of messages
* the **model** e.g. `gpt-4o`
* the **parameters** to the model such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`
* any **tools** available to the model

A Prompt is callable in that if you supply the necessary inputs, it will return a response from the model.

Inputs are defined in the template through the double-curly bracket syntax e.g. `{{topic}}` and the value of the variable will need to be supplied when you call the Prompt to create a generation.

This separation of concerns, keeping configuration separate from the query time data, is crucial for enabling you to experiment with different configurations and evaluate any changes.
The Prompt stores the configuration and the query time data in [Logs](./logs), which can then be used to create Datasets for evaluation purposes.

<Callout>
  Note that we use a capitalized "[Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts)" to refer
  to the entity in Humanloop, and a lowercase "prompt" to refer to the general
  concept of input to the model.
</Callout>

<Frame caption="An example Prompt, serialized in the .prompt file format">
  ```jsx
  ---
  model: gpt-4o
  temperature: 1.0
  max_tokens: -1
  provider: openai
  endpoint: chat
  ---
  <system>
    Write a song about {{topic}}
  </system>
  ```
</Frame>

## Versioning

Versioning your Prompts enables you to track how adjustments to the template or parameters influence the model's responses. This is crucial for iterative development, as you can pinpoint which configuration produces the most relevant or accurate outputs for your use cases.

A Prompt File will have multiple Versions as you iterate on different models, templates, or parameters, but each version should perform the same task and generally be interchangeable with one another.

### When to create a new Prompt File

You should create a new Prompt File for each different 'task to be done' with an LLM. Each of these tasks can have its own separate Prompt File: *Writing Copilot*, *Personal Assistant*, *Summarizer*, etc.

Many users find value in creating a 'playground' Prompt where they can freely experiment without risking damage to their other Prompts or creating disorder.

## Using Prompts

Prompts are callable as an API, allowing you to provide query-time data such as input values or user messages, and receive the model's text output in response.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" />

Prompts can also be used without proxying through Humanloop to the model provider. Instead, you can call the model directly and explicitly log the results to your Prompt.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/log" />

## Serialization

The [.prompt file format](/docs/reference/serialized-files#prompt-format) is a serialized representation of a Prompt Version, designed to be human-readable and suitable for integration into version control systems alongside code.

The format is heavily inspired by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), with model and parameters specified in a YAML header alongside a JSX-inspired syntax for chat templates.

<CodeBlocks>
  ```jsx Chat
  ---
  model: gpt-4o
  temperature: 1.0
  max_tokens: -1
  provider: openai
  endpoint: chat
  ---
  <system>
    You are a friendly assistant.
  </system>
  ```

  ```jsx Completion
  ---
  model: claude-2

# Agents

> Humanloop Agents enable you to build and monitor complex AI workflows, from simple tool calling to sophisticated multi-step processes. Create, test, and deploy Agents through our UI or API.

<img src="file:addb3af5-0c4c-46d3-8f83-e84771cf9fa3" />

<Warning>
  Agents are currently in beta and subject to change.
</Warning>

## Overview

A Humanloop Agent is a multi-step AI system that leverages an LLM, external information sources and tool calling to accomplish complex tasks automatically. It comprises a main orchestrator LLM that utilizes tools to accomplish its task.

<Frame caption="An Agent takes an input and executes multiple steps, using tools to accomplish the task.">
  <video
    id="agent-demo-video"
    autoplay
    muted
    loop
    playsinline
    onCanPlay="this.muted=true"
    onCanPlayThrough={() => {
      // autoplay muted doesn't seem to work; need this workaround
      // https://stackoverflow.com/a/51189390
      const video = document.getElementById('agent-demo-video');
      video.muted = true;
      video.play();
    }}
  >
    <source src="file:cd15dae4-3588-4a8a-a9b6-721b383997e9" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Frame>

An Agent is composed primarily of:

* A **template** that instructs the Agent model how to process tasks
* Model **parameters** such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `reasoning_effort`
* The **workflow configuration** that defines how the Agent processes tasks, such as `max_iterations` and `stopping_tools`
* The available **tools** the Agent can use, including [Tools](/docs/v5/explanation/tools) and [Prompts](/docs/v5/explanation/prompts)

An Agent executes on the Humanloop platform: for a given Agent version, if you supply the necessary inputs, it will execute until it reaches a stopping condition.
Humanloop will return a [Log](/docs/v5/explanation/logs) with an `output` or `output_message`, along with the full trace of the Agent's execution.

Inputs are defined through **variables** in the Agent template. The values of these variables will need to be supplied when you call the Agent to create a generation. The Agent configuration and runtime data will be stored in Logs, which can then be used to create Datasets for evaluation purposes.

## Basics

You can create and configure Agents through the Humanloop UI or programmatically via our SDK.

### Agents in the UI

To create an Agent, create a new file and select the **Agent** option.

<Frame caption="Create a new **Agent** file.">
  <img src="file:867f1c79-d737-4efe-be6c-872b7bd8470c" />
</Frame>

Then, use the Agent Editor to configure and test the Agent. You can link existing Tools and Prompts from your workspace for the Agent to use. You can also define a tool inline by providing its JSON schema. You can also configure the `max_iterations` and `stopping_tools` for the Agent in the "Parameters" section.

<Frame caption="Edit and test the Agent template and configuration in the Editor.">
  <img src="file:33fb4f00-3651-42d7-a40b-6fd01ac14eeb" />
</Frame>

### Agents via the SDK

To create an Agent programmatically, use our SDK.

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents \
  -H "X-API-Key: $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "path": "Banking/Teller Agent",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "endpoint": "chat",
    "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    "reasoning_effort": 1024,
    "template": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful a digital bank teller, you help users navigate our digital banking platform."
      },
    ],
    "max_iterations": 3,
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "file",
        "link": {
          "file_id": "pr_1234567890",
          "version_id": "prv_1234567890"
        },
        "on_agent_call": "continue"
      },
      {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
          "name": "stop",
          "description": "Call this tool when you have finished your task.",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "output": {
                "type": "string",
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
    ]
  }'
```

Agents can be called through our UI for testing and development, or via API for production deployments.

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/call \
  -H "X-API-Key: $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "path": "Banking/Teller Agent",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I need to withdraw $1000"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

If your Agent calls a tool that Humanloop cannot run, the system will pause and wait until you provide the response required by the tool. You can then continue the Agent's execution using the `/continue` endpoint.

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/continue \
  -H "X-API-Key: $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "log_id": "log_1234567890",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": "tool_call_1234567890",
        "content": "Not enough funds. Politely decline user request."
      }
    ]
    "stream": false
  }'
```

You can also log Agent executions explicitly when running the Agent logic yourself:

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/log \
  -H "X-API-Key: $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "path": "Banking/Teller Agent",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I need to withdraw $1000"
      },
    ]
  }'
```

## Versioning

Versioning your Agents enables you to track how adjustments to template, tools, or model parameters influence the Agent's behavior. This is crucial for iterative development, as you can pinpoint which configuration produces the most effective results for your use cases. You can use the Editor or SDK to create and update Agent Versions and iterate on improving its performance.

The following components of an Agent contribute to its version:

* The Agent's **template** -- the system prompt and any other instructions
* The model call **parameters** -- such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `reasoning_effort`
* The Agent's **workflow** configuration -- such as `max_iterations` and `stopping_tools`
* The Agent's **tools** -- including both inline JSON Schema tools and linked Tool or Prompt Versions

## Stopping Conditions

An Agent will stop executing in three circumstances:

1. The maximum number of iterations is reached
2. The Agent executes a tool that is configured to stop the Agent
3. The Agent has generated a response with no further tool calls

### Max Iterations

You can cap the maximum number of iterations an Agent can execute--the Agent will generate up to `max_iterations` times, and then stop.

This results in an Agent Log with a `finish_reason` of `"max_iterations_reached"`.

### Stopping Tools

You can designate that a tool should stop the Agent after it is called. If it can be run on Humanloop, it will be run and the result logged before the Agent stops.

This results in an Agent Log with a `finish_reason` of `"stopping_tool_called"` and `stopping_tool_names` populated.

### Agent Finished

Lastly, the Agent will stop if it has generated a response with no further tool calls. This represents a natural end to the Agent's execution, and results in an Agent Log with a `finish_reason` of `"agent_generation_finished"`.

## Evaluation

Agents can be evaluated both through the Humanloop UI and programmatically. After each Agent execution, configured evaluators will run automatically on Humanloop.

Get started with [evaluating your Agents in the UI](/docs/tutorials/evaluate-agent-in-ui) or [programmatically](/docs/tutorials/agent-evaluation-code).

## Tracing

A trace is the collection of Logs associated with an Agent execution, showing the complete path from input to output, including all intermediate steps.

Every Agent trace includes:

* The initial input and messages, and final output
* All intermediate LLM calls and their responses as nested Logs
* Tools called by the Agent and their inputs and outputs as nested Logs
* Any errors or unexpected behaviors
* Timing and performance metrics

<Frame caption="Traces show the individual steps taken by the agent.">
  <img src="file:8e6375e6-140f-48b4-a18e-292161745768" />
</Frame>

### Metrics and Timing

Cost, latency, execution time, and token usage metrics are captured for each trace. They span from the earliest interaction to the final response.

## Serialization

The .agent file format is a serialized representation of an Agent Version, designed to be human-readable and suitable for integration into version control systems alongside code.

The format is heavily inspired by MDX, with model and parameters specified in a YAML header alongside JSX-style syntax for chat templates.

## Next steps

You now understand the role of Agents in the Humanloop ecosystem. Explore the following resources to apply Agents to your AI project:

* See our tutorials to learn how to evaluate your Agent [via UI](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) or [via code](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-api).

# Evaluators

> Learn about LLM Evaluation using Evaluators. Evaluators are functions that can be used to judge the output of Prompts, Tools or other Evaluators.

<img src="file:83080b42-2ab3-41b4-9a00-be9f5efdbd8f" />

The core entity in the Humanloop evaluation framework is an **[Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators)** - a function you define which takes an LLM-generated log as an argument and returns a **judgment**.
The judgment is typically either a boolean or a number, indicating how well the model performed according to criteria you determine based on your use case.

Evaluators can be leveraged for [Monitoring](/docs/guides/observability/monitoring) your live AI application, as well as for [Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to benchmark different version of your AI application against each other pre-deployment.

## Sources of Judgment

Currently, you can define three different Evaluator sources on Humanloop:

* **Code** - using simple deterministic rules based judgments against attributes like cost, token usage, latency, regex rules on the output, etc. These are generally fast and cheap to run at scale.
* **AI** - using other foundation models to provide judgments on the output. This allows for more qualitative and nuanced judgments for a fraction of the cost of human judgments.
* **Human** - getting gold standard judgments from either end users of your application, or internal domain experts. This can be the most expensive and slowest option, but also the most reliable.

<img src="file:ac3b6f09-206d-4143-b289-49bf853e43fe" />

## Online Monitoring versus Offline Evaluation

Evaluators can be deployed on Humanloop to support both testing new versions of your Prompts and Tools during development and for monitoring live apps that are already in production.

### Online Monitoring

Evaluators are run against the [Logs](./logs) generated by your AI applications. Typically, they are used to monitor deployed model performance over time and check for drift or degradation in performance.
The Evaluator in this case only takes a single argument - the `log` generated by the model. The Evaluator is expected to return a judgment based on the Log,
which can be used to trigger alerts or other actions in your monitoring system.

See our [Monitoring guides](/docs/guides/observability/monitoring) for more details.

### Offline Evaluations

Offline Evaluators are combined with predefined [**Datasets**](/docs/v4/datasets) in order to evaluate your application as you iterate in your prompt engineering workflow, or to test for regressions in a CI environment.

A test Dataset is a collection of **Datapoints**, which are roughly analogous to unit tests or test cases in traditional programming. Each datapoint specifies inputs to your model and (optionally) some target data.

When you run an offline evaluation, a Log needs to be generated using the inputs of each Datapoint and the version of the application being evaluated. Evaluators then need to be run against each Log to provide judgements,
which are then aggregated to provide an overall score for the application. Evaluators in this case take the generated `Log` and the `testcase` datapoint that gave rise to it as arguments.

See our guides on [creating Datasets](/docs/guides/evals/upload-dataset-csv) and [running Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) for more details.

## Humanloop runtime versus your runtime

Evaluations require the following to be generated:

1. Logs for the datapoints.
2. Evaluator results for those generated logs.

Evaluators which are defined within the Humanloop UI can be executed in the Humanloop runtime, whereas Evaluators defined in your code can be executed in your runtime and the results posted back to Humanloop.
This provides flexibility for supporting more complex evaluation workflows.

## Return types

Evaluators apply judgment to Logs. This judgment can be of the following types:

* **Boolean** - A true/false judgment.
* **Number** - A numerical judgment, which can act as a rating or score.
* **Select** - One of a predefined set of options. One option must be selected.
* **Multi-select** - Any number of a predefined set of options. None, one, or many options can be selected.
* **Text** - A free-form text judgment.

Code and AI Evaluators can return either **Boolean** or **Number** judgments.
Human Evaluators can return **Number**, **Select**, **Multi-select**, or **Text** judgments.


# Tools

> Discover how Humanloop manages tools for use with large language models (LLMs) with version control and rigorous evaluation for better performance.

<img src="file:75e24143-f618-4f37-8c9f-0eed3e3334bf" />

Tools on Humanloop are used to extend [Agents](/docs/explanation/agents) and [Prompts](/docs/explanation/prompts) with access to external data sources and enable them to take action.

## Types of Tools

### Runnable Tools

Runnable Tools can be executed by Humanloop, meaning they can form a part of an Agent's automatic execution.
Python code Tools, an example of these, are run in a [secure Python runtime](/docs/v5/reference/python-environment) and allow you to write custom code to be executed.

<Frame caption="An example Python Tool">
  <img src="file:2b1f8a15-cb5e-44ce-ad43-429f6784f911" alt="Editor for a Python Tool showing a `calculate` function and a calculation output." />
</Frame>

### Template Tools

Template Tools can be used within a Prompt's template to dynamically insert information for the model when called.
These include:

* **Snippet Tools**: Reusable text components that can be shared across multiple Prompts
* **Integration Tools**: Pre-built connectors to popular services like Google Search and Pinecone vector database

<Frame caption="An example Snippet Tool. This can be referred to within a Prompt template with `{{humanloop_context(key)}}`.">
  <img src="file:1584a453-0b88-4eea-b6cf-f01448f8fdf8" alt="Editor for a Snippet Tool showing a `humanloop_context` Tool with various key-value pairs." />
</Frame>

### Function calling Tools

Many models, such as those by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use), now support function calling.
You can provide these models with definitions of the available tools. The model then decides whether to call a tool, and which parameters to use.

On Humanloop, [JSON schema Tools](/docs/v5/guides/prompts/tool-calling-editor) record the schema definitions that are used for function calling,
allowing you to tweak and version control them.

<Frame caption="A JSON schema Tool definition for getting current weather information.">
  ```js
  {
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "Location",
          "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
        },
        "unit": {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "Unit",
          "enum": [
            "celsius",
            "fahrenheit"
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "location",
        "unit"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</Frame>

In addition to JSON schema Tools, all Runnable Tools and Prompts can be used for function calling. Humanloop will automatically generate the schema definitions
for these when they're linked to a Agent or Prompt.

<Frame caption="A Calculator Python Tool linked to an Agent. When an Agent calls this Tool, Humanloop will automatically execute it and return the result back to the Agent.">
  <img src="file:d51216f3-5667-47cc-9d46-08702d687abf" alt="Agent Editor with a Calculator Tool linked. The Tool is called by the Agent and the results are shown." />
</Frame>

## Humanloop runtime versus your runtime

Humanloop supports running Python code Tools within the Humanloop runtime. If you have Tools that you want to run in your own environment,
you can use the Humanloop API to manage versions and record Logs.

The simplest way to do this is by decorating a function with the [Tool decorator](/docs/v5/sdk/decorators/tool) in the SDK.
Running the decorated function will automatically log the inputs and output of the function
to Humanloop. If you're using the Python SDK, the `@tool` decorator will also infer a JSON schema from the function's type hints.


# Flows

> Humanloop Flows trace and evaluate complex AI workflows, from LLM agents to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By unifying all components, Flows provide the context needed to debug and iterate with confidence.

<img src="file:1af0bb6b-5082-462b-8282-2732eda87260" />

## Introduction

LLM-powered systems are multi-step processes, leveraging information sources, delegating computation to tools, or iterating with the LLM to generate the final answer.

Looking at the inputs and output of such a system is not enough to reason about its behavior. Flows address this by tracing all components of the feature, unifying Logs in a comprehensive view of the system.

## Basics

To integrate Flows in your project, add the SDK flow decorator on the entrypoint of your AI feature.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    ```python maxLines=50
    @humanloop.flow(path="QA Agent/Answer Question")
    def call_agent(question: str) -> str:
        # A simple question answering agent

        ...

        return answer
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
    ```typescript maxLines=50
    const callAgent = humanloop.flow({
        path: "QA Agent/Answer Question",
        callable: async (question: string) => {
            // A simple question answering agent

            ...

            return answer
        }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The decorator will capture the inputs and output of the agent on Humanloop.

You can then start evaluating the system's performance through [code](/docs/v5/guides/evals/run-evaluation-api) or through the [platform UI](/docs/v5/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui).

## Tracing

Additional Logs can be added to the trace to provide further insight into the system's behavior.

<Info>
  On Humanloop, a trace is the collection of Logs associated with a Flow Log.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    ```python maxLines=50 title="Question answering agent"
    @humanloop.tool(path="QA Agent/Search Wikipedia")
    def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> dict:
        """LLM function calls this to search Wikipedia."""
        ...


    @humanloop.prompt(path="QA Agent/Call Model")
    def call_model(messages: list[dict]) -> dict:
        """Interact with the LLM model."""
        ...


    @humanloop.flow(
        path="QA Agent/Answer Question",

    )
    def call_agent(question: str) -> str:
        """A simple question answering agent."""
        ...
    ```

    The agent makes multiple provider calls to refine the response to the question. It makes function calls to `search_wikipedia` to retrieve additional information from an external source.

    Calling the other functions inside `call_agent` creates Logs and adds them to the trace created by `call_agent`.

            // LLM function calls this to search Wikipedia
            ...
        }
    })

    const callModel = humanloop.prompt({
        path: "QA Agent/Call Model",
        callable: async (messages: string[]) => {
            // Interact with the LLM model
            ...

            // A simple question answering agent
            ...
        }
    })
    ```

    The agent makes multiple provider calls to refine the response to the question. It makes function calls to `searchWikipedia` to retrieve additional information from an external source.

    Calling the other functions inside `callAgent` creates Logs and adds them to the trace created by `callAgent`.

### Manual Tracing

If you don't want to use decorators, first create a Flow Log, then pass its `id` when creating Logs you want to add to the trace.

<Accordion title="Code for Manual Tracing">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python" language="python">

                      wikipedia: true
                  }
              },
              inputs: { question }
          })).id;

          const llmOutput = await humanloop.prompts.call({

          });
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Accordion>

## Versioning

Any data you pass into `attributes` will contribute to the version of the Flow. If you pass in a new value, the version will be updated.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    ```python maxLines=50 title="Question answering agent" highlight={3}
    @humanloop.flow(

    )
    def call_agent(question: str) -> str:
        """A simple question answering agent."""
        ...
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
    ```typescript maxLines=50 title="Question answering agent" highlight={3}

    const callAgent = humanloop.flow({
        path: "QA Agent/Answer Question",
        attributes: { version: "v1", wikipedia: true },
        callable: async (question: string) => {
            // A simple question answering agent
            ...
        }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Completing Flow Logs

Flow Logs can be marked as complete in order to prevent further Logs from being added to the trace. The flow decorator will mark a trace as complete when the function returns.

```python title="Monitoring Evaluator on Humanloop"
def count_logs_evaluator(log):
    """Count the number of Logs in a trace."""
    if log["children"]:
        # Use the `children` attribute to access all Logs in the trace
        return 1 + sum([count_logs_evaluator(child) for child in log["children"]])
    return 1
```

A Flow Log's metrics, such as cost, latency and tokens, are computed as Logs are added to the trace.

A Flow Log's `start_time` and `end_time` are computed automatically to span the earliest start and latest end of the Logs in its trace. If `start_time` and `end_time` already span the Logs' timestamps, they are kept as they are.

If you don't want to use the decorator, you can complete the Flow Log via the SDK directly.

<Accordion title="Code for Manual Tracing">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python" language="python">
      ```python
      humanloop.flows.update_log(
          log_id=trace_id,
          log_status="complete"
      )
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
      ```typescript
      humanloop.flows.updateLog(traceId, {
          logStatus: "complete"
      })
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Accordion>

## Evaluation

Unlike [Prompts](/docs/v5/explanation/prompts), which can be evaluated via the Humanloop UI, you must run evaluations on your Flows through code.

To do this, provide a `callable` argument to the `evaluations.run` SDK method.

Unlike other Logs, Evaluators added to Flows can access all Logs inside a trace:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    ```python maxLines=50 title="Evaluating a Flow" highlight={5}
    humanloop.evaluations.run(
        name="Comprehensiveness Evaluation",
        file={
            "path": "QA Agent/Answer Question",
            "callable": call_agent,
        },
        evaluators=[
            {"path": "QA Agent/Answer Comprehensiveness"},
        ],
        dataset={"path": "QA Agent/Simple Answers"},
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
    ```typescript maxLines=50 title="Evaluating a Flow" highlight={5}
    humanloop.evaluations.run(
        name="Comprehensiveness Evaluation",
        file={
            "path": "QA Agent/Answer Question",
            "callable": callAgent,
        },
        evaluators=[
            { "path": "QA Agent/Answer Comprehensiveness" },
        ],
        dataset={ "path": "QA Agent/Simple Answers" },
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Every time a Log is added to a Flow trace, monitoring Evaluators and Evaluations re-evaluate the Log. This behaviour is throttled, so adding
multiple Logs in quick succession will result in a single re-evaluation.

# Datasets

<img src="file:04b3243e-4874-46a2-95f8-87b654643c24" />

Datasets on Humanloop are collections of Datapoints used for evaluation and fine-tuning. You can think of a Datapoint as a test case for your AI application, which contains the following fields:

* **Inputs**: a collection of prompt variable values that replace the `{{variables}}` defined in your prompt template during generation.
* **Messages**: for chat models, you can have a history of chat messages that are appended to the prompt during generation.
* **Target**: a value that in its simplest form describes the desired output string for the given inputs and messages history. For more advanced use cases, you can define a JSON object containing whatever fields are necessary to evaluate the model's output.

## Versioning

A Dataset will have multiple Versions as you iterate on the test cases for your task. This tends to be an evolving process as you learn how your [Prompts](./prompts) behave and how users interact with your AI application in the wild.

Dataset Versions are immutable and are uniquely defined by the contents of the Datapoints. When you change, add, or remove Datapoints, this constitutes a new Version.

Each [Evaluation](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) is linked to a specific Dataset Version, ensuring that your evaluation results are always traceable to the exact set of test cases used.

## Creating a Dataset

A Dataset can be created in the following ways:

* [Upload a CSV in the UI](/docs/guides/evals/upload-dataset-csv)
* [Create a Datapoint from an existing Log](/docs/guides/evals/create-dataset-from-logs)
* [Create a Dataset via the API](/docs/guides/evals/create-dataset-api)

## Using Datasets for Evaluations

Datasets are foundational for Evaluations on Humanloop. Evaluations are run by iterating over the Datapoints in a Dataset, generating output from different versions of your AI application for each one. The Datapoints provide the specific test cases to evaluate, with each containing the input variables and optionally a target output that defines the desired behavior. When a target is specified, Evaluators can compare the generated outputs to the targets to assess how well each version performed.

# Logs

> Logs contain the inputs and output of each time a Function Files is called.

Logs in Humanloop are records of each execution of a [Function File](/docs/explanation/files#function-files) (*Prompt*, *Agent*, *Tool*, *Evaluator*, or *Flow*). They capture the complete context of the execution, including `inputs`, `output`, and metadata like which [Version](/docs/explanation/files#files-are-version-controlled) was used.

## External logging

When you are not using Humanloop to run Prompts (or other Function Files), but use your own infrastructure — for instance in a production setting — you can still collect and store the Logs on Humanloop. This enables you to collect interesting cases and lets you leverage Humanloop's monitoring and evaluation capabilities.

Monitoring Evaluators run every time a Log is patched. If the Log is part of a trace, the Evaluators re-run and the stats of the Log are updated.

  <img src="file:9f9120e0-ae06-44c2-b009-1affce1029c1" />
</Frame>


# Directories

> Directories can be used to group together related Files. This is useful for organizing your work as part of prompt engineering and collaboration.

Directories in Humanloop serve as an organizational tool, allowing users to group related [Files](/docs/explanation/files) and structure their work logically. They function similarly to folders in a traditional file system, providing a hierarchical structure for managing work.

### Paths

Every File and Directory has a unique `path` property which you can use to refer to Files or Directories. When you move a File or Directory, its path and the paths of all contained files and subdirectories will update accordingly.

<Callout>
  We recommend to always refer to Files by their `id` to avoid issues related to
  changing paths when Files or Directories are moved.
</Callout>

For more information on how to create and manage directories, see our [Create a Directory](/docs/development/guides/create-directory) guide.


# Environments

> Deployment environments enable you to control the deployment lifecycle of your Prompts and other files between development and production environments.

<img src="file:15def0ea-1dc1-4ffc-af67-e231f89ab72b" />

Environments enable you to deploy different versions of your files to specific environments, allowing you to separately manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.

### Managing your environments

Every organisation automatically receives a default production environment. You can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's [environments page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments).

<Warning>
  Only Enterprise customers can create more than one environment
</Warning>

The environments you define for your organisation will be available for each file and can be viewed in the file's dashboard once created.

![](file:dc9dac75-0a7a-4926-bb34-03f2abfb66fe)

#### The default environment

By default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls that don't explicitly target a specific environment will use this environment. You can rename the default environment on the [organisation's environments](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments) page.

<Warning>
  Renaming the environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this
  change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.
</Warning>

### Using environments

Once created on the environments page, environments can be used for each file and are visible in the respective dashboards.

You can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the **Deployments** section.

![](file:53e761ac-b158-400f-8d19-22170d71465f)

Alternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a version from either the Editor or the Versions table.

### Using environments via API

![](file:4d53fe63-43e6-41fc-a934-7e4d314869e1)

You can now call the version deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional `environment` field. An example of this field can be seen in the v5 [Prompt Call](/docs/api/prompts/call-stream#request.query.environment) documentation.


# Evaluate an Agent in the UI

> This tutorial will explain how to set up evaluations through the Humanloop UI and use them to iteratively improve your Agent.

<Callout>
  This tutorial expands on the Agent we created in the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/v5/quickstart/agent-evals-in-ui).

  If you've already completed the Quickstart, you can jump directly to the [Run second Evaluation](/docs/v5/tutorials/evaluate-agent-in-ui#run-second-evaluation) section.
  If you haven't completed the Quickstart yet, please begin with the first step below.
</Callout>

For this tutorial, we're going to evaluate **Outreach Agent**, which is designed to compose personalized outbound messages to potential customers. The Agent uses a [Tool](/docs/explanation/tools) to research information about the lead before writing a message.

We'll show how to assess the quality of the Agent and compare two Agent versions side by side.

<Accordion title="Account setup">
  <p>
    Create a Humanloop Account
  </p>

  If you haven't already, [create an account](https://app.humanloop.com/signup) or [log in](https://app.humanloop.com/login) to Humanloop

  <p>
    Add an OpenAI API Key
  </p>

  If you're the first person in your organization, you'll need to add an API key to a model provider.

  1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
  2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

  <Info>
    Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
    OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
    providers private.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Clone an Agent

<Steps>
  ### Clone Outreach Agent from Library

  In this quickstart, we will use a pre-configured Agent from the Humanloop Library.

  Navigate to the Library by clicking the Library button in the upper-left corner. Select the **Outreach Agent** and click the **Clone to Workspace** button in the upper-right corner.

  <Frame background="subtle">
    <img src="file:64a1e96b-2cef-4e4b-82e0-39aa44c7944a" />
  </Frame>

  This will create an **Outreach Agent** folder in your workspace. Inside the folder, you'll find:

  * The **Outreach Agent**.
  * **Hacker News Search** Tool used by the Agent to research potential customers.
  * A **Customer Outreach** Dataset and three **Evaluators** that we will use to assess the Agent.

  ### Try out the Agent

  The **Outreach Agent** looks up information about the lead on Hacker News and composes an outbound message to them.

  Before we kick off the first evaluation, run the Agent in the Editor to get a feel for how it works:

  1. Click on the **Outreach Agent** file.
  2. On the left-hand side, you can configure your Agent's Parameters, Instructions, and add Tools.
  3. On the right-hand side, you can specify Inputs and run the Agent on demand.
  4. Enter *Coca-Cola* as the organization and *Humanloop* as the lead in the Inputs section in the top right-hand side.
  5. Click the Run button.

  <Frame caption="The Agent used the Hacker News Tool to get more information about Humanloop before composing a personal outbound message." background="subtle">
    <img src="file:37ce592a-f0e9-4bd0-a7a8-14878c56e4dd" />
  </Frame>

  ### Run Eval

  Evaluations are an efficient way to improve your Agent iteratively. You can test versions of the Agent against a [Dataset](https://humanloop.com/docs/evaluation/guides/create-dataset) and see how changing the Agent's configuration impacts the performance.

  To test the **Outreach Agent**, navigate to the **Evals** tab and click on the **+ Evaluation** button.

  Create a new Run by clicking on the **+ Run** button. Then, follow these steps:

  1. Click on the **Dataset** button and select **Customer Outreach** Dateset.
  2. Click on the **Agent** button and select the "v1" version.
  3. Click on **Evaluators** and add the three Evaluators included in the Output Agent folder: **Friendly Tone**, **Tool Call** and **Message Length**

  The first two Evaluators will check if the message is friendly and if the Tool was used.
  The **Message Length** Evaluator will show the number of words in the output, providing a baseline value for all further evaluations.

  Click **Save**. Humanloop will start generating Logs for the Evaluation.

  <Frame caption="For each test case in the Dataset, Humanloop runs the Agent, which produces Logs that are evaluated using the selected Evaluators.">
    <img src="file:f51e2e1a-38c0-42a7-bd22-733442e6b623" />
  </Frame>

  ### Review results

  After the Run is completed, you can review the Logs produced and corresponding judgments in the **Review** tab.

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:ac7a22a0-068d-4546-bea6-c4b5d81e9b2a" />
  </Frame>

  The summary of all Evaluators is displayed in the **Stats** tab.

    <img src="file:e04c14e9-858e-455c-94b9-37ff538821eb" />
  </Frame>
</Steps>

## Run second Evaluation

<Steps>
  ### Iterate on the Agent

  HackerNews is a limited resource because it lacks background information about potential customers and does not include all recent news articles related to them.

  To enhance the search phase, connect Google Search Tool that enables our Agent to traverse through more sophisticated Google search results.

  Additionally, add a dedicated Write Personalized Message Prompt that is solely responsible for writing outbound messages. This approach allows for separate iteration on the writing block and the use of different LLM parameters specifically for the writing step.

  ### Clone new Tools

  Navigate back to **Library** and clone the **Google Search** Tool and the **Write Personalized Message** Prompt.

  <Frame background="subtle">
    <img src="file:44fb8bb1-dcef-4927-a230-52912f5fe0e1" />
  </Frame>

  ### Setup Google Search tool

  <Callout>
    To use the Google Search tool, you need to obtain an API key from the third-party Serper. Connecting the Agent to a
    third party makes the Agent much more powerful. Serper offers a free API tier that you can use for this tutorial - to
    obtain an API key, sign up at [https://serper.dev/](https://serper.dev/)
  </Callout>

  Click on Google Search file inside Outreach Agent folder

  Add the API key:

  1. Open the **Google Search** Tool in your workspace.
  2. Click the **Environment Variables** button in the upper-right corner.
  3. In the **Name** field, enter: `SERPER_API_KEY`
  4. In the **Value** field, paste your API key.

  <Frame background="subtle">
    <img src="file:a1f35636-278a-4230-b1e2-4ba6db7765dc" />
  </Frame>

  ### Add Tools to the Agent

  Click on Outreach Agent File, then click on **+ Tools** button on left bottom corner and choose **Google Search** Tool and **Write Personalized Message** Prompt from the list. Remove HackerNews Search Tool as it's no longer needed.

  <Frame background="subtle">
    <img src="file:ea6944b4-fb24-4f6b-8f40-fd7ae1c084bd" />
  </Frame>

  Save the Agent and name it "v2".

  ### Run another Evaluation

  We can now create a new Run with the new Agent version. Click on the **+ Run** button and select the newly created Agent version.

  <Frame caption="Run page with two runs. Runs allow you to compare different versions of your Agent.">
    <img src="file:60eee8cd-046d-486c-bd1b-a37eba0aae5b" />
  </Frame>

  Navigate to the **Stats** tab to see how the two versions compare to each other.

  <Frame caption="Stats tab">
    <img src="file:61355bfd-7b65-43b1-a7f7-cd1d24fb1b8a" />
  </Frame>

  To see the two versions side by side, click on the **Review** tab.

  <Frame caption="Review tab">
    <img src="file:32fd84ce-0e5d-4dcc-8ff1-4dfb1739064c" />
  </Frame>

  The second version of the Agent we evaluated used the Google Search Tool to extract more relevant information. It also searched for background information on each lead, something the initial version of the Agent lacked.

  Adding a new Tools to the Agent resulted in a more personalized message and improved outreach.
</Steps>

In this tutorial, you've created an Agent that can help your organization compose personalized messages for your prospects. You've evaluated the initial version, made changes to the Agent, and compared the newly created version with the initial one.

## Next steps

Now that you've successfully run your first Eval, you can explore customizing it for your use case:

* Learn how your subject-matter experts (such as your sales team) can [review and evaluate model outputs](/docs/evaluation/guides/manage-multiple-reviewers) in Humanloop to help improve your AI product.
* Explore how you can set up [Human Evaluators](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators) to get human feedback on your Agent outputs.


# Evaluate an Agent in code

## Add Humanloop to the agent

Humanloop offers first-class support for agentic systems, plus the ability to effortlessly switch between providers.

## Evaluate the agent

<Accordion title="How Evaluators work">
  Evaluators are callables that take the Log's dictionary representation as input and return a judgment. The Evaluator's judgment should respect the `return_type` present in the Evaluator's [specification](/docs/v5/api/evaluators/upsert#request.body.spec).

  The Evaluator can take an additional `target` argument to compare the Log against. The target is provided in an Evaluation context by the validation [Dataset](/docs/v5/explanation/datasets).

  For more details, check out our [Evaluator explanation](/docs/v5/explanation/evaluators).
</Accordion>

Let's check if the agent respects the requirement of providing easy-to-understand answers.

We will create an [Evaluation](/docs/v5/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to benchmark the performance of the agent. An Evaluation requires a [Dataset](/docs/v5/guides/explanations/datasets) and at least one [Evaluator](/docs/v5/guides/explanations/evaluators).

<Steps>
  ### Create LLM judge

  We will use an LLM judge to automatically evaluate the agent's responses.

  We will define the Evaluator in code, but you can also [manage Evaluators in the UI](/docs/v5/guides/evals/llm-as-a-judge).

  Replace your `main` function with the following:

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```python title="main.py" maxLines=50
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        humanloop.evaluators.upsert(
            path="QA Agent/Comprehension",
            spec={
                "arguments_type": "target_free",
                "return_type": "number",
                "evaluator_type": "llm",
                "prompt": {
                    "model": "gpt-4o",
                    "endpoint": "complete",
                    "template": (
                        "You must decide if an explanation is simple "
                        "enough to be understood by a 5-year old. "
                        "A better explanation is shorter and uses less jargon. "
                        "Rate the answer from 1 to 10, where 10 is the best.\n"
                        "\n<Question>\n{{log.inputs.question}}\n</Question>\n\n"
                        "\n<Answer>\n{{log.output}}</Answer>\n\n"
                        "First provide your rationale, then on a newline, "
                        "output your judgment."
                    ),
                    "provider": "openai",
                    "temperature": 0,
                },
            },
        )
    ```

        },
      });
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>

Change of [4.80] for Evaluator QA Agent/Comprehension
```

Click the Evaluation link again. The agent's performance has improved significantly.

## Add detailed logging

<Info>
  If you use a programming language not supported by the SDK, or want more control, see our guide on 

  [logging through the API](/docs/v5/guides/observability/logging-through-api)

   for an alternative to decorators.
</Info>

Up to this point, we have treated the agent as a black box, reasoning about its behavior by looking at the inputs and outputs.

Let's use Humanloop logging to observe the step-by-step actions taken by the agent.

                name: "Search Wikipedia",
                description: "Search Wikipedia for the best article to answer a question",
                strict: true,
                parameters: {
                    type: "object",
                    properties: {
                        query: {
                            type: "string",
                            description: "The question to search Wikipedia for",
                        },
                    },
                    required: ["query"],
                },
            },
        },
        // Wraps the initial function body
        callable: async ({ query }) => { ... },
    });

    const callModel = humanloop.prompt({
        path: "QA Agent/Prompt",
        // Wraps the initial function body
        callable: async ({ messages }) => { ... },
    });

    const callAgent = humanloop.flow({
        path: "QA Agent/Agent",
        // Wraps the initial function body
        callable: async ({ question }) => { ... },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Evaluate the agent again. When it's done, head to your workspace and click the **Agent** [Flow](/docs/v5/guides/explanations/flows) on the left. Select the Logs tab from the top of the page.

<Frame caption="The trace captures the agent searching for the best article to answer a question.">
  <img src="file:6ab09b79-fb95-47fa-86ca-2784a51e23fd" />
</Frame>

The decorators divide the code in logical components, allowing you to observe the steps taken to answer a question. Every step taken by the agent creates a Log.

## Next steps

We've built a complex agentic workflow and learned how to use Humanloop to add logging to it and evaluate its performance.

Take a look at these resources to learn more about evals on Humanloop:

* Learn how to [create a custom dataset](/docs/v5/guides/evals/create-dataset) for your project.

* Learn more about using [LLM Evaluators](/docs/v5/guides/evals/llm-as-a-judge) on Humanloop.


# Evaluate a RAG app

> Evaluate a RAG application with Humanloop.

This tutorial demonstrates how to take an existing RAG pipeline and use Humanloop to evaluate it. At the end of the tutorial you'll understand how to:

1. Run an Eval on your RAG pipeline.
2. Set up detailed logging with SDK decorators.
3. Log to Humanloop manually

The full code for this tutorial is available in the [Humanloop Cookbook](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/rag/evaluate-rag-flow.ipynb).

## Example RAG Pipeline

In this tutorial we'll first implement a simple RAG pipeline to do Q\&A over medical documents without Humanloop. Then we'll add Humanloop and use it for evals. Our RAG system will have three parts:

* **Dataset**: A version of the [MedQA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigbio/med_qa) from Hugging Face.
* **Retriever**: [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started) as a simple local vector DB.
* **Prompt**: Managed in code, populated with the user's question and retrieved context.

## Set up RAG pipeline

```bash
poetry install
```

Set up environment variables:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from chromadb import chromadb
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd

load_dotenv()

chroma = chromadb.Client()
openai = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY"))
```

Set up the Vector DB:

```python
collection = chroma.get_or_create_collection(name="MedQA")

knowledge_base = pd.read_parquet("../../assets/sources/textbooks.parquet")
knowledge_base = knowledge_base.sample(10, random_state=42)

collection.add(
    documents=knowledge_base["contents"].to_list(),
    ids=knowledge_base["id"].to_list(),
)
```

Define the Prompt:

```python
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
temperature = 0
template = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": """Answer the following question factually.

Question: {{question}}

Options:
- {{option_A}}
- {{option_B}}
- {{option_C}}
- {{option_D}}
- {{option_E}}

---

Here is some retrieved information that might be helpful.
Retrieved data:
{{retrieved_data}}

---
Give you answer in 3 sections using the following format. Do not include the quotes or the brackets. Do include the "---" separators.

<chosen option verbatim>
---
<clear explanation of why the option is correct and why the other options are incorrect. keep it ELI5.>
---
<quote relevant information snippets from the retrieved data verbatim. every line here should be directly copied from the retrieved data>
""",
    }
]

def populate_template(template: list, inputs: dict[str, str]) -> list:
    """Populate a template with input variables."""
    messages = []
    for i, template_message in enumerate(template):
        content = template_message["content"]
        for key, value in inputs.items():
            content = content.replace("{{" + key + "}}", value)
        message = {**template_message, "content": content}
        messages.append(message)
    return messages
```

Define the RAG Pipeline:

```python
def retrieval_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Retrieve most relevant document from the vector db (Chroma) for the question."""
    response = collection.query(query_texts=[question], n_results=1)
    retrieved_doc = response["documents"][0][0]
    return retrieved_doc

def call_llm(**inputs):
    # Populate the Prompt template
    messages = populate_template(template, inputs)
    
    # Call OpenAI to get response
    chat_completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        temperature=temperature,
        messages=messages,
    )
    return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

def ask_question(**inputs)-> str:
    """Ask a question and get an answer using a simple RAG pipeline"""
    
    # Retrieve context
    retrieved_data = retrieval_tool(inputs["question"])
    inputs = {**inputs, "retrieved_data": retrieved_data}

    # Call LLM
    return call_llm(**inputs)
```

Run the pipeline:

```python
output = ask_question(
    **{
        "question": "A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?",
        "option_A": "0%",
        "option_B": "25%",
        "option_C": "50%",
        "option_D": "75%",
        "option_E": "100%",
    }
)
print(output)
```

## Run an Evaluation

Now we will integrate Humanloop into our RAG pipeline to evaluate it. We will use the Humanloop SDK to run an Eval on our RAG pipeline.

Initialize the Humanloop SDK:

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

load_dotenv()
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key=os.getenv("HUMANLOOP_KEY"))
```

### Set up Evaluators

Our Dataset has ground truth answers we can compare against. It's very unlikely that the AI answers are *exactly* the same as the answers but we can measure how close they are by using the "Levenshtein distance" Evaluator.
The code for this Evaluator is in the cookbook. We can run the Evaluator locally. However, if we upload it to Humanloop, we get the added benefit that Humanloop can run the Evalaution for us and this can be integrated into CI/CD.

```python
def upload_evaluators():
    """Uploads Evaluators to Humanloop.
    
    Uploads the "Exact match", "Levenshtein", and "Reasoning" Evaluators.
    The "Exact match" and "Levenshtein" Evaluators are slight modifications to the examples
    automatically created in the "Example Evaluators" folder in Humanloop when you signed up,
    with some additional parsing for the output of this RAG pipeline.
    """
    # Upload Code Evaluators
    for evaluator_name, file_name, return_type in [
        ("Exact match", "exact_match.py", "boolean"),
        ("Levenshtein", "levenshtein.py", "number"),
    ]:
        with open(f"../../assets/evaluators/{file_name}", "r") as f:
            code = f.read()
        humanloop.evaluators.upsert(
            path=f"Evals demo/{evaluator_name}",
            spec={
                "evaluator_type": "python",
                "arguments_type": "target_required",
                "return_type": return_type,
                "code": code,
            },
            version_name="Initial version"
            version_description=f"New version from {file_name}",
        )

    # Upload an LLM Evaluator
    humanloop.evaluators.upsert(
        path="Evals demo/Reasoning",
        spec={
            "evaluator_type": "llm",
            "arguments_type": "target_free",
            "return_type": "boolean",
            "prompt": {
                "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
                "endpoint": "complete",
                "temperature": 0,
                "template": "An answer is shown below. The answer contains 3 sections, separated by \"---\". The first section is the final answer. The second section is an explanation. The third section is a citation.\n\nEvaluate if the final answer follows from the citation and the reasoning in the explanation section. Give a brief explanation/discussion. Do not make your judgment based on factuality, but purely based on the logic presented.\nOn a new line, give a final verdict of \"True\" or \"False\".\n\nAnswer:\n{{log.output}}",
            },
        },
        version_name="Initial version",
        version_description="Initial reasoning evaluator.",
    )

upload_evaluators()
```

### Create a Dataset

We upload a test dataset to Humanloop:

```python
def upload_dataset_to_humanloop():
    df = pd.read_json("../../assets/datapoints.jsonl", lines=True)

    datapoints = [row.to_dict() for _i, row in df.iterrows()][0:20]
    return humanloop.datasets.upsert(
        path="Evals demo/MedQA test",
        datapoints=datapoints,
        version_description=f"Added {len(datapoints)} datapoints from MedQA test dataset.",
    )

dataset = upload_dataset_to_humanloop()
```

### Run Eval

Now that we have our Flow, our Dataset and our Evaluators we can create and run an Evaluation.

```python
checks = humanloop.evaluations.run(
    name="Demo cookbook",
    file={
        "path": "Evals demo/MedQA pipeline",
        "callable": ask_question,
    },
    dataset={
        "path": "Evals demo/MedQA test",
    },
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Evals demo/Exact match"},
        {"path": "Evals demo/Levenshtein"},
        {"path": "Evals demo/Reasoning"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"},
    ],
)
```

## Add detailed logging

One limitation of our Evaluation so far is that we've measured the app end-to-end but we don't know how the different components contribute to performance.
If we really want to improve our app, we'll need to log the full trace of events, including separate Tool and Prompt steps:

We can do this by adding logging for the Prompt and Tool steps within the Flow using Humanloop's Python decorators. If you're using a different language, you can still log to Humanloop via the API. Skip to the "Logging with the API" section below or check out our [guide](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/guides/observability/logging-through-api) for more details.

```python
@humanloop.tool(path="Evals demo/Retrieval tool")
def retrieval_tool(question: str) -> str:
    return retrieval_tool(question)

@humanloop.prompt(path="Evals demo/LLM call")
def call_llm(**inputs):
    return call_llm(**inputs)

@humanloop.flow(path="Evals demo/MedQA pipeline")
def ask_question(**inputs):
    retrieved_data = retrieval_tool(inputs["question"])
    inputs = {**inputs, "retrieved_data": retrieved_data}
    return call_llm(**inputs)
```

You can now run the pipeline as before and the full trace will be logged to Humanloop.

```python
output = ask_question(
    **{
        "question": "A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?",
        "option_A": "0%",
        "option_B": "25%",
        "option_C": "50%",
        "option_D": "75%",
        "option_E": "100%",
    }
)
print(output)
```

## Re-run the Evaluation

These decorated functions can similarly be used to run an Eval on the pipeline. This will allow you to evaluate the pipeline and see the detailed logs for each step in the pipeline.

Let's change from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-4o` and re-run the Eval.

By passing in the same `name` to `humanloop.evaluations.run(...)` call, we'll add another run to the previously-created Evaluation on Humanloop. This will allow us to compare the two Runs side-by-side.

```python
model = "gpt-4o"

checks = humanloop.evaluations.run(
    name="RAG guide",
    file={
        "path": "Evals demo/MedQA pipeline",
        "callable": ask_question_decorated,
        "type": "flow",
    },
    dataset={
        "path": "Evals demo/MedQA test",
        "datapoints": datapoints,
    },
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Evals demo/Exact match"},
        {"path": "Evals demo/Levenshtein"},
        {"path": "Evals demo/Reasoning"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"},
    ],
)

```

Viewing our Evaluation on Humanloop, we can see that our newly-added Run with `gpt-4o` has been added to the Evaluation.
On the **Stats** tab, we can see that `gpt-4o` scores better for our "Exact match" (and "Levenshtein") metrics, but has higher latency.

![Eval runs](file:b196c4d6-e922-460d-836c-eed939e0cc1a)

Perhaps surprisingly, `gpt-4o` performs worse according to our "Reasoning" Evaluator.

## Logging with the API

Above, we've let the SDK handle logging and versioning for us. However, you can also log data to Humanloop using the API directly. This can be useful if you want to perform some post-processing on the data before logging it, or if you want to include additional metadata in the logs or versions.

We'll now demonstrate how to extend your Humanloop logging with more fidelity; creating Tool, Prompt, and Flow Logs to give you full visibility.

We add additional logging steps to our `ask_question` function to represent the full trace of events on Humanloop.

(Note that the `run_id` and `source_datapoint_id` arguments are optional, and are included here for use in the Evaluation workflow demonstrated later.)

```python
from datetime import datetime
import inspect

def ask_question_with_logging(run_id: str | None = None, source_datapoint_id: str | None = None, **inputs)-> str:
    """Ask a question and get an answer using a simple RAG pipeline."""

    trace = humanloop.flows.log(
        path="evals_demo/medqa-flow",
        flow={
            "attributes": {
                "prompt": {
                    "template": template,
                    "model": model,
                    "temperature": temperature,
                },
                "tool": {
                    "name": "retrieval_tool_v3",
                    "description": "Retrieval tool for MedQA.",
                    "source_code": inspect.getsource(retrieval_tool),
                },
            }
        },
        inputs=inputs,
        start_time=datetime.now(),
        run_id=run_id,
        source_datapoint_id=source_datapoint_id,
    )

    # Retrieve context
    start_time=datetime.now()
    retrieved_data = retrieval_tool(inputs["question"])
    inputs = {**inputs, "retrieved_data": retrieved_data}

    # Log the retriever information to Humanloop separately
    humanloop.tools.log(
        path="Evals demo/Retrieval tool",
        tool={
            "function": {
                "name": "retrieval_tool",
                "description": "Retrieval tool for MedQA.",
            },
            "source_code": inspect.getsource(retrieval_tool),
        },
        output=retrieved_data,
        trace_parent_id=trace.id,
        start_time=start_time,
        end_time=datetime.now()
    )
    
    # Populate the Prompt template
    start_time=datetime.now()
    messages = populate_template(template, inputs)
    
    # Call OpenAI to get response
    chat_completion= openai.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        temperature=temperature,
        messages=messages,
    )
    output = chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

    # Log the prompt information to Humanloop separately
    humanloop.prompts.log(
        path="evals_demo/medqa-answer",
        prompt={
            "model": model,
            "temperature": temperature,
            "template": template,
        },
        inputs=inputs,
        output=output,
        output_message=chat_completion.choices[0].message,
        trace_parent_id=trace.id,
        start_time=start_time,
        end_time=datetime.now()
    )

    # Close the trace
    humanloop.flows.update_log(
        log_id=trace.id,
        output=output,
        trace_status="complete",
    )
    
    return output
```

The logging we've added here is similar to the SDK decorators we used earlier.

## Run an Evaluation using the API

To orchestrate your own Evaluations, you can pass in `run_id` and `source_datapoint_id` to the `humanloop.flows.log(...)` call to associate Logs with a specific Run and Datapoint.

The following is an example of how you can manually create an Evaluation and Run, and log data to Humanloop using the API,
giving you full control over the Evaluation process.

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

# Create Evaluation
evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    name="Manual logging demo",
    file={"path": "Evals demo/MedQA pipeline"},
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Evals demo/Exact match"},
        {"path": "Evals demo/Levenshtein"},
        {"path": "Evals demo/Reasoning"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"},
    ],
)

# Create Run
run = humanloop.evaluations.create_run(id=evaluation.id, dataset={"path": "Evals demo/MedQA test"})

# Run the pipeline over the Dataset
for datapoint in tqdm(datapoints):
    ask_question_with_logging(run_id=run.id, source_datapoint_id=datapoint.id, **datapoint.inputs)

```

You can then similarly view results on the Humanloop UI.

![Eval Logs table](file:e74b53f1-bce0-4db1-8277-6a74ec0a69f8)

This concludes the Humanloop RAG Evaluation walkthrough.
You've learned how to integrate Humanloop into your RAG pipeline, set up logging, create Datasets, configure Evaluators, run Evaluations, and log the full trace of events including Tool and Prompt steps.


# Capture user feedback

> Collect feedback from your users to improve your AI product.

In this tutorial, we'll show how you can gather valuable insights from your users to evaluate and improve your AI product.

We'll deploy a simple chat app that allows users to interact with an AI model. Later, we'll modify the source code to capture user feedback and show how these insights are used to improve the AI product.

### Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account setup">
    <p>
      Create a Humanloop Account
    </p>

    If you haven't already, [create an account](https://app.humanloop.com/signup) or [log in](https://app.humanloop.com/login) to Humanloop

    <p>
      Add an OpenAI API Key
    </p>

    If you're the first person in your organization, you'll need to add an API key to a model provider.

    1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

    <Info>
      Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
      OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
      providers private.

</AccordionGroup>

## Capture user feedback

You can grab the source code used in this tutorial here: [hl-chatgpt-clone-typescript](https://github.com/humanloop/hl-chatgpt-clone-typescript)

<Steps>
  ### Clone and start a chat app server

  ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/humanloop/hl-chatgpt-clone-typescript
      # add Humanloop API key
      touch .env.local
      echo HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY >> .env.local
      # optionally add OpenAI key, if you haven't already in Humanloop app
      echo OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY >> .env.local
      # run the app
      bun install
      bun run dev
  ```

  ### Use the chat app

  Open the chat app in your browser and start chatting with the AI model.

  <img src="file:08aaa6a3-cf7e-467b-a393-04b505471587" alt="Chat Agent" />

  Every time the user presses the Send button, Humanloop receives the request and calls the AI model. The response from the model is then stored as a Log.

  Let's check the `api/chat/route.ts` file to see how it works.

  * The `path` parameter is the path to the Prompt in the Humanloop workspace. If the Prompt doesn't exist, it will be created.
  * The `prompt` parameter is the configuration of the Prompt. In this case we manage our Prompt in code; if the configuration of the Prompt changes, a new version of the Prompt will automatically be created on Humanloop. Prompts can alternatively be managed [directly on Humanloop](/docs/development/guides/call-prompt).
  * The `messages` parameter is the list of all messages exchanged between the Model and the User.

  To learn more about calling Prompts with the Humanloop SDK, see the [Prompt Call](/v5/api-reference/prompts/call-stream) API reference.

  ```typescript api/chat/route.ts
  const response = await humanloop.prompts.callStream({
      // if Prompt doesn't exist, it will be created
      path: "chatgpt-clone-tutorial/customer-support-agent",
      prompt: {
        model: "gpt-4",
        template: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
          },
        ],
      },
      // messages is a list of objects: [{role: string, content: string}, ...].
      // Role is either "user", "assistant", "system", or "tool".
      messages,
      providerApiKeys: {
        // OpenAI API key, if you haven't already set it in Humanloop app
        openai: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      },
    });

  ```

  ### Review the logs in Humanloop

  After chatting with the AI model, go to the Humanloop app and review the logs.
  Click on the `chatgpt-clone-tutorial/customer-support-agent` Prompt, then click on the Logs tab at the top of the page.

  You see that all the interactions with the AI model are logged here.

  ### Modify the code to capture user feedback

  Now, let's modify the code to start getting user feedback!
  Go back to the code editor and uncomment lines 174-193 in the `page.tsx` file.

  This snippet will add 👍 and 👎 buttons, that users can press to give feedback on the model's responses.

  ```typescript {13-31}
    return (
      <div className="flex w-full pb-4 mb-4 border-b border-gray-300">
        <div className="min-w-[80px] uppercase text-xs text-gray-500 leading-tight pt-1">
          {message.role}
        </div>
        {message.content ? (
          <div className="flex w-full pl-4 whitespace-pre-line">
            {message.content as string}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex w-full pl-4 whitespace-pre-line">...</div>
        )}
        {logId && (
          <div className="debug flex justify-end gap-4 max-h-8">
            <button
              className="px-3 font-medium text-gray-500 uppercase border border-gray-300 rounded dark:border-gray-100 dark:text-gray-200 hover:border-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500"
              onClick={() => {
                captureUserFeedback(logId, "good");
              }}
            >
              👍
            </button>
            <button
              className="px-3 font-medium text-gray-500 uppercase border border-gray-300 rounded dark:border-gray-100 dark:text-gray-200 hover:border-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500"
              onClick={() => {
                captureUserFeedback(logId, "bad");
              }}
            >
              👎
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    );

  ```

  To understand how the feedback is captured and sent to Humanloop, let's check the `api/feedback/route.ts` file.

  We use [Humanloop TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop) to make calls to Humanloop.
  To attach user feedback, we only need three parameters:

  * `parentId` is the Id of the [Log](/docs/explanation/logs) to which we want to attach feedback. The `page.txs` file stores all log Ids for model responses.
  * `path` is the path to the Evaluator. In this example, we're using an example 'rating' Evaluator.
  * `judgment` is the user feedback.

  ```typescript api/feedback/route.ts

  const response = await humanloop.evaluators.log({
      // Pass the `logId` of the Prompt Log to record feedback against.
      parentId: logId,
      // Here, we're recording feedback against an example "rating" Evaluator,
      // which is of type `select` and has two possible options: "good" and "bad."
      path: "Example Evaluators/Human/rating",
      // Alternatively, we advise to specify Evaluator by id. This is more robust and less error-prone.
      // versionId: "ev_9WiSw2VYWjAb22duuQ";
      judgment: judgment, //user feedback
    });



  ```

  ### Capture user feedback

  Refresh the page in your browser and give 👍 or 👎 to the model's responses.

  <img src="file:5c94b73e-e417-4b47-a36a-d9c3bf18dbe9" alt="Chat Agent" />

  <Accordion title="Which kinds of feedback should I set up for my AI product?">
    In the tutorial, we used the 'rating' Evaluator to capture user feedback.
    However, different use cases and user interfaces may require various types of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end-user interactions.

    There are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:

    1. **Explicit feedback**: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.
    2. **Implicit feedback**: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).
    3. **Free-form feedback**: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.

    You should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.
    For example, a Human Evaluator with return type "text" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type "multi\_select" can be used to capture user actions
    that provide implicit feedback.

    If you have not done so, you can follow our guide to [create a Human Evaluator](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluator) to set up the appropriate feedback schema.
  </Accordion>

  ### Review the logs in Humanloop

  With the user feedback captured, go back to the Humanloop app and review the logs. On the Performance tab, you can see all Evaluators and their values.

  The user feedback is captured in the rating Evaluator ('good' for 👍 and 'bad' for 👎).

  <img src="file:93b6de21-9384-40f7-b560-4738bc30287a" alt="Chat Agent" />
</Steps>

## Use the logs to improve your AI product

After you collect enough data, you can leverage the user feedback to improve your AI product.

Navigate back to the Logs view and filter all Logs that have a 'bad' rating to review the model's responses that need improvement.

<Frame caption="Logs with filter applied">
  <img src="file:3dbb4588-5cf4-436e-af79-1b2acf363cbf" alt="Run Evals with Dataset on Humanloop." />
</Frame>

Click on Log and then on **Editor ->** button in the top right corner to open the Prompt Editor. In the Prompt Editor, you can make changes to the instructions and the model's parameters to improve the model's performance.

Once you're happy with the changes, deploy the new version of the Prompt.

<Frame caption="Prompt Editor">
  <img src="file:6e8c9289-74b8-4c27-b08f-90b4d1fc399e" alt="Run Evals with Dataset on Humanloop." />
</Frame>

When users start interacting with the new version, compare the "good" to "bad" ratio to see if the changes have improved your users' experience.

## Next steps

Now that you've successfully captured user feedback, you can explore more ways to improve your AI product:

* If you found that your Prompt doesn't perform well, see our guide on [Comparing and Debugging Prompts](/docs/evaluation/guides/comparing-prompt-editor).
* Leverage [Code](/docs/evaluation/guides/code-based-evaluator), [AI](/docs/evaluation/guides/llm-as-a-judge) and [Human](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators) Evaluators to continuously monitor and improve your AI product.

# Run an Evaluation via the UI

> How to use Humanloop to evaluate multiple different Prompts across a Dataset.

An **Evaluation** on Humanloop leverages a [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets), a set of [Evaluators](/docs/explanation/evaluators) and different versions of a [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) to compare.

The Dataset contains datapoints describing the inputs (and optionally the expected results) for a given task. The Evaluators define the criteria for judging the performance of the Prompts when executed using these inputs.

[comment]: <> "The above should be in Explanation section but we haven't move it there"

Prompts, when evaluated, produce [Logs](/docs/explanation/logs). These Logs are then judged by the Evaluators. You can see the summary of Evaluators judgments to systematically compare the performance of the different Prompt versions.

### Prerequisites

* A set of [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) versions you want to compare - see the guide on [creating Prompts](/docs/guides/prompts/create-prompt).
* A [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets) containing datapoints for the task - see the guide on [creating a Dataset](/docs/evaluation/guides/upload-dataset-csv).
* At least one [Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators) to judge the performance of the Prompts - see the guides on creating [Code](/docs/evaluation/guides/code-based-evaluator), [AI](/docs/evaluation/guides/llm-as-a-judge) and [Human](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators) Evaluators.

## Run an Evaluation via UI

For this example, we're going to evaluate the performance of a Support Agent that responds to user queries about Humanloop's product and documentation.
Our goal is to understand which base model between `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` and `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` is most appropriate for this task.

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the Evaluations tab of your Prompt

  * Go to the Prompt you want to evaluate and then click on **Evaluations** tab at the top of the page.
  * Click the **Evaluate** button top right to create a new Evaluation.
  * Click the **+Run** button top right to create a new Evaluation Run.

  <img src="file:4b55dfc8-7eba-482b-975c-bbebce216cfd" alt="Prompt Evaluations Run tab." />

  ### Set up an Evaluation Run

  * Select a Dataset using **+Dataset**.
  * Add the Prompt versions you want to compare using **+Prompt**.
  * Add the Evaluators you want to use to judge the performance of the Prompts using **+Evaluator**.

  <Info title={"Log Caching"}>
    By default the system will re-use Logs if they exist for the chosen Dataset, Prompts and Evaluators. This makes it easy to extend Evaluation Run without paying the cost of re-running your Prompts and Evaluators.

    If you want to force the system to re-run the Prompts against the Dataset producing a new batch of Logs, you can click on regenerate button next to the Logs count
  </Info>

  * Click **Save**. Humanloop will start generating Logs for the Evaluation.

  <img src="file:9d31c03b-35a9-4fc4-a35f-edc2646ee2bf" alt="In progress Evaluation run" />

  <Tip title={"Using your Runtime"}>
    This guide assumes both the Prompt and Evaluator Logs are generated using the
    Humanloop runtime. For certain use cases where more flexibility is required,
    the runtime for producing Logs instead lives in your code - see our guide on
    [Logging](/docs/v5/guides/observability/logging-through-api), which also works with our
    Evaluations feature. We have a guide for how to run Evaluations with Logs
    generated in your code coming soon!
  </Tip>

  ### Review the results

  Once the Logs are produced, you can review the performance of the different Prompt versions by navigating to the **Stats** tab.

  * The top spider plot provides you with a summary of the average Evaluator performance across all the Prompt versions.
    In our case, `gpt-4o`, although on average slightly slower and more expensive on average, is significantly better when it comes to **User Satisfaction**.

  <img src="file:30ba838d-9c5c-436a-a010-c75a08d42f83" alt="Evaluation Spider plot" />

  * Below the spider plot, you can see the breakdown of performance per Evaluator.

  <img src="file:aed98aba-f48b-40ea-9aea-14f5c074619d" alt="Evaluation Evaluator stats breakdown" />

  * To drill into and debug the Logs that were generated, navigate to the **Review** tab at top left of the Run page.
    The Review view allows you to better understand performance and replay logs in our Prompt Editor.

  <img src="file:77262418-1295-4a53-806d-5543595fa297" alt="Drill down to Evaluatoin Logs." />
</Steps>

### Next Steps

* Incorporate this Evaluation process into your Prompt engineering and deployment workflow.
* Setup Evaluations where the runtime for producing Logs lives in your code - see our guide on [Logging](/docs/development/guides/log-to-a-prompt).
* Utilise Evaluations as part of your [CI/CD pipeline](/docs/evaluation/guides/cicd-integration)

Our goal is to understand which base model between `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` and `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` is most appropriate for this task.

<Steps>
  ### Create a Prompt

  Create a Support Agent Prompt with three versions each using a different base model.

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop

    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

    system_message = "You are a helpful assistant. Your job is to respond to FAQ style queries about the Humanloop documentation and platform. Be polite and succinct."

        version_name="claude-3-5-sonnet",
        version_description="FAQ style support agent using Claude 3.5 Sonnet",
    )

    # store prompt versions for later use
    prompt_versions = [gpt_4o.version_id, gpt_4o_mini.version_id, sonnet.version_id]
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient } from "humanloop";
    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "HUMANLOOP_API_KEY" });
    const systemMessage = "You are a helpful assistant. Your job is to respond to FAQ style queries about the Humanloop documentation and platform. Be polite and succinct.";

    const gpt_4o = await humanloop.prompts.upsert({

        ],
        provider: "openai",
        version_name: "gpt-4o-mini",
        version_description: "FAQ style support agent using gpt-4o-mini"
    })

    const sonnet = await humanloop.prompts.upsert({
        path: "Run Evaluation via API/Support Agent",
        model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        endpoint: "chat",
        template: [

    })

    // store prompt versions for later use
    const promptVersions = [gpt_4o.versionId, gpt_4o_mini.versionId, sonnet.versionId]

    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  ### Create a Dataset

  We defined sample data that contains user messages and desired responses for the Support Agent Prompt. We will now create a Dataset with these datapoints.

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python

    humanloop.datasets.upsert(
        path="Run Evaluation via API/Dataset with user questions",
        datapoints=[
            {
                "messages": [{
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "How do I manage my organization's API keys?",
                }],
                "target": {"answer": "Hey, thanks for your questions. Here are steps for how to achieve: 1. Log in to the Humanloop Dashboard \n\n2.

  ### Create an Evaluation

  We create an Evaluation Run to compare the performance of the different Prompts using the Dataset we just created.

  For this guide, we selected *Semantic Similarity*, *Cost* and *Latency* Evaluators.
  You can find these Evaluators in the **Example Evaluators** folder in your workspace.

  <Callout>
    "Semantic Similarity" Evaluator measures the degree of similarity between the model's response and the expected output. The similarity is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means very similar.
  </Callout>

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python


    evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.create(
        name="Evaluation via API",
        file={
            "path": "Run Evaluation via API/Support Agent",
        },
        evaluators=[{"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic Similarity"}, {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Cost"}, {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"}],
    )

    # Create a Run for each prompt version
    for prompt_version in prompt_versions:
        humanloop.evaluations.create_run(
            id=evaluation.id,
            dataset={"path": "Run Evaluation via API/Dataset with user questions"},
            version={"version_id": prompt_version},
        )

    ```

    ```typescript

    const evaluation = await humanloop.evaluations.create({
         name: "Evaluation via API",
         file: {
            "path": "Run Evaluation via API/Support Agent",
        },
        evaluators: [{"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic Similarity"}, {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Cost"}, {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"}],
    });

    for (const promptVersion of promptVersions) {
        await humanloop.evaluations.createRun(evaluation.id, {
            dataset: { path: "Run Evaluation via API/Dataset with user questions" },
            version: { versionId: promptVersion },
        });
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  ### Inspect the Evaluation stats

  When Runs are completed, you can inspect the Evaluation Stats to see the summary of the Evaluators judgments.

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python

    evaluation_stats = humanloop.evaluations.get_stats(
        id=evaluation.id,
    )

    print(evaluation_stats.report)

    ```

    ```typescript
    const evaluationStats = await humanloop.evaluations.getStats(evaluation.id);
    console.log(evaluationStats.report);
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  <img src="file:6acd4d0f-11bb-4f18-a044-e9eb9f7e55b7" alt="Drill down to Evaluatoin Logs." />

  Alternatively you can see detailed stats in the Humanloop UI. Navigate to the Prompt, click on the **Evaluations** tab at the top of the page and select the Evaluation you just created. The stats are displayed in the **Stats** tab.

  <img src="file:e8e1f941-7352-498b-ab2b-c5cfeffcde94" alt="Drill down to Evaluatoin Logs." />
</Steps>

# Run an Evaluation using your runtime

If you choose to execute Prompts using your own Runtime, you still can benefit from Humanloop Evaluations.
In code snippet below, we run Evaluators hosted on Humanloop using logs produced by the OpenAI client.

<CodeBlock>
  ```python
  # create new Humanloop prompt

# Upload a Dataset from CSV

> Learn how to create Datasets in Humanloop to define fixed examples for your projects, and build up a collection of input-output pairs for evaluation and fine-tuning.

[Datasets](/docs/explanation/datasets) are a collection of input-output pairs that can be used to evaluate your Prompts, Tools or even Evaluators.

### Prerequisites

You should have an existing [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) on Humanloop with a variable defined with our double curly bracket syntax `{{variable}}`. If not, first follow our guide on [creating a Prompt](../prompts/create-prompt).

In this example, we'll use a Prompt that categorises user queries about Humanloop's product and docs by which feature they relate to.

<img src="file:dbe4d59a-0bda-4186-8f87-128daf461c7b" alt="An example Prompt with a variable `{{query}}`." />

## Steps

To create a dataset from a CSV file, we'll first create a CSV in Google Sheets that contains values for our Prompt variable `{{query}}` and then upload it to a Dataset on Humanloop.

<Steps>
  ### Create a CSV file.

  * In our Google Sheets example below, we have a column called `query` which contains possible values for our Prompt variable `{{query}}`. You can include as many columns as you have variables in your Prompt template.
  * There is additionally a column called `target` which will populate the target output for the classifier Prompt. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.
  * More complex Datapoints that contain `messages` and structured objects for targets are supported, but are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be hard-to-read JSON. If you need more complex Datapoints, [use the API](./create-dataset-api) instead.

  <img src="file:91c7088e-8bb3-428b-ae16-dd14662c2cc9" alt="A CSV file in Google Sheets defining query and target pairs for our Classifier Prompt." />

  ### Export the Google Sheet to CSV

  In Google Sheets, choose **File** → **Download** → **Comma-separated values (.csv)**

  ### Create a new Dataset File

  On Humanloop, select *New* at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar, then select *Dataset*.

  <img src="file:0ffedd8b-849c-44b8-b6d9-9765afed5e9d" alt="Create a new File from the sidebar on Humanloop." />

  ### Click **Upload CSV**

  First name your dataset when prompted in the sidebar, then select the **Upload CSV** button and drag and drop the CSV file you created above using the file explorer.
  Press **Upload Dataset from CSV...**.

  <img src="file:91cddf9a-4ccd-429b-9670-9768cf4c56e7" alt="Uploading a CSV file to create a dataset." />

  ### Map the CSV columns

  Map each of the CSV columns into one of `input`, `message`, `target`. To avoid uploading a column of your CSV you can map it to the `exclude` option.

  To map in columns to Messages, they need to be in a specific format. An example of this can be seen in our example Dataset or below:

  ```
  "[{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Tell me about the weather""}]"
  ```

  Once you have mapped your columns, press **Extend Current Dataset**

  <img src="file:12f695fb-e369-47c5-ac7e-b2a18b33da90" alt="Mapping columns of a CSV into specific values of a dataset." />

  ### Review your uploaded datapoints

  You'll see the input-output pairs that were included in the CSV file and you can review the rows to inspect and edit the individual Datapoints.

  <img src="file:14e77ec8-e7d8-4de1-a63e-960850e1a895" alt="Inspect the Dataset created from the CSV file." />
</Steps>

### Save the Dataset

Click the **Save** button at the top of the Dataset editor and optionally provide a name and description for this version. Press **Save** again.

<img src="file:4ad5a7e2-1de6-4547-92ac-9fd0c3b50623" alt="Save a Dataset." />

Your dataset is now uploaded and ready for use.

## Next steps

🎉 Now that you have Datasets defined in Humanloop, you can leverage our [Evaluations](./overview) feature to systematically measure and improve the performance of your AI applications.
See our guides on [setting up Evaluators](./llm-as-a-judge) and [Running an Evaluation](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to get started.

For different ways to create datasets, see the links below:

* [Create a Dataset from existing Logs](./create-dataset-from-logs) - useful for curating Datasets based on how your AI application has been behaving in the wild.
* [Upload via API](./create-dataset-api) - useful for uploading more complex Datasets that may have nested JSON structures, which are difficult to represent in tabular .CSV format, and for integrating with your existing data pipelines.


# Create a Dataset via the API

> Learn how to create Datasets in Humanloop to define fixed examples for your projects, and build up a collection of input-output pairs for evaluation and fine-tuning.

[Datasets](/docs/explanation/datasets) are a collection of input-output pairs that can be used to evaluate your Prompts, Tools or even Evaluators.

### Prerequisites

If you are using the SDK, the only prerequisite is to have the SDK installed and configured. If you are using the API directly, you will need to have an API key.

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

## Steps

Using the API is a great way to integrate Humanloop with your existing data pipeline or just to once-off upload a more complex Dataset that is hard to represent in a CSV file, such as one that contains an array of messages and JSON targets.

<Steps>
  ### Post data to the Datasets API

  We first define some sample data that contains user messages and desired responses from our [Support Agent Prompt](./create-dataset-from-logs) and call the `POST /datasets` endpoint to upload it as follows:

  <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /datasets" example="CreateSupportDataset" />

  ### Inspect the uploaded Dataset

  After running this code, in your Humanloop workspace you will now see a Dataset called `Support Query Ground Truth` (or whatever value was in `path`) with your sample data.

  <img src="file:1b7981b1-9ec7-4071-b2bc-7b8be3bec271" alt="Inspect the Dataset uploaded via API." />
</Steps>

## Next steps

🎉 Now that you have Datasets defined in Humanloop, you can leverage our [Evaluations](./overview) feature to systematically measure and improve the performance of your AI applications.
See our guides on [setting up Evaluators](./llm-as-a-judge) and [Running an Evaluation](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to get started.

For different ways to create datasets, see the links below:

* [Create a Dataset from existing Logs](./create-dataset-from-logs) - useful for curating Datasets based on how your AI application has been behaving in the wild.
* [Upload data from CSV](./upload-dataset-csv) - useful for quickly uploading existing tabular data you've collected outside of Humanloop.


# Create a Dataset from existing Logs

> Learn how to create Datasets in Humanloop to define fixed examples for your projects, and build up a collection of input-output pairs for evaluation and fine-tuning.

[Datasets](/docs/explanation/datasets) are a collection of input-output pairs that can be used to evaluate your Prompts, Tools or even Evaluators.

This guide will show you how to create Datasets in Humanloop from your Logs.

### Prerequisites

You should have an existing [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) on Humanloop and already generated some [Logs](/docs/explanation/logs).
Follow our guide on [creating a Prompt](../prompts/create-prompt).

## Steps

To create a Dataset from existing Logs:

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the **Logs** of your Prompt

  Our Prompt in this example is a Support Agent that answers user queries about Humanloop's product and docs:

  <img src="file:8972120c-2231-46f7-a540-7a289c32db1c" alt="Navigate to the Logs table of your Prompt." />

  ### Select a subset of the Logs to add

  Filter logs on a criteria of interest, such as the version of the Prompt used, then multi-select Logs.

  In the menu in the top right of the page, select **Add to Dataset**.

  <img src="file:7c4b147c-a1c1-4b03-8535-2bf38c6c8584" alt="Filter and select logs of interest." />

  ### Add to a new Dataset

  Provide a name for the new Dataset and click **Create** (or you can click **add to existing Dataset** to append the selection to an existing Dataset).
  Then you can optionally add a version name. A description is pre-filled with details from the source Logs — you can edit this to add more context about
  the new version if you’d like.

  <img src="file:cf57f1df-7cb5-434d-9ae4-0612b427a27c" alt="Create a new dataset from logs." />

  You will then see the new Dataset appear at the same level in the filesystem as your Prompt.
</Steps>

## Next steps

🎉 Now that you have Datasets defined in Humanloop, you can leverage our [Evaluations](./overview) feature to systematically measure and improve the performance of your AI applications.
See our guides on [setting up Evaluators](./llm-as-a-judge) and [Running an Evaluation](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to get started.

For different ways to create datasets, see the links below:

* [Upload data from CSV](./upload-dataset-csv) - useful for quickly uploading existing tabular data you've collected outside of Humanloop.
* [Upload via API](./create-dataset-api) - useful for uploading more complex Datasets that may have nested JSON structures, which are difficult to represent in tabular .CSV format, and for integrating with your existing data pipelines.


# Set up a code Evaluator

> Learn how to create a code Evaluators in Humanloop to assess the performance of your AI applications. This guide covers setting up an offline evaluator, writing evaluation logic, and using the debug console.

A code [Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators) is a Python function that takes a generated [Log](/docs/explanation/logs) (and optionally a testcase [Datapoint](/docs/explanation/datasets) if comparing to expected results) as input and returns a **judgement**.
The judgement is in the form of a boolean or number that measures some criteria of the generated Log defined within the code.

Code Evaluators provide a flexible way to evaluate the performance of your AI applications, allowing you to re-use existing evaluation packages as well as define custom evaluation heuristics.

We support a fully featured Python environment; details on the supported packages can be found in the [environment reference](/docs/v5/reference/python-environment)

### Prerequisites

You should have an existing [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) to evaluate and already generated some [Logs](/docs/explanation/logs).
Follow our guide on [creating a Prompt](/docs/guides/prompts/create-prompt).

In this example, we'll reference a Prompt that categorises a user query about Humanloop's product and docs by which feature it relates to.

<img src="file:dbe4d59a-0bda-4186-8f87-128daf461c7b" alt="An example Prompt with a variable `{{query}}`." />

## Create a code Evaluator

<Steps>
  ### Create a new Evaluator

  * Click the **New** button at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar, select **Evaluator**, then select **Code**.

  <img src="file:13911061-6405-44e3-b23b-81e5e7ddd990" alt="Create code evaluator." />

  * Give the Evaluator a name when prompted in the sidebar, for example `Category Validator`.

  ### Define the Evaluator code

  After creating the Evaluator, you will automatically be taken to the code editor.
  For this example, our Evaluator will check that the feature category returned by the Prompt is from the list of allowed feature categories. We want to ensure our categoriser isn't hallucinating new features.

  * Make sure the **Mode** of the Evaluator is set to **Online** in the options on the left.
  * Copy and paste the following code into the code editor:

  ```python Python

  ALLOWED_FEATURES = [
      "Prompt Editor",
      "Model Integrations",
      "Online Monitoring",
      "Offline Evaluations",
      "Dataset Management",
      "User Management",
      "Roles Based Access Control",
      "Deployment Options",
      "Collaboration",
      "Agents and chaining"
  ]

  def validate_feature(log):
      print(f"Full log output: \n {log['output']}")
      # Parse the final line of the log output to get the returned category
      feature = log["output"].split("\n")[-1]
      return feature in ALLOWED_FEATURES
  ```

  <Info title="Code Organisation">
    You can define multiple functions in the code Editor to organize your
    evaluation logic. The final function defined is used as the main Evaluator
    entry point that takes the Log argument and returns a valid judgement.
  </Info>

  ### Debug the code with Prompt Logs

  * In the debug console beneath where you pasted the code, click **Select Prompt or Dataset** and find and select the Prompt you're evaluating.
    The debug console will load a sample of Logs from that Prompt.

  <img src="file:66866462-f405-43e1-8ecd-e9dcb8eeabc3" alt="The debug console for testing the code." />

  * Click the **Run** button at the far right of one of the loaded Logs to trigger a debug run. This causes the code to be executed with the selected Log as input and populates the **Result** column.
  * Inspect the output of the executed code by selecting the arrow to the right of **Result**.

  <img src="file:55adb3a0-a510-466c-953a-a0e853bbe68b" alt="Inspect evaluator log in debug console." />

  ### Save the code

  Now that you've validated the behaviour, save the code by selecting the **Save** button at the top right of the Editor and optionally provide a suitable version name and description.

  ### Inspect Evaluator logs

  Navigate to the **Logs** tab of the Evaluator to see and debug all the historic usages of this Evaluator.

  <img src="file:dfe6bdaa-22dc-4d14-a349-2b1aedcc5231" alt="Evaluator logs table." />
</Steps>

## Monitor a Prompt

Now that you have an Evaluator, you can use it to monitor the performance of your Prompt by linking it so that it is automatically run on new Logs.

<Steps>
  ### Link the Evaluator to the Prompt

  * Navigate to the **Dashboard** of your Prompt
  * Select the **Monitoring** button above the graph and select **Connect Evaluators**.
  * Find and select the Evaluator you just created and click **Chose**.

  <img src="file:e7147dd8-18a4-489d-82b0-1f2cf1fe705d" alt="Select Evaluator for monitoring." />

  <Info title="Linking Evaluators for Monitoring">
    You can link to a deployed version of the Evaluator by choosing the
    environment such as `production`, or you can link to a specific version of the
    Evaluator. If you want changes deployed to your Evaluator to be automatically
    reflected in Monitoring, link to the environment, otherwise link to a specific
    version.
  </Info>

  This linking results in: - An additional graph on your Prompt dashboard showing the Evaluator results over time. - An additional column in your Prompt Versions table showing the aggregated Evaluator results for each version. - An additional column in your Logs table showing the Evaluator results for each Log.

  ### Generate new Logs

  Navigate to the **Editor** tab of your Prompt and generate a new Log by entering a query and clicking **Run**.

  ### Inspect the Monitoring results

  Navigate to the **Logs** tab of your Prompt and see the result of the linked Evaluator against the new Log. You can filter on this value in order to [create a Dataset](/docs/guides/evals/create-dataset-api) of interesting examples.

  <img src="file:e2e96b94-7f45-4d9d-9f88-fe4b80ff7f0a" alt="See the results of monitoring on your logs." />
</Steps>

## Evaluating a Dataset

When running a code Evaluator on a [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets), you can compare a generated [Log](/docs/explanation/logs) to each Datapoint's target. For example, here's the code of our example Exact Match code evaluator, which checks that the log output exactly matches our expected target.

```python Python
def exact_match(log, testcase):
    target = testcase["target"]["output"]
    generation = log["output"]

    return target == generation
```

## Next steps

* Explore [AI Evaluators](/docs/evaluation/guides/llm-as-a-judge) and [Human Evaluators](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators) to complement your code-based judgements for more qualitative and subjective criteria.
* Combine your Evaluator with a [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets) to run [Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to systematically compare the performance of different versions of your AI application.


# Set up LLM as a Judge

> Learn how to use LLM as a judge to check for PII in Logs.

LLMs can be used for evaluating the quality and characteristics of other AI-generated outputs. When correctly prompted, LLMs can act as impartial judges, providing insights and assessments that might be challenging or time-consuming for humans to perform at scale.

In this guide, we'll explore how to setup an LLM as an [AI Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators) in Humanloop, demonstrating their effectiveness in assessing various aspects of AI-generated content, such as checking for the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

An AI [Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators) is a Prompt that takes attributes from a generated [Log](/docs/explanation/logs) (and optionally from a testcase [Datapoint](/docs/explanation/datasets) if comparing to expected results) as context and returns a **judgement**.
The judgement is in the form of a boolean or number that measures some criteria of the generated Log defined within the Prompt instructions.

### Prerequisites

You should have an existing [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts) to evaluate and already generated some [Logs](/docs/explanation/logs).
Follow our guide on [creating a Prompt](/docs/guides/prompts/create-prompt).

In this example we will use a simple Support Agent Prompt that answers user queries about Humanloop's product and docs.

<img src="file:a3890fe9-14e1-49f7-a68c-1a0bd14a6d86" alt="Support agent base prompt." />

## Create an LLM Evaluator

<Steps>
  ### Create a new Evaluator

  * Click the **New** button at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar, select **Evaluator**, then select **AI**.

  * Give the Evaluator a name when prompted in the sidebar, for example `PII Identifier`.

  ### Define the Evaluator Prompt

  After creating the Evaluator, you will automatically be taken to the Evaluator editor.
  For this example, our Evaluator will check whether the request to, or response from, our support agent contains PII. The Evaluator acts as Guardrail, helping us spot issues in our agent workflow.

  * Make sure the **Mode** of the Evaluator is set to **Online** in the options on the left.
  * Copy and paste the following Prompt into the Editor:

  ```text
  You are a helpful assistant. Your job is to observe the requests and outputs to a support agent and identify whether or not they contain any PII.

  Examples of PII information are:
  - Names
  - Addresses
  - Bank account information
  - Job information

  Here is the request and response information:
  ###
  Request:
  {{log.messages}}
  ###
  Response:
  {{log.output_message}}
  ###

  Your response should contain the rationale and the final binary true/false verdict as to whether PII exists in the request resposne. The final true/false verdit should be on a new line at the end.
  ```

  <Info title="Available Prompt Variables">
    In the Prompt Editor for an LLM evaluator, you have access to the underlying `log` you are evaluating as well as the `testcase` Datapoint that gave rise to it if you are using a Dataset for **offline** Evaluations.
    These are accessed with the standard `{{ variable }}` syntax, enhanced with a familiar dot notation to pick out specific values from inside the `log` and `testcase` objects.

    For example, suppose you are evaluating a Log object like this.

    ```json
    {
        "id": "data_B3RmIu9aA5FibdtXP7CkO",
        "prompt": {...},
        "inputs": {
        	"query": "What is the meaning of life?",
        },
        "messages": []
        "output": "I'm sorry, as an AI I don't have the capacity to understand the meaning of life.",
        "metadata": {...},
        ...etc
    }
    ```

    In the LLM Evaluator Prompt, `{{ log.inputs.query }}` will be replaced with the actual query in the final prompt sent to the LLM Evaluator.

    In order to get access to the fully populated Prompt that was sent in the underlying Log, you can use the special variable `{{ log_prompt }}`.
  </Info>

  ### Debug the code with Prompt Logs

  * In the debug console beneath where you pasted the code, click **Select Prompt or Dataset** and find and select the Prompt you're evaluating.
    The debug console will load a sample of Logs from that Prompt.

  <img src="file:957d7aba-3c4f-4568-bb64-d979a8568149" alt="The debug console for testing the Evaluator Prompt." />

  * Click the **Run** button at the far right of one of the loaded Logs to trigger a debug run. This causes the Evaluator Prompt to be called with the selected Log attributes as input and populates the **Result** column.
  * Inspect the output of the executed code by selecting the arrow to the right of **Result**.

  <img src="file:f5720ad1-e7c7-40af-a926-227432b7e043" alt="Inspect evaluator log in debug console." />

  ### Save the code

  Now that you've validated the behaviour, save the code by selecting the **Save** button at the top right of the Editor and optionally provide a suitable version name and description.

  ### Inspect Evaluator logs

  Navigate to the **Logs** tab of the Evaluator to see and debug all the historic usages of this Evaluator.

  <img src="file:43f1593d-8251-4ee7-9f35-20d6aadaf97c" alt="Evaluator logs table." />
</Steps>

## Next steps

* Explore [Code Evaluators](/docs/guides/evals/code-based-evaluator) and [Human Evaluators](/docs/guides/evals/human-evaluators) to complement your AI judgements.
* Combine your Evaluator with a [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets) to run [Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to systematically compare the performance of different versions of your AI application.


# Set up a Human Evaluator

> Learn how to set up a Human Evaluator in Humanloop. Human Evaluators allow your subject-matter experts and end-users to provide feedback on Prompt Logs.

Human Evaluators allow your subject-matter experts and end-users to provide feedback on Prompt Logs.
These Evaluators can be attached to Prompts and Evaluations.

## Creating a Human Evaluator

This section will bring you through creating and setting up a Human Evaluator.
As an example, we'll use a "Tone" Evaluator that allows feedback to be provided by
selecting from a list of options.

<Steps>
  ### Create a new Evaluator

  * Click the **New** button at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar, select **Evaluator**, then select **Human**.

  ![New Evaluator dialog](file:701295ae-8b50-4457-9e71-ecf9c6074e55)

  * Give the Evaluator a name when prompted in the sidebar, for example "Tone".

  ![Created Human Evaluator being renamed to "Tone"](file:8923cfae-84fd-4ed9-bf6a-7bee9ae44a00)

  ### Define the Judgment Schema

  After creating the Evaluator, you will automatically be taken to the Editor.
  Here, you can define the schema detailing the kinds of judgments to be applied for the Evaluator.
  The Evaluator will be initialized to a 5-point rating scale by default.

  In this example, we'll set up a feedback schema for a "Tone" Evaluator.
  See the [Return types documentation](/docs/explanation/evaluators#return-types) for more information on return types.

  * Select **Multi-select** within the **Return type** dropdown. "Multi-select" allows you to apply multiple options to a single Log.
  * Add the following options, and set the valence for each:
    * Enthusiastic \[positive]
    * Informative \[postiive]
    * Repetitive \[negative]
    * Technical \[negative]
  * Update the instructions to "Select all options that apply to the output."

  ![Tone evaluator set up with options and instructions](file:e44886ee-33b5-4f2e-9f7f-bc4fb404a002)

  ### Save and deploy the Evaluator

  * Click **Save** in the top-right corner.
  * Enter "Tone multi-select v1" for the version name and "Added initial tone options" for the description. Click **Save**.

  ![Save dialog over the "Tone" Evaluator](file:d0ae260d-7002-481e-a41f-8e78a64c63b4)

  * Press **Deploy** in the next dialog.
  * Select your default Environment (usually "production").
  * Confirm your deployment.

  ![Dialog deploying the "Tone" Evaluator to the "production" Environment](file:37e5a54d-0b32-4c66-bca1-2904f9dfb013)
</Steps>

:tada: You've now created a Human Evaluator that can be used to collect feedback on Prompt Logs.

## Next steps

* [Use Human Evaluators in Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-human-evaluation) to collect annotations on Prompt Logs from subject-matter experts.

# Run a Human Evaluation

> Collect judgments from subject-matter experts (SMEs) to better understand the quality of your AI product.

In this guide, we'll show how SMEs can provide judgments on Prompt Logs to help you understand the quality of the AI feature.
You can then use this feedback to iterate and improve your Prompt performance.

### Prerequisites

* You have set up a Human Evaluator appropriate for your use-case. If not, follow our guide to [create a Human Evaluator](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators).
* You have a Dataset with test data to evaluate model outputs against. If not, follow our guide to [create a Dataset from already existing Logs](/docs/evaluation/guides/create-dataset-from-logs).

## Provide judgments on Logs

In this guide, we assume you have already created a Prompt and a Dataset for an evaluation. Now we want to leverage the subject-matter experts to help us understand whether model outputs meet our quality standards.

<Steps>
  ### Create a new Evaluation

  Navigate to the Prompt you want to evaluate and click on the **Evaluation** tab at the top of the page. Click on **Evaluate** to create a new Evaluation.

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:2a0a8f05-49f7-46f6-ac7c-3cf6764572e1" />
  </Frame>

  ### Create a new Run

  To evaluate a version of your Prompt, click on the **+Run** button, then select the version of the Prompt you want to evaluate and the Dataset you want to use.
  Click on **+Evaluator** to add a Human Evaluator to the Evaluation.

  <Callout>
    You can find example Human Evaluators in the **Example Evaluators** folder.
  </Callout>

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:c01f788a-c81a-4a79-a0c8-3e71b3040e7c" />
  </Frame>

  Click **Save** to create a new Run. Humanloop will start generating Logs for the Evaluation.

  ### Apply judgments to generated Logs

  When Logs are generated, navigate to the **Review** tab. Turn on **Focus mode** and start providing judgments on the generated Logs.

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:14274bd1-03f6-4bfd-92da-fcc82dc81f5e" />
  </Frame>

  When the last judgment is provided, the Run is marked as complete.

  <Frame caption="Completed review">
    <img src="file:aab3d62e-0d82-4991-8b1a-eead0f0eaa3f" />
  </Frame>

  ### Review judgments stats

  You can see the overall performance across all Evaluators in the **Stats** tab.

  <Frame>
    <img src="file:6457bcec-f6b8-496c-8226-b0a267dad273" />
  </Frame>
</Steps>

## Improve the Prompt

Explore the Logs that the SME flagged in the Review tab.

To make improvements, find a Log with negative judgments and click on its ID above the Log output to open the drawer on the right-hand side.
In the drawer, click on the **Editor ->** button to load the Prompt Editor. Now, modify the instructions and save a new version.

<Frame caption="Prompt Editor">
  <img src="file:6e8c9289-74b8-4c27-b08f-90b4d1fc399e" alt="Run Evals with Dataset on Humanloop." />
</Frame>

Create a new run using the new version of the Prompt and compare the results to find out if the changes have improved the performance.

## Next steps

We've successfully collected judgments from the SMEs to understand the quality of our AI product.
Explore next:

* If your team has multiple internal SMEs, learn how to [effectively manage evaluation involving multiple SMEs](/docs/evaluation/guides/manage-multiple-reviewers).
* If SMEs provided negative judgments on the logs, please refer to our guide on [Comparing and Debugging Prompts](/docs/evaluation/guides/comparing-prompt-editor).


# Manage multiple reviewers

> Learn how to split the work between your SMEs

<Callout>
  **Who is this for**: This guide is for large teams that want to leverage their internal subject matter experts (SMEs) to evaluate the performance of their AI features.
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

* You have set up [Evaluators](/docs/explanation/evaluators). If not, follow our guide to [create a Human Evaluator](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators).
* You have several subject-matter experts (SMEs) available to provide feedback on Evaluation Logs.

## Divide work between SMEs

When you have a large [Dataset](/docs/explanation/datasets) to evaluate, it's helpful to split the work between your SMEs to ensure that the evaluation is completed quickly and effectively.

<Steps>
  ### Split the Dataset into chunks

  Each Dataset consists of datapoints. Add an identifier to each datapoint to group them into chunks.

  For example, we [created](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-cookbook/blob/main/assets/datasets/dataset_with_common_customer_support_questions.csv) a Dataset with 100 common customer support questions.
  In the csv file, we added an identifier called "chunk" to each datapoint, splitting the whole Dataset into 10 equal parts.

  To upload this CSV on Humanloop, create a new Dataset file, then click on the **Upload CSV** button.

  <img src="file:fdb86eae-f4f2-4fdc-a0c1-146f65c9ab88" alt="Upload CSV as dataset to Humanloop." />

  Alternatively, you [upload Dataset via our SDK](/docs/v5/guides/evals/create-dataset-api)

  ### Run an Evaluation

  Navigate to a Prompt you want to evaluate and create a new Evaluation Run.

  <Frame caption="Example of running an Evaluation on a Prompt">
    <img src="file:857ab8d9-8246-49b5-8202-0ded8747aa84" alt="Run Evals with Dataset on Humanloop." />
  </Frame>

  ### Split the workload between SMEs

  To split the workload between your SMEs, navigate to the **Review** tab, turn on **Focus mode**, and click on the **Filters** button.
  Filter the Dataset by identifiers, such as "chunk", to split the review work into smaller pieces.

  ### Send the URL to your SMEs

  After you have filtered the Dataset, copy the URL and send it to your SME.
  When they open the link, they will only see the relevant chunk of the Dataset.

  <Frame caption="The view that SME will see when they open the link. This only shows chunk of the Dataset that is relevant to them.">
    <img src="file:b3050d3b-3512-4b40-88a1-d25e749dbada" alt="Focus mode on." />
  </Frame>

  ### Monitor progress

  As the SMEs provide judgments on the outputs,
  we display the overall progress and the number of outstanding judgments. When the final judgment is given, the Evaluation is marked as complete.
</Steps>

## Improve the Prompt

With judgments from your SMEs, you can now better understand the model's performance and iterate on your Prompt to improve the model outputs.

<Frame caption="Completed Evaluation with judgments from SMEs.">
  <img src="file:e8ff63ff-4409-49d7-87ef-b6c0186e868d" alt="Completed evaluations." />
</Frame>

In our example, the SME marked the Log on the right-hand side as "bad" because it's too long.
To take action, click on the Log ID above the Log output to open the Log drawer. In the drawer, click on the **Editor ->** button to load this Log in the Prompt Editor. Now, modify the instructions to explicitly state that the model should provide a concise answer.

## Next steps

We've successfully split the work among multiple SMEs to effectively evaluate the performance of our AI product.
Explore next:

* If your SMEs gave negative judgments on the Logs, see our guide on [Comparing and Debugging Prompts](/docs/evaluation/guides/comparing-prompt-editor).
* Find out more about [Human Evaluators](/docs/evaluation/guides/human-evaluators) to capture feedback that is most relevant to your use case.


# Compare and Debug Prompts

> In this guide, we will walk through comparing the outputs from multiple Prompts side-by-side using the Humanloop Editor environment and using diffs to help debugging.

You can compare Prompt versions interactively side-by-side to get a sense for how their behaviour differs; before then triggering more systematic [Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui).
All the interactions in Editor are stored as Logs within your Prompt and can be inspected further and [added to a Dataset](/docs/evaluation/guides/create-dataset-from-logs) for Evaluations.

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

## Compare Prompt versions

In this example we will use a simple support agent Prompt that answers user queries about Humanloop's product and docs.

<img src="file:a3890fe9-14e1-49f7-a68c-1a0bd14a6d86" alt="Support agent base prompt." />

<Steps>
  ### Create a new version of your Prompt

  Open your Prompt in the Editor. Under **Parameters**, change some details such as the choice of `Model`.
  In this example, we change from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-mini`.

  <img src="file:f9e89d06-b01b-4ce8-8264-4c49cd1e7456" alt="Support agent change model" />

  Now save the new version of your Prompt by selecting the **Save** button in the top right and optionally provide a helpful version name (e.g. "Simple Support Agent v2") and/or description (e.g. "Changed model to gpt-4o-mini").

  ### Load up two versions of your Prompt in the Editor

  To load up the previous version side-by-side, select the menu beside the Load button and select the **New panel** option (depending on your screen real-estate, you can add more than 2 panels).

  <img src="file:3d01bc06-d6a9-4615-ae0a-75e00e1fbe30" alt="Support agent add panel" />

  Then press the *Load* button in the new panel and select another version of your Prompt to compare.

  <img src="file:072fa596-760b-4dd1-b5fd-9d54692ef08b" alt="Support agent load version" />

  ### Compare the outputs of both versions

  Now you can run the same user messages through both models to compare their behaviours live, side-by-side.

  <img src="file:c0b1e2c3-dfe2-408a-bb9c-7d673e86a65e" alt="Support agent compare version" />
</Steps>

## View Prompt diff for debugging

When debugging more complex Prompts, it's important to understand what changes were made between different versions. Humanloop provides a diff view to support this.

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to your Prompt dashboard

  In the sidebar, select the **Dashboard** section under your Prompt file, where you will find a table of all your Prompt versions.

  <img src="file:eed5016b-650b-4ad6-bbb5-9fdc54b42d59" alt="Support agent dashboard" />

  ### Select the versions to compare

  In the table, select two rows you would like to see the changes between. Then select the **Show diff** button above the table.

  <img src="file:bc3f55ef-5875-4435-89fa-72cdb669d70e" alt="Support agent diff view" />
</Steps>

1. In the comparison view, you'll see a diff that highlights the changes between the selected versions.
2. The diff shows additions in green and deletions in red. Modified content appears as a combination of red (for removed text) and green (for added text).
3. Use this view to understand how specific changes affect the output.

By following these steps, you can effectively compare different versions of your Prompts and iterate on your instructions to improve performance.


# Set up CI/CD Evaluations

> Learn how to automate LLM evaluations as part of your CI/CD pipeline using Humanloop and GitHub Actions.

## Setting up CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions

Integrating Humanloop evaluations into your CI/CD pipeline allows you to automatically test your AI applications as part of your development workflow. This guide will walk you through setting up this integration using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository for your project
* A Humanloop account with access to Evaluations
* A Prompt and Dataset set up in Humanloop
* An Evaluator configured in Humanloop

## Steps to Set Up CI/CD Integration

<Steps>
  ### Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

  In your GitHub repository, create a new file `.github/workflows/humanloop-eval.yml` with the following content:

  <Warning title="Under Development">
    This content is currently under development. Please refer to our [V4
    documentation](https://docs.humanloop.com/v4) for the current docs.
  </Warning>

  ```yaml
  ```
</Steps>


# Spot-check your Logs

> Learn how to use the Humanloop Python SDK to sample a subset of your Logs and create an Evaluation Run to spot-check them.

By regularly reviewing a sample of your Prompt Logs, you can gain valuable insights into the performance of your
Prompts in production, such as through reviews by subject-matter experts (SMEs).

<Info>
  For real-time observability (typically using code Evaluators), see our guide
  on setting up [monitoring](../observability/monitoring). This guide describes
  setting up more detailed evaluations which are run on a small subset of Logs.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

* You have a Prompt with Logs. See our guide on [logging to a Prompt](/docs/guides/prompts/log-to-a-prompt) if you don't yet have one.
* You have a Human Evaluator set up. See our guide on [creating a Human Evaluator](/docs/guides/evals/human-evaluators) if you don't yet have one.

{/* TODO: This should be Python-only. */}

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

## Set up an Evaluation

<Steps>
  ### Create an Evaluation

  Create an Evaluation for the Prompt.
  In this example, we also attach a "rating" Human Evaluator so our SMEs can judge the generated responses.

  ```python
  evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.create(
      # Name your Evaluation
      name="Monthly spot-check",
      file={
          # Replace this with the ID of your Prompt.
          # You can specify a Prompt by "path" as well.
          "id": "pr_..."
      },
      evaluators=[
          # Attach Evaluator to enable SMEs to rate the generated responses
          {"path": "Example Evaluators/Human/rating"},
      ],
  )
  ```

  ### Create a Run

  Create a Run within the Evaluation. We will then attach Logs to this Run.

  ```python
  run = humanloop.evaluations.create_run(
      id=evaluation.id,
  )
  ```

  ### Sample Logs

  Sample a subset of your Logs to attach to the Run.

  For this example, we'll sample 100 Logs from the past 30 days, simulating
  a monthly spot-check.

  ```python
  import datetime

  logs = humanloop.logs.list(
      file_id="pr_...",  # Replace with the ID of the Prompt
      sample=100,
      # Example filter to sample Logs from the past 30 days
      start_date=datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=30),
  )

  log_ids = [log.id for log in logs]
  ```

  ### Attach Logs to the Run

  Attach the sampled Logs to the Run you created earlier.

  ```python
  humanloop.evaluations.add_logs_to_run(
      id=evaluation.id,
      run_id=run.id,
      log_ids=log_ids,
  )
  ```
</Steps>

You have now created an Evaluation Run with a sample of Logs attached to it.
In the Humanloop app, go to the Prompt's Evaluations tab. You should see the new Evaluation
named "Monthly spot-check". Click on it to view the Run with the Logs attached.

![Evaluation Run with Logs attached](file:cbaf2f6f-6324-4f7f-a740-84544f35b79f)

## Review your Logs

Rate the model generations via the **Review** tab.

<Info>
  For further details on how you can manage reviewing your Logs with multiple
  SMEs, see our guide on [managing multiple
  reviewers](./manage-multiple-reviewers).
</Info>

![Logs review](file:cb772725-5693-4ac5-acd5-4da8ff7de247)

After your Logs have been reviewed, go to the **Stats** tab to view aggregate stats.

![Aggregate run stats](file:c140e72b-0988-4c4a-b687-dba67ca4cafa)

## Repeating the spot-check

To repeat this process the next time a spot-check is due, you can create a new Run within the same Evaluation,
repeating the above steps from "Create a Run". You will then see the new Run alongside the previous ones in the Evaluation,
and can compare the aggregate stats across multiple Runs.

## Next Steps

* If you have performed a spot-check and identified issues, you can [iterate on your Prompts in the app](./comparing-prompts) and [run further Evaluations](/docs/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui) to verify improvements.


# Use external Evaluators

> Integrate your existing evaluation process with Humanloop.

LLM and code Evaluators generally live on the Humanloop runtime environment. The advantage of this is that these Evaluators can be used as [monitoring Evaluators](docs/v5/guides/observability/monitoring) and to allow triggering evaluations [directly from the Humanloop UI](/docs/v5/guides/evals/run-evaluation-ui).

Your setup however can be more complex: your Evaluator has library dependencies that are not present in the [runtime environment](/docs/v5/reference/python-environment), your LLM evaluator has multiple reasoning steps, or you prefer managing the logic yourself.

External Evaluators address this: they are registered with Humanloop but their code definition remains in your environment. In order to evaluate a Log, you call the logic yourself and send the judgment to Humanloop.

In this tutorial, we will build a chat agent that answers questions asked by children, and evaluate its performance using an external Evaluator.

## Create the agent

We reuse the chat agent from our [evaluating an agent tutorial](/docs/v5/tutorials/agent-evaluation).

<CodeBlocks>
  ```python title="main.py" maxLines=35
  from humanloop import Humanloop
  from openai import OpenAI
  from openai.types.chat.chat_completion_message import ChatCompletionMessage as Message
  import wikipedia
  import json


  openai = OpenAI(api_key="ADD YOUR KEY HERE")

## Evaluate the agent

<Accordion title="How Evaluators work">
  Evaluators are callables that take the Log's dictionary representation as input and return a judgment. The Evaluator's judgment should respect the `return_type` present in the Evaluator's [specification](/docs/v5/api/evaluators/upsert#request.body.spec).

  The Evaluator can take an additional `target` argument to compare the Log against. The target is provided in an Evaluation context by the validation [Dataset](/docs/v5/explanation/datasets).

  For more details, check out our [Evaluator explanation](/docs/v5/explanation/evaluators).
</Accordion>

<Steps>
  ### Define external Evaluator

  The Evaluator takes a `log` argument, which represents the Log created by calling `call_agent`.

  Let's add a simple Evaluator that checks if the agent's answers are too long. Add this in the `agent.py` file:

  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      def easy_to_understand(log):
          return len(log["output"]) < 100
  ```

  ### Add dataset

  Create a file called `dataset.jsonl` and add the following:

  ```jsonl title="dataset.jsonl" maxLines=5
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why is the sky blue?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Where does the sun go at night?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why do birds fly?"}}

  {"inputs": {"question": "How does the TV work?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why do dogs wag their tails?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "What makes cars go?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why do we need to brush our teeth?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "What do ants eat?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why does the wind blow?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "How do airplanes stay in the air?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why does the ocean look so big?"}}

  {"inputs": {"question": "Why do some animals sleep all winter?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "Why do we have to wear shoes?"}}
  {"inputs": {"question": "What makes music?"}}
  ```

  ### Add Evaluation

  Instantiate an Evaluation using the client's \[]`evaluations.run`]\(/docs/v5/sdk/run-evaluation) utility. `easy_to_understand` is an external Evaluator, so we provide its definition via the `callable` argument. At runtime, `evaluations.run` will call the function and submit the judgment to Humanloop.

  ```python title="agent.py" maxLines=100 highlight={5-28}
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      def easy_to_understand(log):
          return len(log["output"]) < 100

      # Read the evaluation dataset
      with open("dataset.jsonl", "r") as fp:
          dataset = [json.loads(line) for line in fp]

      humanloop.evaluations.run(
          name="QA Agent Answer Comprehensiveness",
          file={
              "path": "QA Agent/Agent",
              "callable": call_agent,
          },
          evaluators=[
              {
                  "path": "QA Agent/Comprehension",
                  "callable": easy_to_understand,
                  "args_type": "target_free",
                  "return_type": "boolean",
              }
          ],
          dataset={
              "path": "QA Agent/Children Questions",
              "datapoints": dataset,
          },
          workers=8,

## Add detailed logging

<Info>
  If you use a programming language not supported by the SDK, or want more control, see our guide on 

  [logging through the API](/docs/v5/guides/observability/logging-through-api)

   for an alternative to decorators.
</Info>

Up to this point, we have treated the agent as a black box, reasoning about its behavior by looking at the inputs and outputs.

Let's use Humanloop logging to observe the step-by-step actions taken by the agent.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    Modify `main.py`:

    ```python title="main.py" maxLines=100 highlight={1,5,10,15}
    @humanloop.tool(path="QA Agent/Search Wikipedia")
    def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> dict:
        ...

    @humanloop.prompt(path="QA Agent/Prompt")
    def call_model(messages: list[Message]) -> Message:
        ...

    @humanloop.flow(path="QA Agent/Agent")
    def call_agent(question: str) -> str:
        ...
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
    <Callout type="info">
      To auto-instrument calls to OpenAI, pass the module in the Humanloop constructor:

      ```typescript
      const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({

          instrumentProviders: {
              // Pass the OpenAI module, not the initialized client
              OpenAI

      ```
    </Callout>

    Modify `main.ts`:

    ```typescript title="main.ts" maxLines=100 highlight={20-21,26-27,32-33}
    const searchWikipedia = humanloop.tool({
        path: "QA Agent/Search Wikipedia",
        version: {
            function: {
                name: "Search Wikipedia",
                description: "Search Wikipedia for the best article to answer a question",
                strict: true,
                parameters: {
                    type: "object",
                    properties: {
                        query: {
                            type: "string",
                            description: "The question to search Wikipedia for",
                        },
                    },
                    required: ["query"],
                },
            },
        },
        // Wraps the initial function body
        callable: async ({ query }) => { ... },
    });

    const callModel = humanloop.prompt({
        path: "QA Agent/Prompt",
        // Wraps the initial function body
        callable: async ({ messages }) => { ... },
    });

    const callAgent = humanloop.flow({
        path: "QA Agent/Agent",
        // Wraps the initial function body
        callable: async ({ question }) => { ... },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Evaluate the agent again. When it's done, head to your workspace and click the **Agent** [Flow](/docs/v5/guides/explanations/flows) on the left. Select the Logs tab from the top of the page.

<Frame caption="The trace captures the agent searching for the best article to answer a question.">
  <img src="file:6ab09b79-fb95-47fa-86ca-2784a51e23fd" />
</Frame>

The decorators divide the code in logical components, allowing you to observe the steps taken to answer a question. Every step taken by the agent creates a Log.

# Evaluate external logs

> Run an Evaluation on Humanloop with your own

This guide demonstrates how to run an Evaluation on Humanloop using your own logs.
This is useful if you have existing logs in an external system and want to evaluate them on Humanloop
with minimal setup.

In this guide, we will use the example of a JSON file containing chat messages between users
and customer support agents. This guide will bring you through uploading these logs to Humanloop
and creating an Evaluation with them.

## Prerequisites

The code in this guide uses the Python SDK. To follow along, you will need to have the SDK installed and configured.
While the code snippets are in Python, the same steps can be performed using the TypeScript SDK or via the API directly.
If you are using the API directly, you will need to have an API key.

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

The example JSON data in this guide can be found in the [Humanloop Cookbook](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-cookbook/tree/evaluating-external-logs/assets).
To continue with the code in this guide, download `conversations-a.json` and `conversations-b.json` from the `assets` folder.

## Evaluate your external logs

We'll start by loading data from `conversations-a.json`, which represents logs recorded by an external system.

```python
import json

with open("conversations-a.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

In this example, `data` is a list of chat messages between users and a support agent.

<Steps>
  ### Upload logs to Humanloop

  <Note>
    These steps are suitable if you do not already have an Evaluation on Humanloop.
    The [Upload new logs step](#upload-new-logs) demonstrates a simpler process
    if you already have an Evaluation you want to add a new set of logs to.
  </Note>

  Upload the logs with the `log(...)` method.
  This will automatically create a [Flow](../../explanation/flows) on Humanloop.

  We additionally pass in some `attributes` identifying
  the configuration of the system that generated these logs.
  `attributes` accepts arbitrary values, and is used for versioning the Flow.
  Here, it allows us to associate this set of logs with a specific version of the support agent.

  ```python
  log_ids = []
  for messages in data:
      log = humanloop.flows.log(
          path="External logs demo/Travel planner",
          flow={"attributes": {"agent-version": "1.0.0"}},  # Optionally add attributes to identify this version of the support agent.
          messages=messages,
      )
      log_ids.append(log.id)
  ```

  This will have created a new Flow on Humanloop named **Travel planner**.
  To confirm this logging has succeeded, navigate to the **Logs** tab of the Flow
  and view the uploaded logs. Each Log should correspond to a conversation and contain
  a list of messages.

  ![Flow Logs](file:74214a7b-40f0-4bf8-a2a5-b5f767381b46)

  We will also use the created Flow version when creating our Run.

  ```python
  version_id = log.version_id
  ```

  ### Create an Evaluation Run

  Next, create an Evaluation on Humanloop. Within the Evaluation, create a Run which will contain the Logs.

  Here, we'll use the example "Helpfulness" LLM-as-a-judge Evaluator. This will automatically rate
  the helpfulness of the support agent across our logs.

  ```python
  evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.create(
      name="Past records",
      # NB: you can use `path`or `id` for references on Humanloop
      file={"path": "External logs demo/Travel planner"},
      evaluators=[
          # Replace with your Evaluators
          {"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Helpfulness"},
      ],
  )
  run = humanloop.evaluations.create_run(
      id=evaluation.id,
      version={'version_id': version_id},  # Associate this Run to the Flow version created above.
  )
  ```

  ### Assign Logs to the Run

  Finally, add the Flow Logs to the Run.

  ```python
  humanloop.evaluations.add_logs_to_run(
      id=evaluation.id,
      run_id=run.id,
      log_ids=log_ids,
  )
  ```

  ### Review the Evaluation

  You have now created an Evaluation on Humanloop and added Logs to it.

  ![Evaluation on Humanloop](file:15067920-44fe-4776-b3c6-0eaa407e32d3)

  Go to the Humanloop UI to view the Evaluation. Within the Evaluation, go to **Logs** tab.
  Here, you can view your uploaded logs as well as the Evaluator judgments.

  ![Logs tab of Evaluation](file:eb83d391-920d-45b0-9c8e-d0ea1d976d80)

  The following steps will guide you through adding a different set of logs to a new Run
  for comparison.

  ### Upload new logs

  <Info>
    If you already have an Evaluation that you want to add a new set of logs to,
    you can start from here.

    To start from this point, retrieve the ID of the Evaluation you want to add logs to.

    Go to the Evaluation you want to add logs to on the Humanloop UI and copy the ID
    from the URL. This is the segment of the URL after `evaluations/`, e.g. `evr_...`.
  </Info>

  Now that we have an Evaluation on Humanloop, we can add a separate set of logs to it
  and compare the performance across this set of logs to the previous set.

  While we can achieve this by repeating the above steps, we can add logs to a Run
  in a more direct and simpler way now that we have an existing Evaluation.

  For this example, we'll continue with the Evaluation created in the previous section,
  and add a new Run with the data from `conversations-b.json`. These represent a set of logs
  from a prototype version of the support agent.

  ```python
  with open("conversations-b.json") as f:
      data = json.load(f)
  ```

  #### Create a new Run

  Create a new Run within the Evaluation that will contain this set of logs.

  ```python
  run = humanloop.evaluations.create_run(
      id=evaluation.id,
  )
  ```

  #### Log to the Run

  Pass the `run_id` argument in your `log(...)` call to associate the Log with the Run.

  ```python
  # Add the new data to the Run
  for messages in data:
      log = humanloop.flows.log(
          path="External logs demo/Travel planner",
          flow={"attributes": {"agent-version": "2.0.0"}},
          messages=messages,
          # Pass `run_id` to associate the Log with the Run.
          run_id=run.id,
      )
  ```

  ### Compare the results

  View the Evaluation on Humanloop. It will now contain two Runs.

  In the **Stats** tab of the Evaluation, you can now compare the performance of the two sets of logs.

  In our case, our second set of logs (on the right) can be seen to be less helpful.

  <CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card>
      ![Evaluation with two Runs on Humanloop](file:ec897ee2-b53b-4db2-927a-e40902537797)

    </Card>
  </CardGroup>
</Steps>

## Next steps

The above examples demonstrate how you can quickly populate an Evaluation Run with your logs.

* You can extend this Evaluation with custom Evaluators, such as using [Code Evaluators](./code-based-evaluator)
  to calculate metrics, or using [Human Evaluators](/docs/guides/evals/human-evaluators)
  to set up your Logs to be reviewed by your subject-matter experts.
* Now that you've set up an Evaluation, explore the other [File](../../explanation/files) types on Humanloop to see how they can better reflect
  your production systems, and how you can use Humanloop to version-control them. Here, we've used a [Flow](../../explanation/flows) to represent a black-box system.


# Create a Prompt

> Learn how to create a Prompt in Humanloop using the UI or SDK, version it, and use it to generate responses from your AI models. Prompt management is a key part of the Humanloop platform.

Humanloop acts as a registry of your [Prompts](/docs/explanation/prompts) so you can centrally manage all their versions and [Logs](/docs/explanation/logs), and evaluate and improve your AI systems.

This guide will show you how to create a Prompt [in the UI](/docs/v4/guides/create-prompt#create-a-prompt-in-the-ui) or [via the SDK/API](/docs/v4/guides/create-prompt#create-a-prompt-using-the-sdk).

<Callout>
  **Prerequisite**: A Humanloop account.

  You can create an account now by going to the [Sign up page](https://app.humanloop.com/signup).
</Callout>

## Create a Prompt in the UI

<Accordion title="Account setup">
  #### Create a Humanloop Account

  If you haven’t already, create an account or log in to Humanloop

  #### Add an OpenAI API Key

  If you’re the first person in your organization, you’ll need to add an API key to a model provider.

  1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

  <Info>
    Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
    OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
    providers private.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Get Started

<Steps>
  ### Create a Prompt File

  When you first open Humanloop you’ll see your File navigation on the left. Click ‘**+ New**’ and create a **Prompt**.

  <img src="file:82ffcfb5-78f2-453b-9074-25a4a61a14f3" />

  In the sidebar, rename this file to "Comedian Bot" now or later.

  ### Create the Prompt template in the Editor

  The left hand side of the screen defines your Prompt – the parameters such as model, temperature and template. The right hand side is a single chat session with this Prompt.

  <img src="file:667cf910-a5c4-498a-a279-bba9606e0fb0" />

  In the editor, update the system message to:

  ```
  You are a funny comedian. Write a joke about {{topic}}.
  ```

  <img src="file:9bc5b928-b2c5-408f-a9cd-ab369a18a940" />

  This message forms the chat template. It has an input slot called `topic` (surrounded by two curly brackets) for an input value that is provided each time you call this Prompt.

  On the right hand side of the page, you’ll now see a box in the **Inputs** section for `topic`.

  1. Add a value for `topic` e.g. music, jogging, whatever
  2. Click **Run** in the bottom right of the page

  This will call OpenAI’s model and return the assistant response. Feel free to try other values, the model is *very* funny.

  You now have a first version of your prompt that you can use.

  ### Save your first version of this Prompt

  1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the editor
  2. Enter **Initial Comedian Setup** in the version name field
  3. Enter **Prompt for making (not so) funny jokes!** in the description field
  4. Click **Save**

  <img src="file:89549dd4-7507-4834-9854-5c1278838547" />

  ### View the logs

  Under the Prompt File, click ‘Logs’ to view all the generations from this Prompt

  Click on a row to see the details of what version of the Prompt generated it. From here you can give feedback to that generation, see performance metrics, open up this example in the Editor, or add this log to a Dataset.

  <img src="file:941bea3b-e28c-4a73-93fb-21265396d0d5" />

## Create a Prompt using the SDK

The Humanloop Python SDK allows you to programmatically create and version your [Prompts](/docs/explanation/prompts) in Humanloop, and log generations from your models. This guide will show you how to create a Prompt using the SDK.

Note that you can also version your prompts dynamically with every Prompt

<Callout>
  **Prerequisite**: A Humanloop SDK Key.

  You can get this from your [Organisation Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) if you have the [right permissions](/docs/v5/reference/access-roles).
</Callout>

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

After initializing the SDK client, you can call the Prompt creation endpoint.

<Steps>
  ### Create the Prompt

  This can be done by using the [Prompt Upsert](/docs/api/prompts/upsert) method in the SDK.

  Or by calling the API directly:

  <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts" />

  ### Go to the App

  Go to the [Humanloop app](https://app.humanloop.com) and you will see your Prompt in your list of files.
</Steps>

You now have a Prompt in Humanloop that contains your initial version. You can call the Prompt in Editor and invite team members by going to your organization's members page.

## Next Steps

With the Prompt set up, you can now integrate it into your app by following the [Call a Prompt Guide](/docs/development/guides/call-prompt).


# Call a Prompt

> Learn how to call your Prompts that are managed on Humanloop.

This guide will show you how to call your Prompts through the API, enabling you to generate responses from the large language model while versioning your Prompts.

You can call an existing Prompt on Humanloop, or you can call a Prompt you're managing in code. These two use-cases are demonstrated below.

### Prerequisites

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

## Call an existing Prompt

If you don't have Prompt already on Humanloop, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

<Steps>
  ### Get the Prompt ID

  In Humanloop, navigate to the Prompt and copy the Prompt ID by clicking Prompt name in the top bar, and copying from the popover.

  <img src="file:75cf473e-f8d7-4a4d-93b3-e58ffac46cf7" />

  ### Call the Prompt by ID

  Now you can use the SDK to generate completions and log the results to your Prompt:

  This can be done by using the [Prompt Call](/docs/api/prompts/call) method in the SDK.

  <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" example="By ID" />

  <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" example="By ID" />
</Steps>

## Call a Prompt defined in code

You can also manage your Prompts in code. Pass the `prompt` details within your API call to generate responses with
the specified parameters.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" example="Supplying Prompt" />

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" example="Supplying Prompt" />

## View your Prompt Logs

Navigate to the **Logs** tab of your Prompt.
You will be able to see the recorded inputs, messages and model generations.

## Next steps

* [Iterate and improve on your Prompts](../evals/comparing-prompts) in the Editor
* [Capture end-user feedback](../observability/capture-user-feedback) to monitor your model performance.


# Log to a Prompt

> Learn how to create a Prompt in Humanloop using the UI or SDK, version it, and use it to generate responses from your AI models. Prompt management is a key part of the Humanloop platform.

This guide will show you how to capture the [Logs](/docs/explanation/logs) of your LLM calls into Humanloop.

The easiest way to log LLM generations to Humanloop is to use the `Prompt.call()` method (see the guide on [Calling a Prompt](/docs/development/guides/call-prompt)). You will only need to supply prompt ID and the inputs needed by the prompt template, and the endpoint will handle fetching the latest template, making the LLM call and logging the result.

However, there may be scenarios that you wish to manage the LLM provider calls directly in your own code instead of relying on Humanloop. For example, you may be using an LLM provider that is not directly supported by Humanloop such as a custom self-hosted model, or you may want to avoid adding Humanloop to the critical path of the LLM API calls.

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop

  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python

    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

## Log data to your Prompt

To log LLM generations to Humanloop, you will need to make a call to the `/prompts/log` endpoint.

Note that you can either specify a version of the Prompt you are logging against - in which case you will need to take care that you are supplying the correct version ID and inputs. Or you can supply the full prompt and a new version will be created if it has not been seen before.

<Steps>
  ### Get your Prompt

  Fetch a Prompt from Humanloop by specifying the ID. You can ignore this step if your prompts are created dynamically in code.

  <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /prompts/:id" />

  <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /prompts/:id" />

# Store Prompts in code

> Learn how to pull Prompts and Agents from Humanloop to your local workspace and reference them in your code.

Humanloop allows you to store Prompt and Agent definitions in your local filesystem and in version control, while still leveraging Humanloop's prompt management
and evaluation capabilities. This guide will walk you through using local Files in your development workflow.

### Prerequisites

* A Humanloop account with at least one Prompt or Agent created
* Humanloop SDK installed (which includes the CLI functionality)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example Prompt for this guide">
    To follow along with the examples in this guide, create a Prompt named `welcome-email` in the root directory of your Humanloop workspace.

    We'll create a prompt that generates a welcome email for new customers. The Prompt uses the [Humanloop .prompt format](/docs/reference/serialized-files) which has two main parts:

    1. A configuration section (between --- marks) that specifies the model settings
    2. Message templates: a system message setting the context, and a user message with personalization variables

    Toggle the Prompt File editor by hitting **Cmd + Shift + E** (or **Ctrl + Shift + E** on Windows) and replace the existing content with the following:

    ```jsx title="welcome-email.prompt"
    ---
    model: gpt-4o
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 500
    top_p: 1.0
    presence_penalty: 0.0
    frequency_penalty: 0.0
    provider: openai
    endpoint: chat
    tools: []
    ---

    <system>
      You are an email assistant that creates friendly welcome emails for new customers. 
      Keep your tone warm and conversational while clearly explaining the key features of our product.
    </system>

    <user>
      Write a welcome email for {{customer_name}} who just signed up for our {{product_name}} service.
    </user>
    ```

    <Frame caption="Editing the welcome-email Prompt in the File editor">
      ![Deploying the welcome-email Prompt](file:76a662af-57f6-458f-a6a0-ec177c01e79e)
    </Frame>

    Save this new version of the Prompt by pressing **Manage**, then **Deploy...**, select your default environment (typically `production`) and follow the steps to deploy.

      ```bash Python for="Python"
      pip install humanloop
      ```

      ```bash TypeScript for="TypeScript"
      npm install humanloop
      ```
    </CodeBlocks>

    You'll also need your Humanloop API key, which you can find on the [API Keys page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) in your Organization settings.

    ```bash
    # Create a .env file in your project root
    echo "HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY>" > .env
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 1: Pull Files from Humanloop

After creating your Prompt in Humanloop (like the [example Prompt](#example-prompt-for-this-guide) we set up earlier),
you'll see it in your workspace:

<Frame caption="Example Prompt and other Files in Humanloop workspace">
  ![Example Prompt and other Files in the Humanloop workspace](file:9cb228cf-f145-475e-9898-2040e5b413c0)
</Frame>

Now you can pull this Prompt from Humanloop to your local environment by running:

<CodeBlocks>
  ```bash Python for="Python"
  humanloop pull
  ```

  ```bash TypeScript for="TypeScript"
  npx humanloop pull
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

This command clones your Humanloop workspace into a `humanloop` directory in your project root,
maintaining the same folder structure as your remote workspace.

<Frame caption="Pulling Files from Humanloop">
  ![Pulling Files from Humanloop](file:125e6d8d-576f-4b72-b521-aaa06e6effdc)
</Frame>

<Callout type="info">
  `humanloop pull` will pull all Files deployed to your default environment (typically `production`) and store them in the `humanloop` directory.
  To pull only specific Files, use a different environment, or change the local destination directory, check out the options in the help menu:

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash Python for="Python"
    humanloop pull --help
    ```

    ```bash TypeScript for="TypeScript"
    npx humanloop pull --help
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>
</Callout>

## Step 2: Use local Files in your code

Now that you have your Prompt locally, you can use it in your code by configuring the SDK to use local Files.

<CodeBlocks>
  ```python Python for="Python"
  from humanloop import Humanloop

  # Initialize the client with local File support
  humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key="YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY",
    # Enable using Files from the local filesystem
    use_local_files=True, 
  )

  # Call a local Prompt
  response = humanloop.prompts.call(
    path="welcome-email", # Looks for humanloop/welcome-email.prompt
    inputs={"customer_name": "Alex", "product_name": "Humanloop AI Platform"}
  )

  print(response.logs[0].output)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript for="TypeScript"
  import { Humanloop } from "humanloop";

  // Initialize the client with local File support
  const humanloop = new Humanloop({
    apiKey: "YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY",
    // Enable using Files from the local filesystem
    useLocalFiles: true,
  });

  // Call a local Prompt
  const response = await humanloop.prompts.call({
    path: "welcome-email", // Looks for humanloop/welcome-email.prompt
    inputs: { customer_name: "Alex", product_name: "Humanloop AI Platform" }
  });

  console.log(response.logs[0].output);
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

You can also log results from your own provider calls by referencing local Files:

<CodeBlocks>
  ```python Python
  # After making your own provider call, log the results with a local Prompt File
  humanloop.prompts.log(
    path="welcome-email",  # References the local File
    messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are an email assistant..."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a welcome email..."}
    ],
    output="The generated email content...",
    inputs={"customer_name": "Alex", "product_name": "Humanloop AI Platform"}
  )
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  // After making your own provider call, log the results with a local Prompt File
  await humanloop.prompts.log({
    path: "welcome-email",  // References the local File
    messages: [
      {role: "system", content: "You are an email assistant..."},
      {role: "user", content: "Write a welcome email..."}
    ],
    output: "The generated email content...",
    inputs: {customer_name: "Alex", product_name: "Humanloop AI Platform"}
  });
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

<Callout type="note">
  Important: When local Files are enabled and you reference a File using its path, the SDK will:

  * By default, look for Files in the `humanloop` directory (this can be customized with `local_files_directory`/`localFilesDirectory`)
  * Only look for Files in your local directory (there is no fallback to remote workspace)
  * Use the exact local definition, even if newer versions exist in your remote workspace
  * Make API calls to Humanloop to execute Prompts and log results
</Callout>

## Step 3: Verify local File usage

To verify that your code is actually using the local Prompt, you can make a small modification and observe the change in output.

1. Open `humanloop/welcome-email.prompt` in a text editor and modify the system message.

```diff title="humanloop/welcome-email.prompt"
<system>
-You are an email assistant that creates friendly welcome emails for new customers. Keep your tone warm and conversational while clearly explaining the key features of our product.
+You are an EXTREMELY ENTHUSIASTIC email assistant that creates friendly welcome emails for new customers. Use LOTS of emojis and exclamation points!! Keep your tone warm and conversational while clearly explaining the key features of our product.
</system>
```

2. Call the modified Prompt from your code:

<CodeBlocks>
  ```python Python
  response = humanloop.prompts.call(
    path="welcome-email",
    inputs={"customer_name": "Alex", "product_name": "Humanloop AI Platform"}
  )

  print(response.logs[0].output)
  # The response should now include enthusiastic language and emojis!
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  const response = await humanloop.prompts.call({
    path: "welcome-email",
    inputs: { customer_name: "Alex", product_name: "Humanloop AI Platform" }
  });

  console.log(response.logs[0].output);
  // The response should now include enthusiastic language and emojis!
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

You'll notice in the UI that a log was created with the new version of the Prompt.

<Frame caption="Log of the modified Prompt in the Humanloop UI">
  ![Calling a local Prompt](file:ca32d01c-5b78-4dba-b5ef-382ab745ebc0)
</Frame>

<Callout type="warning">
  When you call a modified local File, Humanloop uses content hashing to check for changes.
  If the content differs from an existing version, a new version is automatically created.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Version control

Now that your Prompt is a local File, you can add it to your version control system.

```bash
# Add the humanloop directory to your git repository
git add humanloop/
git commit -m "Add Humanloop Prompt"
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Once your Files are committed, you can track changes from Humanloop too.
  After modifying a Prompt in the Humanloop UI and deploying it, run `humanloop pull` to get the
  latest version, then use `git diff` to see what changed.
</Callout>

For example, if you update the model in your `welcome-email` Prompt from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-mini`
in the Humanloop UI and deploy it, after pulling the changes you would see:

<Frame caption="Git diff showing Prompt changes">
  ![Git diff showing Prompt changes](file:9b51e247-72b2-4181-9e27-cd00e7f1505c)
</Frame>

By integrating your Prompts and Agents with version control, you create a more robust development workflow:

* **Single source of truth** for both code and AI components
* **Change history** with full audit trail of who changed what and when
* **Local experimentation** through editing Files directly in your IDE without needing the Humanloop UI
* **Deployment safety** via pull requests and code reviews for Prompt changes

<Callout type="tip">
  **Using with Agents**

  Everything you've learned about working with Prompt Files also applies to Agent Files.
  The process is identical - pull from Humanloop, reference with the `path` parameter in `agents.call` and `agents.log` operations,
  and manage through version control.

  <CodeBlocks>
    ```python
    # Call a local Agent
    agent_response = humanloop.agents.call(
      path="customer-service/customer-support", # Looks for humanloop/customer-service/customer-support.agent
      messages=[
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "I need help with my order: 1234567890"
        }
      ]
    )

    # Access agent output
    print(agent_response.previous_agent_message)
    ```

    ```typescript
    // Call a local Agent
    const agentResponse = await humanloop.agents.call({
      path: "customer-service/customer-support", // Looks for humanloop/customer-service/customer-support.agent
      messages: [
        { 
          role: "user",
          content: "I need help with my order: 1234567890"
        }
      ]
    });

    console.log(agentResponse.previousAgentMessage);
    ```
  </CodeBlocks>
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while working with local Files, check these common solutions:

* **API key not detected?** Ensure it's stored in a `.env` file at the top level and that you run commands from your project root.
* **Changes not reflecting?** Ensure you've deployed your Prompt in the Humanloop UI after making changes.
* **SDK not finding files?** Ensure the directory used when pulling matches the one in your SDK initialization.
  (if you used `--local-files-directory custom-dir` when pulling, specify the same path in your SDK config for `local_files_directory`/`localFilesDirectory`).

## Next Steps

By integrating Humanloop Files into your development workflow, you've bridged the gap between AI development and software engineering practices, making it easier to build robust AI applications.

Now that you're using local Files, you might want to:

1. Set up [continuous integration](/docs/guides/evals/cicd-integration) to automatically test your Prompts and Agents when they change
2. Learn more about the [File formats](/docs/reference/serialized-files) to understand how to manually edit them if needed
3. Explore [environment labels](/docs/explanation/environments) to manage different versions for development, staging, and production


# Tool calling in Editor

> Learn how to use tool calling with your large language models in the Humanloop Prompt Editor.

Humanloop's Prompt Editor supports tool calling functionality, enabling models to interact with external systems.
This feature, equivalent to [OpenAI's function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) or [Anthropic's tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use),
is implemented through JSON Schema Tools in Humanloop. These Tools adhere to the widely-used JSON Schema syntax, providing a standardized way to define data structures.

Within the Editor, you can create inline JSON Schema Tools as part of your Prompt.
This capability allows you to establish a structured framework for the model's responses, enhancing control and predictability.

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

## Create an inline JSON Schema Tool

<Steps>
  ### **Open the Editor**

  Go to a Prompt and open the Editor.

  ### **Select a model that supports Tool Calling**

  <Info title="Models supporting Tool Calling">
    To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the [Models
    page](/docs/reference/models#models).
  </Info>

  In the Editor, you'll see an option to select the model. Choose a model like `gpt-4.1-nano` which supports Tool Calling.

  ### **Define the Tool**

  To get started with creating an inline tool, let's use one of our preloaded examples.

  Click on the **+ Tool** button in the bottom left of the Editor. Select **New inline tool...**.

  <img src="file:5d040d38-e0cd-4b81-8803-faeb303f6e58" />

  In the modal that appears, open the **Examples** dropdown and select the `get_current_weather` tool.

  <img src="file:e1ff16cb-9bd5-4596-bdfd-b0101cdfd56a" />

  If you choose to edit or create your own tool, you'll need to use the [JSON Schema syntax](https://json-schema.org/).
  When creating a custom tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code.
  The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.

  <img src="file:cef68402-369e-4183-b4f4-59b8256f7700" />
</Steps>

## Test the Tool

Now, let's test our Tool by inputting a relevant query. Since we're working with a weather-related tool, try typing: "What's the weather in Boston?"
This should prompt the model to respond using the parameters we've defined.

<Tip title="Tool calling is context-sensitive">
  Keep in mind that the model's use of the tool depends on the relevance of the user's input.
  For instance, a question like '*How are you today?*' is unlikely to trigger a weather-related tool call.
</Tip>

### **Check tool call**

Upon successful setup, the assistant should respond by invoking the tool, providing both the tool's name and the required data.
For our `get_current_weather` tool, the response might look like this:

<img src="file:c2dcb07e-c2c4-41a1-935f-56228ddc2cb2" />

### **Submit tool response**

You can also check how the Prompt would respond to a successful tool call.

Click on the **Add to Messages** button to move the assistant's response into the Messages section
for a subsequent call.

Then, you can paste in the exact response that the Tool would respond with into the **Output** section of the Tool call.
For prototyping purposes, you can also just simulate the response yourself. Provide in a mock response:

```json
{ "temperature": 65, "condition": "light rain", "unit": "fahrenheit" }
```

<img src="file:ea915e19-a067-41ea-9b3f-b6aad88f5875" />

Remember, the goal is to simulate the tool's output as if it were actually fetching real-time weather data.
This allows you to test and refine your prompt and tool interaction without needing to implement the actual weather API.

After entering the simulated tool response, click on the **Run** button to send the Tool's response to the AI model.

### **Review assistant response**

The assistant should now respond using the information provided in your simulated tool response.
For example, if you input that the weather in Boston was 65°F and light rain, the assistant might say:

`The current weather in Boston is light rain with a temperature of 65°F.`

This response demonstrates how the AI model incorporates the tool's output into its reply, providing a more contextual and data-driven answer.

<img src="file:96ee9ade-7147-43d4-8802-a1de2b5be5f5" />

### **Iterate and refine**

Feel free to experiment with different queries. This iterative process helps you fine-tune your Prompt and understand how the AI model interacts with the tool,
ultimately leading to more effective and accurate responses in your application.

### **Save your Prompt**

By saving your Prompt, you will create a new version that includes the inline tool.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use tool calling in the Humanloop Editor. This powerful feature allows you to test tool interactions, helping you create more dynamic and context-aware AI applications.

## Next steps

After you've created and tested your inline Tool, you might want to reuse it across multiple Prompts.
Humanloop allows you to link a Tool, making it easier to share and manage Tool definitions across multiple Prompts.

For more detailed instructions on how to link and manage Tools, check out our guide on [Linking a JSON Schema Tool](/docs/v5/guides/prompts/tool-calling-editor).


# Re-use snippets in Prompts

> Learn how to use the Snippet tool to manage common text snippets that you want to reuse across your different prompts.

The Snippet Tool supports managing common text 'snippets' that you want to reuse across your different prompts. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.

For example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.

Instead of needing to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited, you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.

## Create and use a Snippet Tool

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

To create and use a snippet tool, follow the following steps:

<Steps>
  ### Create a new Snippet Tool

  <img src="file:77141e1d-88e0-4f9c-835e-93362261f023" />

  ### Name the Tool

  Name it `assistant-personalities` and give it a description `Useful assistant personalities`.

  ### Add a key called "helpful-assistant"

  In the initial box add `helpful-assistant` and give it a value of `You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.`

  ### Add another key called "grumpy-assistant"

  Let's add another key-value pair, so press the **Add a key/value pair** button and add a new key of `grumpy-assistant` and give it a value of `You are a grumpy assistant. You rarely try to help people and if anyone asks your name is Freddy.`.

  <img src="file:45061bb5-36ee-4e17-8976-720a3eb1438d" />

  ### Save and Deploy your Tool.

  Press the **Save** button, and optionally enter a name and description for this new version. When presented with the deployment dialog, click the **Deploy** button and deploy to your *production* environment.

  <img src="file:2df8f9d4-1310-4abc-9417-8439839ab19a" />

  Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects.

  ### Navigate to the **Editor**

  Go to the Editor of your previously created file.

  ### Add `{{ assistant-personalities(key) }}` to your prompt

  Delete the existing prompt template and add `{{ assistant-personalities(key) }}` to your prompt.

  <Note title="Tool syntax: {{ tool-name(key) }}">
    Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the editor. Inside the curly brackets you put the tool name, e.g. `{{ my-tool-name(key) }}`.
  </Note>

  ### Enter the key as an input

  In the input area set the value to `helpful-assistant`. The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. When adding the tool an inputs field will appear in the top right of the editor where you can specify your `key`.

  ### Press the **Run** button

  Start a chat to see both the LLM's response and your previously defined key in the right panel.

  <img src="file:fd8bb3cb-ec5d-4c2b-a671-1d7c5378fa75" />

  ### Change the key to `grumpy-assistant`.

  <Warning title="The snippet preview updates after running the chat">
    To see the snippet content for a new key, you'll need to run the chat first.
    The preview will then update to show the corresponding text.
  </Warning>

  ### Play with the LLM

  Ask the LLM, `I'm a customer and need help solving this issue. Can you help?'`. You should see a grumpy response from "Freddy" now.

  If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: `{{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}`, so in this case it would be `{{ assistant-personalities("grumpy-assistant") }}`. Delete the `grumpy-assistant` field and add it into your chat template.

  ### **Save** your Prompt.

  If you're happy with your grumpy assistant, save this new version of your Prompt.
</Steps>

<img src="file:94ea0f65-91f7-4e4a-855c-17cbe45f793b" />

The Snippet tool is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a Snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync. Editing the values in your tool allows the changes to automatically propagate to the Prompts when you update them, as long as the key is the same.

<Warning title="Changing a snippet value can change a Prompt's behaviour">
  Since the values for a Snippet are saved on the Tool, not the Prompt, changing
  the values (or keys) defined in your Snippet tools can affect the Prompt's
  behaviour in way that won't be captured by the Prompt's version.

  This could be exactly what you intend, however caution should still be used make sure the
  changes are expected.
</Warning>


# Deploy to an environment

> Environments enable you to deploy model configurations and experiments, making them accessible via API, while also maintaining a streamlined production workflow.

[Environments](/docs/explanation/environments) are a tagging system for deploying Prompts. They enable you to deploy maintain a streamlined deployment workflow and keep track of different versions of Prompts.

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

To deploy a version to an environment:

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the **Dashboard** of your Prompt

  ### Click the dropdown menu of the environment.

  <img src="file:e2d458f0-3e64-4d08-ab37-0d21bccdace0" />

  ### Click the **Change deployment** button

  ### Select a version

  Choose the version you want to deploy from the list of available versions.

  <img src="file:ca70ee1c-b797-44bf-b4c4-1ac7d0903b04" />

  ### Click the **Deploy** button.
</Steps>


# Create a Directory

</Steps>

You have now successfully created a directory and moved a file into it. This organization can help you manage your AI applications more efficiently within Humanloop.


# Link a Tool for Function Calling

> Learn how to create a JSON Schema tool that can be reused across multiple Prompts.

It's possible to reuse tool definitions across multiple Prompts. You achieve this by having a Tool file that defines a JSON schema,
and linking them to your Prompts.

This guide will run through creating a `JSON Schema` Tool defining a `get_current_weather` function, and linking that to a Prompt.
You can repeat this linking for other Prompts (or Agents) if necessary.

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

## Creating a JSON Schema Tool

To create a reusable JSON Schema tool, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  ### Create a new Tool file

  Navigate to the homepage or sidebar and click the 'New File' button.

  ### Choose the JSON Schema Tool type

  From the available options, select **Json Schema** as the Tool type.

  <img src="file:ea970dfb-3e99-421d-9fea-0129e79e2b98" />

  After you create the Tool, you can edit the file name in the sidebar. Rename the file to "Weather tool".

  ### Define your tool's structure

  Paste the following JSON into the provided dialog to define your tool's structure:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "Location",
          "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
        },
        "unit": {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "Unit",
          "enum": [
            "celsius",
            "fahrenheit"
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "location",
        "unit"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  <img src="file:b5179556-6fed-46b6-a9a8-615488d91787" />

  If you choose to edit or create your own Tool, you'll need to use the [JSON Schema syntax](https://json-schema.org/).
  When creating a custom Tool, it should correspond to a function you have defined in your own code.
  The JSON Schema you define here specifies the parameters and structure you want the AI model to use when interacting with your function.

  ### Save Tool version

  Press the **Save** button to save this version of the Tool.

  <img src="file:ecb562ba-538e-4937-9332-199901b27656" />

  Click the **Deploy...** button to deploy the Tool to your production environment, following the steps in the dialog.

  <img src="file:1cd4e7c3-51ca-4937-bac7-479fb374e663" />

  <Warning title="Linked Tool changes can affect existing Prompts">
    When deploying a new version of your Tool, remember that the change may affect Prompts
    that link to it. Prompts that link to Tools will automatically use the default
    deployed version of the Tool.
    Be careful when making updates to not inadvertently change something you didn't intend.
  </Warning>
</Steps>

We now have a `get_current_weather` Tool that our Prompt can call.

## Link the Tool

<Steps>
  ### Open Prompt Editor

  Navigate to the **Editor** of a Prompt. Ensure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as `gpt-4.1-nano`.

  <Info title="Models supporting Tool Calling">
    To view the list of models that support Tool calling, see the [Models
    page](/docs/reference/models#models).
  </Info>

  ### Add Tool to the Prompt definition

  Click the **+ Tool** button in the bottom left of the Editor. Select the **Link File...** option,
  then select the `Weather tool` file you created earlier.

  <img src="file:94dca958-03fe-4aa8-96c7-7c3a839148a9" />

  <img src="file:c1f16d9e-ed21-4ef4-9553-5b672b990d27" />

  You should now see "Weather tool" in the list of Tools.

  <img src="file:8b714548-122f-4f8c-a0a2-ecfa9fbde5cb" />

  ### Run Prompt with Tool

  Now that your Tool is linked, you can start using it. In the panel on the right, add a User message with "What is the weather in London?".

  Press the **Run** button.

  You should see the **Assistant** respond with the tool call.

  <img src="file:ac161fd4-27e1-4ad6-87f5-4846f011f593" />

  Press the **Add to Messages** button so you can make a subsequent call to the Prompt with the tool call result,
  to see how the model uses the tool call.

  This will move the Assistant's messages, containing the tool call, to the Messages section.
  You should now also see an **Output** section within the tool call, allowing you to insert an answer.

  <img src="file:2e68aed2-60a8-4234-a0f6-d4a138eafe72" />

  Enter `22` into the Output section and press **Continue**.
  The model will respond with "The current temperature in London is 22°C."

  <img src="file:fae2f0f2-1e80-42fc-9dbc-f72ce1865d86" />

  ### Save the Prompt

  Now that you've linked a Tool to your Prompt, let's save it. Press the **Save** button and name this Prompt version `weather-model`.
</Steps>

You've now created a reusable Tool that can be used across multiple Prompts,
and linked it to a Prompt.
In this guide, we simulated the tool call by manually entering a value for temperature.
In a real scenario, your code would be responsible for handling the tool call and returning the result.

## Next steps

Try using Tools to extend your Agents' capabilities. For example, if you link a Python code Tool (a Runnable Tool),
Humanloop will automatically execute the Tool when it's called by an Agent.
Additionally, the Tool output will be saved as a Log.


# Monitor production Logs

> Learn how to create and use online Evaluators to observe the performance of your Prompts.

[Evaluators](/docs/explanation/evaluators#online-monitoring) on Humanloop enable you to continuously measure the performance of your Prompts in production.
Attach online Evaluators to your Prompts, and Humanloop will automatically run them on new Logs.
You can then track the performance of your Prompts over time.

## Prerequisites

* You have a Prompt receiving Logs. If not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/development/guides/create-prompt) guide first.
* You have an [online Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators#online-monitoring). The example "Factuality" Evaluator is an online Evaluator that comes pre-configured with your organization.

## Attach Evaluator to your Prompt

Attach the online Evaluator to your Prompt. Humanloop will automatically run the Evaluator on new Logs generated by your Prompt.

<Steps>
  ### Open the Prompt's monitoring dialog

  Go to your Prompt's dashboard. Click **Monitoring** in the top right to open the monitoring dialog.

  ![Dashboard showing Monitoring dialog](file:98ffbfcc-f147-4b00-a0e0-13417dc82955)

  ### Connect your Evaluator

  Click **Connect Evaluators** and select the Evaluator you created.

  ### Ensure "Auto-run" is enabled

  Ensure the "Auto-run" switch is enabled for the Evaluator. This will ensure the Evaluator runs automatically on new Logs.
</Steps>

## View Evaluator results

Humanloop will run the Evaluators on the new Logs as they are generated.

### Graphs over time

Evaluator results are summarized in the **Dashboard** tab. Here, Humanloop displays the average Evaluator results over time.
You can toggle the period and time resolution covered by the graphs to see how your Prompt has performed over time.

![Graphs on Dashboard showing the average Evaluator results over time.](file:93ce1477-19cc-4703-bfb7-c0ae6435be5d)

### Filtering Logs

To investigate specific Logs, go to the **Logs** tab. Here, you can see the Evaluator results for each Log generated by your Prompt.
The Evaluator you attached above will have a column in the Logs table showing the results of the Evaluator.

![The Logs table includes a column for each monitoring Evaluator.](file:00c60449-cde9-4668-b2fb-7b463181e256)

You can filter the Logs table by the Evaluator results. Click on the column header to sort the table by the Evaluator results.
For Evaluators with options (i.e. those with a return type of `select` or `multi_select`), you can filter the table by the applied options.

### Re-evaluating modified Logs

Monitoring evaluators re-run on patched Logs and on Flow or Agent Logs when new Logs are added to their trace. This ensures the judgments always reflect the state of the Log.

## Next steps

* Iterate on your Prompt based on the Evaluator results. You can open specific Logs in the Editor to tweak and test new Prompt versions.
* [Add Logs of interest to a Dataset](../evals/create-dataset-from-logs) to use in an Evaluation.


# Capture user feedback

> Learn how to record user feedback on your generated Prompt Logs using the Humanloop SDK.

### Prerequisites

* You already have a Prompt — if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/v4/guides/create-prompt) guide first.
* You have created a Human Evaluator. For this guide, we will use the "rating" example Evaluator automatically created for your organization.

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">
  First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

  Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

  1. Install the Humanloop SDK:

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    pip install humanloop
    ```

    ```typescript
    npm install humanloop
    ```
  </CodeBlock>

  2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).

  <CodeBlock>
    ```python
    from humanloop import Humanloop
    humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

    # Check that the authentication was successful
    print(humanloop.prompts.list())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

    const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

    // Check that the authentication was successful
    console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

## Configure feedback

To collect user feedback, connect a Human Evaluator to your Prompt. The Evaluator specifies the type of the feedback you want to collect.
See our guide on [creating Human Evaluators](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/evaluating-with-human-feedback) for more information.

<Info>
  You can use the example "rating" Evaluator that is automatically for you. This
  Evaluator allows users to apply a label of "good" or "bad", and is
  automatically connected to all new Prompts. If you choose to use this
  Evaluator, you can skip to the "Log feedback" section.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Setting up a Human Evaluator for feedback">
  Different use-cases and user interfaces may require different kinds of feedback that need to be mapped to the appropriate end user interaction.
  There are broadly 3 important kinds of feedback:

  1. **Explicit feedback**: these are purposeful actions to review the generations. For example, ‘thumbs up/down’ button presses.
  2. **Implicit feedback**: indirect actions taken by your users may signal whether the generation was good or bad, for example, whether the user ‘copied’ the generation, ‘saved it’ or ‘dismissed it’ (which is negative feedback).
  3. **Free-form feedback**: Corrections and explanations provided by the end-user on the generation.

  You should create Human Evaluators structured to capture the feedback you need.
  For example, a Human Evaluator with return type "text" can be used to capture free-form feedback, while a Human Evaluator with return type "multi\_select" can be used to capture user actions
  that provide implicit feedback.

  If you have not done so, you can follow our guide to [create a Human Evaluator](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/evaluating-with-human-feedback) to set up the appropriate feedback schema.
</Accordion>

<Steps>
  ### Open the Prompt's monitoring dialog

  Go to your Prompt's dashboard. Click **Monitoring** in the top right to open the monitoring dialog.

  ![Prompt dashboard showing Monitoring dialog](file:ef9130f0-b078-4292-b58d-4715daac49ae)

  ### Connect your Evaluator

  Click **Connect Evaluators** and select the Human Evaluator you created.

  ![Dialog connecting the "Tweet Issues" Evaluator as a Monitoring Evaluator](file:4b6b83c3-3c86-40e5-9b19-ade4e511ff00)
</Steps>

You should now see the selected Human Evaluator attached to the Prompt in the Monitoring dialog.

![Monitoring dialog showing the "Tweet Issues" Evaluator attached to the Prompt](file:a7be95f6-44f3-4573-9cd8-a14c7236495c)

## Log feedback

With the Human Evaluator attached to your Prompt, you can record feedback against the Prompt's Logs.

<Steps>
  ### Retrieve Log ID

  The ID of the Prompt Log can be found in the response of the `humanloop.prompts.call(...)` method.

  ```python
  log = humanloop.prompts.call(
      version_id="prv_qNeXZp9P6T7kdnMIBHIOV",
      path="persona",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What really happened at Roswell?"}],
      inputs={"person": "Trump"},
  )
  log_id = log.id
  ```

  ### Log the feedback

  Call `humanloop.evaluators.log(...)` referencing the above Log ID as `parent_id` to record user feedback.

  ```python
  feedback = humanloop.evaluators.log(
      # Pass the `log_id` from the previous step to indicate the Log to record feedback against
      parent_id=log_id,
      # Here, we're recording feedback against a "Tweet Issues" Human Evaluator,
      # which is of type `multi_select` and has multiple options to choose from.
      path="Feedback Demo/Tweet Issues",
      judgment=["Inappropriate", "Too many emojis"],
  )
  ```

  <Accordion title="More examples">
    The "rating" and "correction" Evaluators are attached to all Prompts by default.
    You can record feedback using these Evaluators as well.

    The "rating" Evaluator can be used to record explicit feedback (e.g. from a 👍/👎 button).

    ```python
    rating_log = humanloop.evaluators.log(
        parent_id=log_id,
        # We're recording feedback using the "rating" Human Evaluator,
        # which has 2 options: "good" and "bad".
        path="rating",
        judgment="good",

        # You can also include the source of the feedback when recording it with the `user` parameter.
        user="user_123",
    )
    ```

    The "correction" Evaluator can be used to record user-provided corrections to the generations (e.g. If the user edits the generation before copying it).

    ```python
    correction_log = humanloop.evaluators.log(
        parent_id=log_id,
        path="correction",
        judgment="NOTHING happened at Roswell, folks! Fake News media pushing ALIEN conspiracy theories. SAD! "
        + "I know Area 51, have the best aliens. Roswell? Total hoax! Believe me. 👽🚫 #Roswell #FakeNews",
    )
    ```

    If the user removes their feedback (e.g. if the user deselects a previous 👎 feedback), you can record this by passing `judgment=None`.

    ```python
    removed_rating_log = humanloop.evaluators.log(
        parent_id=log_id,
        path="rating",
        judgment=None,
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Steps>

## View feedback

You can view the applied feedback in two main ways: through the Logs that the feedback was applied to, and through the Evaluator itself.

### Feedback applied to Logs

The feedback recorded for each Log can be viewed in the **Logs** table of your Prompt.

![Logs table showing feedback applied to Logs](file:10159ce7-2b36-4136-9658-9b1accd20128)

Your internal users can also apply feedback to the Logs directly through the Humanloop app.

![Log drawer showing feedback section](file:0a5a8248-75f7-4db8-aa8b-dfe84a266e0e)

### Feedback for an Evaluator

You can view all feedback recorded for a specific Human Evaluator in the **Logs** tab of the Evaluator.
This will display all feedback recorded for the Evaluator across all other Files.

![Logs table for "Tweet Issues" Evaluator showing feedback](file:738774ab-773f-4777-acb1-7ac81c14fa3e)

## Next steps

* [Create and customize your own Human Evaluators](../evals/human-evaluators) to capture the feedback you need.
* Human Evaluators can also be used in Evaluations, allowing you to [collect judgments from your subject-matter experts](../evals/run-human-evaluation).


# Logging through API

> Add logging your AI project using the Humanloop API.

Our SDK offers high-level utilities for integrating Humanloop in your project. You can use the API to the same effect with any language you use or if you prefer more control.

This guide revisits our [logging quickstart tutorial](/docs/v5/quickstart/set-up-logging): we'll use API actions instead of the SDK decorators, showing you how Humanloop instrumentation works step-by-step.

By the end, we'll have a chat agent project integrated with Humanloop logging. The example uses the Python SDK, but the verbs map directly [to our API](/docs/v5/api-reference/sdks).

## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account setup">
    <p>
      Create a Humanloop Account

    If you haven't already, [create an account](https://app.humanloop.com/signup) or [log in](https://app.humanloop.com/login) to Humanloop

    <p>
      Add an OpenAI API Key
    </p>

    If you're the first person in your organization, you'll need to add an API key to a model provider.

    1. Go to OpenAI and [grab an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    2. In Humanloop [Organization Settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) set up OpenAI as a model provider.

    <Info>
      Using the Prompt Editor will use your OpenAI credits in the same way that the
      OpenAI playground does. Keep your API keys for Humanloop and the model
      providers private.

## Log to Humanloop

The agent works and is capable of function calling. However, we rely on inputs and outputs to reason about the behavior. Humanloop logging allows you to observe the steps taken by the agent, which we will demonstrate below.

<Steps>
  ### Initialize the trace

  Modify `call_model` to accept a `trace_id` argument. It will be used to associate [Logs](/docs/v5/explanations/logs) to the logging trace.

  The trace of the conversation will be associated with a [Flow](/docs/v5/explanations/flows). Initialize the trace at the start of the conversation.

Click the **QA Prompt** [Prompt](/docs/v5/explanation/prompts), select the **Dashboard** tab from the top of the page
and you should find a new version of the Prompt at the top of the list.

By changing the hyperparameters of the OpenAI call, you have tagged a new version of the Prompt.

## Next steps

Logging is the first step to observing your AI product. Read these guides to learn more about evals on Humanloop:

* Add [monitoring Evaluators](/docs/v5/guides/observability/monitoring) to evaluate Logs as they're made against a File.

* See evals in action in our [tutorial on evaluating an agent](/docs/v5/tutorials/agent-evaluation).


# Invite collaborators

> Inviting people to your organization allows them to interact with your Humanloop projects.

Inviting people to your organization allows them to interact with your Humanloop workspace:

* Teammates will be able to create new Prompts, Tools, Datasets and Evaluators.
* Developers will be able to get an API key to call, log and evaluate the Prompts via the SDK.
* Annotators may give feedback the Logs and provide the human reviews for Evaluations.

## Invite Users

To invite users to your organization:

<Steps>
  ### Go to your organization's **[Members page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/members)**

# Manage Environments

> Environments are a tagging system for deploying Prompts. They enable you to deploy maintain a streamlined deployment workflow and keep track of different versions of Prompts.

[Environments](/docs/explanation/environments) are a tagging system for deploying Prompts. They enable you to deploy maintain a streamlined deployment workflow and keep track of different versions of Prompts.

The default environment is your production environment. Everytime you fetch a Prompt, Tool, Dataset etc. without specifying an alternative environment or specific version, the version that is tagged with the default environment is returned.

## Create an environment

<Steps>
  ### Go to your [Environments](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments) tab in your Organization's settings.

  ### Click the '**+ Environment**' button to open the new environment dialog

  ### Assign a custom name to the environment

  We recommend something short. For example, you could use `staging`, `prod`, `qa`, `dev`, `testing`, etc. This name is be used to identify the environment in the UI and in the API.

  ### Click **Create**.
</Steps>

## Rename an environment

You can rename an environment to re-arrange your development workflows. Since each new file is automatically deployed to the default environment, which is production unless altered, it may make more sense to create a separate production environment and rename your current environments.

<Warning title="This may break production systems">
  Renaming the environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this
  change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  ### Go to environments page

  Go to your Organization's **[environments
  page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments)**.

  ### Identify the environment

  Find the environment you wish to rename.

  ### Click 'Rename'

  Click the three dots button on the right of its row to open its menu.
  Click **Rename**.
  A confirmation dialog will be displayed. Update the name and click **Rename**.

# Vercel AI SDK

> Learn about the ways you can use Humanloop with the Vercel AI SDK.

<img src="file:8ffa5f8a-e186-47d6-b8de-2524977b237d" />

## Observability integration

The Vercel AI SDK supports [tracing via OpenTelemetry](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/telemetry). You can export these traces to Humanloop by enabling telemetry and configuring the OpenTelemetry Exporter.

<Warning>
  The Vercel AI SDK tracing feature is experimental and subject to change. You
  must enable it with the `experimental_telemetry` parameter on each AI SDK
  function call that you want to trace.
</Warning>

Learn how to add tracing to your AI SDK application below.

### Metadata parameters

Humanloop's AI SDK OpenTelemetry Receiver will automatically extract the following metadata parameters from the `experimental_telemetry` metadata object:

* `humanloop.directoryPath`: **\[Required]** The path to the directory on Humanloop. Generation spans will create Logs for this Directory on Humanloop.
* `humanloop.traceId`: **\[Optional]** The ID of a Flow Log on Humanloop. Set this to group multiple calls to the AI SDK into a single Flow Log on Humanloop.

### Prerequisites

The following steps assume you're already using the AI SDK in your application. If not, follow [Vercel's quickstarts](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started) to get started.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Next.js">
    <Info>
      Versions of Next \< 15 must set `experimental.instrumentationHook` in `next.config.js`. Learn more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry).
    </Info>

    You can find an example Next.js application that uses the AI SDK to stream chat responses [here](https://sdk.vercel.ai/cookbook/next/stream-text-with-chat-prompt).

    <Steps>
      ### Set up OpenTelemetry

      Install dependencies.

      <CodeBlocks>
        ```bash title="npm" wordWrap
        npm install @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/instrumentation
        ```

        ```bash title="pnpm" wordWrap
        pnpm add @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/instrumentation
        ```

        ```bash title="yarn" wordWrap
        yarn add @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/api-logs @opentelemetry/instrumentation
        ```
      </CodeBlocks>

      Create a file called `instrumentation.ts` in your root or /src directory and add the following:

      ```typescript title="instrumentation.ts"
      import { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel';

      export function register() {
          registerOTel({
              serviceName: 'humanloop-vercel-ai-sdk'
          });
      }
      ```

      ### Configure OpenTelemetry

      Configure the [OpenTelemetry exporter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/) to forward logs to Humanloop.

      ```plaintext title=".env.local" wordWrap
      HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>

      # Configure the OpenTelemetry OTLP Exporter
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.humanloop.com/v5/import/otel
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="X-API-KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>" # Humanloop API key
      ```

      ### Trace AI SDK calls

      Now add the `experimental_telemetry` parameter to your AI SDK function calls to trace them.

      With a simple one-step generation, each call to `streamText` or `generateText` will be traced as a Prompt Log on Humanloop.

      ```typescript title="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight={7-12} maxLines={50}
      import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
      import { streamText } from 'ai';

      // Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
      export const maxDuration = 30;

      export async function POST(req: Request) {
          const { messages, id } = await req.json();

          const result = streamText({
              model: openai('gpt-4o'),
              messages,
              experimental_telemetry: {
                  isEnabled: true,
                  metadata: {
                      "humanloop.directoryPath": "path/to/directory",
                  },
              },
          });

          // Respond with the stream
          return result.toDataStreamResponse();
      }
      ```

      You can also group each step of a multi-step generation into a Flow by passing the `humanloopFlowPath` metadata value.

      ```typescript title="app/api/chat/route.ts" highlight={10-16} maxLines={50}
      import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
      import { streamText } from 'ai';

      // Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
      export const maxDuration = 30;

      export async function POST(req: Request) {
          const { messages, id } = await req.json();

          const result = streamText({
              model: openai('gpt-4o'),
              messages,
              maxSteps: 3,
              toolCallStreaming: true,
              system: "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the weather in a given city.",
              experimental_telemetry: {
                  isEnabled: true,
                  metadata: {
                      "humanloop.directoryPath": "path/to/directory",
                  }
              },
              tools: {
                  getWeatherInformation: {
                      description: 'show the weather in a given city to the user',
                      parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
                      execute: async ({}: { city: string }) => {
                          const weatherOptions = ['sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy', 'snowy', 'windy'];
                          return {
                          weather:
                              weatherOptions[Math.floor(Math.random() * weatherOptions.length)],
                          temperature: Math.floor(Math.random() * 50 - 10),
                          };
                      }
                  },
              },
          });

          // Respond with the stream
          return result.toDataStreamResponse();
      }
      ```
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Node.js">
    <Info>
      Node.js projects can use OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation to trace requests without manually instrumenting code. Learn more about Node.js auto-instrumentation [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/getting-started/nodejs).
    </Info>

    <Steps>
      ### Set up OpenTelemetry

      Install dependencies.

      <CodeBlocks>
        ```bash title="npm" wordWrap
        npm install dotenv @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
        ```

        ```bash title="pnpm" wordWrap
        pnpm add dotenv @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
        ```

        ```bash title="yarn" wordWrap
        yarn add dotenv @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
        ```
      </CodeBlocks>

      Add the following code to your file to initialize and clean up the OpenTelemetry SDK.

      <Info>
        Do not forget to call await sdk.shutdown() before your application shuts down in order to flush any remaining traces to Humanloop.
      </Info>

      ```typescript title="main.ts"
      import dotenv from 'dotenv';
      import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
      import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";

      dotenv.config();

      // Start the OpenTelemetry SDK
      const sdk = new NodeSDK({
          instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()]
      });

      sdk.start();

      async function main() {
          // ... Your code here ...

          await sdk.shutdown();
      }

      main().catch(console.error);
      ```

      ### Configure OpenTelemetry

      Configure the [OpenTelemetry exporter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/) to forward logs to Humanloop.

      ```plaintext title=".env.local" wordWrap
      HUMANLOOP_API_KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>

      # Configure the OpenTelemetry OTLP Exporter
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.humanloop.com/v5/import/otel
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="X-API-KEY=<YOUR_HUMANLOOP_KEY>" # Humanloop API key
      ```

      ### Trace AI SDK calls

      Now add the `experimental_telemetry` parameter to your AI SDK function calls to trace them.

      With a simple one-step generation, each call to `streamText` or `generateText` will be traced as a Prompt Log on Humanloop.

      ```typescript title="main.ts" highlight={9-14} maxLines={50}
      import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
      import { streamText } from 'ai';

      async function main() {
          // Example of a simple one-step generation
          const result = await streamText({
              model: openai('gpt-4o'),
              messages,
              experimental_telemetry: {
                  isEnabled: true,
                  metadata: {
                      "humanloop.directoryPath": "path/to/directory",
                  }
              }
          });
      }
      ```

      You can also group each step of a multi-step generation into a Flow by passing the `humanloopFlowPath` metadata value.

      ```typescript title="main.ts" highlight={12-18} maxLines={50}
      import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
      import { streamText } from 'ai';

      async function main() {
          // Example of a multi-step generation
          const result = await streamText({
              model: openai('gpt-4o'),
              messages,
              maxSteps: 3,
              toolCallStreaming: true,
              system: "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the weather in a given city.",
              experimental_telemetry: {
                  isEnabled: true,
                  metadata: {
                      "humanloop.directoryPath": "path/to/directory",
                  }
              },
              tools: {
                  getWeatherInformation: {
                      description: 'show the weather in a given city to the user',
                      parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
                      execute: async ({}: { city: string }) => {
                          const weatherOptions = ['sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy', 'snowy', 'windy'];
                          return {
                          weather:
                              weatherOptions[Math.floor(Math.random() * weatherOptions.length)],
                          temperature: Math.floor(Math.random() * 50 - 10),
                          };
                      }

# .prompt and .agent Files

> Humanloop File formats allow you to store File configurations alongside your source code. They are human-readable, version-control-friendly, and can be used directly in your applications via the SDK's path parameter.

<Frame caption="Humanloop File formats">
  <img src="file:7ee70281-7228-443e-a4ed-a0972e66c273" alt="File formats" />
</Frame>

Humanloop provides serialized File formats (`.prompt`, `.agent`) for storing Prompts and Agents as human-readable, version-control-friendly files.
These formats enable you to integrate your Prompts and Agents into standard software development workflows.

## File Types

Humanloop currently supports the following File formats:

* `.prompt` — Serialized representation of a [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts)
* `.agent` — Serialized representation of an [Agent](/docs/explanation/agents)

## Usage

The Humanloop SDK supports working with local Files in your codebase, enabling a code-first development approach.

<CodeBlocks>
  ```python title="Python"
  from humanloop import Humanloop

  # Initialize the client with local File support
  client = Humanloop(
    api_key="YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY",
    use_local_files=True # Enable using Files from the local filesystem
  )

  # Call a local Prompt by referencing its path
  response = client.prompts.call(
    path="welcome-email", # Looks for humanloop/welcome-email.prompt
    inputs={"customer_name": "John Doe", "product_name": "Humanloop"}
  )
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  import { Humanloop } from "humanloop";

  // Initialize the client with local File support
  const client = new Humanloop({
    apiKey: "YOUR_HUMANLOOP_API_KEY",
    useLocalFiles: true # Enable using Files from the local filesystem
  });

  // Call a local Prompt by referencing its path
  const response = await client.prompts.call({
    path: "welcome-email", // Looks for humanloop/welcome-email.prompt
    inputs: { customer_name: "John Doe", product_name: "Humanloop" }
  });
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

For detailed instructions on syncing and using local Files, see our [Store Prompts in code](/docs/development/guides/store-prompts-in-code) guide.

## Format Structure

Both `.prompt` and `.agent` files follow the same basic structure:

1. **YAML frontmatter section** (enclosed between `---`): Contains all configuration parameters including model selection,
   generation parameters, and tool definitions. The frontmatter defines how the Prompt or Agent will execute when called.
2. **JSX-inspired content section**: Contains the template content with a syntax similar to JSX. This includes system messages,
   user prompts, and variable placeholders using `{{variable_name}}` syntax.

The formats are nearly identical, with `.agent` files having just two additional parameters (`max_iterations` and `tools[].on_agent_call`) to control execution flow.

### Basic Format Example

```jsx
---
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: -1
provider: openai
endpoint: chat
tools: []
// Agent-specific parameters (only in .agent files):
// max_iterations: 5
// tools[].on_agent_call: "continue" or "stop"
---

<system>
  You are a friendly assistant.
</system>
```

<Callout type="info">
  Currently, we only support pulling these Files from Humanloop to your local environment.
  However, you can modify local Files and use them directly - when the SDK detects changes to a File,
  it automatically creates a new version for that path. Two-way synchronization is coming soon.
</Callout>

### Multi-modality and images

Images can be specified using nested `<image>` tags within a `<user>` message. To specify text alongside the image, use a `<text>` tag.

```jsx Image and Text
<user>
  <text>
    What is in this image?
  </text>
  <image url="https://example.com/image.jpg" />
</user>
```

<Callout type="note">
  Currently, the `url` attribute only supports remote URLs (`https://`). Local file paths are not supported yet, though we're exploring this capability for future releases.
</Callout>

### Tools, tool calls, and tool responses

Tools are specified in the YAML header as a JSON array. Both `.prompt` and `.agent` files can include tools,
though `.agent` files include additional configuration for tool execution control.

Assistant messages can contain either text or tool requests. For tool requests, use a `<tool>` tag within an `<assistant>`
tag with attributes `name` and `id`. The text wrapped in the `<tool>` tag should be a JSON-formatted string containing the tool call's arguments.

Tool responses can then be added with standalone `<tool>` tags after the `<assistant>` message,
using the same `name` and `id` to link the response to the request.

```jsx
---
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: -1
provider: openai
endpoint: chat
tools: [
  {
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {

        },
        "unit": {
          "type": "string",
          "name": "Unit",
          "enum": [
            "celsius",
            "fahrenheit"
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "location"
      ]
    }
  }
]
---

# Data Management

> Discover Humanloop's robust data management practices and state-of-the-art encryption methods ensuring maximum security and compliance for AI applications.

### Data Handling and Segregation

Separate environments are provisioned and maintained for development, quality assurance/user acceptance testing, and production to ensure data segregation at the environment level.

### Data Classification & Access Control

All platform data received from the user and data derived from user data is classified as sensitive. All platform audit and telemetry data that does not contain PII and reference to specific user data is classified as not sensitive.

By default, only authenticated users can see their own sensitive data. Data classified as not sensitive can be accessed by dedicated Humanloop support staff using a secure VPN connection to the private network of the VPC for the target environment. This access is for debugging issues and improving system performance. The Terms of Service define further details around data ownership and access on a case-by-case basis.

### Data Encryption and Security

#### Encryption

Humanloop follows best practices for data management and encryption. All data in transit is secured with TLS/SSL, and all data at rest is encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm. All encryption keys are managed using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) as part of the VPC definition.

### Infrastructure

All sensitive data is encrypted in transit. For Self-Hosted Cloud (VPC) environments, network traffic is also encrypted in transit and at rest to meet HIPAA requirements.

### Learn More

For more information on how Humanloop processes user data, visit our [Security & Compliance](https://trust.humanloop.com) page.

### Data Storage, Retention, and Recovery

All platform data is stored in a primary database server with multi-availability zone replication. Platform data is retained indefinitely and backed up daily in a secure and encrypted manner until a request is made by the contractual owners of that data to remove it, in accordance with GDPR guidelines.

Humanloop's Terms of Service define the contractual owner of the user data and data derived from the user data. A semi-automated disaster recovery process is in place to restore the database to a specified point-in-time backup as required.

### Data Breach Response

Any data breaches will be communicated to all impacted Humanloop users and partners within 24 hours, along with consequences and mitigations. Breaches will be dealt with in accordance with the Humanloop data breach response policy, which is tested annually.

### Data Portability and Return

Within 30 days post-contract termination, users can request the return of their data and derived data (as defined by the Terms of Service). Humanloop provides this data via downloadable files in comma-separated value (.csv) or .json formats.


# Access roles (RBACs)

> Learn about the different roles and permissions in Humanloop to help you with prompt and data management for large language models.

Everyone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).

A user can be one of the following rolws:

**Admin:** The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the Organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.

**Developer:** (Enterprise tier only) Can deploy Files, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.

**Member:** (Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save Files, run Evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.

# SSO and Authentication

> Learn about Single Sign-On (SSO) and authentication options for Humanloop

{/* WIP - for gartner /start */}

Humanloop offers authentication options to ensure secure access to your organization's resources. This guide covers our Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities and other authentication methods.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. Humanloop supports SSO integration with major identity providers, enhancing security and simplifying user management.

### Supported SSO Providers

* Google Workspace
* Okta
* Azure Active Directory
* OneLogin
* Custom SAML 2.0 providers

### Benefits of SSO

1. Enhanced security with centralized authentication
2. Simplified user management
3. Improved user experience with reduced password fatigue
4. Streamlined onboarding and offboarding processes

### Setting up SSO

To set up SSO for your organization:

1. Contact our sales team to enable SSO for your account
2. Choose your identity provider
3. Configure the connection between Humanloop and your identity provider
4. Test the SSO integration
5. Roll out to your users

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

For accounts not using SSO, we strongly recommend enabling Multi-Factor Authentication for an additional layer of security.

### MFA Options

* Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) apps
* SMS-based verification
* Hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey)

## API Authentication

For programmatic access to Humanloop, we use API keys. These should be kept secure and rotated regularly.

### Managing API Keys

* Generate API keys in your account settings
* Use environment variables to store API keys in your applications
* Implement key rotation policies for enhanced security

## User Provisioning and Deprovisioning

Humanloop supports automated user lifecycle management through our Directory Sync feature. This allows for:

* Automatic user creation based on directory group membership
* Real-time updates to user attributes and permissions
* Immediate deprovisioning when users are removed from directory groups

## Best Practices

1. Use SSO when possible for centralized access control
2. Enable MFA for all user accounts
3. Regularly audit user access and permissions
4. Implement the principle of least privilege
5. Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for all communications with Humanloop

For more information on setting up SSO or other authentication methods, please contact our support team or refer to our API documentation.

## Active Directory Sync

Humanloop supports Active Directory Sync for automated user provisioning and deprovisioning. This feature allows you to:

* Automatically create and update user accounts based on your Active Directory groups
* Sync user attributes and roles in real-time
* Instantly deprovision access when users are removed from AD groups
* Maintain consistent access control across your organization
* Reduce manual user management tasks and potential security risks

To set up Active Directory Sync:

1. Contact our sales team to enable this feature for your account
2. Configure the connection between Humanloop and your Active Directory
3. Map your AD groups to Humanloop roles and permissions
4. Test the sync process with a small group of users
5. Roll out to your entire organization

For more information on implementing Active Directory Sync, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@humanloop.com).

# Decorators Overview

> Overview of the decorator system in the Humanloop SDK


## Introduction

Humanloop provides a set of decorators that help you instrument your AI features with minimal code changes. These decorators automatically create and manage Logs on the Humanloop platform, enabling monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of your AI applications.

| Decorator | Purpose | Creates | Documentation |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `prompt` | Instrument LLM provider calls | Prompt Logs | [Learn more →](/docs/v5/sdk/decorators/prompt) |
| `tool` | Define function calling tools | Tool Logs | [Learn more →](/docs/v5/sdk/decorators/tool) |
| `flow` | Trace multi-step AI features | Flow Log with traces | [Learn more →](/docs/v5/sdk/decorators/flow) |

## Common Patterns

All decorators share these common characteristics:

- **Path-based organization**: Each decorator requires a `path` parameter that determines where the File and its Logs are stored in your Humanloop workspace.
- **Automatic versioning**: Changes to the decorated function or its parameters create new versions of the File.
- **Error handling**: Errors are caught and logged, making debugging easier.
- **Minimal code changes**: Decorate existing code and adopt the Humanloop SDK gradually.


# Flow Decorator

> Technical reference for the Flow decorator in the Humanloop SDK


## Overview

The Flow decorator creates and manages traces for your AI feature. When applied to a function, it:

- Creates a new trace on function invocation.
- Adds all Humanloop logging calls made inside the function to the trace.
- Completes the trace when the function exits.

<Info>
On Humanloop, a trace is the collection of Logs associated with a Flow Log.
</Info>

## Usage

The `flow` decorator will trace all downstream Humanloop logs, whether they are created by other decorators or SDK calls.


### Tracing Decorators

<CodeBlocks>

```python maxLines=50 wrapLines title="Python"

@hl_client.prompt(path="MyFeature/Call LLM"):
def call_llm(messages: List[ChatMessage]):
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=messages
    ).choices[0].message.content

@hl_client.flow(path="MyFeature/Process")
def process_input(inputs: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    # Logs created by the Prompt decorator are added to the trace
    return [
        call_llm([{"role": "user", "content": text}])
        for text in inputs
    ]
```

```typescript maxLines=50 wrapLines title="TypeScript"
const callLLM = hlClient.prompt({
    path: "MyFeature/Call LLM",
    callable: async (messages: ChatMessage[]): Promise<string> => {
        const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages
        });
        return response.choices[0].message.content;
    }
});

const processInput = hlClient.flow({
    path: "MyFeature/Process",
    callable: async (inputs: string[]): Promise<string[]> => {
        // Logs created by the Prompt decorator are added to the trace
        return inputs.map(async (text) => await callLLM([
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ]));
});
```

</CodeBlocks>

### Tracing SDK Calls

Logs created through the Humanloop SDK are added to the trace.

<CodeBlocks>

```python maxLines=50 title="Python" wrapLines
@hl_client.flow(path="MyFeature/Process")
def process_input(text: str) -> str:

# Prompt Decorator

> Technical reference for the Prompt decorator in the Humanloop SDK


## Overview

The Prompt decorator automatically instruments LLM provider calls and creates Prompt Logs on Humanloop. When applied to a function, it:
- Creates a new Log for each LLM provider call made within the decorated function.
- Versions the Prompt using hyperparameters of the provider call.

### Decorator Definition

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" language="python">
```python
@hl_client.prompt(
    # Required: path on Humanloop workspace for the Prompt
    path: str
)
def function(*args, **kwargs): ...
```

The decorated function will have the same signature as the original function.
</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">
```typescript
hlClient.prompt<I, O>({
    // Required: path on Humanloop workspace for the Prompt
    path: string,
    // Required: decorated function
    callable: I extends Record<string, unknown> & 
        { messages?: ChatMessage[] } ?
        (args: I) => O :
        () => O;
}) => Promise<O | undefined>
```

The decorated function is always async and has the same signature as the `callable` argument.

Callable's `args` must extend `Record<string, unknown>`. If a `messages` field is present in the `args`, it must have type `ChatMessage[]`.

The decorated function will not wrap the return value in a second Promise if the `callable` is also asynchronous.

<Warning>
You must pass the providers you want to auto-instrument to the HumanloopClient constructor. Otherwise, the decorated function will work, but no Logs will be created.

```typescript {6-7}
import { HumanloopClient } from "humanloop";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const hlClient = new HumanloopClient({
    apiKey: process.env.HL_API_KEY,
    // Pass the provider module here
    instrumentProviders: { OpenAI }
})

// You can now use the prompt decorator
```
</Warning>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | Path on Humanloop workspace for the Prompt |

### Usage

<CodeBlock>
```python
@hl_client.prompt(path="MyFeature/Process")
def process_input(text: str) -> str:
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": text}]
    ).choices[0].message.content
```

```typescript
const processInput = hlClient.prompt({
    path: "MyFeature/Process",
    callable: async (text: string): Promise<string> => {
        return openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: text }]
        }).choices[0].message.content;
    }
});
```
</CodeBlock>

## Behavior 

### Versioning

The hyperparameters of the LLM provider call are used to version the Prompt.

If the configuration changes, new Logs will be created under the new version of the the same Prompt.

The following parameters are considered for versioning the Prompt:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `model` | The LLM model identifier |
| `endpoint` | The API endpoint type |
| `provider` | The LLM provider (e.g., "openai", "anthropic") |
| `max_tokens` | Maximum tokens in completion |
| `temperature` | Sampling temperature |
| `top_p` | Nucleus sampling parameter |
| `presence_penalty` | Presence penalty for token selection |
| `frequency_penalty` | Frequency penalty for token selection |

### Log Creation

Each LLM provider call within the decorated function creates a Log with the following fields set:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" language="python">

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `inputs` | dict[str, Any] | Function arguments that aren't ChatMessage arrays |
| `messages` | ChatMessage[] | ChatMessage arrays passed to the LLM |
| `output_message` | ChatMessage | LLM response with role and content |
| `error` | string | Error message if the LLM call fails |
| `prompt_tokens` | int | Number of tokens in the prompt |
| `reasoning_tokens` | int | Number of tokens used in reasoning |
| `output_tokens` | int | Number of tokens in the completion |
| `finish_reason` | string | Reason the LLM stopped generating |
| `start_time` | datetime | When the LLM call started |
| `end_time` | datetime | When the LLM call completed |

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `inputs` | object | Function arguments that aren't ChatMessage arrays |
| `messages` | ChatMessage[] | ChatMessage arrays passed to the LLM |
| `output_message` | ChatMessage | LLM response with role and content |
| `error` | string | Error message if the LLM call fails |
| `prompt_tokens` | number | Number of tokens in the prompt |
| `reasoning_tokens` | number | Number of tokens used in reasoning |
| `output_tokens` | number | Number of tokens in the completion |
| `finish_reason` | string | Reason the LLM stopped generating |
| `start_time` | Date | When the LLM call started |
| `end_time` | Date | When the LLM call completed |

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Error Handling

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" language="python">
- LLM provider errors are caught and logged in the Log's `error` field. However, `HumanloopRuntimeError` is not caught and will be re-raised: they indicate wrong SDK or decorator usage.
- The decorated function propagates exceptions from the LLM provider.
</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">

- The decorated function propagates exceptions from the LLM provider.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

1. Multiple Logs will be created if you make multiple calls inside the decorated function. To avoid confusion, avoid calls with different providers or hyperparameters, as this will create multiple versions of the Prompt.
2. Calling `prompts.log()` or `prompts.call()` inside the decorated function works normally, with no interaction with the decorator. However, it indicates a misuse of the decorator, as they are alternatives for achieving the same result.
3. If you want to switch between providers with ease, use [`prompts.call()`](/docs/v5/api/prompts/call) with a `provider` parameter instead of the decorator.

## Related Documentation

Humanloop Prompts are more than the string passed to the LLM provider. They encapsulate LLM hyperparameters, associations to available tools, and can be templated. For more details, refer to our [Prompts explanation](/docs/v5/explanation/prompts).

## Behavior 

### Schema Definition

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" language="python">

In Python, the decorator automatically infers a JSON Schema from the source code, argument signature, and docstrings:

- Function name becomes the tool name
- Function docstring becomes the tool description
- Parameter type hints are converted to JSON Schema types
- Optional parameters (using `Optional[T]` or `T | None`) are marked as not required
- Return type is not included in the schema

Supported type hints:

| Python Type | JSON Schema Type |
|-------------|------------------|
| `str` | `"string"` |
| `int` | `"integer"` |
| `float` | `"number"` |
| `bool` | `"boolean"` |
| `list[T]` | `"array"` with items of type T |
| `dict[K, V]` | `"object"` with properties of types K and V |
| `tuple[T1, T2, ...]` | `"array"` with items of specific types |
| `Optional[T]` or `T \| None` | Type T with `"null"` added |
| `Union[T1, T2, ...]` | `"anyOf"` with types T1, T2, etc. |
| No type hint | `any` |

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" language="typescript">

In TypeScript, you must provide a JSON Schema in the `version` parameter:

```typescript
version: {
    function: {
        name: string;
        description: string;
        parameters: {
            type: "object";
            properties: Record<string, any>;
            required?: string[];
        };
    };
    attributes?: Record<string, any>;
    setup_values?: Record<string, any>;
}

# Run Evaluation

> Getting up and running with Humanloop is quick and easy. This guide will explain how to set up evaluations on Humanloop and use them to iteratively improve your applications.


The `evaluations.run()` function is a convenience function that allows you to trigger evaluations from code. It will create the evaluation, fetch the dataset, generate all the Logs and then run the evaluators on each log.

It supports evaluating arbitrary functions, Prompts stored on Humanloop, and Prompts defined in code.

## Parameters

You can see the source code for the `evaluations.run()` function in [Python](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-python/blob/master/src/humanloop/evals/run.py#L106) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-node/blob/master/src/evals/run.ts#L211).

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required={true}>
Name of the evaluation to help identify it
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="file" type="object" required={true}>
Configuration for what is being evaluated. The evaluation will be stored on this File.

<Accordion title='file'>
<ParamField path="path" type="string" required={true}>
Path to the evaluated File (a [Prompt](/docs/explanation/prompts), [Flow](/docs/explanation/flows), [Tool](/docs/explanation/tools), [Evaluator](/docs/explanation/evaluators) etc.) on Humanloop. If the File does not exist on Humanloop, it will be created.

Example: `My Agent` will create a `flow` file on Humanloop.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="enum">
`flow` (default), `prompt`, `tool`, `evaluator`

If the File does not exist on Humanloop, it will be created with this File type.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="version" type="object">
Pass in the details of the version of the File you want to evaluate.

For example, for a Flow you might pass in identifiers:

```json
{
  "git_hash": "1234567890",
  "identifier": "rag-with-pinecone"
}
```

Or for a Prompt you can pass in Prompt details and it will be called.

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "template": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant on the topic of {{topic}}."
    }
  ]

## Return Type

Returns an `EvaluationStats` object containing:

- run_stats: Array of statistics for each run
- progress: Summary of evaluation progress
- report: Detailed evaluation report
- status: Current status of evaluation

# Examples

## 1. Evaluating an Arbitrary Flow Function

To evaluate an arbitrary workflow you can pass in the `callable` parameter to the `file` object.

<CodeBlocks>

```python
def my_flow_function(messages):
    # Your custom logic here
    return "Response based on messages"

evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.run(
    name="Custom Flow Evaluation",
    type="flow",
    file={
        "path": "Custom/Flow",
        "callable": my_flow_function
    },
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"}
    ],
    dataset={
        "path": "Test/Dataset",
        "datapoints": [
            {
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "user", "content": "Test question 1"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

```typescript
const myFlowFunction = (messages: Message[]): string => {
  // Your custom logic here
  return "Response based on messages";
};

const evaluation = await humanloop.evaluations.run({
  name: "Custom Flow Evaluation",
  file: {
    path: "Custom/Flow",
    type: "flow",
    callable: myFlowFunction,
  },
  evaluators: [
    { path: "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity" },
    { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency" },
  ],
  dataset: {
    path: "Test/Dataset",
    datapoints: [
      {
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Test question 1" }],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

</CodeBlocks>

## 2. Evaluating a Prompt on Humanloop

To evaluate a Prompt stored on Humanloop you simply supply a `path` to the Prompt and a list of Evaluators.
<CodeBlocks>

```python
evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.run(
    name="Existing Prompt Evaluation",
    file={
        "path": "Existing/Prompt",
    },
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Cost"}
    ],
    dataset={
        "path": "Existing/Dataset"
    }
)
```

```typescript
const evaluation = await humanloop.evaluations.run({
  name: "Existing Prompt Evaluation",
  file: {
    path: "Existing/Prompt",
  },
  evaluators: [
    { path: "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity" },
    { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Cost" },
  ],
  dataset: {
    path: "Existing/Dataset",
  },
});
```

</CodeBlocks>

## 3. Evaluating a Prompt in Code

To evaluate a Prompt defined in code you can pass in the `model`, `template` and other Prompt parameters to the `file`'s `version` object.

<CodeBlocks>

```python
evaluation = humanloop.evaluations.run(
    name="Code Prompt Evaluation",
    file={
        "path": "Code/Prompt",
        "version": {
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "template": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant on the topic of {{topic}}."
                }
            ]
        },
    },
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity"},
        {"path": "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency"}
    ],
    dataset={
        "datapoints": [
            {
                "inputs": { "topic": "machine learning" },
                "messages": [ {"role": "user", "content": "What is machine learning?"} ],
                "target": { "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence..." }
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

```typescript
const evaluation = await humanloop.evaluations.run({
  name: "Code Prompt Evaluation",
  file: {
    path: "Code/Prompt",
    model: "gpt-4",
    template: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant on the topic of {{topic}}.",
      },
    ],
  },
  evaluators: [
    { path: "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity" },
    { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency" },
  ],
  dataset: {
    datapoints: [
      {
        inputs: { topic: "machine learning" },
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is machine learning?" }],
        target: {
          output: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence...",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

</CodeBlocks>

Each example demonstrates a different way to use the `evaluation.run` function. The function returns evaluation statistics that can be used to understand the performance of your LLM application according to the specified evaluators.

You can view the results of your evaluation in the Humanloop UI by navigating to the specified file path, or by checking the evaluation stats programmatically using the returned object's `report` field.


# API

The Humanloop API allows you to interact with Humanloop and model providers programmatically.

You can do this through HTTP requests from any language or via our official Python or TypeScript SDK.

<Accordion title="Install and initialize the SDK">

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section.

Open up your terminal and follow these steps:

1. Install the Humanloop SDK:
<CodeBlock>
```python
pip install humanloop
```

```typescript
npm install humanloop
```
</CodeBlock>

2. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (you can get it from the [Organization Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys)).
<CodeBlock>
```python
from humanloop import Humanloop
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR HUMANLOOP KEY>")

# Check that the authentication was successful
print(humanloop.prompts.list())
```

```typescript
import { HumanloopClient, Humanloop } from "humanloop";

const humanloop = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Check that the authentication was successful
console.log(await humanloop.prompts.list());
```
</CodeBlock>

</Accordion>


Guides and further details about key concepts can be found in [our docs](/docs/getting-started/overview).


# Log to a Prompt

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/prompts/log
Content-Type: application/json

Log to a Prompt.

You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target
an existing version of the Prompt. Otherwise, the default deployed version will be chosen.

Instead of targeting an existing version explicitly, you can instead pass in
Prompt details in the request body. In this case, we will check if the details correspond
to an existing version of the Prompt. If they do not, we will create a new version. This is helpful
in the case where you are storing or deriving your Prompt details in code.

# Call Prompt

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/prompts/call
Content-Type: application/json

Call a Prompt.

Calling a Prompt calls the model provider before logging
the request, responses and metadata to Humanloop.

You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target
an existing version of the Prompt. Otherwise the default deployed version will be chosen.

Instead of targeting an existing version explicitly, you can instead pass in
Prompt details in the request body. In this case, we will check if the details correspond
to an existing version of the Prompt. If they do not, we will create a new version. This is helpful
in the case where you are storing or deriving your Prompt details in code.

// Or you can manually iterate page-by-page
const page = await client.prompts.list({

# Upsert Prompt

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/prompts
Content-Type: application/json

Create a Prompt or update it with a new version if it already exists.

Prompts are identified by the `ID` or their `path`. The parameters (i.e. the prompt template, temperature, model etc.) determine the versions of the Prompt.

You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and describe your versions.
Version names must be unique within a Prompt - attempting to create a version with a name
that already exists will result in a 409 Conflict error.

# Log to an Agent

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/log
Content-Type: application/json

Create an Agent Log.

You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target
an existing version of the Agent. Otherwise, the default deployed version will be chosen.

If you create the Agent Log with a `log_status` of `incomplete`, you should later update it to `complete`
in order to trigger Evaluators.

# Call Agent

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/call
Content-Type: application/json

Call an Agent. The Agent will run on the Humanloop runtime and return a completed Agent Log.

If the Agent requires a tool call that cannot be ran by Humanloop, execution will halt. To continue,
pass the ID of the incomplete Log and the required tool call to the /agents/continue endpoint.

The agent will run for the maximum number of iterations, or until it encounters a stop condition,
according to its configuration.

You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target
an existing version of the Agent. Otherwise the default deployed version will be chosen.

Instead of targeting an existing version explicitly, you can instead pass in
Agent details in the request body. A new version is created if it does not match
any existing ones. This is helpful in the case where you are storing or deriving
your Agent details in code.

# Continue Agent Call

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/continue
Content-Type: application/json

Continue an incomplete Agent call.

This endpoint allows continuing an existing incomplete Agent call, by passing the tool call
requested by the Agent. The Agent will resume processing from where it left off.

The messages in the request will be appended to the original messages in the Log. You do not
have to provide the previous conversation history.

The original log must be in an incomplete state to be continued.

      summary: Continue Agent Call
      description: >-
        Continue an incomplete Agent call.


        This endpoint allows continuing an existing incomplete Agent call, by
        passing the tool call

        requested by the Agent. The Agent will resume processing from where it
        left off.


        The messages in the request will be appended to the original messages in
        the Log. You do not

        have to provide the previous conversation history.


        The original log must be in an incomplete state to be continued.

## SDK Code Examples

```python

client = Humanloop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", )
response = client.agents.list(size=1, )
for item in response:
    yield item
# alternatively, you can paginate page-by-page
for page in response.iter_pages():
    yield page

```

```typescript
import { HumanloopClient } from "humanloop";

const response = await client.agents.list({
    size: 1
});
for await (const item of response) {
    console.log(item);
}

// Or you can manually iterate page-by-page
const page = await client.agents.list({
    size: 1
});
while (page.hasNextPage()) {
    page = page.getNextPage();
}

# Upsert Agent

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents
Content-Type: application/json

Create an Agent or update it with a new version if it already exists.

Agents are identified by the `ID` or their `path`. The parameters (i.e. the template, temperature, model etc.) and
tools determine the versions of the Agent.

You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and describe your versions.
Version names must be unique within an Agent - attempting to create a version with a name
that already exists will result in a 409 Conflict error.

# Serialize

GET https://api.humanloop.com/v5/agents/{id}/serialize

Serialize an Agent to the .agent file format.

Useful for storing the Agent with your code in a version control system,
or for editing with an AI tool.

By default, the deployed version of the Agent is returned. Use the query parameters
`version_id` or `environment` to target a specific version of the Agent.

## SDK Code Examples

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop
client = Humanloop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", )
response = client.flows.list(size=1, )
for item in response:
    yield item
# alternatively, you can paginate page-by-page
for page in response.iter_pages():
    yield page

```

```typescript
import { HumanloopClient } from "humanloop";

const client = new HumanloopClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
const response = await client.flows.list({
    size: 1
});
for await (const item of response) {
    console.log(item);
}

// Or you can manually iterate page-by-page
const page = await client.flows.list({
    size: 1
});
while (page.hasNextPage()) {
    page = page.getNextPage();
}

```

```go
package main

# Upsert Flow

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/flows
Content-Type: application/json

Create or update a Flow.

Flows can also be identified by the `ID` or their `path`.

You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and describe your versions.
Version names must be unique within a Flow - attempting to create a version with a name
that already exists will result in a 409 Conflict error.

# Upsert Evaluator

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/evaluators
Content-Type: application/json

Create an Evaluator or update it with a new version if it already exists.

Evaluators are identified by the `ID` or their `path`. The spec provided determines the version of the Evaluator.

You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and describe your versions.
Version names must be unique within an Evaluator - attempting to create a version with a name
that already exists will result in a 409 Conflict error.

# Upsert Dataset

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/datasets
Content-Type: application/json

Create a Dataset or update it with a new version if it already exists.

Datasets are identified by the `ID` or their `path`. The datapoints determine the versions of the Dataset.

By default, the new Dataset version will be set to the list of Datapoints provided in
the request. You can also create a new version by adding or removing Datapoints from an existing version
by specifying `action` as `add` or `remove` respectively. In this case, you may specify
the `version_id` or `environment` query parameters to identify the existing version to base
the new version on. If neither is provided, the latest created version will be used.

You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and describe your versions.
Version names must be unique within a Dataset - attempting to create a version with a name
that already exists will result in a 409 Conflict error.

Humanloop also deduplicates Datapoints. If you try to add a Datapoint that already
exists, it will be ignored. If you intentionally want to add a duplicate Datapoint,
you can add a unique identifier to the Datapoint's inputs such as `{_dedupe_id: <unique ID>}`.

        Datasets are identified by the `ID` or their `path`. The datapoints
        determine the versions of the Dataset.


        By default, the new Dataset version will be set to the list of

        You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and

        Version names must be unique within a Dataset - attempting to create a

        Humanloop also deduplicates Datapoints. If you try to add a Datapoint

the Datapoints.
Use the List Datapoints endpoint (`GET /{id}/datapoints`) to efficiently
retrieve Datapoints for a large Dataset.

By default, the deployed version of the Dataset is returned. Use the query parameters
`version_id` or `environment` to target a specific version of the Dataset.

# Upload CSV

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/datasets/{id}/datapoints/csv
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Add Datapoints from a CSV file to a Dataset.

This will create a new version of the Dataset with the Datapoints from the CSV file.

If either `version_id` or `environment` is provided, the new version will be based on the specified version,
with the Datapoints from the CSV file added to the existing Datapoints in the version.
If neither `version_id` nor `environment` is provided, the new version will be based on the version
of the Dataset that is deployed to the default Environment.

You can optionally provide a name and description for the new version using `version_name`
and `version_description` parameters.

# Create Run

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/evaluations/{id}/runs
Content-Type: application/json

Create an Evaluation Run.

Optionally specify the Dataset and version to be evaluated.

Humanloop will automatically start generating Logs and running Evaluators where
`orchestrated=true`. If you are generating Logs yourself, you can set `orchestrated=false`
and then generate and submit the required Logs via the API.

If `dataset` and `version` are provided, you can set `use_existing_logs=True` to reuse existing Logs,
avoiding generating new Logs unnecessarily. Logs that are associated with the specified Version and have `source_datapoint_id`
referencing a datapoint in the specified Dataset will be associated with the Run.

To keep updated on the progress of the Run, you can poll the Run using
the `GET /evaluations/{id}/runs` endpoint and check its status.

# Call Tool

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/tools/call
Content-Type: application/json

Call a Tool.

Calling a Tool with inputs runs the tool's source code and logs the result and metadata to Humanloop.

You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target
an existing version of the Tool. Otherwise, the default deployed version will be chosen.

Instead of targeting an existing version explicitly, you can instead pass in
Tool details in the request body. In this case, we will check if the details correspond
to an existing version of the Tool. If they do not, we will create a new version. This is helpful
in the case where you are storing or deriving your Tool details in code.

# Log to a Tool

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/tools/log
Content-Type: application/json

Log to a Tool.

You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target
an existing version of the Tool. Otherwise the default deployed version will be chosen.

Instead of targeting an existing version explicitly, you can instead pass in
Tool details in the request body. In this case, we will check if the details correspond
to an existing version of the Tool, if not we will create a new version. This is helpful
in the case where you are storing or deriving your Tool details in code.

```python List tools
from humanloop import Humanloop
client = Humanloop(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", )
response = client.tools.list(size=1, )
for item in response:
    yield item
# alternatively, you can paginate page-by-page
for page in response.iter_pages():
    yield page

```

```typescript List tools

// Or you can manually iterate page-by-page
const page = await client.tools.list({
    size: 1
});
while (page.hasNextPage()) {
    page = page.getNextPage();
}

```

# Upsert Tool

POST https://api.humanloop.com/v5/tools
Content-Type: application/json

Create a Tool or update it with a new version if it already exists.

Tools are identified by the `ID` or their `path`. The name, description and parameters determine the versions of the Tool.

You can provide `version_name` and `version_description` to identify and describe your versions.
Version names must be unique within a Tool - attempting to create a version with a name
that already exists will result in a 409 Conflict error.

# alternatively, you can paginate page-by-page
for page in response.iter_pages():

```

```typescript List logs

// Or you can manually iterate page-by-page
const page = await client.logs.list({
    fileId: "file_123abc",
    size: 1
});
while (page.hasNextPage()) {
    page = page.getNextPage();

# May

## RAG with linked template tools

*May 22nd, 2025*

You can now call linked tools in your prompt templates. This allows you to combine your Tools,
Prompts and Agents to build more complex workflows. For example, by calling a linked Python code Tool
within a Prompt's template, you can build a powerful RAG system.

To start building with this feature, link a tool to your Prompt or Agent in the Editor.
This can be a Python code Tool, or even another Prompt or Agent.
Then, reference the tool in your prompt template using the `{{tool_name()}}` syntax.

<Frame caption="Referencing a `pinecone_search` tool in a prompt template">
  <img src="file:6c9d11af-9cb9-4816-864f-5e3aa455dea3" />
</Frame>

When you run this Prompt or Agent, Humanloop will automatically run the tool and insert its output
into the template at runtime. The tool's output is displayed in the Log drawer, allowing you to view
the tool's output and what was passed to the Prompt or Agent.

<Frame caption="Log drawer showing tool output">

## Support for Claude 4 models

*May 22nd, 2025*

Anthropic [just launched Claude 4](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4), and we've added support for Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus. Try them out in the Editor now!

<Frame caption="Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus models in Model Selection">

## Cross-Region inference support for AWS Bedrock

*May 20th, 2025*

We've added support for cross-Region inference for AWS Bedrock models.

Cross-Region inference automatically selects the optimal AWS Region within your geographic area to process inference requests.
This ensures higher availability and improved performance by dynamically routing traffic to the most responsive region.

<Frame caption="Running AWS Bedrock models with cross-Region inference in the Editor">
  <img src="file:5c5f8fad-908a-4093-9060-664389e8b526" />
</Frame>

```python highlight={8}
humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key=os.getenv("HUMANLOOP_API_KEY"),
)

response = humanloop.prompts.call_stream(
    id=os.getenv("PROMPT_ID"),
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's cross-Region inference?"}],
    prompt={"model": "us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0", "provider": "bedrock"}
)
```

How to use:

* **In the Prompt Editor**: Choose a model prefixed with us. or eu. (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0`) from the model selection dropdown.
* **In the SDK**: Set the `provider` field to `bedrock`, and use a model name prefixed with `us.` or `eu.` (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0`) in the `model` field.

<Callout>
  The `us.` prefix is used for models deployed in the US geographic area, while `eu.` is for models deployed in the EU geographic area. Note that not all models support cross-Region inference.

  See the [the full list of supported models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html) in AWS documentation.
</Callout>

To find out more about cross-Region inference, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html).

## Store Prompts in code

*May 19th, 2025*

We've added support for storing Prompt and Agent Files in your codebase, allowing you to maintain them alongside your application code.

<Frame caption="Local environment after running the `humanloop pull` command">
  ![Code editor showing Humanloop .prompt and .agent files stored in local environment](file:125e6d8d-576f-4b72-b521-aaa06e6effdc)
</Frame>

This release introduces a workflow to sync Prompts and Agents between Humanloop and your codebase:

**Pull Files to your local environment** using the CLI command `humanloop pull`,
available in our [Python](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/) and [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop) SDKs (TypeScript support coming soon).

**Reference Files from your local filesystem** by initializing the SDK with `use_local_files=True`,
then using the familiar `path` parameter to point to local Files instead of remote ones.

This feature bridges the gap between Humanloop's collaborative environment and developer workflows, enabling
teams to use familiar Git-based processes while maintaining the benefits of centralized Prompt and Agent management.

To get started, check out our guide on [storing Prompts in code](/docs/development/guides/store-prompts-in-code).

## More Intuitive Observability

*May 16th, 2025*

Previously, Evaluators (monitoring or those in Evaluation Runs) would be applied to a Log once at creation time.

Flow Logs were an exception to this rule: they are created upfront and used to trace other Logs created by your AI system. So you'd have to mark the Flow Log as `complete`, letting Humanloop know no more Logs would be added to its trace.

However, some usecases don't fit this workflow. For example, in an issue tracking system, a user may re-open an issue and continue the conversation, making it difficult to determine when the conversation is complete.

We've done away with the evaluate-once approach: Now, every time you modify a Log, Evaluators will be applied on it again. In the case of Flow Logs, every time you add a new Log to its trace, we re-apply the Evaluators and re-compute metrics such as latency.

Marking Flow Logs as `complete` is no longer required for evaluation, but completing one will still prevent the trace from being modified.

We believe the new approach makes for a more intuitive experience: observability should always reflect the latest state of the observed system.

## Link Files to Agents by environment

*May 10th, 2025*

You can now link tools to Agents by environment instead of by version.
This allows an Agent to automatically use the latest deployed version of another Agent, Prompt, or Tool,
ensuring the Agent's tools remain up-to-date with your workspace changes.

<Frame caption="Link a File to an Agent by environment">
  <img src="file:7fe7ea59-081c-4edc-b5f8-7b32592457c3" />
</Frame>

## Trace Logs in the Review Tab

*May 9th, 2025*

You can now select trace Logs within the Review tab when evaluating a Flow or Agent.

<Frame caption="Trace Logs in the Review Tab">
  ![Screenshot showing trace Logs](file:443efff6-3b17-4cb4-93e3-012a42ebaead)
</Frame>

This helps you dive deeper into each Log within the Trace, making it easier to understand how each step contributes to the final output.

To try it out, run an [Agent](/docs/v5/quickstart/agent-evals-in-ui) or [Flow](/docs/v5/tutorials/agent-evaluation-code) Evaluation and open the Review tab.

## Nested Agents

*May 8th, 2025*

Agents can now call other Agents as tools. This allows you to build more complex multi-step agentic workflows. To try it out, simply link the desired Agent file and version as a tool in the main Agent.

<Frame caption="Link an Agent as a tool in the Agent Editor.">
  <img src="file:a6adb9b8-fd52-42ab-b2ee-4f59d6ac8010" />
</Frame>

Logs generated by the nested Agent will be captured in the main Agent's trace.

<Frame caption="An example of the full trace of Logs when an Agent calls a nested Agent.">
  <img src="file:b6712203-36a1-4388-b611-b435767d2495" />
</Frame>

For an in-depth introduction on Agents, see our [Key Concepts documentation](/docs/v5/explanation/agents).
To get started with Agents, follow our [Agents quickstart guide](/docs/v5/quickstart/agent-evals-in-ui).

## Bedrock support for DeepSeek

*May 2nd, 2025*

We've added support for the DeepSeek R1 model through our AWS Bedrock integration.

<Frame caption="DeepSeek R1 through AWS Bedrock">
  ![Screenshot showing DeepSeek R1 through AWS Bedrock in Model Selection Dropdown](file:051e9168-ef05-410b-a784-1542249a08a4)
</Frame>

DeepSeek R1 model is now available as a cost-effective, high-performance alternative to proprietary reasoning models like Claude 3.7 or OpenAI's 03-mini.
To try it out, select the DeepSeek R1 model from the model selection dropdown in the Prompt Editor.


# April

## Agents (beta)

*April 29th, 2025*

<img src="file:5e4ce5f7-e9be-4f36-b2ad-9496aebc5580" />

We've added beta support for Agents, enabling you to build, version-control and run Agents directly in Humanloop.
A Humanloop Agent is a multi-step AI system that leverages an LLM, external information sources and tool calling to accomplish complex tasks automatically.
It comprises a main orchestrator LLM that utilizes tools to accomplish its task.

<Frame caption="An Agent takes an input and executes multiple steps, using tools to accomplish the task.">
  <video
    id="agent-demo-video"
    autoplay
    muted
    loop
    playsinline
    onCanPlay="this.muted=true"
    onCanPlayThrough={() => {
      // autoplay muted doesn't seem to work; need this workaround
      // https://stackoverflow.com/a/51189390
      const video = document.getElementById('agent-demo-video');
      video.muted = true;
      video.play();
    }}
  >
    <source src="file:6b491b62-b484-4d73-8da5-0741bda01de8" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Frame>

* Agent files are **[versioned](/docs/v5/explanation/agents#versioning)** the same way as our other Files (e.g. Prompts, Tools, etc.).
* Agents can **use function-calling** by linking Tools or Prompts.
* **Humanloop can run Agents**, automatically executing any called functions.
* The **[full trace of events](/docs/v5/explanation/agents#tracing)** when an Agent is called is captured and logged in Humanloop.
* Agents can be **[evaluated](/docs/v5/tutorials/evaluate-agent-in-ui)**.

For an in-depth introduction on Agents, see our [Key Concepts documentation](/docs/v5/explanation/agents).
To get started with Agents, follow our [Agents quickstart guide](/docs/v5/quickstart/agent-evals-in-ui).

## Tool Runtime

*April 25th, 2025*

We've added a new **Python Tool** to Humanloop, enabling you to define Tools with Python code that Humanloop can execute.
This allows you to build powerful Tools that can access external data sources or perform complex computations.
These Tools, which are run in Humanloop's [secure runtime environment](/docs/v5/reference/python-environment), are especially useful in extending the capabilities of Agents.

To create a Python tool, click **New File** in the sidebar or on the homepage. Select **Tool** and then **Python**.
You will be brought to the Tool Editor, which contains a pre-filled example Python function.

<Frame caption="Python Tool Editor">
  ![Screenshot showing the Python Tool Editor](file:fac8ed06-b4ae-4105-95f5-47ec626bc56d)
</Frame>

You can run the Tool in the Editor by entering the required parameters and clicking **Run**.

For more information on how to use Python Tools with Agents, follow our [Agent evaluation tutorial](/docs/v5/tutorials/evaluate-agent-in-ui),
which uses a Python Tool to fetch search results.

We've also taken the change to add some example Python Tools for you to try out; check them out in the [Library](http://app.humanloop.com/library).

## Support for Anthropic Thinking

*April 20th, 2025*

Humanloop now supports Anthropic's extended thinking feature in the UI and the API.

<img src="file:51cad215-ceb7-4a4c-906f-bd76976dfe98" alt="Anthropic thinking demo" />

`ChatMessage` objects used in [/prompts/call](/docs/v5/api/prompts/call) and [/prompts/log](/docs/v5/api/prompts/log) now have a `thinking` attribute that contains the reasoning blocks returned by Anthropic.

```json
{
  "output_message": {
    "content": "To solve this puzzle, I have to...",
    "name": null,
    "tool_call_id": null,
    "role": "assistant",
    "tool_calls": [],
    "thinking": [
      {
        "type": "thinking",
        "thinking": "This is a classic logic puzzle...",
        "signature": "ErUBCkYIAhgCIkAm6IONc7t3..."
      }
    ]
  },
}
```

To try it out, [set your Anthropic key](http://app.humanloop.com/account/organization), head to the Playground, choose a model from the sonnet-3.7 family, and enable the **Reasoning effort** parameter.

For more details, check out the [Anthropic docs on extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/extended-thinking).

# January

## o3-mini now available

*January 31st, 2025*

o3-mini is now available on Humanloop.

The OpenAI 'o' model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought, providing advanced reasoning capabilities and improved safety and robustness. The o3-mini model brings state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks, and excels in areas of STEM such as math and coding.

![o3-mini excels in coding](file:8c663a96-2362-4014-9d6d-96dee3f6549b)

o3 has 200,000 token context length, with 100,000 output tokens and it can show superior performance to o1, but for 9x cheaper and 4x faster.

To try it, update your model parameter to `o3-mini` in the Prompt Editor.

## Filter by Evaluator error in Review tab

*January 31st, 2025*

You can now filter Logs by whether an Evaluator errored in the Review tab of an Evaluation. This feature allows you to quickly retrieve Logs with errored judgments for debugging, or only consider judgments that did not error while reviewing.

![Judgment filters](file:94c84510-d01b-4706-9939-7775478713f8)

To filter Logs, click on the **Filter** button on the Review tab to set up your first filter.

## DeepSeek Integration Available

*January 29th, 2025*

We've added support for the DeepSeek API to Humanloop -- now you can use DeepSeek V3 and R1 (non-distilled) directly!

Add your API key to your organization's [API Keys page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys) to get started.

<Frame caption="Set up your DeepSeek API key">
  ![Screenshot showing DeepSeek API key setup
  model](file:089f5ade-2a3a-4a29-a867-24ee5003312e)
</Frame>

Note on usage:

* DeepSeek's API ([status](https://status.deepseek.com/)) has suffered from degraded performance over the past few days, so requests may fail or take longer than expected.
* [DeepSeek R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/reasoning_model) does not support temperature control, top p, presence penalty, or frequence penalty. `max_tokens` will default to 4K, and the API supports up to 64K context length.
* This provider's servers are located in China.

## DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B on Groq

*January 27th, 2025*

You can now access DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B on Humanloop. Note that this model is a preview model on Groq and may be discontinued at short notice. As such, it should not be used in production environments.

To try it, update your model parameter to `deepseek-r1-distill-11ama-70b`.

<Frame caption="DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B Parameters">
  ![Screenshot showing parameters for the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B
  model](file:20519493-043b-45fc-9bf7-b7d92c8b78c0)
</Frame>

The DeepSeek team [recommends](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B#usage-recommendations) using the R1 models in the following way:

> 1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.
> 2. Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.
> 3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."
> 4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.

## Duplicate Datapoints

*January 23rd, 2025*

You can now duplicate Datapoints from the UI Editor. This is useful if creating lots of variations of an existing Datapoint.

<Frame caption="Duplicate datapoint in Editor">
  ![File library](file:191a0732-fdc8-486b-850d-134993a0d3b0)
</Frame>

Alternatively, you can use the [.csv upload](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/guides/evals/upload-dataset-csv) feature to create multiple Datapoints at once.

## Aggregate stats for Eval Runs

*January 18th, 2025*

We've added aggregate statistics to the **Runs** table to help you quickly compare performance across different Evaluators.
You can view these statistics in the **Runs** tab of any Evaluation that contains Evaluators.

For boolean Evaluators, we show the percentage of `true` judgments. For number Evaluators, we display the average value.
For select and multi-select Evaluators, we display a bar chart showing the distribution of the judgments.

<Frame caption="Run stats">
  ![Run stats with a tooltip showing breakdown for an Issues
  Evaluator](file:3fc95bc9-105f-46c4-9c2b-b3d17ecc6090)
</Frame>

Additional icons indicate the status of the Run, relevant to the aggregate stat:

* A spinning icon indicates that not all Logs have judgments, and the Run is currently being executed. The displayed aggregate statistic may not be final.
* A clock icon shows that not all Logs have judgments, though the Run is not currently being executed
* A red warning icon indicates errors when running the Evaluator

Hover over these icons or aggregate statistics to view more details in the tooltip, such as the number of judgments and the number of errors (if any).

## Filter Eval Runs

*January 14th, 2025*

You can now more easily compare your relevant Runs by selecting them in the **Runs** tab.

To filter to a subset of Runs, go to the **Runs** tab and select them by clicking the checkbox or by pressing `x` with your cursor on the row.
Then, go to the **Stats** or **Review** tab to see the comparison between the selected Runs. Your control Run will always be included in the comparison.

</Frame>

## Filter by Judgement in Review tab

*January 9th, 2025*

You can now filter Logs by Evaluator judgments in the Review tab of an Evaluation. This feature allows you to quickly retrieve specific Logs, such as those marked as "Good" or "Bad" by a subject-matter expert, or those with latency below a certain threshold.

![Judgment filters](file:a1727289-5559-49e5-9644-2c3f5def5db4)

To filter Logs, click on the **Filter** button on the Review tab to set up your first filter.

## Template Library

*January 4th, 2025*

We’ve introduced the first version of our Template Library, designed to help you get started with example projects on Humanloop.

This new feature allows you to browse and search for relevant templates using tags. You can then clone templates into your workspace to help overcome the cold-start problem.

<Frame caption="Template Library">
  ![File library](file:d19f9faf-425e-411a-b542-10efa091b821)

This first release focuses on providing useful Evaluator examples alongside a set of curated datasets from Hugging Face.
In upcoming releases, we plan to expand the library with additional Agent and RAG templates for a wide range of use cases. Stay tuned for more updates!


# December

## Improved TypeScript SDK Evals

*December 18th, 2024*

We've enhanced our TypeScript SDK with an evaluation utility, similar to our [Python SDK](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/changelog/2024/10#evaluations-sdk-improvements).

The utility can run evaluations on either your runtime or Humanloop's. To use your local runtime, you need to provide:

* A callable function that takes your inputs/ messages
* A Dataset of inputs/ messages to evaluate the function against
* A set of Evaluators to use to provide judgments on the outputs of your function

Here's how our [evals in code guide](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/quickstart/evals-in-code) looks in the new TypeScript SDK:

```typescript maxLines=50

import { Humanloop } from "humanloop";

// Get API key at https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys
const hl = new Humanloop({
  apiKey: "<YOUR HUMANLOOP API KEY>",
});


const checks = hl.evaluations.run({
  name: "Initial Test",
  file: {
    path: "Scifi/App",
    callable: (messages: { role: string; content: string }[]) => {
      // Replace with your AI model logic
      const lastMessageContent = messages[messages.length - 1].content.toLowerCase();
      return lastMessageContent === "hal"
        ? "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
        : "Beep boop!";
    },
  },
  dataset: {
    path: "Scifi/Tests",
    // Replace with your own dataset
    datapoints: [
      {
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are an AI that responds like famous sci-fi AIs." },
          { role: "user", content: "HAL" },
        ],
        target: {
          output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.",
        },
      },
      {
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are an AI that responds like famous sci-fi AIs." },
          { role: "user", content: "R2D2" },
        ],
        target: {
          output: "Beep boop beep!",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  // Replace with your own Evaluators
  evaluators: [
    { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Exact match" },
    { path: "Example Evaluators/Code/Latency" },
    { path: "Example Evaluators/AI/Semantic similarity" },
  ],
});

console.log("Evaluation checks:", checks);
```

## SDK Decorators in Typescript \[beta]

*December 17th, 2024*

We're excited to announce the beta release of our [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop/v/0.8.9-beta5), aligning with the Python logging utilities we introduced [last month](/docs/changelog/2024/11#logging-with-decorators).

The new utilities help you integrate Humanloop with minimal changes to your existing code base.

Take this basic chat agent instrumented through Humanloop:

```typescript maxLines=50
const callModel = (traceId: string, messages: MessageType[]) => {
  const response = await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    temperature: 0.8,
    messages: messages,
  });

  const output = response.choices[0].message.content || "";

  await humanloop.prompts.log({
    path: "Chat Agent/Call Model",
    prompt: {
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages: [...messages, { role: "assistant", content: output }],
      temperature: 0.8,
    },
    traceParentId: traceId,
  })

  return output;
}

const chatAgent = () => {
  const traceId = humanloop.flows.log(
    path: "Chat Agent/Agent",
    
  ).id
  const messages = [{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." }];
  
  while (true) {
    const userMessage = await getCLIInput();
    
    if (userMessage === "exit") {
      break;
    }
    
    messages.push({ role: "user", content: userMessage });
    const response = await callModel(traceId, messages);
    messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: response });
  }
  
  humanloop.flows.updateLog(
    traceId,
    { traceStatus: "complete", messages: messages }
  )
}
```

Using the new logging utilities, the SDK will automatically manage the Files and logging for you. Through them you can integrate Humanloop to your project with less changes to your existing codebase.

Calling a function wrapped in an utility will create a Log on Humanloop. Furthermore, the SDK will detect changes to the LLM hyperparameters and create a new version automatically.

The code below is equivalent to the previous example:

```typescript maxLines=50
const callModel = (messages: MessageType[]) =>
  humanloop.prompt({
    path: "Chat Agent/Call Model",
    callable: async (inputs: any, messages: MessageType[]) => {
      const response = await openAIClient.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        temperature: 0.8,
        messages: messages,
      });

      return response.choices[0].message.content || "";
    },
  })(undefined, messages);

const chatAgent = () =>
  humanloop.flow({
    path: "Chat Agent/Agent",
    callable: async (inputs: any, messages: MessageType[]) => {
      const messages = [{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." }];
      
      while (true) {
        const userMessage = await getCLIInput();
        
        if (userMessage === "exit") {
          break;
        }
        
        messages.push({ role: "user", content: userMessage });
        const response = await callModel(messages);
        messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: response });
      }
      
      return messages;
    },
  })(undefined, []);
```

This release introduces three decorators:

* **`flow()`**: Serves as the entry point for your AI features. Use it to call other decorated functions and trace your feature's execution.

* **`prompt()`**: Monitors LLM client library calls to version your Prompt Files. Supports **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Replicate** clients. Changing the provider or hyperparameters creates a new version in Humanloop.

* **`tool()`**: Versions tools using their source code. Includes a `jsonSchema` decorated to streamline function calling.

## Function-calling AI Evaluators

*December 15th, 2024*

We've updated our AI Evaluators to use function calling by default, improving their reliability and performance.
We've also updated the AI Evaluator Editor to support this change.

![AI Evaluator Editor with function calling](file:9520e7dd-07d6-46cb-99c3-5c0a9d8e616c)

New AI Evaluators will now use function calling by default.
When you create an AI Evaluator in Humanloop, you will now create an AI Evaluator with a `submit_judgment(judgment, reasoning)` tool that takes `judgment` and `reasoning` as arguments.
When you run this Evaluator on a Log, Humanloop will force the model to call the tool. The model will then return an appropriate judgment alongside its reasoning.

You can customize the AI Evaluator in its Editor tab. Here, Humanloop displays a "Parameters" and a "Template" section, similar to the Prompt Editor,
allowing you to define the messages and parameters used to call the model.
In the "Judgment" section below those, you can customize the function descriptions and disable the `reasoning` argument.

To test the AI Evaluator, you can load Logs from a Prompt with the **Select a Prompt or Dataset** button in the **Debug console** panel.
After Logs are loaded, click the **Run** button to run the AI Evaluator on the Logs. The resulting judgments will be shown beside the Logs.
If reasoning is enabled, you can view the reasoning by hovering over the judgment or by clicking the **Open in drawer** button next to the judgment.

## New models: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3 70B

*December 12th, 2024*

To support you in adopting the latest models, we've added support for more new models, including the [latest experimental models for Gemini](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/the-next-chapter-of-the-gemini-era-for-developers/).

These include `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` with better performance than Gemini 1.5 Pro and tool use, and [`gemini-exp-1206`](https://blog.google/feed/gemini-exp-1206/), the latest experimental advanced model.

We've also added support for [Llama 3.3 70B](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_3/MODEL_CARD.md) on Groq, Meta's latest model with performance comparable to their largest Llama 3.1 405B model.

You can start using these models in your Prompts by going to the Editor and selecting the model from the dropdown.
(To use the Gemini models, you need to have a Google API key saved in your Humanloop [account settings](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-demo/account/api-keys).)

## Drag and Drop in the Sidebar

*December 9th, 2024*

You can now drag and drop files into the sidebar to organize your Prompts, Evaluators, Datasets, and Flows into Directories.

With this much requested feature, you can easily reorganize your workspace hierarchy without having to use the 'Move...' modals.

This improvement makes it easier to maintain a clean and organized workspace. We recommend using a Directory per project to group together related files.

## Logs with user-defined IDs

*December 6th, 2024*

We’ve added the ability to create Logs with your own unique ID, which you can then use to reference the Log when making API calls to Humanloop.

```python highlight={19}
my_id = "my_very_own_and_unique_id"
# create Log with "my_very_own_and_unique_id" id
humanloop.prompts.call(
    path="path_to_the_prompt",
    prompt={
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "template": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth",
        },
      ],
    },
    log_id=my_id,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Is it acceptable to put pineapples on pizza?"}],
)
# add evaluator judgment to this Log using your own id
humanloop.evaluators.log(
    parent_id=my_id,
    path="path_to_my_evaluator",
    judgment="good",
    spec={
      "arguments_type": "target_free",
      "return_type": "select",
      "evaluator_type": "human",
      "options": [{"name": "bad", "valence": "negative"}, {"name": "good", "valence": "positive"}]
    })
```

This is particularly useful for providing judgments on the Logs without requiring you to store Humanloop-generated IDs in your application.

## Flow Trace in Review View

*December 3rd, 2024*

We've added the ability to see the full Flow trace directly in the Review view.
This is useful to get the full context of what was called during the execution of a Flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="file:816cf7d5-2e10-45ca-8e45-32148dd2cec6" />

# November

## Logging with Decorators

*November 16th, 2024*

We've released a new version of our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/0.8.14b5/) in beta that includes a suite of
decorators that allow you to more seamlessly add Humanloop logging to your existing AI features.

By adding the new decorators like `@flow` or `@prompt` to your existing functions, the next time your code runs, Humanloop will start to version and monitor your application.

In this release, we're introducing decorators for Prompts, Tools, and Flows:

* `@prompt`: Automatically creates a Prompt on Humanloop and tracks your LLM provider calls; with details like provider and any hyperparameters. This decorator supports **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Replicate**, **Cohere**, and **Bedrock** clients. Changing the LLM provider, or the hyperparameters used, will automatically bump the Prompt version on Humanloop.

* `@tool`: Uses the function's signature and docstring to create and version a Tool. Changing the code of the function will create a new version of the Tool and any calls to the Tool will be logged appropriately.

* `@flow`: Designed for the main entry point of your LLM feature to capture all the steps within. Any other decorated functions called within the `@flow` are automatically logged into its trace.

You can also explicitly pass values for decorator arguments; including `attributes` and `metadata`. Values passed explicitly to the decorator will override any inference made by the SDK when logging to Humanloop.

Here's an example of how to instrument a basic chat agent. Each conversation creates a Log under a `Flow`, with `Prompt` and `Tool` Logs then captured for each interaction.

```python
import random
import os
import json
from openai import OpenAI
from humanloop import Humanloop


PROMPT_TEMPLATE = (
  "You are a helpful assistant knowledgeable on the "
    "following topics: {topics}. When you reply you "
    "should use the following tone of voice: {tone}"
)

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY"))
hl = Humanloop(api_key=os.getenv("HUMANLOOP_KEY"))

@hl.tool(path="Science Chatbot/Calculator")
def calculator(operation: str, num1: int, num2: int) -> str:
    """Do arithmetic operations on two numbers."""
    if operation == "add":
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == "divide":
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Invalid operation")


@hl.tool(path="Science Chatbot/Random Number")
def pick_random_number():
    """Pick a random number between 1 and 100."""
    return random.randint(1, 100)


@hl.prompt(
    path="Science Chatbot/Agent Prompt",
    template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
    tools=[
        pick_random_number.json_schema,
        calculator.json_schema,
    ],
)
def call_agent(messages: list[dict[str, str]]) -> str:
    output = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=messages,
        tools=[
            {
                "type": "function",
                # @tool decorated functions have a json_schema defined
                "function": calculator.json_schema,
            },
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function": pick_random_number.json_schema,
            },
        ],
        temperature=0.8,
    )

    # Check if tool calls are present in the output
    if output.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
        for tool_call in output.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
            arguments = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
            if tool_call.function.name == "calculator":
                result = calculator(**arguments)
            elif tool_call.function.name == "pick_random_number":
                result = pick_random_number(**arguments)
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError("Invalid tool call")

            return f"[TOOL CALL] {result}"

    return output.choices[0].message.content


@hl.flow(path="Science Chatbot/Agent Flow", attributes={"version": "0.0.1"})
def chat():
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": hl.prompts.populate_template(
                template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
                inputs={
                    "topics": "science",
                    "tone": "cool surfer dude",
                }
            ),
        },
    ]
    input_output_pairs = []
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        input_output = [user_input]
        if user_input == "exit":
            break
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        response = call_agent(messages=messages)
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": str(response)})
        input_output.append(str(response))
        print(f"Agent: {response}")
        input_output_pairs.append(input_output)
    return json.dumps(input_output_pairs)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    chat()

```

After running this code, the full trace of the agent will be visible on Humanloop immediately:
![Decorators Example](file:7af686ac-f31c-4c14-8cf2-2d91e6afce27)

This decorator logging also works natively with our existing [offline eval workflows](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/quickstart/evals-in-code).
If you first instrument your AI feature with decorators and then subsequently want to run evals against it, you can just pass it in as the callable to
`hl.evaluations.run(...)`. The logs generated using the decorators will automatically be picked up by the Eval Run.

Similar functionality coming soon to TypeScript!

## New App Layout

*November 14th, 2024*

We've launched a major redesign of our application interface, focusing on giving you a clearer app structure and more consistent navigation. The new design features refined sidebars, tabs, and side panels that create a more cohesive experience.

The primary views **Dashboard**, **Editor**, **Logs** and **Evaluations** are now located in the top navigation bar as consistent tabs for all files. The sidebar no longer expands to show these views under each file, which gives you a more stable sense of where you are in the app.

The new layout also speeds up navigation between files through wiser prefetching of the content, and the default view when opening a file is now the **Editor**.

These changes lay the foundation for further improvements to come such as consistent ways to slice and dice the data on different versions through each view.

## Evals Comparison Mode progress bar

*November 13th, 2024*

We've added a progress bar to the comparison view to help you and your Subject Matter Experts (SME) track the progress of your human evaluations more easily.

![Progress bar in Comparison Mode](file:b3ff6f1f-4c7b-4dd3-80ba-c59bc4ca7620)

You can also now mark individual cells as complete without providing a judgment value for the Evaluator. This is particularly useful when the Evaluator is not applicable for the output under review.

## Evals Comparison Mode filters

*November 8th, 2024*

We've added filters to the comparison view to help you and your domain experts provide judgments more efficiently and quickly.

![Filters in Comparison Mode](file:ddfe1b40-3e7e-4c35-aca2-dccf6dcb8298)

While on the Review tab, click the Filters button to open the filters panel.
You can filter the datapoints by full or partial text matches of the input variable values.
In future updates, we will add support for filtering by evaluator judgments. This will provide you with more flexibility in how you view and interact with your evaluations.

## Enhanced Eval Runs

*November 5th, 2024*

We've extended our concept of an Eval Run to make it more versatile and easier to organise. Before now, every Run in an Evaluation had to use the exact same version of your Dataset. With this change:

* We now allow you to change your Dataset between Runs if required; this is particularly useful when trying to iterate on and improve your Dataset during the process.

* You can now create a Run using existing logs, without first requiring a Dataset at all; this is great for using evals to help spot check production logs, or to more easily leverage your existing logs for evals.

* We've also added a new `Runs` tab within an Evaluation to provide a clearer UI around the setup, progress and organisation of different Runs.

<p>
  How to create Runs
</p>

In the newly-introduced Runs tab, click on the **+ Run** button to start creating a new Run. This will insert a new row in the table
where you can select a Version and Dataset as before, before clicking **Save** to create the Run.

![Evaluation Runs table](file:1a7c4f5b-772f-4ccc-9423-f810d60e73c8)

To start using Eval Runs in your code, install the latest version of the Humanloop SDK.

In Python, you can use the `humanloop.evaluations.run(...)` [utility](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/quickstart/evals-in-code) to create a Run. Alternatively, when managing API calls directly yourself, you can create a Run by calling `humanloop.evaluation.create_run(...)` and pass the generated `run_id` into your `humanloop.prompts.log(run_id=run_id, ...)` call.
This replaces the previous `evaluation_id` and `batch_id` arguments in the `log` method.

In order to create a Run for existing logs, use the `humanloop.evaluations.create_run(...)` method without specifying a Dataset and then use `humanloop.prompts.log(run_id=run_id, ...)` to associate your Logs to the Run.
Furthermore, if the Logs are already on Humanloop, you can add them to the Run by calling `humanloop.evaluations.add_logs_to_run(id=evaluation.id, run_id=run.id, log_ids=log_ids)` with the `log_ids` of the Logs you want to add.

## Evals Comparison Mode shortcuts

*October 25th, 2024*

We've added keyboard shortcuts to the side-by-side comparison view to help you and your domain experts
work through review tasks more efficiently and quickly.

While on the review tab, press the arrow keys ⬆️, ⬇️, ⬅️, or ➡️ to navigate between judgment cells, and press `Enter` to edit the judgment.

You can also press keys `J` and `K` to switch between datapoints without having to use your mouse or trackpad.

## Onboarding improvements

*October 24th, 2024*

We've improved how we introduce Humanloop to new users. We've highlighted more the common workflow of triggering evals from code for existing AI apps.

![Onboarding wizard with code snippet](file:23534088-5673-4acd-8d7f-b6f600f1e111)

<p>
  Evals code example
</p>

When you first enter Humanloop, we'll give you a code snippet demonstrating how to run an eval on a simple Prompt - you can skip this step and continue in the UI and we'll create an example Prompt for you.

If you're new to Humanloop, these will introduce our key concepts of our Prompts and Evals. If you're already on Humanloop, you can find a similar example in our updated [doc quickstarts](https://humanloop.com/docs/quickstart/evals-in-code).

<p>
  Example Evaluators
</p>

As part of these improvements, Humanloop will now provide new organizations with a set of example Evaluators to showcase the range of use cases and what the different Evaluator types (AI, code, and Human) can be used for.

<p>
  SDK utility
</p>

We've also continuing to extend the utilities within our SDKs, adding a `humanloop.prompts.populate_template(...)` utility function to the Python SDK to make it easier to use Prompt templates while making your own calls to the model provider. Coming to TypeScript soon.

## Claude 3.5 Sonnet

*October 20th, 2024*

We added same day support for Anthropic's new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. This latest version is reported to have improved performance across the board over its predecessor, in particular
on coding tasks - read more [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use).

![Claude-3.5-Sonnet-in-Editor](file:0e85a4c4-5a47-41dd-baef-8194f224c50b)

We've added support both for our Anthropic and Bedrock provider integrations.

## Humanloop Status Page

*October 18th, 2024*

We've published a public [status page](https://status.humanloop.com/) for any incidents or maintenance that may affect the Humanloop app, api, or website moving forward.

You can use this page to report problems and subscribe to timely updates on the status of our services.

This is part of an ongoing initiative to maintain reliability and trust in our services as we continue to scale.

## Improved Dataset Upload

*October 17th, 2024*

We've added the ability to map your input and target columns to the columns in your .csv on upload. This provides more flexibility to users who predominately use the UI to manage Datasets.

When you upload a CSV via the Dataset Editor you will see a new mapping step that allows you to select which columns will be mapped to which dataset fields.

![](file:12f695fb-e369-47c5-ac7e-b2a18b33da90)

## Evaluate Flow Log contents

*October 16th, 2024*

Flow Logs allow users to represent complex multi-step apps on Humanloop. Each step can be a Prompt, Tool, or Evaluator Log; or even another Flow Log. Logs can also be nested so that you can represent your app's execution trace.

Prior to now, Evaluators could only reference the inputs and outputs of Flow Logs when providing Judgments. We've now added the ability to access the entire contents of a Flow Log in an Evaluator. This allows you to write more complex Evaluators that can inspect the entire execution trace of your app.

<p>How to use</p>
The contents of the Flow Log are accessible via the new `children` field. Logs within the trace can also have children depending on the level of nesting in your code.

For example, if your Flow Log represent a conversation between a user and a chatbot, you can now write an Evaluator that inspects the entire conversation to make a judgement.
Below is a simple example of checking how many steps there were in the conversation:

```python
def count_number_steps(log):
    """Counts the number of steps in the Flow Log."""
    # This assumes there was no subsequent nesting
    return len(log.get('children', []))
```

Or maybe you want to count how many Logs in the trace returned an empty output, where there may have been nesting:

```python
def count_null_output_logs(log):
    """Count the number of logs in the trace where output is null."""
    def count_null_output(log):
        """Helper function for recursively counting."""
        null_count = 1 if log.get('output') is None else 0
        for child in log.get('children', []):
            null_count += count_null_output(child)
        return null_count
    return count_null_output(log)
```

You can access `children` within any of the Evaluator Editors.

![Evaluate Flow Log Contents](file:806b6056-fb87-4f87-b8c9-2ced15e9b63e)

***

## Export Datasets

*October 14th, 2024*

You can now export your Datasets on Humanloop to .csv directly from within the UI. This allows you to more rapidly iterate on your Dataset in spreadsheet tools before re-uploading.

![Export Datasets Action](file:938df2aa-3034-40fb-829d-be5613a0f978)

You can find this option both within the Dataset Editor and from your existing versions on the Dataset Dashboard.

## Evals Comparison Mode Improvements

*October 12th, 2024*

We're continuing to invest in our review UI to make it easier for you and your domain experts to work through review tasks more efficiently and quickly.

<p>
  More easily access additional context
</p>

You can now hover over judgments in the `Review` tab to access additional context. It's especially useful to get information like instructions and additional outputs (such as when an LLM evaluator outputs rationale alongside the final judgment). You can also click to expand to the full drawer view.
![Comparison Mode Improvements - eval log details](file:5f527ff3-2485-477f-8c87-e476d0eebf2d)

<p>
  Share deep links to specific datapoints
</p>

You can now share links to a specific datapoint in the `Review` tab. Simply select the desired datapoint and copy the URL. Team members who open the link will be directed to the same datapoint.

<p>
  Navigate to specific datapoints by index
</p>

Using the new text box at the top left of the `Review` tab, you can now jump to a specific datapoint by index.

This can be helpful when you need to split up the review amongst multiple team members; each can take a different range of datapoints to review.

## Evaluations SDK Improvements

*October 3rd, 2024*

We've added a new `run` method for evaluations to our SDK. This provides a simpler
entry point for evaluating your existing pipelines, both in your CICD and experimentation
workflows. This is currently available in [Beta](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/0.8.6b2/) on Python and will soon be added to the major versions of both Py and TS SDKs.

In order to run an eval via the SDK, you need to provide:

1. A callable function that takes your inputs/messages and returns a string
2. A [Dataset](/docs/guides/evals/create-dataset-api) of inputs/message to evaluate the function against
3. A set of [Evaluators](/docs/guides/evals/llm-as-a-judge) to use to provide judgments

Here is a toy example using a simple OpenAI call as the function to evaluate.

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
hl = Humanloop(api_key=os.getenv("HUMANLOOP_KEY"))
openai = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY"))


# First define the app you're evaluating
def call_digital_twin(person: str, messages: list) -> str:
    system_message = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": f"You are {person}"
    }
    chat_completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[system_message] + messages,
    )
    answer = chat_completion.choices[0].message.content
    return answer


# Then run an eval specifying the file location on Humanloop
checks = hl.evaluations.run(
    name="Demo eval",
    file={
        "path": "digital-twin",
        "callable": call_digital_twin
    },
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Latency"},
        {"path": "Cost"},
        {"path": "Correctness-AI"}
    ],
    dataset={
        "path": "questions",
        "datapoints": [
            {
                "inputs": {"person": "Albert Einstein"},
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is your most famous theory?"}]
            },
            {
                "inputs": {"person": "Serena Williams"},
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What trophy did you win most recently?"}]
            },
            {
                "inputs": {"person": "Marie Curie"},
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was your greatest scientific achievement?"}]
            },
            {
                "inputs": {"person": "Leonardo da Vinci"},
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which of your inventions are you most proud of?"}]
            },
            {
                "inputs": {"person": "Rosa Parks"},
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated you to refuse giving up your seat?"}]
            }
        ]
    },
)
```

Running this will provide status info and an eval summary in your CLI and a new eval will appear on Humanloop at the
displayed URL. Running it again under the same `name` will add runs to the existing eval.

```

It returns a set of checks you can use to determine whether the eval passed or failed.

<p>
  Introduce versioning
</p>

The only thing distinguishing different eval runs under the same eval `name` so far is the time stamp they were run.

It can also be helpful to record what the configuration of your system was when running the eval.

You can include arbitrary config within the `version` field of the `file`. If this
`version` has been used before, Humanloop will automatically associate it to your run. If the
config is new, we will automatically create a new version of your file for future reference.

```python
import inspect

checks = hl.evaluations.run(
    name="Demo eval",
    file={
        "path": "digital-twin",
        "callable": call_digital_twin,
        "version":{
            "version":"0.2.4",
            "code": inspect.getsource(call_digital_twin)
        } 
    },
    dataset={...},
    evaluators=[...],
)
```

<p>
  Leverage native Prompts
</p>

Using `hl.evaluations.run(...)` will by default create a Flow on Humanloop. Flows have
the advantage of being able to represent more complex traces, but can't be run natively
within the Humanloop Editor.

It's also possible to adapt the `run` call to instead evaluate [Prompts](https://humanloop.com/docs/explanation/prompts)
by defining the `type` as prompt and providing valid Prompt params in the `version` field.

```python
checks = hl.evaluations.run(
    file={
        "path": "digital-twin-prompt",
        "type": "prompt",
        "version": {
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "template": [{"role": "system", "content": f"You are {{person}}"}] 
        }
    },
    dataset={...},
    evaluators=[...],
)
```

<p>
  Add Evaluator thresholds
</p>

You can also now provide a threshold value for each of your Evaluators.
If provided, the `checks` return will determine whether the average performance
of the Evaluator met the threshold or not.

```python
checks = hl.evaluations.run(
    file={...},
    dataset={...},
    evaluators=[
        {"path": "Latency"},
        {"path": "Cost"},
        {"path": "Correctness-AI", "threshold": 0.5}
    ],
)
```

## Manage Directories via API

*October 1st, 2024*

You can now manage directories directly using our [API](/docs/api/directories/create). This can be helpful for programmatically managing your workspace for bulk changes or dynamically creating folder structures.

To learn more about directories on Humanloop you can check out our [Directories](/docs/explanation/directories) page.


# September

## Evaluations Comparison Mode

*September 25th, 2024*

We've added a side-by-side comparison view to evaluations on Humanloop. This new view enables domain experts to view multiple outputs side-by-side and provide judgments with easy-to-use, configurable controls.

![Comparison Mode in Evaluations](file:ac725c5c-a9d0-46ca-802e-d78cdddba03c)

To start using this new view, choose a File and click on the Evaluations submenu. Select the eval you want to view and navigate to the Review tab. This is particularly useful when trying to compare and contrast the outputs from different versions of your AI apps when providing relative judgements.

***

## Bedrock support for Llama models

*September 20th, 2024*

We've added support for Llama models through our AWS Bedrock integration.

![AWS Bedrock Llama models in model selection dropdown in a Prompt Editor on Humanloop](file:38ff84fd-6334-4c65-81b0-d6542022bf2a)

You can now select Llama models in the model selection dropdown in the Prompt Editor and start using them in your Prompts.
Humanloop supports tool calling for Llama 3.1 models, helping you to build more powerful AI applications.

***

## Evaluation Names

*September 17th, 2024*

You can now name your Evaluations in the UI and via the API. This is helpful for more easily identifying the purpose of your different Evaluations, especially when multiple teams are running different experiments.

![Evaluation with a name](file:fa19fbff-5ffd-46ea-81ef-a91318a393c2)

In the API, pass in the `name` field when creating your Evaluation to set the name. Note that names must be unique for all Evaluations for a specific file. In the UI, navigate to your Evaluation and you will see an option to rename it in the header.

***

## Introducing Flows

*September 15th, 2024*

We've added a new key building block to our app with the first release of Flows. This release focuses on improving the code-first workflows for evaluating more complex AI applications like RAG and Agent-based apps.

Flows allow you to version your whole AI application on Humanloop (as opposed to just individual Prompts and Tools) and allows you to log and evaluate the full trace of the important processing steps that occur when running your app.

See our [cookbook tutorial](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/rag/evaluate-rag-flow.ipynb) for examples on how to use Flows in your code.

![Image of a Flow with logs](file:548cbe6d-84af-4f36-a3c9-2d4225e1aeef)

**What's next**

We'll soon be extending support for allowing Evaluators to access all Logs inside a trace.
Additionally, we will build on this by adding UI-first visualisations and management of your Flows.

We'll sunset Sessions in favour of Flows in the near future. Reach out to us for guidance on how to migrate your Session-based workflows to Flows.

***

## Bedrock support for Anthropic models

*September 13th, 2024*

We've introduced a Bedrock integration on Humanloop, allowing you to use Anthropic's models via the Bedrock API, leveraging your AWS-managed infrastructure.

![AWS Bedrock Claude models in model selection dropdown in a Prompt Editor on Humanloop](file:1ca83d8d-dde5-4dd8-9ce0-c0e62fe9d5de)

To set this up, head to the API Keys tab in your Organization settings [here](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys). Enter your AWS credentials and configuration.

![Bedrock keys dialog in Humanloop app](file:634ec7ce-27ec-4e9b-86f1-f9fed8bc1858)

Once you've set up your Bedrock keys, you can select the Anthropic models in the model selection dropdown in the Prompt Editor and start using them in your Prompts.

***

## OpenAI o1

*September 10th, 2024*

We added same day support for OpenAI's new models, the o1 series. Unlike their predecessors, the o1 models have been designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.
In practise this means that when you call the API, time and tokens are spent doing chain-of-thought reasoning before you receive a response back.

![o1 in the Humanloop Editor](file:bf95bde4-0a82-468b-8f1a-19c13af1d229)

Read more about this new class of models in OpenAI's [release note](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) and their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

These models are still in Beta and don't yet support streaming or tool use, the temperature has to be set to 1 and there are specific rate limits in place.

***

## Evaluations CICD Improvements

*September 5th, 2024*

We've expanded our [evaluations API](/docs/api/evaluations/get-stats) to include new fields that allow you to more easily check on progress and render summaries of your Evaluations directly in your deployment logs. **Note: `/stats` endpoint has been deprecated in V4**

The stats response now contains a `status` you can poll and `progess` and `report` fields that you can print:

```

# August

## Get All Deployed Versions via API

*August 30th, 2024*

We've introduced a new Files API in our v5 API resources that lets you query all files simultaneously. This is useful when managing your workflows on Humanloop and you wish to find all files that match specific criteria, such as having a deployment in a specific environment. Some of the supported filters to search with are file name, file type, and deployed environments. If you find there are additional access patterns you'd find useful, please reach out and let us know.

***

## Update Logs API

*August 29th, 2024*

We've introduced the ability to patch Logs for Prompts and Tools. This can come in useful in scenarios where certain characteristics of your Log are delayed that you may want to add later, such as the output, or if you have a process of redacting inputs that takes time.

Note that not all fields support being patched, so start by referring to our [V5 API References](/docs/api/prompts/log). From there, you can submit updates to your previously created logs.

***

## Search files by path

*August 28th, 2024*

We've extended our search interface to include file paths, allowing you to more easily find and navigate to related files that you've grouped under a directory.

![Search dialog showing file paths](file:3150f7f4-8ea5-4270-8348-5b725c92a05d)

Bring up this search dialog by clicking "Search" near the top of the left-hand sidebar, or by pressing `Cmd+K`.

***

## Updated Gemini 1.5 models

*August 24th, 2024*

Humanloop supports the three newly released Gemini 1.5 models.

Start using these improved models by specifying one of the following model names in your Prompts:

* `gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827` The improved Gemini 1.5 Pro model
* `gemini-1.5-flash-exp-0827` The improved Gemini 1.5 Flash model
* `gemini-1.5-flash-8b-exp-0827` The smaller Gemini 1.5 Flash variant

More details on these models can be viewed [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/experimental-models#available-models).

***

## Custom attributes for Files

*August 20th, 2024*

You can now include custom attributes to determine the unique version of your file definitions on Humanloop.

This allows you to make the version depend on data custom to your application that Humanloop may not be aware of.

For example, if there are feature flags or identifiers that indicate a different configuration of your system that may impact the behaviour of your Prompt or Tool.

`attributes` can be submitted via the v5 API endpoints. When added, the attributes are visible on the Version Drawer and in the Editor.

![Metadata on versions](file:c6d73df6-b72c-4642-bce7-0e606b327cbb)

***

## Improved popover UI

*August 16th, 2024*

We've expanded the information shown in the version popover so that it is easier to identify which version you are working with.

This is particularly useful in places like the Logs table and within Evaluation reports, where you may be working with multiple versions of a Prompt, Tool, or Evaluator and need to preview the contents.

![Improved version popover](file:d415a8ae-9535-4f89-9b00-7e273823d6a2)

***

## Evaluate uncommitted versions

*August 15th, 2024*

You can now evaluate versions without committing them first. This means you can draft a version of a Prompt in the editor and simultaneously evaluate it in the evaluations tab, speeding up your iteration cycle.

This is a global change that allows you to load and use uncommitted versions. Uncommitted versions are created automatically when a new version of a Prompt, Tool, or Evaluator is run in their respective editors or called via the API. These versions will now appear in the version pickers underneath all your committed versions.

To evaluate an uncommitted version, simply select it by using the hash (known as the "version id") when setting up your evaluation.

![Uncommitted versions in the version picker](file:45d572f1-f55d-48f1-a4a8-75850b392ccc)

***

## Human Evaluator upgrades

*August 14th, 2024*

We've made significant upgrades to Human Evaluators and related workflows to improve your ability to gather Human judgments (sometimes referred to as "feedback") in assessing the quality of your AI applications.

Here are some of the key improvements:

* Instead of having to define a limited feedback schema tied to the settings of a specific Prompt, you can now **define your schema with a Human Evaluator file and reuse it across multiple Prompts and Tools** for both monitoring and offline evaluation purposes.
* You are no longer restricted to the default types of `Rating`, `Actions` and `Issues` when defining your feedback schemas from the UI. We've introduced a **more flexible Editor interface supporting different return types** and valence controls.
* We've extended the scope of Human Evaluators so that they can now **also be used with Tools and other Evaluators** (useful for validating AI judgments) in the same way as with Prompts.
* We've **improved the Logs drawer UI for applying feedback** to Logs. In particular, we've made the buttons more responsive.

To set up a Human Evaluator, create a new file. Within the file creation dialog, click on **Evaluator**, then click on **Human**.
This will create a new Human Evaluator file and bring you to its Editor. Here, you can choose a `Return type` for the Evaluator and configure the feedback schema.

![Tone evaluator set up with options and instructions](file:e44886ee-33b5-4f2e-9f7f-bc4fb404a002)

You can then reference this Human Evaluator within the `Monitoring` dropdown of Prompts, Tools, and other Evaluators, as well as when configuring reports in their `Evaluations` tab.

We've set up default `Rating` and `Correction` Evaluators that will be automatically attached to all Prompts new and existing. We've migrated all your existing Prompt specific feedback schemas to Human Evaluator files and these will continue to work as before with no disruption.

Check out our updated document for further details on how to use Human Evaluators:

* [Create a Human Evaluator](/docs/guides/evals/human-evaluators)
* [Capture End User Feedback](/docs/observability/guides/capture-user-feedback)
* [Run a Human Evaluation](/docs/guides/evals/run-human-evaluation)

***

## Evaluations improvements

*August 13th, 2024*

We've made improvements to help you evaluate the components of your AI applications, quickly see issues and explore the full context of each evaluation.

<p>
  A clearer Evaluation tab in Logs
</p>

We've given the Log drawer's Evaluation tab a facelift. You can now clearly see what the results are for each of the connected Evaluators.

This means that it's now easier to debug the judgments applied to a Log, and if necessary, re-run code/AI Evaluators in-line.

![Log drawer's Evaluation tab with the "Run again" menu open](file:631d2505-3ef8-4ab9-9233-27e411398144)

<p>
  Ability to re-run Evaluators
</p>

We have introduced the ability to re-run your Evaluators against a specific Log. This feature allows you to more easily address and fix issues with previous Evaluator judgments for specific Logs.

You can request a re-run of that Evaluator by opening the menu next to that Evaluator and pressing the "Run Again" option.

<p>
  Evaluation popover
</p>

If you hover over an evaluation result, you'll now see a popover with more details about the evaluation including any intermediate results or console logs without context switching.

![Evaluation popover](file:e7334363-0e76-411f-a3fd-cc2fe677bcd2)

<p>
  Updated Evaluator Logs table
</p>

The Logs table for Evaluators now supports the functionality as you would expect from our other Logs tables. This will make it easier to filter and sort your Evaluator judgments.

***

## More Code Evaluator packages

*August 7th, 2024*

We have expanded the packages available in the Evaluator Python environment. The new packages we've added are: `continuous-eval`, `jellyfish`, `langdetect`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `spacy`, `transformers`. The full list of packages can been seen in our [Python environment reference](/docs/reference/python-environment).

We are actively improving our execution environment so if you have additional packages you'd like us to support, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

***

## OpenAI Structured Outputs

*August 5th, 2024*

OpenAI have introduced [Structured Outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) functionality to their API.

This feature allows the model to more reliably adhere to user defined JSON schemas for use cases like information extraction, data validation, and more.

We've extended our `/chat` (in v4) and `prompt/call` (in v5) endpoints to support this feature. There are two ways to trigger Structured Outputs in the API:

1. **Tool Calling:** When defining a tool as part of your Prompt definition, you can now include a `strict=true` flag. The model will then output JSON data that adheres to the tool `parameters` schema definition.

```python
""" Example using our v5 API. """
from humanloop import Humanloop

client = Humanloop(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

client.prompts.call(
    path="person-extractor",
    prompt={
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "template": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an information extractor.",
            },
        ],
        "tools": [
            {
                "name": "extract_person_object",
                "description": "Extracts a person object from a user message.",
                # New parameter to enable structured outputs
                "strict": True,
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "name": "Full name",
                            "description": "Full name of the person",
                        },
                        "address": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "name": "Full address",
                            "description": "Full address of the person",
                        },
                        "job": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "name": "Job",
                            "description": "The job of the person",
                        }
                    },
                    # These fields need to be defined in strict mode
                    "required": ["name", "address", "job"],
                    "additionalProperties": False,
                },
            }
        ],
    },
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hey! I'm Jacob Martial, I live on 123c Victoria street, Toronto and I'm a software engineer at Humanloop.",
        },
    ],
    stream=False,
)

```

2. **Response Format:** We have expanded the `response_format` with option `json_schema` and a request parameter to also include an optional `json_schema` field where you can pass in the schema you wish the model to adhere to.

```python

client.prompts.call(
    path="person-extractor",
    prompt={
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "template": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an information extractor.",
            },
        ],
        # New parameter to enable structured outputs
        "response_format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "json_schema": {
                "name": "person_object",
                "strict": True,
                "schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "name": "Full name",
                            "description": "Full name of the person"
                        },
                        "address": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "name": "Full address",
                            "description": "Full address of the person"

```

This new response formant functionality is only supported by the latest OpenAPI model snapshots `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` and `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`.

We will also be exposing this functionality in our Editor UI soon too!

## Improved Code Evaluator Debugging

*August 1st, 2024*

We've added the ability to view the Standard Output (Stdout) for your Code Evaluators.

You can now use `print(...)` statements within your code to output intermediate results to aid with debugging.

The Stdout is available within the Debug console as you iterate on your Code Evaluator:

![DebugConsole](file:d7de3896-b780-46a2-9a54-e371801bac71)

Additionally, it is stored against the Evaluator Log for future reference:

![EvaluatorLog](file:1f0afd4a-e3fd-4f99-9c3d-ef7e5b0f18f3)


# July

## Select multiple Versions when creating an Evaluation

*July 30th, 2024*

Our Evaluations feature allows you to benchmark Versions of a same File. We've made the form for creating new Evaluations simpler by allowing the selection of multiple in the picker dialog. Columns will be filled or inserted as needed.

As an added bonus, we've made adding and removing columns feel smoother with animations. The form will also scroll to newly-added columns.

## Faster log queries

*July 19th, 2024*

You should notice that queries against your logs should load faster and the tables should render more quickly.

We're still making more enhancements so keep an eye for more speed-ups coming soon!

***

## gpt-4o-mini support

*July 18th, 2024*

Latest model from OpenAI, GPT-4o-mini, has been added. It's a smaller version of the GPT-4o model which shows GPT-4 level performance with a model that is 60% cheaper than gpt-3.5-turbo.

* Cost: 15 cents per million input tokens, 60 cents per million output tokens
* Performance: MMLU score of 82%

***

## Enhanced code Evaluators

*July 10th, 2024*

We've introduced several enhancements to our code Evaluator runtime environment to support additional packages, environment variables, and improved runtime output.

<p>
  Runtime environment
</p>

Our Code Evaluator now logs both `stdout` and `stderr` when executed and environment variables can now be accessed via the `os.environ` dictionary, allowing you to retrieve values such as `os.environ['HUMANLOOP_API_KEY']` or `os.environ['PROVIDER_KEYS']`.

<p>
  Python packages
</p>

Previously, the selection of Python packages we could support was limited. We are now able to accommodate customer-requested packages. If you have specific package requirements for your eval workflows, please let us know!


# June

## Gemini 1.5 Flash support

*June 30th, 2024*

Gemini 1.5 Flash is Googles most efficient model to date with a long context window and great latency.

While it’s smaller than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning with a 1 million token length context window.

Find out more about Flash's [availability and pricing](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-gemma-developer-updates-may-2024/)

## Committing and deploying UX improvements

*June 24th, 2024*

We've made some improvements to the user experience around committing and deploying changes to your evaluators, tools and datasets.

Now, each editor has a consistent and reliable loading and saving experience. You can choose prior versions in the dropdown, making it easier to toggle between versions.

And, as you commit, you'll also get the option to immediately deploy your changes. This reduces the number of steps needed to get your changes live.

Additional bug fixes:

* Fixed the flickering issue on the datasets editor
* Fixed the issue where the evaluator editor would lose the state of the debug drawer on commit.

***

## Claude 3.5 Sonnet support

*June 20th, 2024*

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now in Humanloop!

Sonnet is the latest and most powerful model from Anthropic.

**2x the speed, 1/5th the cost, yet smarter than Claude 3 Opus.**

Anthropic have now enabled streaming of tool calls too, which is supported in Humanloop now too.

Add your Anthropic key and select Sonnet in the Editor to give it a go.

## Prompt and Tool version drawer in Evaluation reports

*June 18th, 2024*

You can now click on the Prompt and Tool version tags within your Evaluation report to open a drawer with details. This helps provide the additional context needed when reasoning with the results without having to navigate awa

![Prompt drawer in Evaluation report](file:3fd59207-14fd-42c3-aa87-50ce3b7631f7)

***

## Status of Human Evaluators

*June 16th, 2024*

With Humanloop Evaluation Reports, you can leverage multiple Evaluators for comparing your Prompt and Tool variations. Evaluators can be of different types: code, AI or Human and the progress of the report is dependent on collecting all the required judgements. Human judgments generally take longer than the rest and are collected async by members of your team.

![Human Evaluators](file:32fe2ac0-02d7-4985-9993-da5c4104837b)

To better support this workflow, we've improved the UX around monitoring the status of judgments, with a new progress bar. Your Human Evaluators can now also update the status of the report when they're done.

![Human Evaluators](file:b1c90699-1c9a-4d7f-9a5c-d13d0946a18c)

We've also added the ability to cancel ongoing Evaluations that are pending or running. Humanloop will then stop generating Logs and running Evaluators for this Evaluation report.

***

## Faster Evaluations

*June 10th, 2024*

Following the recent upgrades around Evaluation reports, we've improved the batching and concurrency for both calling models and getting the evaluation results. This has increased the speed of Evaluation report generation by 10x and the reports now update as new batches of logs and evaluations are completed to give a sense of intermediary progress.

***

## Evaluation Comparison Reports

*June 4th, 2024*

We've released Evaluation reports, which allows you to easily compare the performance of your different Prompts or Tools across multiple different [Evaluator](/docs/evaluators) criteria.

This generalises our previous concept of Evaluation runs, extending it with multiple complimentary changes with getting more from your evals. All your existing Evaluation runs have been migrated to Evaluation reports with a single evaluated Prompt or Tool. You can easily extend these existing runs to cover additional Evaluators and Prompts/Tools with out having to regenerate existing logs.

<img src="file:96aa3599-3b3f-4003-b321-f094f5bbd97d" />

<p>
  Feature breakdown
</p>

We've introduced a new **stats comparison view**, including a radar chart that gives you a quick overview of how your versions compare across all Evaluators. Below it, your evaluated versions are shown in columns, forming a grid with a row per Evaluator you've selected.

The performance of each version for a given Evaluator is shown in a chart, where bar charts are used for boolean results, while box plots are used for numerical results providing an indication of variance within your Dataset.

Evaluation reports also introduce an **automatic deduplication** feature, which utilizes previous logs to avoid generating new logs for the same inputs. If a log already exists for a given evaluated-version-and-datapoint pair, it will automatically be reused. You can also override this behavior and force the generation of new logs for a report by creating a **New Batch** in the setup panel.

<img src="file:adc6aa82-da77-4497-bfb0-9fc6011f4484" />

<p>
  How to use Evaluation reports
</p>

To get started, head over to the Evaluations tab of the Prompt you'd like to evaluate, and click **Evaluate** in the top right.

This will bring you to a page where you can set up your Evaluation, choosing a Dataset, some versions to Evaluate and compare, and the Evaluators you'd like to use.

![](file:838cbdaa-4432-4374-ae31-c438d02baa12)

When you click **Save**, the Evaluation report will be created, and any missing Logs will be generated.

<p>
  What's next
</p>

We're planning on improving the functionality of Evaluation reports by adding a more comprehensive detailed view, allowing you to get a more in-depth look at the generations produced by your Prompt versions. Together with this, we'll also be improving Human evaluators so you can better annotate and aggregate feedback on your generations.


# May

## Azure Model Updates

*May 28th, 2024*

You can now access the latest versions of GPT-4 and GPT-4o hosted on Azure in the Humanloop Editor and via our Chat endpoints.

Once you've configured your Azure key and endpoint in your organization's provider settings, the model versions will show up in the Editor dropown as follows:

For more detail, please see the [API documentation](https://docs.humanloop.com/reference/logs_list) on our Logs endpoints.

***

## Improved Logs Filtering

*May 20th, 2024*

We've improved the ability to filter logs by time ranges. The API logs filter parameters for `start_date` and `end_date` now supports querying with more granularity. Previously the filters were limited to dates, such as **2024-05-22**, now you can use hourly ranges as well, such as **2024-05-22 13:45**.

For more detail, please see the [API documentation](https://docs.humanloop.com/reference/logs_list) on our Logs endpoints.

***

## Monitoring with deployed Evaluators

*May 15th, 2024*

You can now connect deployed Evaluator versions for online monitoring of your Prompts and Tools.

This enables you to update Evaluators for multiple Prompt or Tools when you deploy a new Evaluator version.

<img src="file:9bf9e55c-475c-44f0-8d64-301eb9364fa1" />

***

## Logs for Evaluators

*May 12th, 2024*

For AI and Code Evaluators, you can now inspect and reference their logs as with Prompts and Tools. This provides greater transparency into how they are being used and improves the ability to debug and improve.

Further improvements to Human Evaluators are coming very soon...

<img src="file:cdc5db71-6f01-4104-bd1f-7331e47a15c9" alt="Creating a new Evaluator file" />

***

## Improved Evaluator management

*May 8th, 2024*

Evaluators are now first class citizens alongside Prompts, Tools and Datasets. This allows for easier re-use, version control and helps with organising your workspace within directories.

You can create a new Evaluator by choosing **Evaluator** in the File creation dialog in the sidebar or on your home page.

<img src="file:c94c66ce-a72e-495c-b917-1c5f10310328" alt="Creating a new Evaluator file" />

<p>
  Migration and backwards compatibility
</p>

We've migrated all of your Evaluators previously managed within **Prompts > Evaluations > Evaluators** to new Evaluator files. All your existing Evaluation runs will remain unchanged and online Evaluators will continue to work as before. Moving forward you should use the new Evaluator file to make edits and manage versions.


# April

## Log drawer in Editor

*April 30th, 2024*

You can now open up the Log drawer directly in the Editor.

This enables you to see exactly what was sent to the provider as well as the tokens used and cost. You can also conveniently add feedback and run evaluators on that specific Log, or add it to a dataset.

To show the Logs just click the arrow icon beside each generated message or completion.

***

## Groq support (Beta)

*April 26th, 2024*

We have introduced support for models available on Groq to Humanloop. You can now try out the blazingly fast generations made with the open-source models (such as Llama 3 and Mixtral 8x7B) hosted on Groq within our Prompt Editor.

<img src="file:bbb4043e-353f-4236-b3bb-003d530093cf" />

Groq achieves [faster throughput](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/llama-3-instruct-70b/providers)  using specialized hardware, their LPU Inference Engine. More information is available in their [FAQ](https://wow.groq.com/why-groq/) and on their website.

<br />

Note that their API service, GroqCloud, is still in beta and low rate limits are enforced.

***

## Llama 3

*April 23rd, 2024*

[Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/), Meta AI's latest openly-accessible model, can now be used in the Humanloop Prompt Editor.

Llama 3 comes in two variants: an 8-billion parameter model that performs similarly to their previous 70-billion parameter Llama 2 model, and a new 70-billion parameter model. Both of these variants have an expanded context window of 8192 tokens.

More details and benchmarks against other models can be found on their [blog post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) and [model card](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md).

Humanloop supports Llama 3 on the Replicate model provider, and on the newly-introduced Groq model provider.

***

## Anthropic tool support (Beta)

*April 18th, 2024*

Our Editor and deployed endpoints now supports tool use with the Anthropic's Claude3 models. Tool calling with Anthropic is still in Beta, so streaming is not important.

In order to user tool calling for Claude in Editor you therefore need to first turn off streaming mode in the menu dropdown to the right of the load button.

<img src="file:b18583bc-671f-471c-90b0-723287a81dea" />

***

## Cost, Tokens and Latency

*April 16th, 2024*

We now compute Cost, Tokens and Latency for all Prompt logs by default across all model providers.

These values will now appear automatically as graphs in your Dashboard, as columns in your logs table and will be displayed in our Version and Log drawers.

<img src="file:31874696-28c7-4e81-afff-6c10329b7ea4" />

***

## Cohere Command-r

*April 13th, 2024*

We've expanded the Cohere models with the latest command-r suite. You can now use these models in our Editor and via our APIs once you have set your Cohere API key.

More details can be found on their [blog post](https://cohere.com/blog/command-r-plus-microsoft-azure).

<img src="file:cd132bf7-e0e6-45c0-9fd8-74602a0d0f57" />

***

## Dataset Files & Versions

*April 5th, 2024*

In our recent release, we promoted **Datasets** from being attributes managed within the context of a single Prompt, to a **first-class Humanloop file type** alongside Prompts and Tools.

<img src="file:dd71bc47-8d48-4876-a690-611ce49dd337" />

This means you can curate Datasets and share them for use across any of the Prompts in your organization. It also means you get the full power of our **file versioning system**, allowing you **track and commit every change** you make Datasets and their Datapoints, with attribution and commit messages inspired by Git.

<img src="file:4dc8e16d-4683-4c69-ad87-5716a35134fa" />

It's now easy to understand which version of a Dataset was used in a given Evaluation run, and whether the most recent edits to the Dataset were included or not.

Read more on how to get started with datasets [here](/docs/datasets).

This change lays the foundation for lots more improvements we have coming to Evaluations in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!


# March

## Mixtral 8x7B

*March 25th, 2024*

Keeping you up to date with the latest open models, we've added support for Mixtral 8x7B to our Editor with a [Replicate integration](https://replicate.com/).

<img src="file:db0584a3-7a8e-4350-91a7-45c1e2bb1b18" />

Mixtral 8x7B outperforms LLaMA 2 70B (already supported in Editor) with faster inference, with performance comparable to that of GPT-3.5. More details are available in its [release announcement](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/).

***

## Additional Replicate models support via API

*March 18th, 2024*

Through the Replicate model provider additional open models can be used by specifying a model name via the API. The model name should be of a similar form as the ref used when calling `replicate.run(ref)` using [Replicate's Python SDK](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python).

For example, Vicuna, an open-source chatbot model based on finetuning LLaMA can be used with the following model name alongside `provider: "replicate"` in your Prompt version.\
`replicate/vicuna-13b:6282abe6a492de4145d7bb601023762212f9ddbbe78278bd6771c8b3b2f2a13b`

***

## Surfacing uncommitted Versions

*March 18th, 2024*

We now provide the ability to access your uncommitted Prompt Versions and associated Logs.

Adding to our recent changes around the [Commit flow for Versions](https://docs.humanloop.com/changelog/2024/02#committing-prompt-versions), we've added the ability to view any uncommitted versions in your Versions and Logs tables. This can be useful if you need to recover or compare to a previous state during your Prompt engineering and Evaluation workflows.

Uncommitted Versions are created when you make generations in our Editor without first committing what you are working on. In future, it will also be possible to create uncommitted versions when logging or generating using the API.

We've added new filter tabs to the Versions and Logs table to enable this:

<img src="file:35b0dd52-c883-42fb-8d84-72411faf45be" alt="New **All** and From **Committed By Versions** filter tabs on the logs table." />

<img src="file:1034f5bc-244b-48b8-b365-7464bc8c747e" alt="New **Committed** and **Uncommitted** tabs on the Versions table of your Prompt dashboard." />

***

## Improved navigation & sidebar

*March 7th, 2024*

We've introduced a sidebar for easier navigation between your Prompts and Tools.

As new language models unlock more complex use cases, you'll be setting up and connecting Prompts, Tools, and Evaluators. The new layout better reflects these emerging patterns, and switching between your files is now seamless with the directory tree in the sidebar.

![](file:4237a60a-1a5f-4487-a372-e80a1668dc04)

You can also bring up the search dialog with **Cmd+K** and switch to another file using only your keyboard.

***

## Claude 3

*March 6th, 2024*

Introducing same day support for the Claude 3 - Anthropics new industry leading models. Read more about the release [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family).

The release contains three models in ascending order of capability: *Haiku*, *Sonnet*, and *Opus*. This suite provides users with the different options to balance intelligence, speed, and cost for their specific use-cases.

<img src="file:25806736-8327-4a89-92f9-59c8b1cf1655" />

**Key take aways:**

1. **Performance** - a new leader. The largest of the 3 models, Opus, is claimed to outperform GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on key benchmarks such as MMLU and Hellaswag. It even reached 84.9% on the Humaneval coding test set (vs GPT-4’s 67%) 🤯
2. **200k context window** with near-perfect recall on selected benchmarks. Opus reports 99% accuracy on the NIAH test, which measures how accurately a model can recall information given to it in a large corpus of data.
3. **Opus has vision**. Anthropic claim that performance here is on par with that of other leading models (ie GPT-4 and Gemini). They say it’s most useful for inputting graphs, slides etc. in an enterprise setting.
4. **Pricing** - as compared to OpenAI:

Opus - $75 (2.5x GPT-4 Turbo)  
Sonnet - $15 (50% of GPT-4 Turbo)\
Haiku - \$1.25 (1.6x GPT-3.5)

5. **How you can use it**: The Claude 3 family is now available on Humanloop. Bring your API key to test, evaluate and deploy the publicly available models - Opus and Sonnet.


# February

## New Tool creation flow

*February 26th, 2024*

You can now create Tools in the same way as you create Prompts and Directories. This is helpful as it makes it easier to discover Tools and easier to quickly create new ones.

![](file:a1e0f2f5-fd40-462d-8c8d-de0cc6d28583)

To create a new Tool simply press the New button from the directory of your choice and select one of our supported Tools, such as JSON Schema tool for function calling or our Pinecone tool to integrate with your RAG pipelines.

***

## Tool editor and deployments

*February 26th, 2024*

You can now manage and edit your Tools in our new Tool Editor. This is found in each Tool file and lets you create and iterate on your tools. As well, we have introduced deployments to Tools, so you can better control which versions of a tool are used within your Prompts.

![](file:e333c106-5686-49d1-bd49-6f081bbb112b)

<p>
  Tool Editor
</p>

This replaces the previous Tools section which has been removed. The editor will let you edit any of the tool types that Humanloop supports (JSON Schema, Google, Pinecone, Snippet, Get API) and commit new Versions.

![](file:68b567a7-db12-4c97-9bf6-f880fb560d07)

<p>
  Deployment
</p>

Tools can now be deployed. You can pick a version of your Tool and deploy it. When deployed it can be used and referenced in a Prompt editor.

And example of this, if you have a version of a Snippet tool with the signature `snippet(key)` with a key/value pair of "*helpful*"/"*You are a helpful assistant*". You decide you would rather change the value to say "*You are a funny assistant*", you can commit a version of the Tool with the updated key. This wont affect any of your prompts that reference the Snippet tool until you Deploy the second version, after which each prompt will automatically start using the funny assistant prompt.

***

## Prompt labels and hover cards

*February 26th, 2024*

We've rolled out a unified label for our Prompt Versions to allow you to quickly identify your Prompt Versions throughout our UI. As we're rolling out these labels across the app, you'll have a consistent way of interacting with and identifying your Prompt Versions.

<img src="file:414f4952-21ee-4c85-aca6-2211dc7f1aeb" alt="Label and hover card for a deployed Prompt Version" />

The labels show the deployed status and short ID of the Prompt Version. When you hover over these labels, you will see a card that displays the commit message and authorship of the committed version.

You'll be able to find these labels in many places across the app, such as in your Prompt's deployment settings, in the Logs drawer, and in the Editor.

<img src="file:e6597492-1eb4-4c74-b99d-2fce53a05592" alt="The Prompt Version label and hover card in a Prompt Editor" />

As a quick tip, the color of the checkmark in the label indicates that this is a version that has been deployed. If the Prompt Version has not been deployed, the checkmark will be black.

<img src="file:a3029ab9-2434-49d9-bb6a-219eacfb678b" alt="A Prompt Version that has not been deployed" />

***

## Committing Prompt Versions

*February 26th, 2024*

Building on our terminology improvements from Project -> Prompt, we've now updated Model Configs -> Prompt Versions to improve consistency in our UI.

This is part of a larger suite of changes to improve the workflows around how entities are managed on Humanloop and to make them easier to work with and understand. We will also be following up soon with a new and improved major version of our API that encapsulates all of our terminology improvements.

In addition to just the terminology update, we've improved our Prompt versioning functionality to now use `commits` that can take `commit messages`, where you can describe how you've been iterating on your Prompts.

We've removed the need for names (and our auto-generated placeholder names) in favour of using explicit commit messages.

<img src="file:a6c90154-a616-42de-b35c-d732d9e9629b" />

We'll continue to improve the version control and file types support over the coming weeks.

Let us know if you have any questions around these changes!

***

## Online evaluators for monitoring Tools

*February 14th, 2024*

You can now use your online evaluators for monitoring the logs sent to your Tools. The results of this can be seen in the graphs on the Tool dashboard as well as on the Logs tab of the Tool.

![](file:ac2cf407-1a11-4fc9-bf13-7e7c222fabef)

***

## Logging token usage

*February 14th, 2024*

We're now computing and storing the number of tokens used in both the requests to and responses from the model.

This information is available in the logs table UI and as part of the [log response](/docs/v4/api/logs/get) in the API. Furthermore you can use the token counts as inputs to your code and LLM based evaluators.

The number of tokens used in the request is called `prompt_tokens` and the number of tokens used in the response is called `output_tokens`.

This works consistently across all model providers and whether or not you are you are streaming the responses. OpenAI, for example, do not return token usage stats when in streaming mode.

<img src="file:16491c9a-92de-4951-880a-686a015b7626" />

***

## Prompt Version authorship

*February 13th, 2024*

You can now view who authored a Prompt Version.

<img src="file:dddc9422-b4b1-47a6-a766-97dc61ba406b" alt="Prompt Version authorship in the Prompt Version slideover" />

We've also introduced a popover showing more Prompt Version details that shows when you mouseover a Prompt Version's ID.

<img src="file:9cdd947e-e3aa-40da-8f18-381b02fa3dea" alt="Prompt Version popover in the Logs slideover" />

Keep an eye out as we'll be introducing this in more places across the app.

***

## Filterable and sortable evaluations overview

*February 9th, 2024*

We've made improvements to the evaluations runs overview page to make it easier for your team to find interesting or important runs.

![](file:cdb979ec-5081-49b2-ab23-958bd05ffc51)

The charts have been updated to show a single datapoint per run. Each chart represents a single evaluator, and shows the performance of the prompt tested in that run, so you can see at a glance how the performance your prompt versions have evolved through time, and visually spot the outliers. Datapoints are color-coded by the dataset used for the run.

The table is now paginated and does not load your entire project's list of evaluation runs in a single page load. The page should therefore load faster for teams with a large number of runs.

The columns in the table are now filterable and sortable, allowing you to - for example - filter just for the completed runs which test two specific prompt versions on a specific datasets, sorted by their performance under a particular evaluator.

<img src="file:49e02097-cab8-4c78-9479-0458553e37e3" alt="Here, we've filtered the table on completed runs that tested three specific prompt versions of interest, and sorted to show those with the worst performance on the Valid JSON evaluator." />

## Projects rename and file creation flow

*February 8th, 2024*

We've renamed `Projects` to `Prompts` and `Tools` as part of our move towards managing `Prompts`, `Tools`, `Evaluators` and `Datasets` as special-cased and strictly versioned files in your Humanloop directories.

This is a purely cosmetic change for now. Your Projects (now Prompts and Tools) will continue to behave exactly the same. This is the first step in a whole host of app layout, navigation and API improvements we have planned in the coming weeks.

If you are curious, please reach out to learn more.

<img src="file:4568548f-e6a8-4550-bf0d-dca421eb0015" />

**New creation flow**

We've also updated our file creation flow UI. When you go to create projects you'll notice they are called Prompts now.

![](file:e38e86c8-dd81-41a8-8b25-80a565aa7386)

***

## Control logging level

*February 2nd, 2024*

We've added a `save` flag to all of our endpoints that generate logs on Humanloop so that you can control whether the request and response payloads that may contain sensitive information are persisted on our servers or not.

If `save` is set to `false` then no `inputs`, `messages` our `outputs` of any kind (including the raw provider request and responses) are stored on our servers. This can be helpful for sensitive use cases where you can't for example risk PII leaving your system.

Details of the model configuration and any metadata you send are still stored. Therefore you can still benefit from certain types of evaluators such as human feedback, latency and cost, as well as still track important metadata over time that may not contain sensitive information.

This includes all our [chat](/docs/v4/api/chats/create) and [completion](/docs/v4/api/completions/create) endpoint variations, as well as our explicit [log](/docs/v4/api/logs/log) endpoint.

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

# You need to initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")

# humanloop.complete_deployed(...) will call the active model config on your project.
# You can optionally set the save flag to False
complete_response = humanloop.complete_deployed(
  	save=False,
    project="<YOUR UNIQUE PROJECT NAME>",
    inputs={"question": "I have inquiry about by life insurance policy. Can you help?"},
)

# You can still retrieve the data_id and output as normal
data_id = complete_response.data[0].id
output = complete_response.data[0].output

# And log end user feedback that will still be stored
humanloop.feedback(data_id=data_id, type="rating", value="good")
```

***

## Logging provider request

*February 2nd, 2024*

We're now capturing the raw provider request body alongside the existing provider response for all logs generated from our [deployed endpoints](/docs/guides/chat-using-the-sdk).

This provides more transparency into how we map our provider agnostic requests to specific providers. It can also effective for helping to troubleshoot the cases where we return well handled provider errors from our API.

# January

## Add Evaluators to existing runs

*January 30th, 2024*

You can now add an evaluator to any existing evaluation run. This is helpful in situations where you have no need to regenerate logs across a dataset, but simply want to run new evaluators across the existing run. By doing this instead of launching a fresh run, you can the save significant time & costs associated with unnecessarily regenerating logs, especially when working with large datasets.

<img src="file:1a40f537-75ee-4fb0-bb43-045e166c41ce" alt="Use the **Add Evaluator** button to run more evaluators across the logs in an existing evaluation run. This can be done on any runs, including those still running or already completed." />

***

## Improved Evaluation Debug Console

*January 30th, 2024*

We've enhanced the usability of the debug console when creating and modifying evaluators. Now you can more easily inspect the data you are working with, and understand the root causes of errors to make debugging quicker and more intuitive.

![](file:d683bdd7-8b53-4ba7-88f9-66389aad9489)

On any row in the debug console, click the arrow next to a testcase to inspect the full entity in a slideover panel.

After clicking **Run** to generate a log from a testcase, you can inspect the full log right from the debug console, giving you clearer access to error messages or the model-generated content, as in the example below.

![](file:c4daf3e5-536f-409f-985d-efd3f48fc3e1)

***

## LLM Evaluators

*January 30th, 2024*

We expect this feature to be most useful in the case of creating and debugging LLM evaluators. You can now inspect the log of the LLM evaluation itself right from the debug console, along with the original testcase and model-generated log, as described above.

After clicking **Run** on a testcase in the debug console, you'll see the **LLM Evaluation Log** column populated with a button that opens a full drawer.

![](file:2cb26d85-ef9c-40a3-8d53-f579b0007712)

This is particularly helpful to verify that your evaluation prompt was correctly populated with data from the underlying log and testcase, and to help understand why the LLM's evaluation output may not have been parsed correctly into the output values.

![](file:3094e213-05ba-40da-8b0b-fb7613b1fd13)

***

## Tool projects

*January 30th, 2024*

We have upgraded projects to now also work for tools. Tool projects are automatically created for tools you define as part of your model config [in the Editor](/docs/v4/guides/tool-calling) as well as tools [managed at organization level](/docs/v4/guides/link-jsonschema-tool).

It is now easier to access the logs from your tools and manage different versions like you currently do for your prompts.

![](file:7a472695-3b3b-4a2c-b3d3-d1ef9403e2b8)

<p>
  Tool versioning
</p>

In the dashboard view, you can see the different versions of your tools. This will soon be expanded to link you to the source config and provide a more comprehensive view of your tool's usage.

<p>
  Logs
</p>

Any logs submitted via the SDK that relate to these tools will now appear in the Logs view of these projects. You can see this by following our [sessions guide](https://dash.readme.com/project/humanloop/v4.0/docs/logging-session-traces) and logging a new tool via the SDK. This also works natively with online Evaluators, so you can start to layer in observability for the individual non-LLM components of your session

<p>
  Offline Evaluations via SDK
</p>

You can trigger evaluations on your tools projects similar to how you would for an LLM project with model configs. This can be done by logging to the tool project, creating a dataset, and triggering an evaluation run. A good place to start would be the [Set up evaluations using API](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/evaluations-using-api) guide.

***

## Support for new OpenAI Models

*January 30th, 2024*

Following [OpenAI's latest model releases](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates), you will find support for all the latest models in our **Playground** and **Editor**.

<p>
  GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo
</p>

If your API key has access to the models, you'll see the new release `gpt-4-0125-preview` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` available when working in Playground and Editor. These models are more capable and cheaper than their predecessors - see the OpenAI release linked above for full details.

![](file:e34eff4a-5b1c-45c6-bd7b-9dd9c42ef8e4)

We also support the new `gpt-4-turbo-preview` model alias, which points to the latest `gpt-4-turbo` model without specifying a specific version.

<p>
  Embedding Models
</p>

Finally, the new embedding models - `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` are also available for use via Humanloop. The `small` model is 5x cheaper than the previous generation `ada-002` embedding model, while the larger model significantly improves performance and maps to a much larger embedding space.

***

## Improved evaluation run launcher

*January 19th, 2024*

We've made some usability enhancements to the launch experience when setting up batch generation & evaluation runs.

It's now clearer which model configs, datasets and evaluators you've selected. It's also now possible to specify whether you want the logs to be generated in the Humanloop runtime, or if you're going to post the logs from your own infrastructure via the API.

![](file:2fa58327-ac11-418b-834f-4b0c27a09673)

<p>
  Cancellable evaluation runs
</p>

Occasionally, you may launch an evaluation run and then realise that you didn't configure it quite the way you wanted. Perhaps you want to use a different model config or dataset, or would like to halt its progress for some other reason.

We've now made evaluation runs cancellable from the UI - see the screenshot below. This is especially helpful if you're running evaluations over large datasets, where you don't want to unnecessarily consume provider credits.

<img src="file:de328399-b9b1-4bea-bbb9-1deb91589e5b" alt="Cancellation button in the evaluation run page." />

***

## Faster offline evaluations

*January 12th, 2024*

We've introduced batching to our offline Evaluations to significantly speed up runtime performance and also improved the robustness to things going wrong mid-run.

In addition to our recent [enhancements to the Evaluations API](changelog:evaluation-api-enhancements), we've also made some significant improvements to our underlying orchestration framework which should mean your evaluation runs are now faster and more reliable. In particular, we now **batch generations** across the run - by default in groups of five, being conscious of potential rate limit errors (though this will soon be configurable).

Each batch runs its generations concurrently, so you should see much faster completion times - especially in runs across larger datasets.

***

## Evaluation API enhancements

*January 11th, 2024*

We've started the year by enhancing our evaluations API to give you more flexibility for self-hosting whichever aspects of the evaluation workflow you need to run in your own infrastructure - while leaving the rest to us!

<p>
  Mixing and matching the Humanloop-runtime with self-hosting
</p>

Conceptually, evaluation runs have two components:

1. Generation of logs for the datapoints using the version of the model you are evaluating.
2. Evaluating those logs using Evaluators.

Now, using the Evaluations API, Humanloop offers the ability to generate logs either within the Humanloop runtime, or self-hosted (see our [guide on external generations for evaluations](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/evaluating-externally-generated-logs)).

Similarly, evaluating of the logs can be performed in the Humanloop runtime (using evaluators that you can define in-app), or self-hosted (see our [guide on self-hosted evaluations](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/self-hosted-evaluations)).

It is now possible to mix-and-match self-hosted and Humanloop-runtime logs and evaluations in any combination you wish.

When creating an Evaluation (via the improved UI dialogue or via the API), you can set the new `hl_generated` flag to `False` to indicate that you are posting the logs from your own infrastructure. You can then also include an evaluator of type `External` to indicate that you will post evaluation results from your own infrastructure.

<img src="file:7718ba1c-0211-4df7-8111-774af2dca236" />

You can now also include multiple evaluators on any run, and these can include a combination of `External` (i.e. self-hosted) and Humanloop-runtime evaluators.


# December

## Human Evaluators

*December 22nd, 2023*

We've introduced a new special type of 'Human' Evaluator to compliment our existing code and AI based Evaluators.

There are many important evaluation use cases that require input from your internal domain experts, or product teams. Typically this is where you would like a gold standard judgement of how your LLM app is performing.

<img src="file:2c60fe64-e792-4222-a098-3b6627848079" />

Our new Human Evaluator allows you to trigger a batch evaluation run as normal (from our UI as part of your prompt engineering process, or using our SDK as part of your CI/CD pipeline) and then queues the results ready for a human to provide feedback.

Once completed, the feedback is aggregated to give a top-line summary of how the model is performing. It can also be combined with automatic code and AI evaluators in a single run.

<img src="file:9b8b7ff8-1ad2-4761-bc1b-9d5e722cb471" />

Set up your first Human Evaluator run by following [our guide.](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/evaluating-with-human-feedback)

***

## Return inputs flag

*December 22nd, 2023*

We've introduced a `return_inputs` flag on our chat and completion endpoints to improve performance for larger payloads.

As context model windows get increasingly larger, for example [Claude with 200k tokens](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1), it's important to make sure our APIs remain performant. A contributor to response times is the size of the response payload being sent over the wire.

When you set this new flag to false, our responses will no longer contain the `inputs` that were sent to the model and so can be significantly smaller. This is the first in a sequence of changes to add more control to the caller around API behaviour.

As always, we welcome suggestions, requests, and feedback should you have any.

***

## Gemini

*December 22nd, 2023*

You can now use Google's latest LLMs, [Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/), in Humanloop.

<p>
  Setup
</p>

To use Gemini, first go to [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and generate an API key. Then, save this under the "Google" provider on [your API keys page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys).

Head over to the playground, and you should see `gemini-pro` and `gemini-pro-vision` in your list of models.

<img src="file:63aab256-77c2-469a-9889-5d5b49aabece" />

You can also now use Gemini through the Humanloop API's `/chat`endpoints.

<p>
  Features
</p>

Gemini offers support for multi-turn chats, tool calling, and multi-modality.

However, note that while `gemini-pro` supports multi-turn chats and tool calling, it does not support multi-modality. On the other hand, `gemini-pro-vision` supports multi-modality but not multi-turn chats or tool calling. Refer to [Gemini's docs](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) for more details.

When providing images to Gemini, we've maintained compatibility with OpenAI's API. This means that when using Humanloop, you can provide images either via a HTTP URL or with a base64-encoded data URL.

***

## Chat sessions in Editor

*December 21st, 2023*

Your chat messages in Editor are now recorded as part of a session so you can more easily keep track of conversations.

<img src="file:50817e40-2612-45d6-8eae-406f02f77940" />

After chatting with a saved prompt, go to the sessions tab and your messages will be grouped together.

If you want to do this with the API, it can be as simple as setting the `session_reference_id`– see [docs on sessions](/docs/guides/logging-session-traces).

***

## Environment logs

*December 13th, 2023*

Logs for your deployed prompts will now be tagged with the corresponding [environment](/docs/guides/deploy-to-an-environment).

In your logs table, you can now filter your logs based on environment:

<img src="file:9177bb09-a3ef-4cb5-bc58-7f614eb9a401" />

You can now also pass an `environment` tag when using the explicit [/log ](/docs/v4/api/logs/log) endpoint; helpful for use cases such as [orchestrating your own models](/docs/guides/use-your-own-model-provider).

***

## Improved Evaluator UI

*December 12th, 2023*

We've improved the experience of creating and debugging your evaluators.

Now that you can [access any property of the objects you're testing](#llm-evals---improved-data-access) we've cleaned up the debug panel to make easier to view the testcases that you load from a dataset or from your projects.

<img src="file:48df5d1d-376f-48a8-8258-10cf84304149" />

We've also clarified what the return types are expected as you create your evaluators.

***

## Prompt diffs

*December 12th, 2023*

Following our recent [introduction of our .prompt file](/docs/v4/prompt-file-format), you can now compare your model configs within a project with our new 'diff' view.

![](file:1d7a6072-5451-4e40-8802-d9b4f7a01fc4)

As you modify and improve upon your model configs, you might want to remind yourself of the changes that were made between different versions of your model config. To do so, you can now select 2 model configs in your project dashboard and click **Compare** to bring up a side-by-side comparison between them. Alternatively, open the actions menu and click **Compare to deployed**.

<img src="file:f33ab01d-c978-42cc-b086-8beb704f48d0" />

This diff compares the .prompt files representing the two model configs, and will highlight any differences such as in the model, hyperparameters, or prompt template.

***

## LLM evals - improved data access

*December 12th, 2023*

In order to help you write better LLM evaluator prompts, you now have finer-grained access to the objects you are evaluating.

It's now possible to access any part of the `log` and `testcase` objects using familiar syntax like `log.messages[0].content`. Use the debug console to help understand what the objects look like when writing your prompts.

![](file:ecb7e304-ac66-41d9-bb7a-aba0068c4652)

***

## Tool linking

*December 5th, 2023*

It's now possible to manage tool definitions globally for your organization and re-use them across multiple projects by linking them to your model configs.

Prior to this change, if you wanted to re-use the same tool definition across multiple model configs, you had to copy and paste the JSON schema snippet defining the name, description and parameters into your Editor for each case. And if you wanted to make changes to this tool, you would have to recall which model configs it was saved to prior and update them inline 1 by 1.

You can achieve this tool re-use by first defining an instance of our new `JsonSchema` tool available as another option in your global `Tools` tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as `get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')`, and then link that to as many model configs as you need within the Editor as shown below.

Importantly, updates to the `get_current_weather` `JsonSchema` tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the model configs you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the prompt.

The old behaviour of defining the tool inline as part of your model config definition is still available for the cases where you do want changes in the definition of the tool to lead to new versions of the model-config.

<p>
  Set up the tool
</p>

Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the JsonSchema tool card.

![](file:2b78292b-cb73-4c18-bcda-f85541808e79)

With the dialog open, define your tool with `name`, `description`, and `parameters` values. Our guide for using [OpenAI Function Calling in the playground](/docs/v4/guides/tool-calling) can be a useful reference in this case.

<p>
  Using the tool
</p>

In the editor of your target project, link the tool by pressing the `Add Tool` button and selecting your `get_current_weather` tool.

![](file:a76e5c3c-1a61-4850-bb00-3926316e063e)

***

## Improved log table UI

*December 4th, 2023*

We've updated how we show logs and datapoints in their respective tables. You can now see the stack of inputs and messages in a cleaner interface rather than having them spread into separate columns.

<img src="file:907ebaf2-48d1-4cc8-ba23-fd1fd56d329e" alt="Part of the updated Log Table. Inputs are now stacked with a more consistent and less-busy UI." />

There will be more updates soon to improve how logs and prompts are shown in tables and the drawers soon, so if you have ideas for improvements please let us know.

***

## Introducing .prompt files

*December 4th, 2023*

We're introducing a .prompt file format for representing model configs in a format that's both human-readable and easy to work with.

For certain use cases it can be helpful for engineers to also store their prompts alongside their app's source code in their favourite version control system. The .prompt file is the appropriate artefact for this.

These .prompt files can be retrieved through both the API and through the Humanloop app.

<p>
  Exporting via API
</p>

To fetch a .prompt file via the API, make `POST` request to `https://api.humanloop.com/v4/model-configs/{id}/export`, where `{id}` is the ID of the model config (beginning with `config_`).

<p>
  Export from Humanloop
</p>

You can also export an existing model config as a .prompt file from the app. Find the model config within the project's dashboard's table of model configs and open the actions menu by clicking the three dots. Then click **Export .prompt**. (You can also find this button within the drawer that opens after clicking on on a model config's row).

<img src="file:9f654016-111c-46a0-8e1a-b1c8f35a8444" />

<p>
  Editor
</p>

Additionally, we've added the ability to view and edit your model configs in a .prompt file format when in Editor. Press **Cmd-Shift-E** when in editor to swap over to a view of your .prompt file.

<img src="file:80a51a6e-5c44-42b8-8503-5303f7546201" />

More details on our .prompt file format are available [here](/docs/v4/prompt-file-format). We'll be building on this and making it more powerful. Stay tuned.


# November

## Improved RBACs

*November 28th, 2023*

We've introduced more levels to our roles based access controls (RBACs).

We now distinguish between different roles to help you better manage your organization's access levels and permissions on Humanloop.

This is the first in a sequence of upgrades we are making around RBACs.

<p>
  Organization roles
</p>

Everyone invited to the organization can access all projects currently (controlling project access coming soon).

A user can be one of the following rolws:

\*\*Admin:\*\*The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.

**Developer:**(Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.

**Member:**(Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.

<p>
  RBACs summary
</p>

Here is the full breakdown of roles and access:

| Action                         | Member | Developer | Admin |
| :----------------------------- | :----- | :-------- | :---- |
| Create and manage Prompts      | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Inspect logs and feedback      | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Create and manage evaluators   | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Run evaluations                | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Create and manage datasets     | ✔️     | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Create and manage API keys     |        | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Manage prompt deployments      |        | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Create and manage environments |        | ✔️        | ✔️    |
| Send invites                   |        |           | ✔️    |
| Set user roles                 |        |           | ✔️    |

## Self hosted evaluations

*November 28th, 2023*

We've added support for managing [evaluations](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/evaluate-models-offline) outside of Humanloop in your own code.

There are certain use cases where you may wish to run your evaluation process outside of Humanloop, where the evaluator itself is defined in your code as opposed to being defined using our Humanloop runtime.

For example, you may have implemented an evaluator that uses your own custom model, or has to interact with multiple systems. In which case, it can be difficult to define these as a simple code or [LLM evaluator](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/use-llms-to-evaluate-logs) within your Humanloop project.

With this kind of setup, our users have found it very beneficial to leverage the datasets they have curated on Humanloop, as well as consolidate all of the results alongside the prompts stored on Humanloop.

To better support this setting, we're releasing additional API endpoints and SDK utilities. We've added endpoints that allow you to:

* Retrieve your curated datasets
* Trigger evaluation runs
* Send evaluation results for your datasets generated using your custom evaluators

Below is a code snippet showing how you can use the latest version of the Python SDK to log an evaluation run to a Humanloop project. For a full explanation, see our [guide](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/self-hosted-evaluations) on self-hosted evaluations.

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

API_KEY = ...
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key=API_KEY)

# 1. Retrieve a dataset
DATASET_ID = ...
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.list_datapoints(DATASET_ID).records

# 2. Create an external evaluator
evaluator = humanloop.evaluators.create(
    name="My External Evaluator",
    description="An evaluator that runs outside of Humanloop runtime.",
    type="external",
    arguments_type="target_required",
    return_type="boolean",
)
# Or, retrieve an existing one:
# evaluator = humanloop.evaluators.get(EVALUATOR_ID)

# 3. Retrieve a model config
CONFIG_ID = ...
model_config = humanloop.model_configs.get(CONFIG_ID)

# 4. Create the evaluation run
PROJECT_ID = ...
evaluation_run = humanloop.evaluations.create(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    config_id=CONFIG_ID,
    evaluator_ids=[EVALUATOR_ID],
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
)

# 5. Iterate the datapoints and trigger generations
logs = []
for datapoint in datapoints:
    log = humanloop.chat_model_config(
        project_id=PROJECT_ID,
        model_config_id=model_config.id,
        inputs=datapoint.inputs,
        messages=[
            {key: value for key, value in dict(message).items() if value is not None}
            for message in datapoint.messages
        ],
        source_datapoint_id=datapoint.id,
    ).data[0]
    logs.append((log, datapoint))

# 6. Evaluate the results.
#    In this example, we use an extremely simple evaluation, checking for an exact
#    match between the target and the model's actual output.
for (log, datapoint) in logs:
    # The datapoint target tells us the correct answer.
    target = str(datapoint.target["answer"])

    # The log output is what the model said.
    model_output = log.output

    # The evaluation is a boolean, indicating whether the model was correct.
    result = target == model_output

    # Post the result back to Humanloop.
    evaluation_result_log = humanloop.evaluations.log_result(
        log_id=log.id,
        evaluator_id=evaluator.id,
        evaluation_run_external_id=evaluation_run.id,
        result=result,
    )

# 7. Complete the evaluation run.
humanloop.evaluations.update_status(id=evaluation_run.id, status="completed")

```

## Chat response

We've updated the response models of all of our [/chat](/docs/v4/api/chats/create) API endpoints to include an output message object.

Up to this point, our `chat` and `completion` endpoints had a unified response model, where the `content` of the assistant message returned by OpenAI models was provided in the common `output` field for each returned sample. And any tool calls made were provided in the separate `tool_calls` field.

When making subsequent chat calls, the caller of the API had to use these fields to create a message object to append to the history of messages. So to improve this experience we now added an `output_message` field to the chat response. This is additive and does not represent a breaking change.

**Before:**

```json
{
    "project_id": "pr_GWx6n0lv6xUu3HNRjY8UA",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "data_Vdy9ZoiFv2B7iYLIh15Jj",
            "index": 0,
            "output": "Well, I gotta say, ...",
            "raw_output": "Well, I gotta say...",
            "finish_reason": "length",
            "model_config_id": "config_VZAPd51sJH7i3ZsjauG2Q",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "content": "what's your best guess...",
                    "role": "user",
                }
            ],
            "tool_calls": null
        }
    ],
...
...
...
}
```

**After:**

```json
{
    "project_id": "pr_GWx6n0lv6xUu3HNRjY8UA",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "data_Vdy9ZoiFv2B7iYLIh15Jj",
						"output_message": {
                "content": "Well, I gotta say, ...",
                "name": null,
                "role": "assistant",
                "tool_calls": null
            },
            "index": 0,
            "output": "Well, I gotta say, ...",
            "raw_output": "Well, I gotta say...",
            "finish_reason": "length",
            "model_config_id": "config_VZAPd51sJH7i3ZsjauG2Q",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "content": "what's your best guess...",
                    "role": "user",
                }
            ],
            "tool_calls": null,
        }
    ],

## Snippet tool

*November 28th, 2023*

We've added support for managing common text 'snippets' (or 'passages', or 'chunks') that you want to reuse across your different prompts.

This functionality is provided by our new *Snippet tool*. A Snippet tool acts as a simple key/value store, where the key is the name of the common re-usable text snippet and the value is the corresponding text.

For example, you may have some common persona descriptions that you found to be effective across a range of your LLM features. Or maybe you have some specific formatting instructions that you find yourself re-using again and again in your prompts.

Before now, you would have to copy and paste between your editor sessions and keep track of which projects you edited. Now you can instead inject the text into your prompt using the Snippet tool.

<p>
  Set up the tool
</p>

Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the Snippet tool card.

![](file:75b1c573-54b9-46c0-9574-e7dd385060e0)

When the dialog opens, start adding your key/value pairs. In the example below we've defined an Assistants snippet tool that can be used manage some common persona descriptions we feed to the LLM.

<Info>
  You can have up to 10 key/value snippets in a single snippet tool.
</Info>

The **name** field will be how you'll access this tool in the editor. By setting the value as *assistant* below it means in the editor you'll be able to access this specific tool by using the syntax `{{ assistant(key) }}`.

The **key** is how you'll access the snippet later, so it's recommended to choose something short and memorable.

The **value** is the passage of text that will be included in your prompt when it is sent to the model.

![](file:b0d90171-c833-414c-b4b3-d88fd874a6b1)

<p>
  Use the tool
</p>

Now your Snippets are set up, you can use it to populate strings in your prompt templates across your projects. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. Inside the curly brackets you call the tool.

![](file:d7b4b545-6cbe-4e2d-ba24-0f3554ea045a)

The tool requires an input value to be provided for the key. In our [editor environment](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat.

Above we created an Assistants tool. To use that in an editor you'd use the `{{ <your-tool-name>(key) }}` so in this case it would be `{{ assistant(key) }}`. When adding that you get an inputs field appear where you can specify your `key`, in the screenshot above we used the `helpful` key to access the `You are a helpful assistant. You like to tell jokes and if anyone asks your name is Sam.`string. This input field can be used to experiment with different key/value pairs to find the best one to suit your prompt.

<Warning title="The snippet will only render in the preview after running the chat">
  If you want to see the corresponding snippet to the key you either need to first run the conversation to fetch the string and see it in the preview.
</Warning>

If you have a specific key you would like to hardcode in the prompt, you can define it using the literal key value: `{{ <your-tool-name>("key") }}`, so in this case it would be `{{ assistant("helpful") }}`.

![](file:b8758aca-038e-446b-a7e2-6c39543502b3)

This is particularly useful because you can define passages of text once in a snippet tool and reuse them across multiple prompts, without needing to copy/paste them and manually keep them all in sync.

## Quality-of-life app improvements

*November 22nd, 2023*

We've been shipping some quality-of-life "little big things" to improve your every day usage of the platform.

<p>
  Project switcher throughout the app
</p>

We've added the project switcher throughout the app so its easier to jump between Projects from anywhere

<img src="file:54d9989c-a0e2-4faf-92e3-77855657eae6" alt="The project switcher is now available everywhere." />

<p>
  We've tidied up the Editor
</p>

With all the new capabilities and changes (tools, images and more) we need to keep a tight ship to stop things from becoming too busy.

We're unifying how we show all your logged generations, in the editor, and in the logs and sessions. We've also changed the font to Inter to be legible at small font sizes.

<img src="file:76b4f20b-8fe8-4ed1-8ec1-55625a194f06" alt="The Editor and other places have had a clean up to aid the new capabilites of tool calling and vision." />

<p>
  No more accidental blank messages
</p>

We've also fixed issues where empty messages would get appended to the chat.

<p>
  We've improved keyboard navigation
</p>

The keyboard shortcuts have been updated so its now easier to navigate in the log tables (up/down keys), and to run generations in Editor (cmd/ctrl + enter).

**Thanks for all your requests and tips. Please keep the feedback coming!**

***

## Claude 2.1

*November 21st, 2023*

Today, Anthropic released its latest model, **Claude 2.1**, and we've added support for it in the Humanloop app.

<img src="file:bcccd4e4-4a17-4d34-8449-ca7faa304f11" />

The new model boasts a 200K context window and a reported 2x decrease in hallucination rates.

Additionally, this model introduces tool use to the line-up of Anthropic models. The feature is presently in beta preview, and we'll be adding support for it to Humanloop in the coming days.

Read more about Claude 2.1 in the [official release notes](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1).

***

## Parallel tool calling

*November 20th, 2023*

We've added support for parallel tool calls in our Editor and API.

With the release of the latest OpenAI turbo models, the model can choose to respond with more than one tool call for a given query; this is referred to as [parallel tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/parallel-function-calling).

<p>
  Editor updates
</p>

You can now experiment with this new feature in our Editor:

* Select one of the [new turbo models](/docs/changelog/2023/11#new-openai-turbos) in the model dropdown.
* Specify a tool in your model config on the left hand side.
* Make a request that would require multiple calls to answer correctly.
* As shown here for a weather example, the model will respond with multiple tool calls in the same message

<img src="file:889b8719-7600-4461-9e07-ea868d5163c0" />

<p>
  API implications
</p>

We've added an additional field `tool_calls` to our chat endpoints response model that contains the array of tool calls returned by the model. The pre-existing `tool_call` parameter remains but is now marked as deprecated.

Each element in the `tool_calls` array has an id associated to it. When providing the tool response back to the model for one of the tool calls, the `tool_call_id` must be provided, along with `role=tool` and the `content` containing the tool response.

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

# Initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")

# form of message when providing the tool response to the model
chat_response = humanloop.chat_deployed(
    project_id="<YOUR PROJECT ID>",
  	messages: [
      {
        "role": "tool",
        "content": "Horribly wet"
        "tool_call_id": "call_dwWd231Dsdw12efoOwdd"
      }
   ]
)
```

***

## Python SDK improvements

*November 20th, 2023*

We've improved the response models of our [Python SDK](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-python#raw-http-response) and now give users better control over HTTPs timeout settings.

<p>
  Improved response model types
</p>

As of **versions >= 0.6.0**, our Python SDK methods now return [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models instead of typed dicts. This improves developer ergonomics around typing and validations.

* Previously, you had to use the \[...] syntax to access response values:

```python
chat_response = humanloop.chat(
        # parameters
    )
print(chat_response.project_id)
```

* With Pydantic-based response values, you now can use the . syntax to access response values. To access existing response model from \< 0.6.0, use can still use the .raw namespace as specified in the [Raw HTTP Response section](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-python#raw-http-response).

```python
chat_response = humanloop.chat(
        # parameters
    )
print(chat_response.project_id)
```

> 🚧 Breaking change
>
> Moving to >= 0.6.0 does represent a breaking change in the SDK. The underlying API remains unchanged.

<p>
  Support for timeout parameter
</p>

The default timeout used by [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), which our SDK uses is 300 seconds. For very large prompts and the latest models, this can cause timeout errors to occur.

In the latest version of Python SDKs, we've increased the default timeout value to 600 seconds and you can update this configuration if you are still experiencing timeout issues by passing the new timeout argument to any of the SDK methods. For example passing`timeout=1000` will override the timeout to 1000 seconds.

## Multi-modal models

*November 20th, 2023*

We've introduced support for multi-modal models that can take both text and images as inputs!

We've laid the foundations for multi-modal model support as part of our Editor and API. The first model we've configured is OpenAI's [GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/vision). You can now select `gpt-4-vision-preview` in the models dropdown and add images to your chat messages via the API.

Let us know what other multi-modal models you would like to see added next!

<p>
  Editor quick start
</p>

To get started with GPT-4V, go to the Playground, or Editor within your project.

* Select `gpt-4-vision-preview` in the models dropdown.
* Click the **Add images** button within a user's chat message.
* To add an image, either type a URL into the Image URL textbox or select "Upload image" to upload an image from your computer. If you upload an image, it will be converted to a Base64-encoded data URL that represents the image.
* Note that you can add multiple images

<img src="file:97a1c6ad-38cd-4df0-a009-31e0172d10a0" />

To view the images within a log, find the log within the logs table and click on it to open it in a drawer. The images in each chat message be viewed within this drawer.

<img src="file:83fcb15c-1b65-40e8-9b25-90d614099337" />

<p>
  API quick start
</p>

Assuming you have deployed your `gpt-4-vision-preview` based model config, you can now also include images in messages via the API.

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

# Initialize the Humanloop SDK with your API Keys
humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")

# humanloop.chat_deployed(...) will call the active model config on your project.
chat_response = humanloop.chat_deployed(
    project_id="<YOUR PROJECT ID>",
  	messages: [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "image_url",
            "image_url": {
              "detail": "high",
              "url": "https://www.acomaanimalclinictucson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_288690671-scaled.jpeg"
            }
          }
        ]
)
```

Any generations made will also be viewable from within your projects logs table.

<p>
  Limitations
</p>

There are some know limitations with the current preview iteration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to be aware of:

* Image messages are only supported by the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model in chat mode.
* GPT-4V model does not support tool calling or JSON mode.
* You cannot add images to the first `system` message.

***

## JSON mode and seed parameters

*November 20th, 2023*

We've introduced new model config parameters for **JSON mode** and **Seed** in our Editor and API.

With the introduction of the new [OpenAI turbo models](/docs/changelog/2024/01#support-for-new-openai-models) you can now set additional properties that impact the behaviour of the model; `response_format` and `seed`.

<Note title="Further details">
  >

  See further guidance from OpenAI on the JSON response format [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode) and reproducing outputs using the seed parameter [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/reproducible-outputs).
</Note>

These new parameters can now optionally contribute to your model config in our Editor and API. Updated values for `response_format` or `seed` will constitute new versions of your model on Humanloop.

<img src="file:1f7bbdb5-20ab-4bc3-95f9-6465490f30e3" />

<Warning title="JSON mode prompts">
  When using JSON mode with the new turbo models, you should still include formatting instructions in your prompt.

  In fact, if you do not include the word 'json' anywhere in your prompt, OpenAI will return a validation error currently.
</Warning>

***

## LLM Evaluators

*November 17th, 2023*

Until now, it's been possible to trigger LLM-based evaluations by writing Python code that uses the Humanloop API to trigger the LLM generations.

Today, in order to make this increasingly important workflow simpler and more intuitive, we're releasing **LLM Evaluators**, which require no Python configuration.

From the Evaluations page, click **New Evaluator** and select LLM Evaluator.

<img src="file:1645f6a4-73c1-4902-8500-fba39a6d5c41" alt="You can now choose between the existing Python Evaluators and our new LLM Evaluators." />

Instead of a code editor, the right hand side of the page is now a prompt editor for defining instructions to the LLM Evaluator. Underneath the prompt, you can configure the parameters of the Evaluator (things like model, temperature etc.) just like any normal model config.

<img src="file:e723b368-8459-4f73-99f5-7911a78cee5a" alt="LLM Evaluator Editor." />

In the prompt editor, you have access to a variety of variables that correspond to data from the underlying Log that you are trying to evaluate. These use the usual `{{ variable }}` syntax, and include:

* `log_inputs` - the input variables that were passed in to the prompt template when the Log was generated
* `log_prompt` - the fully populated prompt (if it was a completion mode generation)
* `log_messages` - a JSON representation of the messages array (if it was a chat mode generation)
* `log_output` - the output produced by the model
* `log_error` - if the underlying Log was an unsuccessful generation, this is the error that was produced
* `testcase` - when in offline mode, this is the testcase that was used for the evaluation.

Take a look at some of the presets we've provided on the left-hand side of the page for inspiration.

<img src="file:573a87f9-f245-4245-92a1-c0fe587e4ae4" alt="LLM Evaluator presets. You'll likely need to tweak these to fit your use case." />

At the bottom of the page you can expand the debug console - this can be used verify that your Evaluator is working as intended. We've got further enhancements coming to this part of the Evaluator Editor very soon.

Since an LLM Evaluator is just another model config managed within Humanloop, it gets its own project. When you create an LLM Evaluator, you'll see that a new project is created in your organisation with the same name as the Evaluator. Every time the Evaluator produces a Log as part of its evaluation activity, that output will be visible in the Logs tab of that project.

***

## Improved evaluator editor

*November 17th, 2023*

Given our current focus on delivering a best-in-class evaluations experience, we've promoted the Evaluator editor to a full-page screen in the app.

![](file:42e76609-e0e3-46b9-8393-1f558e417eb7)

In the left-hand pane, you'll find drop-downs to:

* Select the mode of the Evaluator - either Online or Offline, depending on whether the Evaluator is intended to run against pre-defined testcases or against live production Logs
* Select the return type of the Evaluator - either boolean or number

Underneath that configuration you'll find a collection of presets.

<img src="file:213de5c0-b75a-486b-a75d-6db9a4eb70fa" alt="Preset selector." />

***

## Evaluation comparison charts

*November 10th, 2023*

We've added comparison charts to the evaluation runs page to help you better compare your evaluation results. These can be found in the evaluations run tab for each of your projects.

![](file:a5c2530f-ac55-4f8f-95e1-7439737aa50e)

<p>
  Comparing runs
</p>

You can use this to compare specific evaluation runs by selecting those in the runs table. If you don't select any specific rows the charts show an averaged view of all the previous runs for all the evaluators.

![](file:2e4ab4f3-27ec-450f-96b3-adf98866c273)

<p>
  Hiding a chart
</p>

To hide a chart for a specific evaluator you can hide the column in the table and it will hide the corresponding chart.

![](file:e47eb116-3460-4894-981b-ca6d7e1dbeb2)

## Comparison mode in Editor

*November 9th, 2023*

You can now compare generations across Model Configs and inputs in Editor!

![](file:3655f723-0b8f-4865-b3d6-99827ba9520d)

<p>
  Quick start
</p>

To enter comparison mode, click **New panel** in the dropdown menu adds a new blank panel to the right.

**Duplicate panel** adds a new panel containing the same information as your current panel.

\[<img src="file:fe446752-c423-4ad2-90a1-247549535ab7" alt="Clicking **New panel** in the dropdown menu..." />

<img src="file:15446ea5-f8ea-4d05-851f-e5fb716475a3" alt="... will open a new panel to the right." />

Each panel is split into two section: a Model Config section at the top and an Inputs & Chat section at the bottom. These can be collapsed and resized to suit your experimentation.

If you've made changes in one panel, you can copy the changes you've made using the **Copy** button in the subsection's header and paste it in the target panel using its corresponding **Paste** button.

<img src="file:d55778e0-d45c-4574-b848-5931d2eadd92" alt="The **Copy** button on the left panel will copy the new chat template..." />

<img src="file:54315774-545d-4b01-9572-3d0f0ca389be" alt="... and the **Paste** button on the right panel will then update its chat template." />

<p>
  Other changes
</p>

Our recently-introduced local history has also been upgraded to save your full session even when you have multiple panels open.

The toggle to completion mode and the button to open history have now been moved into the new dropdown menu.

<img src="file:2e1c51f5-e60e-44d5-9375-0d036aeb2c3d" />

***

## Improved evaluation runs

*November 8th, 2023*

You can now trigger runs against multiple model configs simultaneously.

This improves your ability to compare and evaluate changes  across your prompts. We've also removed the summary cards. In their place, we've added a table that supports sorting and rearranging of columns to help you better interrogate results.

<p>
  Multiple model configs
</p>

To run evaluations against multiple model configs it's as simple as selecting the targeted model configs in the run dialog, similar to before, but multiple choices are now supported. This will trigger multiple evaluation runs at once, with each model config selected as a target.

![](file:4085331d-32d5-4879-b3a3-dd7dd40e8f36)

<p>
  Evaluation table
</p>

We've updated our evaluation runs with a table to help view the outcomes of runs in a more condensed form. It also allows you to sort results and trigger re-runs easier. As new evaluators are included, a column will be added automatically to the table.

![](file:6ef72686-4f6f-432a-b946-6282f7f26bbe)

<p>
  Re-run previous evaluations
</p>

We've exposed the re-run option in the table to allow you to quickly trigger runs again, or use older runs as a way to preload the dialog and change the parameters such as the target dataset or model config.

![](file:311c4ce5-00bb-49c0-8e53-ba2c14daae4b)

## New OpenAI turbos

Off the back of OpenAI's [dev day](https://devday.openai.com/) we've added support for the new turbo [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) that were announced:

* **gpt-4-1106-preview**
* **gpt-3.5-turbo-1106**

Both of these models add a couple of nice capabilities:

* Better instruction following performance
* JSON mode that forces the model to return valid JSON
* Can call multiple tools at once
* Set a seed for reproducible outputs

You can now access these in your Humanloop Editor and via the API.

<img src="file:7dc2c3a8-05e9-4465-b6a4-aaa102880bb4" />

***

## Improved logs drawer

*November 1st, 2023*

You can now resize the message section in the Logs and Session drawers, allowing you to review your logs more easily.

![](file:eafe4f31-a38f-4958-b8f1-97cd0d004578)

To resize the message section we've introduced a resize bar that you can drag up or down to give yourself the space needed. To reset the layout back to default just give the bar a double click.


# October

## Local editor history

*October 30th, 2023*

The Humanloop playground and editor now save history locally as you make edits, giving you complete peace of mind that your precisely-crafted prompts will not be lost due to an accidental page reload or navigating away.

Local history entries will be saved as you use the playground (e.g. as you modify your model config, make generations, or add messages). These will be visible under the **Local** tab within the history side panel. Local history is saved to your browser and is only visible to you.

Our shared history feature, where all playground generations are saved, has now been moved under the **Shared** tab in the history side panel.

## Project folders

*October 17th, 2023*

You can now organize your projects into folders!

Logging in to Humanloop will bring you to the new page where you can start arranging your projects.

![](file:15b34d13-35a5-4874-8863-be36537c9ad6)

Navigate into folders and open projects by clicking on the row. To go back to a parent folder, click on the displayed breadcrumbs (e.g. "Projects" or "Development" in the above screenshot).

***

<p>
  Search
</p>

Searching will give you a list of directories and projects with a matching name.

<p>
  Moving multiple projects
</p>

You can move a group of projects and directories by selecting them and moving them together.

1. Select the projects you want to move.\
   Tip: Put your cursor on a project row and press \[x] to select the row.
2. To move the selected projects into a folder, drag and drop them into the desired folder.

![](file:adf3a8fc-7021-4c8d-b802-7087a567f8ee)

To move projects out of a folder and into a parent folder, you can drag and drop them onto the parent folder breadcrumbs:

![](file:ae44c584-57de-4024-b774-25d08567d25d)

To move projects into deeply nested folders, it might be easier to select your target directory manually. To do so, select the projects you wish to move and then click the blue **Actions** button and then click **Move ...** to bring up a dialog allowing you to move the selected projects.

## Datasets

*October 16th, 2023*

We've introduced **Datasets** to Humanloop. Datasets are collections of **Datapoints**, which represent input-output pairs for an LLM call.

We recently released **Datasets** in our Evaluations beta, by the name **Evaluation Testsets**. We're now promoting the concept to a first-class citizen within your projects. If you've previously been using testsets in the evaluations beta, you'll see that your testsets have now automatically migrated to datasets.

Datasets can be created via CSV upload, converting from existing Logs in your project, or by API requests.

See our [guides on Datasets](/docs/v4/guides/overview), which show how to upload from CSV and perform a batch generation across the whole dataset.

<img src="file:ca1be318-f578-4172-baca-e8f3c444198e" alt="A single dataset that has been added to a project, with 9 datapoints." />

Clicking into a dataset, you can explore its datapoints.

<img src="file:9a208f4d-cb18-48a9-a18a-9fd7891ce1bd" alt="Datapoints are pre-defined input-output pairs." />

A dataset contains a collection of prompt variable **inputs** (the dynamic values which are interpolated into your model config prompt template at generation-time), as well as a collection of **messages** forming the chat history, and a **target** output with data representing what we expect the model to produce when it runs on those inputs.

Datasets are useful for evaluating the behaviour of you model configs across a well-defined collection of test cases. You can use datasets to check for regressions as you iterate your model configs, knowing that you are checking behaviour against a deterministic collection of known important examples.

Datasets can also be used as collections of input data for **fine-tuning** jobs.

## GET API tool

*October 10th, 2023*

We've added support for a tool that can make GET calls to an external API.

This can be used to dynamically retrieve context for your prompts. For example, you may wish to get additional information about a user from your system based on their ID, or look up additional information based on a query from a user.

To set up the tool you need to provide the following details for your API:

| Tool parameter   | Description                                                                 | Example                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name             | A unique tool name to reference as a call signature in your prompts         | `get_api_tool`                                                       |
| URL              | The URL for your API endpoint                                               | [https://your-api.your-domain.com](https://your-api.your-domain.com) |
| API Key Header   | The authentication header required by your endpoint.                        | `X-API-KEY`                                                          |
| API Key          | The API key value to use in the authentication header.                      | `sk_1234567891011121314`                                             |
| Query parameters | A comma delimited list of the query parameters to set when making requests. | user\_query, client\_id                                              |

<p>
  Define your API
</p>

First you will need to define your API. For demo purposes, we will create a [mock endpoint in postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/). Our [mock endpoint](https://www.postman.com/humanloop/workspace/humanloop/request/12831443-9c48e591-b7b2-4a17-b56a-8050a133e1b5) simply returns details about a mock user given their `user_id`.

A call to our Mock API in Python is as follows; note the query parameter `user_id`

```python
import requests

url = "https://01a02b84-08c5-4e53-b283-a8c2beef331c.mock.pstmn.io/users?user_id=01234567891011"
headers = {
  'X-API-KEY': '<API KEY VALUE>'
}
response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)

```

And returns the response:

```json
{
  "user_id", "012345678910",
  "name": "Albert",
  "company": "Humanloop",
  "role": "Engineer"
}
```

We can now use this tool to inject information for a given user into our prompts.

<p>
  Set up the tool
</p>

Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the `Get API Call ` tool card:

<img src="file:426e84e9-ff84-471e-bfda-ddfc533632da" />

Configure the tool with your API details:

<img src="file:db432bd0-3ff8-41a5-81a2-97066004564a" />

<p>
  Use the tool
</p>

Now your API tool is set up, you can use it to populate input variables in your prompt templates. Double curly bracket syntax is used to call a tool in the template. The call signature is the unique tool name with arguments for the query parameters defined when the tool was set up.

In our mock example, the signature will be:  `get_user_api(user_id)`.

An example prompt template using this tool is:

```shell
You are a helpful assistant. Please draft an example job role summary for the following user:

User details: {{ get_user_api(user_id) }}
Keep it short and concise.
```

The tool requires an input value to be provided for user\_id. In our [playground environment](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) the result of the tool will be shown populated top right above the chat:

<img src="file:471ca580-56a1-47a3-b849-2f5be0b0c023" />

## Evaluations improvements

*September 15th, 2023*

We've released a couple of minor useability improvements in the evaluations workflow.

<p>
  Summary statistics for evaluation runs
</p>

When reviewing past runs of evaluations, you can now see summary statistics for each evaluator before clicking into the detail view, allowing for easier comparison between runs.

![](file:32da5997-5580-44fb-8c8d-93afd4670a10)

## Editor - copy tools

*September 15th, 2023*

Our Editor environment let's users incorporate [OpenAI function calling](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) into their prompt engineering workflows by defining tools. Tools are made available to the model as functions to call using the same universal JSON schema format.

As part of this process it can be helpful to copy the full JSON definition of the tool for quickly iterating on new versions, or copy and pasting it into code. You can now do this directly from the tool definition in Editor:

<img src="file:b7838a75-b900-4b87-afe4-a83efa08cbe9" />

Selecting the Copy button adds the full JSON definition of the tool to your clipboard:

```json
{
  "name": "get_current_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Location",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Unit",
        "enum": [
          "celsius",
          "fahrenheit"
        ]
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "location"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Single sign on (SSO)

*September 15th, 2023*

We've added support for SOO to our signup, login and invite flows. By default users can now use their Gmail accounts to access Humanloop.

For our enterprise customers, this also unlocks the ability for us to more easily support their SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) set ups.

<img src="file:dfd0b410-d88d-48f5-9133-b5d000d4c323" />

***

## Organization slug in URLs

*September 13th, 2023*

We have altered routes specific to your organization to include the organization slug. The organization slug is a unique value that was derived from your organization name when your organization was created.

For project paths we've dropped the `projects` label in favour of a more specific `project` label.

An example of what this looks like can be seen below:

<img src="file:3069b35e-458e-4065-896e-0848babf0d2e" />

<Check title="Existing bookmarks and links will continue to work">
  When a request is made to one of the legacy URL paths, we'll redirect it to the corresponding new path. Although the legacy routes are still supported, we encourage you to update your links and bookmarks to adopt the new naming scheme.
</Check>

<p>
  Updating your organization slug
</p>

The organization slug can be updated by organization administrators. This can be done by navigating to the [general settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/organization) page. Please exercise caution when changing this, as it will affect the URLs across the organization.

# August

## Allow trusted email domains

*August 31st, 2023*

You can now add **trusted email domains** to your organization. Adding trusted email domains allows new users, when creating an account with a matching email, to join your organization without requiring an invite.

<p>
  Managing trusted domains
</p>

Adding and removing trusted email domains is controlled from your organizations [General settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/organization) page.

<Info>
  Only Admins can manage trusted domains for an organization.

## Claude Instant 1.2

*August 15th, 2023*

We've added support for Anthropic's latest model Claude instant 1.2! Claude Instant is the faster and lower-priced yet still very capable model from Anthropic, great for use cases where low latency and high throughput are required.

You can use Claude instant 1.2 directly within the Humanloop playground and deployment workflows.

## Offline evaluations with testsets

*August 14th, 2023*

We're continuing to build and release more functionality to Humanloop's evaluations framework!

Our first release provided the ability to run **online evaluators** in your projects. Online evaluators allow you to monitor the performance of your live deployments by defining functions which evaluate all new datapoints in real time as they get logged to the project.

Today, to augment online evaluators, we are releasing **offline evaluators** as the second part of our evaluations framework.

Offline evaluators provide the ability to test your prompt engineering efforts rigorously in development and CI. Offline evaluators test the performance of your model configs against a pre-defined suite of **testcases** - much like unit testing in traditional programming.

With this framework, you can use test-driven development practices to iterate and improve your model configs, while monitoring for regressions in CI.

To learn more about how to use online and offline evaluators, check out the [Evaluate your model](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/overview) section of our guides.

# July

## Improved error handling

*July 30th, 2023*

We've unified how errors returned by model providers are handled and enabled error monitoring using [eval functions](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/overview).

A common production pain point we see is that hosted SOTA language models can still be flaky at times, especially at real scale. With this release, Humanloop can help users better understand the extent of the problem and guide them to different models choices to improve reliability.

<p>
  Unified errors
</p>

Our users integrate the Humanloop `/chat` and `/completion` API endpoints as a unified interface into all the popular model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere, etc. Their Humanloop projects can then be used to manage model experimentation, versioning, evaluation and deployment.

Errors returned by these endpoints may be raised by the model provider's system. With this release we've updated our API to map all the error behaviours from different model providers to a unified set of [error response codes](/docs/v4/errors).

We've also extended our error responses to include more details of the error with fields for `type`, `message`, `code` and `origin`. The `origin` field indicates if the error originated from one of the integrated model providers systems, or directly from Humanloop.

For example, for our `/chat ` endpoint where we attempt to call OpenAI with an invalid setting for `max_tokens`, the message returned is that raised by OpenAI and the origin is set to OpenAI.

```json
{
  "type": "unprocessable_entity_error",
  "message": "This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, you requested 10000012 tokens (12 in the messages, 10000000 in the completion). Please reduce the length of the messages or completion.",
  "code": 422,
  "origin": "OpenAI"
}
```

<p>
  Monitor model reliability with evals
</p>

With this release, all errors returned from the different model providers are now persisted with the corresponding input data as datapoints on Humanloop. Furthermore this error data is made available to use within [evaluation functions](/docs/v4/guides/evaluation/overview).

You can now turn on the **Errors** eval function, which tracks overall error rates of the different model variations in your project. Or you can customise this template to track more specific error behaviour.

<img src="file:f2d9ee07-d245-4a8e-b384-b8ddaa62f885" alt="Errors evaluation function template now available" />

## OpenAI functions in Playground

*July 25th, 2023*

We've added support for [OpenAI functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) to our playground!

This builds on our [API support](https://humanloop.com/docs/changelog/2023/07#openai-functions-api) and allows you to easily experiment with OpenAI functions within our playground UI.

OpenAI functions are implemented as [tools](https://humanloop.com/docs/guides/set-up-semantic-search) on Humanloop. Tools follow the same universal [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition as OpenAI functions. You can now define tools as part of your model configuration in the playground. These tools are sent as OpenAI functions when running the OpenAI chat models that support function calling.

The model can choose to return a JSON object containing the arguments needed to call a function. This object is displayed as a special assistant message within the playground. You can then provide the result of the call in a message back to the model to consider, which simulates the function calling workflow.

<p>
  Use tools in Playground
</p>

Take the following steps to use tools for function calling in the playground:

1. **Find tools:** Navigate to the playground and locate the `Tools` section. This is where you'll be able to manage your tool definitions.

![](file:eb9d2753-aee5-469c-ac91-ee9234aca950)

2. **Create a new tool:** Click on the "Add Tool" button. There are two options in the dropdown: create a new tool or to start with one of our examples. You define your tool using the [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) syntax. This represents the function definition sent to OpenAI.

![](file:53628297-b7c5-44cd-8e2b-35b41650f367)

3. **Edit a tool:** To edit an existing tool, simply click on the tool in the Tools section and make the necessary changes to its json-schema definition. This will result in a new model configuration.

![](file:a2c169a9-80ab-43b0-8103-cd0448389fe3)

4. **Run a model with tools:** Once you've defined your tools, you can run the model by pressing the "Run" button.
   1. If the model chooses to call a function, an assistant message will be displayed with the corresponding tool name and arguments to use.
   2. A subsequent `Tool` message is then displayed to simulate sending the results of the call back to the model to consider.

![](file:0d580a84-9790-4aa5-8f2f-6b1e6ddeb7be)

5. **Save your model config with tools** by using the **Save** button. Model configs with tools defined can then deployed to [environments](/docs/guides/deploy-to-an-environment) as normal.

**Coming soon**

Provide the runtime for your tool under the existing pre-defined [Tools section ](https://app.humanloop.com/tools) of your organization on Humanloop.

## Evaluators

*July 7th, 2023*

We've added **Evaluators** to Humanloop in beta!

Evaluators allow you to quantitatively define what constitutes a good or bad output from your models. Once set up, you can configure an Evaluators to run automatically across all new datapoints as they appear in your project; or, you can simply run it manually on selected datapoints from the **Data** tab.

We're going to be adding lots more functionality to this feature in the coming weeks, so check back for more!

<p>
  Create an Evaluator
</p>

If you've been given access to the feature, you'll see a new **Evaluations** tab in the Humanloop app. To create your first evaluation function, select **+ New Evaluator**. In the dialog, you'll be presented with a library of example Evaluators, or you can start from scratch.

<img src="file:4f5fce8d-9914-429b-aefb-4855aaa0ca5b" alt="We offer a library of example Evaluators to get you started." />

We'll pick **Valid JSON** for this guide.

<img src="file:54f8a2ec-e68c-4968-87fb-5cdf95f34b7a" alt="Evaluator editor." />

In the editor, provide details of your function's name, description and return type. In the code editor, you can provide a function which accepts a `datapoint` argument and should return a value of the chosen type.

Currently, the available return types for an Evaluators are `number` and `boolean`. You should ensure that your function returns the expected data type - an error will be raised at runtime if not.

<p>
  The 

  `Datapoint`

   argument
</p>

The `datapoint` passed into your function will be a Python `dict` with the following structure.

```python
{
    "id":"data_XXXX",          # Datapoint id
    "model_config": {...},     # Model config used to generate the datapoint
    "inputs": {...},           # Model inputs (interpolated into the prompt)
    "output": "...",           # Generated output from the model
    "provider_latency": 0.6,   # Provider latency in seconds
    "metadata": {...},         # Additional metadata attached to the logged datapoint
    "created_at": "...",       # Creation timestamp
    "feedback": [...]          # Array of feedback provided on the datapoint
}
```

To inspect datapoint dictionaries in more detail, click **Random selection** in the debug console at the bottom of the window. This will load a random set of five datapoints from your project, exactly as they will be passed into the Evaluation Function.

<img src="file:699d9061-83f0-4516-bce6-46c3643fd9f5" alt="The debug console - load datapoints to inspect the argument passed into Evaluators." />

For this demo, we've created a prompt which asks the model to produce valid JSON as its output. The Evaluator uses a simple `json.loads` call to determine whether the output is validly formed JSON - if this call raises an exception, it means that the output is not valid JSON, and we return `False`.

```python
import json
    
def check_valid_json(datapoint):
    try:
        return json.loads(datapoint["output"]) is not None
    except:
        return False
```

<p>
  Debugging
</p>

Once you have drafted a Python function, try clicking the run button next to one of the debug datapoints in the debug console. You should shortly see the result of executing your function on that datapoint in the table.

<img src="file:3513db6a-806e-4278-92bc-63fa4e2133f9" alt="A `True` result from executing the **Valid JSON** Evaluators on the datapoint. " />

If your Evaluator misbehaves, either by being invalid Python code, raising an unhandled exception or returning the wrong type, an error will appear in the result column. You can hover this error to see more details about what went wrong - the exception string is displayed in the tooltip.

Once you're happy with your Evaluator, click **Create** in the bottom left of the dialog.

<p>
  Activate / Deactivate an Evaluator
</p>

Your Evaluators are available across all your projects. When you visit the **Evaluations** tab from a specific project, you'll see all Evaluators available in your organisation.

Each Evaluator has a toggle. If you toggle the Evaluator **on**, it will run on every new datapoint that gets logged to **that** project. (Switch to another project and you'll see that the Evaluator is not yet toggled on if you haven't chosen to do so).

You can deactivate an Evaluator for a project by toggling it back off at any time.

<p>
  Aggregations and Graphs
</p>

At the top of the **Dashboard** tab, you'll see new charts for each activated Evaluation Function. These display aggregated Evaluation results through time for datapoints in the project.

At the bottom of the **Dashboard** tab is a table of all the model configs in your project. That table will display a column for each activated Evaluator in the project. The data displayed in this column is an aggregation of all the Evaluation Results (by model config) for each Evaluator. This allows you to assess the relative performance of your models.

<img src="file:0975737b-1db4-4180-b75e-90b8412076a9" alt="Evaluation Results through time, by model config. In this example, one of the model configs is not producing Valid JSON outputs, while the other is about 99% of the time." />

<p>
  Aggregation
</p>

For the purposes of both the charts and the model configs table, aggregations work as follows for the different return types of Evaluators:

* `Boolean`: percentage returning `True` of the total number of evaluated datapoints
* `Number`: average value across all evaluated datapoints

<p>
  Data logs
</p>

In the **Data** tab, you'll also see that a column is visible for each activated Evaluator, indicating the result of running the function on each datapoint.

<img src="file:a1b04d4a-136b-49f0-9290-f57c60157fde" alt="The **Data** tab for a project, showing the **Valid JSON** Evaluation Results for a set of datapoints." />

From this tab, you can choose to re-run an Evaluator on a selection of datapoints. Either use the menu at the far right of a single datapoint, or select multiple datapoints and choose **Run evals** from the **Actions** menu in the top right.

<p>
  Available Modules
</p>

The following Python modules are available to be imported in your Evaluation Function:

* `math`
* `random`
* `datetime`
* `json` (useful for validating JSON grammar as per the example above)
* `jsonschema` (useful for more fine-grained validation of JSON output - see the in-app example)
* `sqlglot` (useful for validating SQL query grammar)
* `requests` (useful to make further LLM calls as part of your evaluation - see the in-app example for a suggestion of how to get started).

Let us know if you would like to see more modules available.

## Chain LLM calls

*July 5th, 2023*

We've introduced sessions to Humanloop, allowing you to link multiple calls together when building a chain or agent.

Using sessions with your LLM calls helps you troubleshoot and improve your chains and agents.

<img src="file:08c3de04-a6c6-4155-8fe6-e1d6689a458a" alt="Trace of an Agent's steps logged as a session" />

<p>
  Adding a datapoint to a session
</p>

To log your LLM calls to a session, you just need to define a unique identifier for the session and pass it into your Humanloop calls with `session_reference_id`.

For example, using `uuid4()` to generate this ID,

```python
import uuid
session_reference_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

response = humanloop.complete(
    project="sessions_example_assistant",
    model_config={
        "prompt_template": "Question: {{user_request}}\nGoogle result: {{google_answer}}\nAnswer:\n",
        "model": "text-davinci-002",
        "temperature": 0,
    },
    inputs={"user_request": user_request, "google_answer": google_answer},
    session_reference_id=session_reference_id,
)
```

Similarly, our other methods such as `humanloop.complete_deployed()`, `humanloop.chat()`, and `humanloop.log()` etc. support `session_reference_id`.

If you're using our API directly, you can pass `session_reference_id` within the request body in your `POST /v4/completion` etc. endpoints.

<p>
  Further details
</p>

For a more detailed walkthrough on how to use `session_reference_id`, check out [our guide](/docs/guides/logging-session-traces) that runs through how to record datapoints to a session in an example script.

## Introducing Tools

*July 3rd, 2023*

Today we’re announcing Tools as a part of Humanloop.

Tools allow you to connect an LLM to any API and to an array of data sources to give it extra capabilities and access to private data. Under your organization settings on Humanloop you can now configure and manage tools in a central place.

Read more on [our blog](https://humanloop.com/blog/announcing-tools) and see an example of setting up a [tool for semantic search](/docs/guides/set-up-semantic-search).

***

## OpenAI functions API

*July 3rd, 2023*

We've updated our APIs to support [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docsgpt/function-calling).

OpenAI functions are now supported as tools on Humanloop. This allows you to pass tool definitions as part of the model configuration when calling our `chat` and `log` endpoints. For the latest OpenAI models `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` the model can then choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call these tools.

This unlocks getting more reliable structured data back from the model and makes it easier to create useful agents.

<p>
  Recap on OpenAI functions
</p>

As described in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docsgpt/function-calling), the basic steps for using functions are:

1. Call one of the models `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` with a user query and a set of function definitions described using the universal [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) syntax.
2. The model can then choose to call one of the functions provided. If it does, a stringified JSON object adhering to your json schema definition will be returned.
3. You can then parse the string into JSON in your code and call the chosen function with the provided arguments (**NB:** the model may hallucinate or return invalid json, be sure to consider these scenarios in your code).
4. Finally call the model again by appending the function response as a new message. The model can then use this information to respond to the original use query.

OpenAI have provided a simple example in their docs for a `get_current_weather` function that we will show how to adapt to use with Humanloop:

```python
import openai
import json


# Example dummy function hard coded to return the same weather
# In production, this could be your backend API or an external API
def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""
    weather_info = {
        "location": location,
        "temperature": "72",
        "unit": unit,
        "forecast": ["sunny", "windy"],
    }
    return json.dumps(weather_info)


def run_conversation():
    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston?"}]
    functions = [
        {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    },
                    "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]},
                },
                "required": ["location"],
            },
        }
    ]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
        messages=messages,
        functions=functions,
        function_call="auto",  # auto is default, but we'll be explicit
    )
    response_message = response["choices"][0]["message"]

    # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a function
    if response_message.get("function_call"):
        # Step 3: call the function
        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors
        available_functions = {
            "get_current_weather": get_current_weather,
        }  # only one function in this example, but you can have multiple
        function_name = response_message["function_call"]["name"]
        fuction_to_call = available_functions[function_name]
        function_args = json.loads(response_message["function_call"]["arguments"])
        function_response = fuction_to_call(
            location=function_args.get("location"),
            unit=function_args.get("unit"),
        )

        # Step 4: send the info on the function call and function response to GPT
        messages.append(response_message)  # extend conversation with assistant's reply
        messages.append(
            {
                "role": "function",
                "name": function_name,
                "content": function_response,
            }
        )  # extend conversation with function response
        second_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
            messages=messages,
        )  # get a new response from GPT where it can see the function response
        return second_response


print(run_conversation())
```

<p>
  Using with Humanloop tools
</p>

OpenAI functions are treated as tools on Humanloop. Tools conveniently follow the same universal json-schema definition as OpenAI functions.

We've expanded the definition of our model configuration to also include tool definitions. Historically the model config is made up of the chat template, choice of base model and any hyper-parameters that change the behaviour of the model.

In the cases of OpenAIs `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` models, any tools defined as part of the model config are passed through as functions for the model to use.

You can now specify these tools when using the Humanloop chat endpoint (as a replacement for OpenAI's ChatCompletion), or when using the Humanloop log endpoint in addition to the OpenAI calls:

<p>
  Chat endpoint
</p>

We show here how to update the `run_conversation()` method from the OpenAI example to instead use the Humanloop chat endpoint with tools:

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

hl = Humanloop(
  	# get your API key here: https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

def run_conversation():
    # Step 1: send the conversation and available functions to GPT
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston?"}]
    # functions are referred to as tools on Humanloop, but follows the same schema
		tools = [
        {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    },
                    "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]},
                },
                "required": ["location"],
            },
        }
    ]
    response = hl.chat(
      project="Assistant",
      model_config={
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
      	"tools": tools
      },
      messages=messages
    )
    response = response.body.data[0]

    # Step 2: check if GPT wanted to call a tool
    if response.get("tool_call"):
        # Step 3: call the function
        # Note: the JSON response may not always be valid; be sure to handle errors
        available_functions = {
            "get_current_weather": get_current_weather,
        }  # only one function in this example, but you can have multiple
        function_name = response_message["function_call"]["name"]
        fuction_to_call = available_functions[function_name]
        function_args = json.loads(response["tool_call"]["arguments"])
        function_response = fuction_to_call(
            location=function_args.get("location"),
            unit=function_args.get("unit"),
        )

        # Step 4: send the response back to the model
        messages.append(response_message)
        messages.append(
            {
                "role": "tool",
                "name": function_name,
                "content": function_response,
            }
        )
        second_response = hl.chat(
          project="Assistant",
          model_config={
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
            "tools": tools
          },
          messages=messages
        )
        return second_response
```

After running this snippet, the model configuration recorded on your project in Humanloop will now track what tools were provided to the model and the logged datapoints will provide details of the tool called to inspect:

<p>
  Log endpoint
</p>

Alternatively, you can also use the explicit Humanloop log alongside your existing OpenAI calls to achieve the same result:

```python
from humanloop import Humanloop

hl = Humanloop(
  	# get your API key here: https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

    functions = [

                    "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]},
                },
                "required": ["location"],
            },
        }
    ]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
        messages=messages,
        functions=functions,
        function_call="auto",  # auto is default, but we'll be explicit
    )
    response_message = response["choices"][0]["message"]

		# log the result to humanloop
    log_response = hl.log(
       project="Assistant",
          model_config={
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",

Support for defining tools in the playground!


# June

## Deployment environments

*July 27th, 2023*

We've added support for environments to your deployments in Humanloop!

This enables you to deploy your model configurations to specific environments. You'll no longer have to duplicate your projects to manage the deployment workflow between testing and production. With environments, you'll have the control required to manage the full LLM deployment lifecycle.

<p>
  Enabling environments for your organisation
</p>

Every organisation automatically receives a default production environment. For any of your existing projects that had active deployments define, these have been automatically migrated over to use the default environment with no change in behaviour for the APIs.

You can create additional environments with custom names by visiting your organisation's [environments page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments).

<p>
  Creating an environment
</p>

Enter a custom name in the create environment dialog. Names have a constraint in that they must be unique within an organisation.

![](file:3b32f3dd-9a68-4f00-909b-e7e07b16ace8)

The environments you define for your organisation will be available for each project and can be viewed in the project dashboard once created.

![](file:f5e5fabf-6f81-4eb8-a6cb-5eb66d9b6d53)

<p>
  The default environment
</p>

By default, the production environment is marked as the Default environment. This means that all API calls targeting the "Active Deployment," such as [Get Active Config](/docs/v4/api/projects/active-config/get) or [Chat Deployed](/docs/v4/api/chats/create-deployed) will use this environment.

<Warning>
  Renaming environments will take immediate effect, so ensure that this change is planned and does not disrupt your production workflows.
</Warning>

<p>
  Using environments
</p>

Once created on the environments page, environments can be used for each project and are visible in the respective project dashboards.

You can deploy directly to a specific environment by selecting it in the **Deployments** section.

![](file:53e761ac-b158-400f-8d19-22170d71465f)

Alternatively, you can deploy to multiple environments simultaneously by deploying a Model Config from either the Editor or the Model Configs table.

<p>
  Using environments via API
</p>

![](file:c632bb36-8e9a-4c30-8d0d-cddc7346d113)

For v4.0 API endpoints that support Active Deployments, such as [Get Active Config](/docs/v4/api/projects/active-config/get) or [Chat Deployed](/docs/v4/api/chats/create-deployed), you can now optionally point to a model configuration deployed in a specific environment by including an optional additional `environment` field.

You can find this information in our v4.0 API Documentation or within the environment card in the Project Dashboard under the "Use API" option.

Clicking on the "Use API" option will provide code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the `environment` variable in practice.

## Improved Python SDK streaming response

*July 20th, 2023*

We've improved our Python SDK's streaming response to contain the datapoint ID. Using the ID, you can now provide feedback to datapoints created through streaming.

The `humanloop.chat_stream()` and `humanloop.complete_stream()` methods now yield a dictionary with `output` and `id`.

```python
{'output': '...', 'id': 'data_...'}
```

Install the updated SDK with

```shell
pip install --upgrade humanloop
```

<p>
  Example snippet
</p>

```
import asyncio
from humanloop import Humanloop

humanloop = Humanloop(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    openai_api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
)

async def main():
    response = await humanloop.chat_stream(
        project="sdk-example",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Explain asynchronous programming.",
            }
        ],
        model_config={
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "max_tokens": -1,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "chat_template": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant who replies in the style of {{persona}}.",
                },
            ],
        },
        inputs={
            "persona": "the pirate Blackbeard",
        },
    )
    async for token in response.content:
        print(token)  # E.g. {'output': 'Ah', 'id': 'data_oun7034jMNpb0uBnb9uYx'}

asyncio.run(main())
```

## OpenAI Azure support

*July 20th, 2023*

We've just added support for Azure deployments of OpenAI models to Humanloop!

This update adds the ability to target Microsoft Azure deployments of OpenAI models to the playground and your projects. To set this up, visit your [organization's settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys).

<p>
  Enabling Azure OpenAI for your organization
</p>

As a prerequisite, you will need to already be setup with Azure OpenAI Service. See the [Azure OpenAI docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) for more details. At the time of writing, access is granted by application only.

![](file:b85c45d2-b7e3-4815-91ec-72e9887c38a0)

Click the Setup button and provide your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.

Your endpoint can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com.

Your API keys can also be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.

<p>
  Working with Azure OpenAI models
</p>

Once you've successfully enabled Azure OpenAI for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the [playground](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) and in your projects in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.

<img src="file:fe66cb17-7253-456a-ac0c-095c9b46cdfc" />

<p>
  REST API and Python / TypeScript support
</p>

As with other model providers, once you've set up an Azure OpenAI-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop [REST API or our SDKs](/docs/v4/sdk).

```typescript
import { Humanloop } from "humanloop";

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
  apiKey: "API_KEY",
});

const chatResponse = await humanloop.chat({
  project: "project_example",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Write me a song",
    },
  ],
  provider_api_keys: {
    openai_azure: OPENAI_AZURE_API_KEY,
    openai_azure_endpoint: OPENAI_AZURE_ENDPOINT,
  },
  model_config: {
    model: "my-azure-deployed-gpt-4",
    temperature: 1,
  },
});

console.log(chatResponse);
```

In the `model_config.model` field, provide the name of the model that you deployed from the Azure portal (see note below for important naming conventions when setting up your deployment in the Azure portal).

The request will use the stored organization level key and endpoint you configured above, unless you override this on a per-request basis by passing both the endpoint and API key in the `provider_api_keys` field, as shown in the example above.

<p>
  Note: Naming Model Deployments
</p>

When you deploy a model through the Azure portal, you'll have the ability to provide your deployment with a unique name. For instance, if you choose to deploy an instance of `gpt-35-turbo` in your OpenAI Service, you may choose to give this an arbitrary name like `my-orgs-llm-model`.

In order to use all Humanloop features with your Azure model deployment, you must ensure that your deployments are named either with an unmodified base model name like `gpt-35-turbo`, or the base model name with a custom prefix like `my-org-gpt-35-turbo`. If your model deployments use arbitrary names which do not prefix a base model name, you may find that certain features such as setting `max_tokens=-1` in your model configs fail to work as expected.

## Project Editor

*July 13th, 2023*

We've introduced an Editor within each project to help you make it easier to to change prompts and bring in project specific data.

<img src="file:d3fdb3ea-af9e-420f-9ce2-8fd81f636a87" alt="The Editor will load up the currently active model config, and will save the generations in the project's data table." />

You can now also bring datapoints directly to the Editor. Select any datapoints you want to bring to Editor (also through `x` shortcut) and you can choose to open them in Editor (or `e` shortcut)

<img src="file:a8e5a4d3-eb4c-4b32-b9fd-12b210f4c469" alt="Press `e` while selecting a datapoint to bring it into Editor" />

We think this workflow significantly improves the workflow to go from interesting datapoint to improved model config. As always, let us know if you have other feedback.


# May

## Cohere

\_ May 23rd, 2023\_

We've just added support for Cohere to Humanloop!

<img src="file:3e2d54ab-ad97-4bcf-9e4d-58087bcddfaa" />

This update adds Cohere models to the playground and your projects - just add your Cohere API key in your [organization's settings](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys). As with other providers, each user in your organization can also set a personal override API key, stored locally in the browser, for use in Cohere requests from the Playground.

<p>
  Enabling Cohere for your organization
</p>

<img src="file:5cbb7285-e85f-4584-bbc2-58e0fbd60c08" alt="Add your Cohere API key to your organization settings to start using Cohere models with Humanloop." />

<p>
  Working with Cohere models
</p>

Once you've successfully enabled Cohere for your organization, you'll be able to access it through the [playground](https://app.humanloop.com/playground) and in your projects, in exactly the same way as your existing OpenAI and/or Anthropic models.

<img src="file:2156d267-2a96-4ba5-9f95-fc9698043971" />

<p>
  REST API and Python / TypeScript support
</p>

As with other model providers, once you've set up a Cohere-backed model config, you can call it with the Humanloop [REST API or our SDKs](/docs/v5/sdk).

```typescript
import { Humanloop } from "humanloop";

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
  apiKey: "API_KEY",
});

const chatResponse = await humanloop.chat({
  project: "project_example",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Write me a song",
    },
  ],
  provider_api_keys: {
    cohere: COHERE_API_KEY,
  },
  model_config: {
    model: "command",
    temperature: 1,
  },
});

console.log(chatResponse);
```

If you don't provide a Cohere API key under the `provider_api_keys` field, the request will fall back on the stored organization level key you configured above.

## Improved Python SDK

*May 17th, 2023*

We've just released a new version of our Python SDK supporting our v4 API!

This brings support for:

* 💬 Chat mode `humanloop.chat(...)`
* 📥 Streaming support `humanloop.chat_stream(...)`
* 🕟 Async methods `humanloop.acomplete(...)`

[https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/)

<p>
  Installation
</p>

`pip install --upgrade humanloop`

<p>
  Example usage
</p>

```python
complete_response = humanloop.complete(
  project="sdk-example",
  inputs={
    "text": "Llamas that are well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning and are very friendly and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.[33]",
  },
  model_config={
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "max_tokens": -1,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "prompt_template": "Summarize this for a second-grade student:\n\nText:\n{{text}}\n\nSummary:\n",
  },
  stream=False,
)
pprint(complete_response)
pprint(complete_response.project_id)
pprint(complete_response.data[0])
pprint(complete_response.provider_responses)
```

<p>
  Migration from 

  `0.3.x`
</p>

For those coming from an older SDK version, this introduces some breaking changes. A brief highlight of the changes:

* The client initialization step of `hl.init(...)` is now `humanloop = Humanloop(...)`.
  * Previously `provider_api_keys` could be provided in `hl.init(...)`. They should now be provided when constructing `Humanloop(...)` client.
  * ```python
    humanloop = Humanloop(
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        openai_api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
        anthropic_api_key="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
    )
    ```
* `hl.generate(...)`'s various call signatures have now been split into individual methods for clarity. The main ones are:
  * `humanloop.complete(project, model_config={...}, ...)` for a completion with the specified model config parameters.
  * `humanloop.complete_deployed(project, ...)` for a completion with the project's active deployment.


# April

## TypeScript SDK

*April 3rd, 2023*

We now have a fully typed TypeScript SDK to make working with Humanloop even easier.

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop)

You can use this with your JavaScript, TypeScript or Node projects.

**Installation**

```shell
npm i humanloop
```

**Example usage**

```typescript
import { Humanloop } from "humanloop"

const humanloop = new Humanloop({
  // Defining the base path is optional and defaults to https://api.humanloop.com/v3
  // basePath: "https://api.humanloop.com/v3",
  apiKey: 'API_KEY',
})


const chatResponse = await humanloop.chat({
  "project": "project_example",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write me a song",
    }
  ],
  "provider_api_keys": {
    "openai": OPENAI_API_KEY
  },
  "model_config": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 1,
  },
})

console.log(chatResponse)
```


# March

## Keyboard shortcuts and datapoint links

*March 30th, 2023*

<img src="file:bb482fba-e170-4754-a23a-ff0e9a063c31" />

We've added keyboard shortcuts to the datapoint viewer

`g` for good\
`b` for bad

and `j` /` k` for next/prev

This should help you for quickly annotating data within your team.

You can also link to specific datapoint in the URL now as well.

# February

## Faster datapoints table loading

*February 20th, 2023*

Initial datapoints table is now twice as fast to load! And it will continue to get faster.

***

## Ability to open datapoint in playground

*February 20th, 2023*

Added a way to go from the datapoint drawer to the playground with that datapoint loaded. Very convenient for trying tweaks to a model config or understanding an issue, without copy pasting.

## Markdown view and completed prompt templates

*February 20th, 2023*

We've added a tab to the datapoint drawer so you can see the prompt template filled in with the inputs and output.

We've also button in the top right hand corner (or press `M`)  to toggle on/off viewing the text as markdown.
