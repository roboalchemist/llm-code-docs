Generate an SBOM of target directory using CycloneDX

This calls [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)  which will generate an SBOM of a directory of your choosing. This [SBOM](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) ("Software Bill of Materials") is a report of all the pieces that your software uses. This report can tell us what pieces of software you use so we can scan them for malware and report back to you.

We leverage [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) to generate this SBOM for various ecosystems. The command basically forwards the call directly so more details on this command like flags, options, and usage are more likely to be found on [https://cyclonedx.org/](https://cyclonedx.org/)

Note: all suggested cdxgen commands imply that you put "socket" before them, like `socket cdxgen -t java`

```
