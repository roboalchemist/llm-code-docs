# Running Jaeger

The easiest way to run Jaeger is by using Docker compose. If you have docker installed, it is a matter of running this docker-compose.yaml file:

```yaml
services:
  jaeger:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    container_name: BullMQ_with_opentelemetry_jaeger
    ports:
      - '4318:4318'
      - '16686:16686'

```

Note that we need to expose 2 ports here, the first (4318) one is the endpoint to export our traces and the second one (16686) is our UI.

You can now just run this service with:

```
docker-compose up
```

In a few seconds the image will be up and running. You can verify that is working by opening a browser window and pointing it to [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686/search)

As no traces has been created yet you will get a quite empty dashboard:
