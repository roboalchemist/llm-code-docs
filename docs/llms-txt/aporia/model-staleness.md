# Model Staleness

### Why Monitor Model Staleness?

Monitoring the last time a model version was deployed helps track models that do not meet the organization's policy, or require high attention to track metrics and changes.

### Configuring your monitor

The monitor will raise an alert when the model version is older than the specified time period.

You can choose time granularity to be hour, day, week or month.
