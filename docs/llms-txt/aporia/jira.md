# JIRA

You can easily integrate Aporia with JIRA to create JIRA issues from Aporia alerts.

Integrations can be found on the "Integrations" page, accessible through the sidebar:

![All Integrations](https://1009457926-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FCiBXs570GNM7Jbx4EBQ9%2Fuploads%2FogmjRuZ5XbmPSJwXoBPm%2Fall_integrations.png?alt=media)

### Setting up the JIRA Integration

After clicking the JIRA integration you will be redirected to JIRA, where you will need to allow Aporia to create issues in your project. Clicking "Accept" will redirect you back to Aporia.

You can now go to the [Alerts](https://app.aporia.com/alerts) page and click the JIRA icon in order to create a JIRA issue from an alert:
