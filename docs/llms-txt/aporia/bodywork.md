[Bodywork](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) deploys machine learning projects developed in Python to Kubernetes. \
It helps you:

* serve models as microservices
* execute batch jobs
* run reproducible pipelines

On demand, or on schedule, Bodywork automates repetitive DevOps tasks and frees machine learning engineers to focus on what they do best - solve data problems with machine learning.

### Aporia & Bodywork Integration

This integration enables you to easily monitor models deployed with Bodywork for issues such as model drift, performance degradation, and more.
