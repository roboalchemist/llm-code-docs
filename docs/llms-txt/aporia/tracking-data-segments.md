# Tracking Data Segments

Sometimes looking over our entire data doesn't supply us with enough insights to understand what is best to do. We need the ability to break our data into smaller pieces to reach valuable and sharp insights.

This is exactly when data segmentation jumps to our help!

Zooming into a specific data segment can help us understand if our overall performance degradation originates just in that segment or do we have a wide problem. Comparing two different segments can help us decide which one of them is more valuable to invest in our future campaign.

### Tracking Data Segments

There are infinite ways to segment your data. Let us say we want to segment our subjects by their age. What interval between bins should we choose? should that interval be constant or maybe correlating to a real-world segmentation?

Don't be tempted to create them all. Think about what segmentation choice can help you answer real valuable questions that may influence the actions you'll take.

For example, gender is often just raw data and not a feature, but slicing your data by gender can help you surface performance differences or even biases. In such cases, you should consider even monitoring specific issues by segments.
