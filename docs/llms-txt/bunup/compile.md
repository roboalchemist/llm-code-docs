# Compile to Executable

Bunup supports creating standalone executables using the `compile` option. This allows you to bundle your code and the Bun runtime into a single executable file that can be distributed and run without requiring Bun to be installed.

## Use Case

The `compile` option is useful when you want to:

* Distribute CLI tools that users can run without installing Bun
* Create standalone executables for scripts and utilities
* Package your code with all dependencies included

## Output Directory

Compiled executables output to `bin/` by default, unlike normal builds which output to `dist/` by default. If you want to change the output location, you can use the `outDir` option to specify a different directory like `dist/` or any other location.

## Basic Usage

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
	entry: "src/cli.ts",
	compile: true, // Create executable for current platform
});
```

This will output the executable to the `bin/` directory.

## Customizing Output Directory

You can change the output directory using the `outDir` option:

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
	entry: "src/cli.ts",
	compile: true,
	outDir: "dist", // Output to dist/ instead of bin/
});
```

## Cross-Compilation

Target specific platforms:

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
	entry: "src/cli.ts",
	compile: "bun-linux-x64", // Cross-compile for Linux
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
	entry: "src/cli.ts",
	compile: {
		target: "bun-linux-x64",
		outfile: "./bin/my-app",
		windows: {
			hideConsole: true,
			icon: "./icon.ico",
		},
	},
});
```

## Multiple Entrypoints

Only one entrypoint can be compiled at a time. If you want to compile multiple entrypoints, you need to use a build config array with separate configurations:

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig([
	{
		name: "main",
		entry: "src/main.ts",
		compile: true,
	},
	{
		name: "cli",
		entry: "src/cli.ts",
		compile: {
			outfile: "my-cli",
		},
	},
]);
```

This will create separate executables for each entrypoint.

## Cross-Compiling for Multiple Targets

If you want to cross-compile the same entrypoint for multiple targets, or use different configurations for different targets, you can create separate objects in the config array:

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig([
	{
		name: "cli-linux",
		entry: "src/cli.ts",
		compile: "bun-linux-x64",
	},
	{
		name: "cli-windows",
		entry: "src/cli.ts",
		compile: {
			target: "bun-windows-x64",
			outfile: "./bin/my-app-windows.exe",
			windows: {
				hideConsole: true,
				icon: "./icon.ico",
			},
		},
	},
	{
		name: "cli-macos",
		entry: "src/cli.ts",
		compile: {
			target: "bun-darwin-arm64",
			outfile: "./bin/my-app-macos",
		},
	},
]);
```

This approach allows you to:

* Build executables for multiple platforms in a single build command
* Apply platform-specific configurations (like Windows console hiding or custom icons)
* Customize the output filename for each target platform

## Mixing Executables and Library Builds

You can also mix executable compilation with normal library builds in the same config array. This is useful when you want to build both a library and CLI tools:

```typescript [bunup.config.ts]
export default defineConfig([
	{
		name: "library",
		entry: "src/index.ts",
		format: ["esm", "cjs"],
		dts: true,
		// Normal library build
	},
	{
		name: "cli",
		entry: "src/cli.ts",
		compile: true,
		// Compile to executable
	},
]);
```

This allows you to build your library and create executables in a single build process.
