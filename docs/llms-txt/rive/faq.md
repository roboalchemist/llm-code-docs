## Does Rive support Unity's Sprite Renderer?

Rive renders to a **Render Texture** in Unity. Unity's **Sprite Renderer** doesn't handle Render Textures particularly well out of the box, so using Rive directly as a sprite usually requires a workaround.

In general, we recommend building your visuals in Rive and driving behavior with **data binding**, rather than trying to treat Rive files as a drop-in replacement for individual sprites that are then assembled in Unity.

If you absolutely need a 2D-style workflow of rendering Rive files as individual objects in Unity, the recommended workaround is to render Rive onto a **Quad** (or other mesh) using the **Rive Texture Renderer**, rather than trying to display a Render Texture through a Sprite Renderer. Note that there are [performance considerations](/game-runtimes/unity/best-practices) to keep in mind when using this approach.

<Note>
  If you choose to use a Sprite Renderer workaround (especially custom shader approaches), we can't provide support for debugging or maintaining that custom rendering path as it is not officially supported.

## Does Rive support UI Toolkit?

Not yet, but we're working on it.

Today, the recommended approach is to use **uGUI** (via the **Rive Canvas Renderer**) or render Rive to a mesh.

## Why isn't my Rive graphic displaying?

A few common gotchas:

* Your **Rive Widget** needs to be under a **Rive Panel** to be rendered.
* A camera needs to be present in the scene.

See: [Unity components](/game-runtimes/unity/components).

## Unity crashes when upgrading the package. What should I do?

If Unity crashes while upgrading the package, close the Unity Editor, update the version in `Packages/manifest.json`, and then reopen the project.

See: [Getting Started](/game-runtimes/unity/getting-started).

## How do I report a bug or crash?

If you hit a crash or unexpected behavior, please file an issue in the [rive-unity GitHub repo](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity/issues).

To help us reproduce and diagnose the issue:

* In Unity, run **Tools → Rive → Copy Support Info** and paste the output into the issue.
* Include your **Editor.log**.

See: [Bug reports](/game-runtimes/unity/unity#bug-reports).
