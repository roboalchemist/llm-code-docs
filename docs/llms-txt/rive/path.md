# Path

Path is a mutable path object that can be drawn by a Renderer. An unchanged
path can be drawn multiple times per frame. However, if you mutate it (via
moveTo, lineTo, cubicTo, add, etc.) after drawing, you must wait until the
next frame to draw it again.

## Constructors

### `new`

```lua highlight={11} theme={null}
local path = Path.new()
path:moveTo(Vector.xy(0, 0))
```

## Methods

### `moveTo`

Moves the current point to the specified location, starting a new contour.

```lua  theme={null}
path:moveTo(Vector.xy(0, 0))
```

### `lineTo`

Adds a straight line segment from the current point to the specified point.

```lua  theme={null}
path:lineTo(Vector.xy(10, 0))
```

### `quadTo`

Adds a quadratic Bézier curve from the current point to the specified point,
using the control point to define the curve shape.

```lua  theme={null}
path:quadTo(
  Vector.xy(-50, -50), -- control point
  Vector.xy(0, 0)      -- end point
)
```

### `cubicTo`

Adds a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to the specified point,
using `controlOut` for the start tangent and `controlIn` for the end tangent.

```lua  theme={null}
path:cubicTo(
  Vector.xy(25, -40),  -- control point out
  Vector.xy(75, 40),   -- control point in
  Vector.xy(100, 0)    -- end point
)
```

### `close`

Closes the current contour by adding a line segment from the current point
back to the first point of the contour (the last `moveTo`).

```lua  theme={null}
-- Draw a rectangle
path:moveTo(Vector.xy(-10, -10))
path:lineTo(Vector.xy(10, -10))
path:lineTo(Vector.xy(10, 10))
path:lineTo(Vector.xy(-10, 10))
-- Close the path
path:close()
```

### `__len`

Each entry is a [PathCommand](/scripting/api-reference/path/path-command) describing one segment or action in the path.

```lua  theme={null}
local cmd = path[1]
print(cmd.type)
```

Returns the number of commands in the path.

```lua  theme={null}
local count = #path
print(count)
```

### `reset`

Do not mutate or reset a [Path](/scripting/api-reference/path/path) in the same frame after drawing it.
If you need to change it, wait until the next frame.
Only call `reset` on subsequent frames if you've called `Renderer.drawPath`
with it.

```lua  theme={null}
path:reset()
```

### `add`

Appends the commands from `other` onto this path. If `transform` is provided,
the appended commands are transformed as they are added.

```lua  theme={null}
local dst = Path.new()
local src = Path.new()

src:moveTo(Vector.xy(0, 0))
src:lineTo(Vector.xy(10, 0))
src:lineTo(Vector.xy(10, 10))
src:close()

-- Add `src` into `dst` (optionally with a transform)
dst:add(src)
```

### `contours`

Returns a [ContourMeasure](/scripting/api-reference/path/contour-measure) for the first contour in the path. A contour is a
sequence of path segments starting at a `moveTo` and ending before the next
`moveTo` (or end of path). Use the `next` property on the returned
[ContourMeasure](/scripting/api-reference/path/contour-measure) to iterate through subsequent contours. Returns `nil` if the
path has no contours.

```lua  theme={null}
local contour = path:contours()
while contour do
  print(contour.length)
  contour = contour.next
end
```

### `measure`

Returns a [PathMeasure](/scripting/api-reference/path/path-measure) that measures the entire path across all contours.
This provides the total length and allows operations on the path as a whole.

```lua  theme={null}
local measure = path:measure()
local pathLength = measure.length
print(pathLength)
```
