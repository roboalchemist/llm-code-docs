# What factors affect the number of simultaneous requests that can be handled?

The request handling capacity is influenced by multiple factors:

* **Model size and type**
* **Number of GPUs** allocated to the deployment
* **GPU type** (e.g., A100 vs. H100)
* **Prompt size** and **generation token length**
* **Deployment type** (serverless vs. on-demand)
