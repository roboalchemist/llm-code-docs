# Why might my account be suspended even with remaining credits?

Your account may be suspended due to several factors:

1. **Monthly usage limits**:
   * Each tier includes a monthly usage limit, independent of any credits.
   * Once you reach this limit, your service will be suspended, even if you have credits remaining.
   * Usage limits automatically reset at the beginning of each month.

2. **Billing structure**:
   * Pre-purchased credits do not prevent additional charges.
   * You can exceed your pre-purchased credits and will be billed for any usage beyond that limit.
   * **Example**: If you have `$20` in pre-purchased credits but incur `$83` in usage, you will be billed for the `$63` difference.
