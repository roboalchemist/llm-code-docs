## API key generation

The Quo API uses API keys for secure authentication. Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Quo">Access your Quo account.</Step>

  <Step title="Access API Settings">
    Navigate to the "API" tab under workspace settings. Remember, you need
    workspace owner or admin privileges to access this tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate your key">
    Click "Generate API key" and provide a descriptive label. Each key provides
    full API access.

    <Tip>
      Label your keys based on their intended use (e.g., "Production
      Environment" or "Testing Integration")
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement authentication">
    Include your API key in the Authorization header of each request: `    Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY`
    <Tip>The Quo API does not use a Bearer token for authentication.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security guidelines

<Info>
  Your API key carries the same privileges as your Quo account. Treat it
  with the same level of security as your password.
</Info>

### Best practices

* Keep your API keys confidential
* Don’t share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code
* Regularly rotate your API keys to enhance security
* If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one

### Revoking access

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Navigate to the "API" tab in Workspace Settings
2. Locate the specific key
3. Click the ellipsis (three dots) icon and select 'delete' to immediately revoke access
4. Generate a new key if needed

<Note>
  Deleting an API key only affects the integrations using that specific key.
  Other keys and integrations will continue to function normally.
</Note>
