Please read these Developer API Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) carefully before using the API and Service (each as defined below) offered by OpenPhone Technologies, Inc. (“OpenPhone”). By clicking on the “Accept” or “Submit” button, you or the entity or company that you represent (“You,” “Your,” “Yours” or “Developer”) are unconditionally consenting to be bound by and are becoming a party to this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, Developer may not make any Integration or provide access to the Service to any End User or any other person or entity who has not agreed to the OpenPhone Terms of Service.

Prior to accessing the API or developing an Integration, Developer shall complete OpenPhone’s standard registration process and provide all requested information, including, without limitation, (i) contact information for Developer, (ii) the purpose, features, and functionality of the Integration, and (iii) whether Developer intends to charge End Users for or otherwise monetize the Integration. Developer may not charge End Users for access to the Services via the Integration or otherwise monetize the Integration without OpenPhone’s prior written approval.

2.3 Responsibilities. Developer is solely responsible for the acts or omissions of Developer and each End User in connection with their use of the API and Service in connection with the Integration. Developer’s agreements with End Users must: (i) be no less protective of OpenPhone’s rights and ownership than this Agreement and the OpenPhone Terms of Service; (ii) not grant greater use or access rights to the Service or API than those rights, licenses and permissions described in OpenPhone Terms of Service; (iii) include substantially and materially similar restrictions to those set forth in Section 2.5 with respect to the Service and API to the extent applicable; and (iv) require, as a condition of accessing the Services via the Integration, that End Users have agreed to the OpenPhone Terms of Service. Developer shall prohibit unauthorized access to or use of the API and to promptly notify OpenPhone of any such unauthorized access or use. Developer accepts and assumes all responsibility for complying with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with all of Developer’s and End Users’ activities involving the API, the Service, End User Content and OpenPhone Data.

2.4 Updates and Modifications. Developer understands and agrees that the specifications for the API and the Service shall be defined by OpenPhone in its sole discretion, and Developer is responsible for its development and other costs associated with Developer’s use of the API or Integration. OpenPhone reserves the right to modify, change, update and/or enhance the API and/or the Service (each a “Modification”) at any time in OpenPhone’s sole and exclusive discretion. Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Modifications may affect Developer’s and End Users’ ability to access the Service and may require Developer to make changes to the Integration. OpenPhone shall not be liable for any costs incurred by Developer arising out of or in connection with any Modification.

2.5 License Restrictions.

2.5.1 Except as expressly permitted hereunder, Developer shall not, and shall require that End Users do not (i) use any method to access or use the Service other than as permitted through the API, (ii) provide the API or access to the Service to any third parties other than End Users, (iii) permit or enable third parties to copy or obtain the API or access to the Service in any manner not expressly authorized in this Agreement, (iv) use the API or Service, in any manner that violates applicable laws, (v) license, sell, re-sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, or alter the API, Service or any portion of the API or Service, or permit or enable any third parties to do so; (vi) use the Service, the API, or any documentation or other materials received from OpenPhone in connection with this Agreement, to develop a product or service that competes with the Service; (vii) modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying algorithms of any part of the Service or API except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (viii) remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the Service or API; (ix) access or use the API or Service in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage, disrupt or impair the API or Service or interfere with any other party’s access to or use of the API or Service or use any device, software or routine that causes the same; (x) attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage or disrupt the API or Service, accounts registered to other users, or the computer systems or networks connected to the API or Service; (xi) circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any technological measure or content protections of the API or Service; (xii) use any robot, spider, crawlers, scraper, or other automatic device, process, software or queries that intercepts, “mines,” scrapes, extracts, or otherwise accesses the API or Service to monitor, extract, copy or collect information or data from or through the API or Service; or (xiii) introduce any viruses, trojan horses, worms, logic bombs or other materials that are malicious or technologically harmful into OpenPhone’s systems.

2.6 Public Announcement. The timing and content of any advertisements, announcements, press releases or other promotional activity relating to this Agreement, and the use of one party’s name or trademarks by the other party shall be subject to the prior approval of both parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, OpenPhone may reference Developer as a Developer in advertisements, press releases, or other marketing or promotional activities regarding OpenPhone’s products or services.

OpenPhone cannot and does not guarantee that the Service shall incorporate (or continue to incorporate) any particular Third Party Services.
