# Building with AI LLMs

> Learn how to use AI Language Models to build applications with the Quo API.

## Introduction

Building with Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly accelerate your Quo API integration development. This guide will help you effectively use LLMs to create applications with our API.

<Note>
  While we provide examples using Claude, the principles and practices outlined here apply to any capable LLM platform.
</Note>

## Getting started

### Documentation setup

Before beginning development with an LLM, gather and prepare the necessary documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download OpenAPI specification">
    Get our [OpenAPI specification](https://openphone-public-api-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/openphone-public-api-v1-prod.json) for detailed endpoint information.

    **Tip**: Right-click and select "Save Link As..." to download the file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get complete documentation">
    Download and extract our [complete documentation package](https://openphone-public-api-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/openphone-public-api-llm-ready-docs-prod.zip)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share with your LLM">
    Provide these resources to your LLM to help it understand Quo API capabilities
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development process

### Working with LLMs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clear goals" icon="bullseye">
    Start by clearly describing your integration objectives to the LLM
  </Card>

  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book">
    Share relevant API documentation and specifications
  </Card>

  <Card title="Step breakdown" icon="list">
    Let the LLM help break complex features into manageable tasks
  </Card>

  <Card title="Iterative development" icon="rotate">
    Generate and review code one step at a time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development approach">
    * Start with core functionality
    * Iterate to add features
    * Test each component thoroughly
    * Move forward only after validation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security considerations">
    * Never share API keys with LLMs
    * Keep sensitive data out of prompts
    * Validate all generated code
    * Follow security best practices
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance & limits">
    * Follow Quo API rate limits
    * Implement proper error handling
    * Monitor API usage
    * Optimize API calls
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example interactions

Here's a practical example of how to instruct an LLM to help build with our API:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample project: message sender">
    ```text  theme={null}
    I want to build an application that:
    1. Displays a list of all my phone numbers
    2. Allows me to select a number to send a message with
    3. Lets me input an external phone number to send a message to
    4. Sends a message to the external phone number

    Please help me implement this using the Quo API.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contact management example">
    ```text  theme={null}
    Help me create a system to:
    1. Sync contacts from my CRM
    2. Update contact details automatically
    3. Track message history per contact
    4. Generate contact activity reports
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration patterns

  <Card title="Contact management" icon="address-book">
    Sync and manage contact information
  </Card>

  <Card title="Call analytics" icon="chart-line">
    Process call summaries and recording data
  </Card>

  <Card title="Scheduling" icon="calendar">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Implementation checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Code review">
    Thoroughly review all LLM-generated code
  </Step>

  <Step title="Testing">
    Test extensively in a development environment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Error handling">
    Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitoring">
    Deploy with appropriate monitoring systems
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iteration">
    Continuously improve based on usage and feedback
  </Step>
</Steps>
