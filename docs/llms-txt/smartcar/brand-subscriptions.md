## Notes

### Audi

* Owners will need to ensure they're the Primary or Key user for the vehicle connected to their account in order to access all Smartcar functionality.

### Ford and Lincoln

* Owners that use a username to login to their connected services app will need to migrate to using their email address under account settings in their Ford Pass or Lincoln Way portal.

### Onstar

* Chevy Bolts MY 2020+ come with the **EV Mobile Command** service included for 5 years with the purchase of a new vehicle. Location data is not included in the package. Bolt owners will need to also subscribe to **Remote Access** to be able to get access to location data.
* For all other OnStar accounts, we require the modern **Remote Access** plan as our base subscription. This plan comes with the **Vehicle Status** feature set, which is what enables our remote access to data from cars.
  More information can be found [in this PDF](https://my.chevrolet.com/content/dam/gmownercenter/gmna/dynamic/onstar/comparePlans/nbm/OC_Compare-Plans-Chevy.pdf).
* There are certain legacy OnStar accounts floating around with similar names. A good check on whether a customer has the correct plan or not is the ability to view vehicle information like fuel level, EV battery level, odometer, or tire pressure from within their vehicle’s mobile app.

### Nissan US

* Convenience features are included as part of the Premium package.

### Toyota

* The Remote Connect subscription is tied to the audio package purchased with the vehicle. Compatible audio package availability is determined based on the trim of the vehicle model and varies model year to model year.
  Toyota provides PDFs for Remote Connect availability [here](https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/#:~:text=Learn%20about%20your%20Connected%20Services).

### Uconnect

* For all Uconnect accounts, we require the ability to interact with vehicle information through the UConnect portal
* A Uconnect account may have access to Mopar, but not all Mopar accounts have access to UConnect. If a user can see information in Mopar but not UConnect, they’ll need to reach out to UConnect support to set up the right UConnect plan for their vehicle.
* 2021+ Jeeps have their own connected service - Jeep Connect
* 2022+ Rams have their own connected service - Ram Connect
* 2022+ Jeep Wagoneers have their own connected service - Wagoneer Connect
* Canada has limited support listed [here](https://www.driveuconnect.ca/en/sirius-xm-guardian-vehicles)

### Volkswagen ID Series

* Model year 2021 and certain 2022 Volkswagen ID vehicles require an upgrade to vehicle software version 3 which will allow you to get location and odometer data. This is a requirement for both US and European vehicles.

### Volvo

The following models are not currently compatible with Smartcar:

* 2021+ : XC40 Recharge
* 2022+ : S90, S90 Recharge, V90, V90 Recharge, V90 Cross Country, XC60, XC60 Recharge
* 2023+ : All models with the exception of the XC40
