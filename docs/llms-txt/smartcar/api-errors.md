# API Errors

API errors are returned from requests made via Smartcar API.
Smartcar uses HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of API requests. This includes:

* `2XX`: indicates success
* `4XX`: indicates an invalid request (e.g. a required parameter is missing from the request body)
* `5XX`: indicates Smartcar-related issues (e.g. a vehicle is not capable of fulfilling a request).

## Error Response
