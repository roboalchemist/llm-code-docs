# Make Specific Endpoints
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/about-brand-specific



<Warning>
  The Vehicles API v2.0 will be deprecated by **Q3 of 2026**. We recommend migrating to the [latest version](/api-reference/vehicles-api-intro) as soon as possible to ensure continued support and access to new features.
</Warning>

In cases where there are many differences in how each OEM provides the same data, Smartcar would provide you with a make-specific endpoint before making it widely available to all supported makes.

This allowed customers to take advantage of these endpoints and share feedback with Smartcar. Based on the feedback, we realized that these endpoints often required customers to write make-specific code, which is not ideal for a standardized API.

These endpoints will be deprecated along with API V2.0.

<Info>When using make specific endpoints, please ensure to specify the [make](/api-reference/makes) in lower case format. Using upper case letters will result in a PERMISSION error.</Info>

# API Errors

API errors are returned from requests made via Smartcar API.
Smartcar uses HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of API requests. This includes:

* `2XX`: indicates success
* `4XX`: indicates an invalid request (e.g. a required parameter is missing from the request body)
* `5XX`: indicates Smartcar-related issues (e.g. a vehicle is not capable of fulfilling a request).

## Error Response

# Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/authorization/overview

Understand how to manage access and refresh tokens to maintain persistent access to vehicles.

Smartcar uses OAuth 2.0 access tokens to secure API requests. Managing these tokens correctly is critical for ensuring your application can reliably interact with vehicles.

* **Access Tokens**: Short-lived tokens (2 hours) used to authorize requests to the Smartcar API.
* **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived tokens (60 days) used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

## Token Management

* **[Auth Code Exchange](/api-reference/authorization/auth-code-exchange)**: The initial exchange of an authorization code for your first access and refresh token pair.
* **[Access Tokens Refresh](/api-reference/authorization/refreshing-access-token)**: How to get a new token set when the current one expires.

<Warning>
  When you use a refresh token, you receive a **new refresh token** in the response. You must save this new refresh token for future use, as the old one is invalidated.
</Warning>

## Storing access tokens

### Default and Brand Select Connect Flow

By default tokens are scoped to the user's connected services account.

<Note>This means that if there are multiple vehicles
on the account - and they are selected at the time of authorization, the access token is valid for all those vehicle Ids.</Note>

To manage this, we recommend using the [Smartcar User Id](/api-reference/user) to link tokens to your corresponding user id. The diagram below
will also allow multiple users to connect to vehicles on the same account.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

### Single Select Connect Flow

When using the Single Select flow, tokens are strictly scoped to the vehicle that was authorized for that Connect session.
This means that if a user connects multiple vehicles under the same connected services account, each vehicle id will be tied
to its own set of tokens.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

## Token expiry

Access tokens are valid for 2 hours, while refresh tokens are valid for 60 days. You can use the corresponding refresh token to fetch a new token pair
once an access token has expired.

In order to maintain access to a vehicle without having a user go through Connect again, you'll want to make sure the refresh token never expires.
Whenever you fetch a new token pair, we will return a **new access and refresh token**.

Prior to expiry, access tokens will remain valid until their expiry when fetching a new token pair. Refresh tokens on the other hand are invalidated
1 minute after they're used.

To avoid common 401 Authentication errors, please ensure you are **persisting both the access and refresh token** we return whenever you fetch a new pair.

<Tip>
  In addition to any logic that checks access token expiry when making an API request, we strongly recommend having another job that periodically
  checks for refresh tokens that are close to expiry and refreshes them.
</Tip>


# Refreshing Access Tokens
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/authorization/refreshing-access-token

POST https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token
Your access token will expire **2 hours** after it is issued. When this happens, your application can retrieve a new one by using the corresponding `refresh_token` without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

<Warning>
  A refresh token is invalidated 10 minutes after use. If your first attempt at refreshing tokens fails, ensure you retry within 10 minutes.
  Please ensure you're persisting **both the newly minted access and refresh token**. Failure to do so will require the user to authenticate again after the access token has expired.
</Warning>

## Notes

**BMW and MINI**<br />
Vehicle needs to be on OS Version 8+

**Ford and Lincoln**<br />
Issuing a start command while the vehicle has a schedule in place for its current charging location will result in the vehicle charging to 100%.

Please see [charge schedule by location](/api-reference/ford/set-charge-schedule-by-location) for details on setting a charge limit with preferred charging times
or clearing schedules.

**Nissan**<br />
Currently only START charge commands are supported in the US. See [Set Charge Schedule](/api-reference/nissan/set-charge-schedule) for details on setting a charge schedule for Nissan vehicles.

**Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac**<br />

### Case 3: User selected battery capacity

Smartcar will sometimes return an `availableCapacities` object along side a Connect URL you can use to prompt users to select the battery capacity of their vehicle. This can occur when an accurate match could not be found, or vehicle owners purchased extension packs, or software upgrades specific to their vehicle.

When you redirect a vehicle owner to this Smartcar Connect url, they can select the battery capacity of their vehicle for cases where the battery capacity cannot be accurately determined.

When a user selects an option, Smartcar will return this value with `USER_SELECTED` as the source.

# Smartcar APIs
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/intro

Here you'll find everything you need to integrate with Smartcar via REST APIs. Learn how to connect and manage Smartcar's Vehicles API, Management API, and Compatibility API through a simple interface.

Welcome to the Smartcar API Reference! Here you’ll find everything you need to integrate with Smartcar and build applications that can reach to millions of vehicles.

Smartcar provides three main APIs, each designed for a specific part of your integration:

## Vehicles API

The **Vehicles API** lets you access standardized vehicle data and send commands to connected vehicles. Use this API to:

* Retrieve signals such as battery level, odometer, location, and more
* Issue commands like lock/unlock or start/stop charging
* Access vehicle attributes and diagnostic information

All requests to the Vehicles API require an access token obtained via the [OAuth2 authorization flow](/getting-started/how-to/get-an-access-token).

The Vehicles API is designed primarily for exploration and non-frequent data retrieval. This API is not designed for continuous polling or real-time monitoring. Data is typically updated once every 24 hours unless the vehicle is actively subscribed to a webhook, which enables more frequent updates. For most use cases, you should avoid polling the Vehicles API at high frequency leverage [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview) instead.

* [Vehicles API Reference](/api-reference/vehicles-api-intro)
* [Standard Signal Schema](/api-reference/signals/schema)
* [Permissions](/api-reference/permissions)

## Management API

The **Management API** allows you to manage vehicle connections at the application level. Use this API to:

* List all vehicles connected to your application
* Remove (disconnect) vehicles
* Unsubscribe vehicles from a webhook

The Management API uses a separate management token for authentication, which you can find in your [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/).

* [Management API Reference](/api-reference/management/get-vehicle-connections)
* [Delete Vehicle Connections](/api-reference/management/delete-vehicle-connections)
* [Unsubscribe Webhook](/api-reference/webhooks/unsubscribe-webhook)

## Compatibility API

The **Compatibility API** helps you determine if a specific vehicle is supported by Smartcar before launching the Connect flow. Use this API to:

* Query supported makes and regions

This API is useful for improving user experience by verifying eligibility up front.

* [Compatibility by VIN](/api-reference/compatibility/by-vin)
* [Compatibility by Region and Make](/api-reference/compatibility/by-region-and-make)

# Management API Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/management-api-intro

The Management API allows you to manage vehicle connections and webhook subscriptions at the application level. It is designed for administrative tasks that go beyond individual vehicle data access.

## What You Can Do

* List all vehicles connected to your application
* Remove (disconnect) vehicles from your app
* Manage webhook subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe vehicles)

## Authentication

The Management API uses a management token, which you can generate in your [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/).

## Base URL

```
https://api.smartcar.com/management/v2.0
```

## Key Resources

* [Get Vehicle Connections](/api-reference/management/get-vehicle-connections)
* [Delete Vehicle Connections](/api-reference/management/delete-vehicle-connections)
* [Webhook Management](/api-reference/webhooks/unsubscribe-webhook)

## Example Use Cases

* Removing vehicles when a user deletes their account
* Managing webhook event delivery
* Auditing connected vehicles for compliance

<Info>
  For more details on using the Management API, see [Management API Reference](/api-reference/management/get-vehicle-connections).

# Vehicle Connections
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/management/delete-vehicle-connections

DELETE https://management.smartcar.com/v2.0/management/connections
Deletes all vehicle connections associated with a Smartcar user ID or a specific vehicle.

## Request

**Header**

<ParamField type="string">
  In the format `Basic base64(default:{application_management_token})`. You can find your `application_management_token` under
  your Application Configuration in the Smartcar Dashboard.
</ParamField>

**Query**

<ParamField type="string" />

<ParamField type="string" />

You can delete connections in three ways:

* Provide a `vehicle_id` to remove all connections for that vehicle across all users.
* Provide a `user_id` to remove all vehicles linked to that user.
* Provide both a `vehicle_id` and `user_id` to remove only that vehicle for that specific user.

# Permissions
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/permissions

In order to use an endpoint or webhook, you'll need to request the associated permissions from your user in [Connect](/docs/connect/what-is-connect).

When requesting permissions, it's crucial to only ask for the data that is absolutely necessary for your application's functionality. Avoid collecting additional permissions "just in case" you might need them later. This practice not only protects vehicle owners' privacy but also increases the likelihood of users granting consent during the Connect flow. Users are more likely to trust and authorize applications that clearly demonstrate respect for their privacy by requesting minimal, purposeful access to their vehicle data.

## Vehicle Access

Smartcar's **Vehicle Access** configuration page (Dashboard → Configuration → Vehicle Access) lets you select the *vehicle data* (signals) and *commands* without needing to know which individual permission is needed for a given signal. Based on the signals you choose, Smartcar automatically determines the minimum set of OAuth permissions required and surfaces them during the Connect flow.

<Info>
  **Signals vs Permissions**: Permissions (e.g. `read_location`, `control_security`) are OAuth scopes requested from the user. Signals are the granular data points (e.g. state of charge, tire pressure) defined in the <a href="/api-reference/signals/schema">Signal Schema</a>. Vehicle Access starts from signals and derives the needed permissions for you.
</Info>

### Why use Vehicle Access?

* Enforces least-privilege automatically
* Reduces guesswork mapping data needs to permissions
* Prevents over-requesting and improves user trust
* Keeps configuration centralized in the Dashboard

### How it works

1. You open the Vehicle Access page in the Dashboard.
2. You search or browse for the signals you need (see the <a href="/api-reference/signals/schema">Signal Schema</a> for structure and definitions).
3. Smartcar instantly computes the required permissions for those signals.
4. You save the configuration; the derived permissions are locked in for subsequent Connect authorizations.
5. During Connect, Smartcar presents only those permissions—no need to manually maintain a scope list.

<Note>
  Updating Vehicle Access changes the permissions requested in **future** Connect authorizations. Existing refresh/access tokens retain previously granted scopes until the user re-authenticates.
</Note>

<Note>
  Passing the `scope` parameter in the Connect URL overrides the permissions derived from Vehicle Access for that authorization. This allows you to request different permissions for specific Connect flows without changing your overall Vehicle Access configuration.
</Note>

### Example

Selecting signals for battery state of charge, charging status, and odometer will automatically derive permissions such as `read_battery`, `read_charge`, and \`read\_odometer. You don't need to add those manually.

## Read Permissions

Permissions prefixed with `read_` allow your application to get data from a vehicle as part of `GET` requests.

# Vehicles API v2.0 Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/v2-overview

Overview of the Smartcar Vehicles API v2.0 and deprecation notice.

<Warning>
  The Vehicles API v2.0 will be deprecated by **Q3 of 2026**. We recommend migrating to the [latest version](/api-reference/vehicles-api-intro) as soon as possible to ensure continued support and access to new features.
</Warning>

<Note>
  2.0 is still the only supported version for sending remote commands. If you need to send commands, please continue using v2.0 until commands are supported in the latest version later this year.
</Note>

The Smartcar Vehicles API v2.0 is the previous version of our core API for accessing standardized vehicle data and current version for sending remote commands. It allows developers to:

* Retrieve real-time vehicle signals (e.g., battery level, odometer, fuel, tire pressure)
* Send remote commands (lock/unlock, start/stop charging, etc.)

All requests to v2.0 require an OAuth2 access token, which is obtained by having the vehicle owner authorize your app via [Smartcar Connect](/connect/what-is-connect).

## Base URL

```
https://api.smartcar.com/v2.0
```

For this API, the latency response times may vary per vehicle make and model. For more information, see [OEM Latency](/help/oem-latency).


# Vehicles API Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/vehicles-api-intro

The Vehicles API is Smartcar’s core API for accessing standardized vehicle data and sending remote commands to connected vehicles. It enables you to build applications that interact with a wide range of makes and models through a single, unified interface.

## What You Can Do

* Retrieve last known vehicle signals (e.g., battery level, odometer, fuel, tire pressure)
* Access vehicle attributes (make, model, year, VIN, etc.)
* Send remote commands (lock/unlock, start/stop charging, etc.)

The Vehicles API is designed primarily for exploration and non-frequent data retrieval. This API is not designed for continuous polling or real-time monitoring. Data is typically updated once every 24 hours unless the vehicle is actively subscribed to a webhook, which enables more frequent updates. For most use cases, you should avoid polling the Vehicles API at high frequency leverage [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview) instead.

## Authentication

All requests require an OAuth2 access token, which is obtained by having the vehicle owner authorize your app via [Smartcar Connect](/connect/what-is-connect).

* Learn how to get an access token in our [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/how-to/get-an-access-token).
* Learn more about the [Auth Token Exchange](/api-reference/authorization/auth-code-exchange) process.

## Base URL

```
https://vehicle.api.smartcar.com/v3
```

## Key Resources

* [Signal Schema](/api-reference/signals/schema)
* [Permissions](/api-reference/permissions)
* [Error Codes](/api-reference/api-errors)

## Example Use Cases

* Fleet management and telematics
* Insurance and mileage tracking
* EV charging and energy management
* Car sharing and rental platforms

# Delivery Behavior
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/delivery-behavior

HTTP delivery mechanics, retry policies, timeouts, and ordering guarantees

Understanding how Smartcar delivers webhook events helps you build a reliable integration. This page covers the technical details of webhook delivery, including HTTP semantics, retry behavior, and timing expectations.

## HTTP Request Format

### Request Method

All webhook deliveries use `HTTP POST` requests sent to your configured callback URI.

### Request Headers

Smartcar includes the following headers with every webhook delivery:

<ResponseField name="Content-Type" type="string">
  Always set to `application/json`. All webhook payloads are JSON-encoded.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="SC-Signature" type="string">
  HMAC-SHA256 signature for payload verification. See [Payload Verification](/integrations/webhooks/payload-verification) for details on how to validate this signature.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="User-Agent" type="string">
  Identifies requests as coming from Smartcar. Format: `Smartcar/{version}`.
</ResponseField>

### Request Body

The request body contains a JSON payload matching one of the event types documented in [Event Reference](/api-reference/webhooks/events/overview).

All requests include:

* Valid JSON formatting
* UTF-8 encoding
* Content-Length header matching the payload size

## Expected Response

### Success Response

Your webhook endpoint must return a **2xx status code** (200, 201, 202, 204, etc.) within the timeout window to acknowledge successful receipt. Any 2xx response is treated as success.

<CodeGroup>
  ```http HTTP Response theme={null}
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {}
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  @app.post("/webhooks/smartcar")
  def handle_webhook(request):
      # Persist payload first
      save_to_queue(request.body)
      
      # Return 200 immediately
      return {"status": "received"}, 200
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
  app.post('/webhooks/smartcar', (req, res) => {
    // Persist payload first
    saveToQueue(req.body);
    
    // Return 200 immediately
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
  });
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  @PostMapping("/webhooks/smartcar")
  public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> handleWebhook(@RequestBody String payload) {
      // Persist payload first
      saveToQueue(payload);
      
      // Return 200 immediately
      return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("status", "received"));
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **Any 2xx status code is accepted.** You can return 200, 201, 202, 204, or any other 2xx response. Smartcar treats all 2xx codes as successful delivery.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Response body is ignored.** Smartcar only checks the HTTP status code. You can return an empty body or a simple acknowledgment object.
</Warning>

### Response Timeout

**Your endpoint must respond within 15 seconds.** Requests that exceed this timeout are treated as delivery failures, even if your server eventually responds with a 200 status.

<Tip>
  **Decouple receiving from processing.** Persist the webhook payload to a queue or database immediately, return `200 OK`, then process the data asynchronously. This prevents timeouts from long-running business logic.
</Tip>

### Failed Responses

Any of the following are considered delivery failures and will trigger retries:

* Non-2xx HTTP status codes (including 3xx redirects, 4xx client errors, 5xx server errors)
* Connection timeouts (> 15 seconds)
* Connection refused or DNS resolution failures
* TLS/SSL handshake failures
* Network errors or connection resets

## Retry Behavior

### Retry Policy

When a delivery fails, Smartcar automatically retries up to **3 times** using an **exponential backoff** strategy with an initial delay of 25 seconds:

| Attempt       | Wait Time   | Total Elapsed        |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1st (initial) | 0s          | 0s                   |
| 2nd           | 25 seconds  | 25 seconds           |
| 3rd           | 50 seconds  | 1 minute 15 seconds  |
| 4th (final)   | 100 seconds | 2 minutes 55 seconds |

<Info>
  If all 4 delivery attempts fail, the payload is permanently dropped. Future events will still be attempted as long as the webhook remains active.
</Info>

### What Triggers Retries

Retries occur for:

* Non-2xx HTTP status codes (3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
* Request timeouts (> 15 seconds)
* Network errors (connection refused, DNS failures, etc.)
* TLS/SSL errors

### What Doesn't Trigger Retries

Once your endpoint returns any 2xx status code, Smartcar considers the delivery successful and will not retry, even if:

* Your processing logic fails later
* You detect the payload is invalid
* Your database write fails after responding

<Warning>
  **Always validate before responding.** If you return a 2xx status code and then discover the payload is invalid, you cannot trigger a retry. The delivery is considered complete.
</Warning>

### Retry Identification

Each delivery attempt receives a unique `deliveryId`, but the `eventId` remains the same across all retry attempts. Use the `eventId` to identify retries of the same event:

```json theme={null}
{
  "eventId": "f7c0f3e6-4c9d-4f0e-8e5d-6e7f8a9b0c1d",  // Same across all retries
  // ... event data ...
  "meta": {
    "deliveryId": "5d569643-3a47-4cd1-a3ec-db5fc1f6f03b",  // Different for each attempt
    "deliveredAt": 1678901234567
  }
}
```

If the first delivery fails and Smartcar retries, the payload will have:

* **Same `eventId`**: `f7c0f3e6-4c9d-4f0e-8e5d-6e7f8a9b0c1d`
* **New `deliveryId`**: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`
* **Updated `deliveredAt`**: timestamp of the retry attempt

<Tip>
  Use `eventId` for deduplication, not `deliveryId`. The `eventId` uniquely identifies the webhook event, while `deliveryId` only identifies the specific delivery attempt.
</Tip>

See [Idempotency & Deduplication](/integrations/webhooks/best-practices#implement-idempotency) for best practices on handling retries.

## Concurrent Deliveries

### Multiple Events for the Same Vehicle

Smartcar can deliver **multiple events for the same vehicle simultaneously**. This most commonly occurs when a vehicle is in a partial error state and triggers both:

* A `VEHICLE_STATE` event with signal data
* A `VEHICLE_ERROR` event with error details

Your webhook endpoint must handle concurrent requests for the same vehicle. Design your processing logic to be thread-safe and avoid race conditions.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python - Thread-Safe Processing theme={null}
  from threading import Lock

  vehicle_locks = {}

  @app.post("/webhooks/smartcar")
  def handle_webhook(request):
      payload = request.json
      vehicle_id = payload['data']['vehicle']['id']
      
      # Get or create a lock for this vehicle
      if vehicle_id not in vehicle_locks:
          vehicle_locks[vehicle_id] = Lock()
      
      # Process with vehicle-specific lock
      with vehicle_locks[vehicle_id]:
          process_payload(payload)
      
      return {"status": "received"}, 200
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js - Async Queue theme={null}
  const async = require('async');
  const vehicleQueues = {};

  app.post('/webhooks/smartcar', (req, res) => {
    const vehicleId = req.body.data.vehicle.id;
    
    // Create queue for this vehicle if it doesn't exist
    if (!vehicleQueues[vehicleId]) {
      vehicleQueues[vehicleId] = async.queue(processPayload, 1);
    }
    
    // Add to vehicle-specific queue
    vehicleQueues[vehicleId].push(req.body);
    
    // Return 200 immediately
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Cross-Vehicle Concurrency

Events for **different vehicles** can and will be delivered concurrently. If you have 1,000 vehicles subscribed to a webhook, you may receive events for multiple vehicles at the same time.

Your infrastructure should be able to handle concurrent requests proportional to your fleet size.

## Event Batching

### Single vs Multiple Deliveries

**One event per delivery.** Each webhook request contains a single event (either `VEHICLE_STATE` or `VEHICLE_ERROR`).

However, the number of deliveries depends on how the vehicle reports changes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Simultaneous Changes (1 delivery)">
    If a vehicle reports 3 signal changes at the same time (e.g., during a single vehicle data poll), Smartcar delivers **one `VEHICLE_STATE` event** containing all changed signals:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "eventType": "VEHICLE_STATE",
      "data": {
        "triggers": ["Charge.IsCharging", "TractionBattery.StateOfCharge", "TractionBattery.Range"],
        "signals": {
          "Charge.IsCharging": { "value": true, ... },
          "TractionBattery.StateOfCharge": { "value": 85, ... },
          "TractionBattery.Range": { "value": 250, ... }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Sequential Changes (3 deliveries)">
    If a vehicle reports the same 3 signals as separate changes in quick succession, Smartcar delivers **three separate `VEHICLE_STATE` events**:

    **Delivery 1:**

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "eventType": "VEHICLE_STATE",
      "data": {
        "triggers": ["Charge.IsCharging"],
        "signals": { "Charge.IsCharging": { "value": true, ... }, ... }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Delivery 2:**

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "eventType": "VEHICLE_STATE",
      "data": {
        "triggers": ["TractionBattery.StateOfCharge"],
        "signals": { "TractionBattery.StateOfCharge": { "value": 85, ... }, ... }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Delivery 3:**

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "eventType": "VEHICLE_STATE",
      "data": {
        "triggers": ["TractionBattery.Range"],
        "signals": { "TractionBattery.Range": { "value": 250, ... }, ... }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **The behavior depends on the vehicle manufacturer.** Some OEMs batch updates, while others stream individual changes. Your integration should handle both patterns.
</Info>

## Payload Size Limits

The maximum webhook payload size is **50 KB**. This limit applies to the entire JSON payload.

<Info>
  Most webhook payloads are well under this limit. A typical `VEHICLE_STATE` event with 10-20 signals usually under 5 KB, depending on the signals.
</Info>

If you're approaching this limit, consider:

* Reducing the number of signals in your webhook subscription
* Splitting data across multiple webhooks with different signal sets

## Delivery Logs & Monitoring

### Dashboard Logs

View delivery attempt history in the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com) under the **Logs** tab. The logs show:

* **Successful deliveries**: Events that received a 2xx response
* **Failed deliveries**: Events that failed after all retry attempts
* **Individual retry attempts**: Each attempt with timestamp, status code, and response time
* **Signal names**: The signals that were included in the webhook payload

<Tip>
  Use the dashboard logs to:

  * Debug delivery failures
  * Monitor webhook health
  * Track which signals triggered events
  * Verify retry behavior
</Tip>

### Delivery Metrics

Track key metrics to ensure webhook reliability:

* **Success rate**: Percentage of events delivered successfully on first attempt
* **Retry rate**: Percentage of events requiring retries
* **Average response time**: How quickly your endpoint responds
* **Failure patterns**: Common error codes or failure reasons

<Warning>
  Set up monitoring alerts for:

  * Success rate drops below 95%
  * Average response time exceeds 5 seconds
  * Consecutive failures for the same vehicle
</Warning>

## Webhook Lifecycle

### Disabling Webhooks

When you disable a webhook in the Smartcar Dashboard:

* Smartcar **stops monitoring** subscribed vehicles for changes
* Smartcar **stops attempting deliveries** immediately
* No events are queued or stored while the webhook is disabled

### Re-enabling Webhooks

When you re-enable a webhook:

* Smartcar **resumes monitoring** subscribed vehicles for changes
* The next event will include a `FIRST_DELIVERY` trigger with current signal values
* **Not supported:** Events that occurred while disabled are not retroactively delivered

<Info>
  **No event history while disabled.** Smartcar does not queue events during the disabled period. When you re-enable, you'll receive current state, not historical changes.
</Info>

## Delivery Guarantees

### At-Least-Once Delivery

Smartcar guarantees **at-least-once delivery** for all webhook events. This means:

* **Guaranteed:** You will receive every event at least once (unless all retry attempts fail)
* **Expected:** You may receive the same event multiple times
* **Not guaranteed:** Events are not delivered in order (see below)

### Ordering

**Events are not guaranteed to be delivered in order.** Due to network conditions, retry behavior, and distributed systems, events may arrive out of sequence.

For example:

1. Vehicle's state of charge changes from 50% → 60% at 10:00 AM
2. Vehicle's state of charge changes from 60% → 70% at 10:05 AM
3. You might receive the 70% event before the 60% event

<Tip>
  **Use timestamps to establish order.** Each signal includes `meta.oemUpdatedAt` and `meta.fetchedAt` timestamps. Compare these values to determine the actual sequence of events:

  ```javascript theme={null}
  function isNewerThan(signalA, signalB) {
    return signalA.meta.oemUpdatedAt > signalB.meta.oemUpdatedAt;
  }
  ```
</Tip>

### Duplicate Prevention

While Smartcar delivers each event at least once, duplicates can occur due to:

* **Retry attempts**: If your endpoint doesn't return a 2xx response within 15 seconds, Smartcar will retry the same event, resulting in duplicate deliveries
* **Network issues**: Temporary connectivity problems may cause duplicate sends
* **Distributed systems**: Race conditions in distributed infrastructure

<Warning>
  **Most duplicates are caused by slow or failed responses.** If your endpoint takes longer than 15 seconds to respond or returns a non-2xx status code, Smartcar will retry the delivery. Always return a 2xx response quickly to minimize duplicates.
</Warning>

#### Rare Edge Case: Multiple Deliveries During Confirmation

In extremely rare circumstances, you may receive multiple deliveries for the same error **even when responding quickly**. This can occur when:

1. Smartcar detects a vehicle error (e.g., expired authorization)
2. A webhook delivery is initiated to your endpoint
3. **While confirming delivery**, the same error is detected again (e.g., another API request encounters the same expired authorization)
4. This triggers a second, independent delivery with a **different `eventId`**

**Key characteristics:**

* Happens during a narrow time window (typically milliseconds to seconds)
* Results in **different `eventId` values** for what is logically the same error condition
* Each delivery is a legitimate, distinct event from Smartcar's perspective
* Most common with `VEHICLE_ERROR` events when multiple operations encounter the same error state

**How to handle this:**

If your application is sensitive to duplicate error notifications (e.g., sending user alerts), implement additional deduplication. Use a combination of `userId`, `vehicleId`, error `code`, and a time window (2-5 minutes) in addition to standard `eventId` deduplication.

<Info>
  **This edge case is rare in practice.** Most applications won't need special handling beyond standard `eventId` deduplication.
</Info>

Always implement idempotent processing using the unique `eventId` for standard deduplication. See [Reliability Best Practices](/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/reliability#implement-idempotency) for implementation patterns.

## Latency & Timing

### Understanding Webhook Latency

Webhook delivery latency consists of two components:

**1. Detection Latency** - Time for Smartcar to detect a vehicle data change

* Depends on the vehicle manufacturer's integration and data reporting frequency
* Varies significantly by OEM (from seconds to minutes)
* Outside of Smartcar's control

**2. Delivery Latency** - Time from detection to HTTP delivery

* Smartcar delivers webhooks within seconds of detecting a change
* Actual delivery time depends on network conditions and your endpoint's location

<Info>
  **Total end-to-end latency** = Detection latency (OEM-dependent) + Delivery latency (typically seconds)

  The detection latency varies by manufacturer and is the primary factor in total webhook latency. Once Smartcar detects a change, delivery occurs quickly.
</Info>

### Delivery Latency

Webhook deliveries typically occur within **seconds** of the triggering event. Latency depends on:

* **Vehicle OEM latency**: Time for the vehicle manufacturer to report data to Smartcar
* **Change detection**: Time for Smartcar to detect a signal value change
* **Network latency**: Time to deliver the HTTP request to your endpoint

<Info>
  Most deliveries complete within 1-5 seconds of Smartcar detecting a change, but OEM latency can vary significantly by manufacturer.
</Info>

### Event Freshness

Each signal includes two timestamps to help you understand data freshness:

* **`meta.oemUpdatedAt`**: When the vehicle manufacturer recorded the value (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
* **`meta.fetchedAt`**: When Smartcar retrieved the value from the OEM (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)

The difference between these timestamps indicates how fresh the data is from the vehicle's perspective.

## Network Requirements

### HTTPS & SSL

All webhook endpoints must:

* Use HTTPS (not HTTP)
* Have a valid SSL/TLS certificate
* Support TLS 1.2 or higher

Self-signed certificates and internal corporate CAs are not supported.

### Public Internet Access

Your webhook endpoint must be accessible from the public internet. Smartcar cannot deliver to:

* `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
* Private IP addresses (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x)
* Internal corporate networks without public DNS

### IP Addresses

Smartcar sends webhook requests from **public IPv4 addresses** that may change over time. We do not publish a static list of IP addresses.

<Warning>
  **Avoid IP-based firewall rules.** Instead of allowlisting specific IP addresses, use signature verification to authenticate webhook requests. See [Payload Verification](/integrations/webhooks/payload-verification).
</Warning>

### Firewall Configuration

If you must use firewall rules:

* Allow inbound HTTPS (port 443) from any IP
* Use signature verification for authentication
* Monitor for delivery failures that might indicate blocked IPs

## Error Handling

### Temporary vs Permanent Failures

**Temporary failures** (worth retrying):

* 500, 502, 503, 504 status codes
* Connection timeouts
* Temporary DNS failures
* Network blips

**Permanent failures** (not worth retrying):

* 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 status codes
* Invalid SSL certificates
* DNS resolution failures for non-existent domains

Smartcar retries both types, but you should fix permanent failures quickly to avoid dropped events.

### Monitoring Delivery Health

Monitor your webhook delivery success rate in the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com) **Logs** tab. High failure rates may indicate:

* Your endpoint is down or unreachable
* Responses are too slow (> 15 seconds)
* Your endpoint is rejecting requests (4xx errors)
* SSL certificate issues

<Tip>
  Set up alerts for:

  * Delivery success rate drops below 95%
  * Average response time exceeds 5 seconds
  * Consecutive delivery failures (3+)
</Tip>

## Best Practices

To build a reliable webhook integration, follow these essential practices:

1. **Respond Quickly** - Return `200 OK` within 200ms. Queue the payload and process asynchronously to avoid timeouts.

2. **Validate Signatures** - Always verify the `SC-Signature` header before processing payloads to ensure authenticity.

3. **Handle Duplicates** - Use `eventId` to detect and skip duplicate deliveries due to retries or network issues.

4. **Use Timestamps** - Compare `meta.oemUpdatedAt` values to establish correct event ordering, as events may arrive out of sequence.

5. **Monitor Failures** - Track delivery success rates and set up alerts for anomalies or consecutive failures.

6. **Test Error Cases** - Verify your retry and error handling logic with test scenarios during development.

# Event Reference Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/events/overview

Understanding webhook event structure and types

Smartcar delivers webhook events to your configured endpoint. Each event notifies your application about changes to vehicle state, errors encountered during data retrieval, or verification challenges.

## Event Types

Smartcar webhooks deliver three types of events:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="VERIFY" icon="shield-check" href="/api-reference/webhooks/events/verify">
    One-time challenge to verify your callback URL
  </Card>

  <Card title="VEHICLE_STATE" icon="car" href="/api-reference/webhooks/events/vehicle-state">
    Fired when any monitored signal changes value
  </Card>

  <Card title="VEHICLE_ERROR" icon="triangle-exclamation" href="/api-reference/webhooks/events/vehicle-error">
    Fired when signal retrieval fails or enters error state
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

***

## Event Envelope Structure

All webhook payloads follow this consistent structure:

```json Event Envelope theme={null}
{
  "eventId": "52f6e0bb-1369-45da-a61c-9e67d092d6db",
  "eventType": "VEHICLE_STATE",
  "vehicleId": "bc6ea99e-57d1-4e41-b129-27e7eb58713e",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data (varies by eventType)
  },
  "meta": {
    "version": "4.0",
    "webhookId": "5a8e5e38-1e12-4011-a36d-56f120053f9e",
    "webhookName": "Battery Monitor",
    "deliveryId": "5d569643-3a47-4cd1-a3ec-db5fc1f6f03b",
    "deliveredAt": 1761896351529
  }
}
```

### Common Fields

All events include these fields:

<ResponseField name="eventId" type="string">
  Unique identifier for this event. Use this for deduplication to prevent processing the same event twice.

  **Important:** The `eventId` remains the same across delivery retries. Use this to implement idempotency.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="eventType" type="string">
  The type of event: `VERIFY`, `VEHICLE_STATE`, or `VEHICLE_ERROR`.

  Use this field to route events to appropriate handlers in your application.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="vehicleId" type="string">
  The Smartcar vehicle ID this event relates to.

  **Note:** Not present in `VERIFY` events, which are webhook-level (not vehicle-specific).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Event-specific data. The structure varies by `eventType`:

  * **VERIFY**: Contains a `challenge` string to hash and return
  * **VEHICLE\_STATE**: Contains **all** signals configured in your webhook subscription
  * **VEHICLE\_ERROR**: Contains error details and affected signals

  See individual event type pages for complete `data` schemas.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  Metadata about the webhook delivery.

  <Expandable title="meta object">
    <ResponseField name="version" type="string">
      Webhook API version (e.g., `"4.0"`)
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="webhookId" type="string">
      ID of the webhook subscription that triggered this event
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="webhookName" type="string">
      Name of the webhook subscription (user-defined in Dashboard)
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="deliveryId" type="string">
      Unique identifier for this delivery attempt. Different from `eventId` - each retry gets a new `deliveryId`.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="deliveredAt" type="integer">
      Unix timestamp (milliseconds) when Smartcar sent this webhook
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="mode" type="string">
      Environment mode: `"LIVE"`
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Event Delivery Guarantees

All webhook events follow these delivery characteristics:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="At-Least-Once Delivery" icon="rotate">
    Events may be delivered more than once due to retries. Always use the `eventId` field for deduplication to ensure you process each unique event exactly once.

    **Why this happens:**

    * Network failures
    * Your endpoint returning non-2xx status codes
    * Timeout before your endpoint responds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Ordering Guarantees" icon="arrows-up-down">
    Events are not guaranteed to arrive in chronological order. Concurrent deliveries or network delays can cause later events to arrive before earlier ones.

    **Best practice:** Always use timestamps to determine data freshness:

    * `meta.deliveredAt` - when Smartcar sent the webhook
    * `signals[].meta.oemUpdatedAt` - when the vehicle manufacturer updated the signal
    * `signals[].meta.fetchedAt` - when Smartcar retrieved the signal
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Idempotent Event IDs" icon="fingerprint">
    The `eventId` field remains constant across all retry attempts for the same event. The `deliveryId` changes with each retry.

    **Implementation:** Store processed `eventId` values for at least 7 days to handle late retries and reprocessing scenarios.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Retry Policy" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Failed deliveries are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff:

    | Attempt       | Wait Time   | Total Elapsed        |
    | ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
    | 1st (initial) | 0s          | 0s                   |
    | 2nd           | 25 seconds  | 25 seconds           |
    | 3rd           | 50 seconds  | 1 minute 15 seconds  |
    | 4th (final)   | 100 seconds | 2 minutes 55 seconds |

# VEHICLE_ERROR Event
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/events/vehicle-error

Error notifications and resolution tracking for signal retrieval issues

Triggered when Smartcar encounters an error while attempting to retrieve signal data from a vehicle. This event helps you monitor data availability, understand missing or stale signal data and provide an event to trigger a user action to resolve the issue.

## When This Event Fires

The `VEHICLE_ERROR` event fires when:

* Smartcar detects an error while retrieving signal data
* The vehicle manufacturer's API returns an error
* The vehicle is offline or unreachable
* Authentication, permission, or compatibility errors occur

<Info>
  **Resolution notifications**: When an error condition is resolved (e.g., vehicle comes back online), Smartcar sends another `VEHICLE_ERROR` event with `state` set to `"RESOLVED"`. This enables automatic recovery workflows.
</Info>

***

## Error Categories

Errors are categorized by type and include specific error codes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connected Services Account Errors" icon="user-slash">
    Issues with the user's account with the vehicle manufacturer.

    | Type                         | Code                    | Description                                     |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
    | `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT` | `ACCOUNT_ISSUE`         | General account problem                         |
    | `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT` | `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` | Authentication credentials are invalid          |
    | `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT` | `PERMISSION`            | User lacks necessary permissions                |
    | `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT` | `SUBSCRIPTION`          | Required subscription is inactive or expired    |
    | `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT` | `VIRTUAL_KEY_REQUIRED`  | Vehicle requires a virtual key to be configured |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vehicle State Errors" icon="car-battery">

## Processing VEHICLE\_ERROR Events

### Basic Handler

```javascript theme={null}
function handleVehicleError(payload) {
  const { vehicleId, data } = payload;
  const { errors } = data;
  
  errors.forEach(error => {
    if (error.state === 'ERROR') {
      // New error
      logError(vehicleId, error);
      notifyUser(vehicleId, error.suggestedUserMessage);
      
      // Take action based on error type
      if (error.resolution.type === 'RETRY_LATER') {
        scheduleRetry(vehicleId, error.signals);
      } else if (error.resolution.type === 'USER_ACTION_REQUIRED') {
        sendUserNotification(vehicleId, error);
      }
    } else if (error.state === 'RESOLVED') {
      // Error resolved
      logResolution(vehicleId, error);
      clearErrorState(vehicleId, error.code);
      notifyUser(vehicleId, 'Issue resolved, data is now available');
    }
  });
}
```

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track error state changes" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor both `ERROR` and `RESOLVED` states to implement automatic recovery workflows.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    async function trackErrorState(payload) {
      const { vehicleId, data } = payload;
      
      for (const error of data.errors) {
        if (error.state === 'ERROR') {
          await db.errors.insert({
            vehicleId,
            errorType: error.type,
            errorCode: error.code,
            affectedSignals: error.signals.map(s => s.code),
            detectedAt: new Date()
          });
        } else if (error.state === 'RESOLVED') {
          await db.errors.update(
            { vehicleId, errorCode: error.code },
            { resolvedAt: new Date(), status: 'resolved' }
          );
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use suggestedUserMessage for notifications" icon="envelope">
    Display the user-friendly message to vehicle owners instead of technical error descriptions.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    function notifyVehicleOwner(error, userId) {
      const message = error.suggestedUserMessage || 
        'We encountered an issue retrieving data from your vehicle.';
      
      sendNotification(userId, {
        title: 'Vehicle Data Unavailable',
        body: message,
        link: error.docURL // Link to troubleshooting docs
      });
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement retry logic for transient errors" icon="rotate">
    Some errors (ASLEEP, UNREACHABLE) are transient. Implement exponential backoff retries.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    const TRANSIENT_ERROR_CODES = ['ASLEEP', 'UNREACHABLE'];

    function shouldRetry(error) {
      return TRANSIENT_ERROR_CODES.includes(error.code);
    }

    async function handleTransientError(vehicleId, error) {
      const retryDelays = [60000, 300000, 900000]; // 1m, 5m, 15m
      
      for (const delay of retryDelays) {
        await sleep(delay);
        
        try {
          // Attempt to fetch data again
          const data = await smartcar.fetchSignals(vehicleId, error.signals);
          return data; // Success
        } catch (err) {
          // Still failing, continue retrying
        }
      }
      
      // All retries failed
      notifyUser(vehicleId, 'Unable to reach vehicle after multiple attempts');
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle multiple simultaneous errors" icon="layer-group">
    A single `VEHICLE_ERROR` event can contain multiple errors affecting different signals.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    function categorizeErrors(errors) {
      const categorized = {
        transient: [],
        userAction: [],
        permanent: []
      };
      
      errors.forEach(error => {
        if (['ASLEEP', 'UNREACHABLE'].includes(error.code)) {
          categorized.transient.push(error);
        } else if (error.resolution.type === 'USER_ACTION_REQUIRED') {
          categorized.userAction.push(error);
        } else {
          categorized.permanent.push(error);
        }
      });
      
      return categorized;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Degrade gracefully in your UI" icon="shield-halved">
    When errors occur, show stale data with a clear indication that it's not current.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    function displayVehicleData(vehicleId, hasActiveErrors) {
      const data = getLastKnownData(vehicleId);
      
      return {
        ...data,
        isStale: hasActiveErrors,
        staleSince: getLastSuccessfulFetch(vehicleId),
        errorMessage: 'Unable to retrieve current data. Showing last known values.'
      };
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

***

## Error Resolution Tracking

When an error condition is resolved, Smartcar sends a `VEHICLE_ERROR` event with `state: "RESOLVED"`:

```javascript theme={null}
function handleErrorResolution(payload) {
  const { vehicleId, data } = payload;
  
  data.errors.forEach(error => {
    if (error.state === 'RESOLVED') {
      console.log(`Error resolved for ${vehicleId}: ${error.code}`);
      
      // Clear error flags
      clearVehicleError(vehicleId, error.code);
      
      // Resume data collection
      resumeDataCollection(vehicleId, error.signals);
      
      // Notify user
      notifyUser(vehicleId, 'Your vehicle is now connected and data is available');
    }
  });
}
```

<Tip>
  **Automatic recovery**: Use `state: "RESOLVED"` events to automatically resume normal operations without manual intervention.

# VEHICLE_STATE Event
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/events/vehicle-state

Signal data delivery when trigger conditions are met

Triggered when one or more signals you've configured as triggers change their value. This event delivers the updated signal data for all subscribed signals in the payload.

<Warning>
  **All Configured Signals Are Always Included**

  Every `VEHICLE_STATE` event contains **all** signals you configured in your webhook subscription, regardless of which signal(s) triggered the event. This ensures you always have complete vehicle state data.

  Example: If your webhook subscribes to 10 signals but only 1 trigger changes, you'll receive all 10 signals in the payload.
</Warning>

## When This Event Fires

The `VEHICLE_STATE` event fires when Smartcar detects a signal value change for any trigger signal configured in your webhook.

### Trigger Configuration

You configure which signals should trigger this event through the Smartcar Dashboard when creating or editing a webhook. For example:

**Triggers:**

* `TractionBattery.StateOfCharge` (code: `tractionbattery-stateofcharge`)
* `Charge.IsCharging` (code: `charge-ischarging`)
* `Location.PreciseLocation` (code: `location-preciselocation`)

**Subscribed Signals:**

* `TractionBattery.StateOfCharge`
* `Charge.IsCharging`
* `Location.PreciseLocation`
* `Charge.Voltage`
* `Odometer.TraveledDistance`

If any of the trigger signals change, a `VEHICLE_STATE` event is delivered containing **all five subscribed signals**.

***

## Identifying Which Triggers Fired

The webhook payload includes a `triggers` field that specifies which trigger signal(s) changed to prompt this delivery. This helps you identify what caused the event without comparing all signal values.

### Trigger Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Signal Change Triggers" icon="arrows-rotate">
    When a monitored trigger signal changes value, the `triggers` array contains the signal(s) that changed.

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "triggers": [
        {
          "code": "tractionbattery-stateofcharge",
          "name": "StateOfCharge",
          "group": "TractionBattery"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    If multiple triggers change simultaneously, all will be included in the array.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="First Delivery Trigger" icon="flag-checkered">
    When a webhook subscription is first created, a `FIRST_DELIVERY` trigger is sent to provide the initial state of the vehicle.

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "triggers": [
        {
          "code": "FIRST_DELIVERY"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    This initial delivery:

    * Occurs after vehicle subscription to a webhook
    * Contains all subscribed signals at their current values
    * Does not indicate any signal value changes
    * Helps establish baseline state for your application

    **When FIRST\_DELIVERY is sent again:**

    * When a vehicle is unsubscribed and then resubscribed to your webhook
    * If your endpoint fails to respond with a 2xx status code, Smartcar will retry delivery with the same `FIRST_DELIVERY` trigger
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Use the `triggers` field to determine the delivery reason. Check for `"code": "FIRST_DELIVERY"` to identify initial state deliveries versus change-triggered deliveries.
</Tip>

## Signal Reference

The `signals` array contains data structured according to the [Signals Schema Reference](/api-reference/signals/schema). Each signal type has a specific shape:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Charge Signals" href="/api-reference/signals/charge">
    Battery charging status and metrics
  </Card>

  <Card title="Battery Signals" href="/api-reference/signals/tractionbattery">
    State of charge and battery health
  </Card>

  <Card title="Location Signals" href="/api-reference/signals/location">
    GPS coordinates and location data
  </Card>

  <Card title="Odometer" href="/api-reference/signals/odometer">
    Distance traveled
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fuel Tank" href="/api-reference/get-fuel-tank">
    Fuel level for ICE vehicles
  </Card>

  <Card title="All Signals" href="/api-reference/signals/schema">
    Complete signal catalog
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

***

## Signal-Level Errors

Individual signals within a `VEHICLE_STATE` payload can contain errors if the vehicle doesn't support that signal or if retrieval fails. When this occurs, the signal will have a `status` object with error details instead of a `body` with data:

```json Signal with Error theme={null}
{
  "code": "location-isathome",
  "name": "IsAtHome",
  "group": "Location",
  "status": {
    "error": {
      "code": "VEHICLE_NOT_CAPABLE",
      "type": "COMPATIBILITY"
    },
    "value": "ERROR"
  }
}
```

<Info>
  **Partial data delivery**: When some signals succeed and others fail, you'll receive a `VEHICLE_STATE` event with successful signals containing `body` data and failed signals containing `status` errors. This allows you to process available data even when some signals are unavailable.
</Info>

For complete error handling, see the [VEHICLE\_ERROR Event](/api-reference/webhooks/events/vehicle-error) documentation.

***

## Processing VEHICLE\_STATE Events

### Basic Handler

```javascript theme={null}
function handleVehicleState(payload) {
  const { vehicleId, data } = payload;
  const { signals, triggers } = data;
  
  // Check if this is first delivery
  const isFirstDelivery = triggers.some(t => t.code === 'FIRST_DELIVERY');
  
  // Process each signal
  signals.forEach(signal => {
    if (signal.body) {
      // Signal has data
      console.log(`${signal.name}: ${JSON.stringify(signal.body)}`);
      updateDatabase(vehicleId, signal.code, signal.body);
    } else if (signal.status) {
      // Signal has error
      console.error(`${signal.name} error: ${signal.status.error.code}`);
      handleSignalError(vehicleId, signal);
    }
  });
}
```

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use eventId for deduplication" icon="fingerprint">
    Always check if you've already processed an `eventId` before updating your database. Retries will have the same `eventId` but different `deliveryId`.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    async function processWebhook(payload) {
      const { eventId } = payload;
      
      // Check if already processed
      if (await isProcessed(eventId)) {
        console.log(`Already processed ${eventId}`);
        return;
      }
      
      // Process the event
      await handleVehicleState(payload);
      
      // Mark as processed
      await markProcessed(eventId);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check timestamp freshness" icon="clock">
    Use `signals[].meta.oemUpdatedAt` to determine if incoming data is newer than your stored state. Events can arrive out of order.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    function shouldUpdate(currentData, newSignal) {
      if (!currentData) return true;
      
      return newSignal.meta.oemUpdatedAt > currentData.timestamp;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle partial failures gracefully" icon="shield-halved">
    Some signals may succeed while others fail. Process available data and log errors for unavailable signals.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    signals.forEach(signal => {
      if (signal.body) {
        updateVehicleData(signal);
      } else if (signal.status) {
        logSignalUnavailable(signal);
        // Don't block processing of other signals
      }
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Differentiate FIRST_DELIVERY from changes" icon="flag">
    Use the `triggers` field to identify initial state deliveries vs. actual signal changes.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    const isFirstDelivery = payload.data.triggers.some(
      t => t.code === 'FIRST_DELIVERY'
    );

    if (isFirstDelivery) {
      // Initialize vehicle state
      initializeVehicle(payload.data);
    } else {
      // Update changed signals
      updateVehicleState(payload.data);
    }
    ```

# VERIFY Event
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/events/verify

One-time challenge to verify your webhook endpoint

A one-time event sent when you first create a webhook to verify that Smartcar can successfully deliver payloads to your callback URL.

<Warning>
  **Required Before Data Delivery**

  Your endpoint must successfully respond to the `VERIFY` event before Smartcar will deliver any `VEHICLE_STATE` or `VEHICLE_ERROR` events. This confirms your endpoint is configured correctly and ready to receive webhooks.
</Warning>

## When This Event Fires

The `VERIFY` event fires once when you:

* Create a new webhook in the Smartcar Dashboard
* Update the callback URL of an existing webhook
* Click "Verify this webhook" in the Dashboard

***

## Payload Structure

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Version 4.0 (Current) theme={null}
  {
    "eventId": "52f6e0bb-1369-45da-a61c-9e67d092d6db",
    "eventType": "VERIFY",
    "data": {
      "challenge": "3a5c8f72-e6d9-4b1a-9f2e-8c7d6a5b4e3f"
    },
    "meta": {
      "version": "4.0",
      "webhookId": "5a8e5e38-1e12-4011-a36d-56f120053f9e",
      "webhookName": "Example Webhook",
      "deliveryId": "5d569643-3a47-4cd1-a3ec-db5fc1f6f03b",
      "deliveredAt": 1761896351529
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json Version 2.0 (Legacy) theme={null}
  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "webhookId": "5a8e5e38-1e12-4011-a36d-56f120053f9e",
    "eventName": "verify",
    "payload": { 
      "challenge": "3a5c8f72-e6d9-4b1a-9f2e-8c7d6a5b4e3f"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Payload Fields

<ResponseField name="eventId" type="string">
  Unique identifier for this verification event.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="eventType" type="string">
  Always `"VERIFY"` for this event type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Container for the challenge.

  <Expandable title="data object">
    <ResponseField name="challenge" type="string">
      Random string that must be hashed with your Application Management Token and returned in your response.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  Webhook delivery metadata. See [Event Reference Overview](/api-reference/webhooks/events/overview#common-fields) for the complete `meta` object schema.
</ResponseField>

***

## Required Response

Your endpoint must respond with:

1. **Status code**: `200 OK`
2. **Content-Type header**: `application/json`
3. **Response body**: JSON object with the HMAC-SHA256 hash

```json Response Body theme={null}
{
  "challenge": "a3f5c8e9d2b4a1f6e8c7d9a5b3e1f2c4d6a8b9c1e3f5a7b9c2d4e6f8a1b3c5d7"
}
```

### Generate the HMAC

Create an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the `challenge` string using your **Application Management Token** as the secret key, then hex-encode the result:

<Tip>
  Our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks) have helper methods to generate the HMAC automatically.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import smartcar

  hmac = smartcar.hash_challenge(
      application_management_token, 
      challenge
  )

  # Return in response body
  return {"challenge": hmac}, 200
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
  const smartcar = require('smartcar');

  const hmac = smartcar.hashChallenge(
      application_management_token, 
      challenge
  );

  // Return in response body
  res.status(200).json({ challenge: hmac });
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  import com.smartcar.sdk.Smartcar;

  String hmac = Smartcar.hashChallenge(
      application_management_token, 
      challenge
  );

  // Return in response body
  return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("challenge", hmac));
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby theme={null}
  require 'smartcar'

  hmac = Smartcar.hash_challenge(
      application_management_token, 
      challenge
  )

  # Return in response body
  { challenge: hmac }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Complete Handler Example

Here's a complete webhook handler that responds to the `VERIFY` event:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js (Express) theme={null}
  const express = require('express');
  const smartcar = require('smartcar');

  const app = express();

    const { eventType, data } = req.body;
    
    if (eventType === 'VERIFY') {
      // Generate HMAC challenge response
      const hmac = smartcar.hashChallenge(
        process.env.SMARTCAR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN,
        data.challenge
      );
      
      return res.status(200).json({ challenge: hmac });
    }
    
    // Handle other event types...

      # Handle other event types...
      return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200
  ```

  ```java Java (Spring Boot) theme={null}

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verification fails in Dashboard" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Common causes:**

    * Wrong Application Management Token used
    * HMAC not hex-encoded
    * Response body doesn't match `{ "challenge": "..." }` format
    * Endpoint returns non-200 status code
    * Response takes longer than 15 seconds

    **Solution:** Use the Dashboard's verification modal to see the expected challenge and response. Compare your implementation against the provided code snippets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test VERIFY locally?" icon="laptop">
    Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or similar to expose your local server:

    ```bash theme={null}
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    Then use the ngrok URL as your callback URI in the Dashboard. The Dashboard will send a real `VERIFY` event to your local endpoint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I re-verify my webhook?" icon="rotate">
    Yes! You can click "Verify this webhook" in the Dashboard at any time to send a new `VERIFY` event to your endpoint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to handle VERIFY in production?" icon="question">
    Yes, your production webhook endpoint should always handle the `VERIFY` event type, even after initial verification. This allows you to re-verify from the Dashboard if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Timeout Requirement**

  Your endpoint must respond to the `VERIFY` event within **15 seconds**. If verification times out, Smartcar will not activate the webhook.
</Warning>

***

## Next Steps

After successfully responding to the `VERIFY` event, your webhook is activated and will begin receiving vehicle data.

b. Unavailable brands that we plan to introduce in the future, which will display a message highlighting future compatibility with the chosen brand.

2. Expanding login method coverage to include phone numbers for certain brands. We now allow users to log in using email or phone number for the Connect flow starting with Kia and Mercedes-Benz. Stay tuned to our changelog for more brand updates.
3. Providing clearer errors for the Connect flow:

a. no\_vehicles for when the user does not have any vehicles tied to their account and they click to go back to the application

b. configuration\_error for when exiting Connect back to your app through an error page (see below).

<Update label="January 28th, 2026">
  ## Charging signal CONNECTOR replaced with CHARGING\_TYPE is now live

  The charging signal change [announced on January 12th](#upcoming-change-charging-signal-connector-to-charging_type) is now live. The `CONNECTOR` type has been replaced with `CHARGING_TYPE` in the following signals:

  * Charge.ChargeLimits
  * Charge.ChargeRecords
  * Charge.ChargeTimers

  These signals now return the charging current type (`AC` or `DC`) instead of a connector hardware type. If your integration parses any of these signals and still references the `CONNECTOR` type, update your code to use `CHARGING_TYPE` and parse the `chargingType` field.

  For full details on the change, see the [original announcement](#upcoming-change-charging-signal-connector-to-charging_type) below.
</Update>

<Update label="January 20th, 2026">
  ## Send Destination now available for Volkswagen

  You can now use the Smartcar API to send destinations to Volkswagen vehicles in the United States.

  With the Send Destination command, your application can route a destination directly to a driver's built-in navigation screen. This unlocks new workflows:

  * Fleet management: Route drivers to their next pickup, delivery, or service location
  * Car sharing and rentals: Send return location addresses when a rental period is ending
  * Repair and maintenance: Direct customers to your nearest service center when maintenance is needed
  * Charging networks: Guide EV drivers to available chargers when battery is low

  **Get started**: Request the `control_navigation` permission during the Smartcar Connect flow and call [Send Destination](/api-reference/send-destination-to-vehicle).

  On January 28th, 2026, we're updating three charging-related signals. This is a breaking change that may require updates to your integration.

  **Affected signals:**

  * `Charge.ChargeLimits`
  * `Charge.ChargeRecords`
  * `Charge.ChargeTimers`

  **What's changing:**
  In all three signals, the `CONNECTOR` type is being replaced with `CHARGING_TYPE`. Instead of returning a connector hardware type (e.g., `J1772`), these signals will now return the charging current type (`AC` or `DC`).

  **Before (current format):**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "type": "CONNECTOR",
    "condition": {
      "connectorType": "J1772"
    }
  }
  ```

  **After (new format):**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "type": "CHARGING_TYPE",
    "condition": {
      "chargingType": "AC"
    }
  }
  ```

  Other types such as `GLOBAL` and `LOCATION` remain unchanged.

  **Why we're making this change:**
  OEMs report connector hardware types inconsistently--some return proprietary strings, others return nothing at all. In contrast, AC vs. DC charging type is more widely provided across manufacturers.

  This change gives you more consistent, actionable data. Rather than maintaining a mapping of connector type strings, you can rely on a simple AC or DC value to determine whether the vehicle is on Level 1/2 charging or DC fast charging.

  **What you need to do:**
  If your integration parses any of these signals and handles the `CONNECTOR` type, update your code to:

  * Expect `CHARGING_TYPE` instead of `CONNECTOR`
  * Parse `chargingType` (values: `AC` or `DC`) instead of `connectorType`

  **Timeline:**

  * Now -> January 27th, 2026: Current format remains in place
  * January 28th, 2026: New format goes live

  ## Verifying webhooks just got a lot easier!

  <Frame>
    <img alt="" />
  </Frame>

  When you verify a webhook, you’ll see a guided modal with a sample challenge string, copy-ready SDK snippets (Python, Node, Java, Ruby), and inline instructions for hashing the `application_management_token` plus challenge.

  When your server responds with your webhook verification, you'll see the response that Smartcar received compared to the expected hash output.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="" />
  </Frame>

  If the verification fails, the new response tab surfaces the HTTP status, challenge string, expected hash output, and the payload Smartcar received so you can immediately compare and retry. This feedback loop removes trial-and-error, shortens onboarding for new teams, and ensures your webhook endpoint is producing the correct `SC-Signature` before you start ingesting production signals.

  **Get started**

  * Head to the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/integrations) and select your webhook integration to launch the verifier.
  * Follow the updated [Payload verification guide](/integrations/webhooks/payload-verification) to reproduce the same HMAC calculation server-side.
  * After verification succeeds, wire up your [webhook receiver tutorial](/getting-started/tutorials/webhook-receiver-recipe) or call the [webhook overview](/integrations/webhooks/overview) docs for deployment best practices.

# Country Selection
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/country-flag

By default Connect will launch based on the devices location impacting the brands that are available to the user e.g. Renault is only available in Europe.

You can override this behavior by passing a country feature flag in your Connect URL in the form `country:{country_code}`.

Your feature flag should contain the [two-character ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
of the country that your user is located in.

<Tip>
  Our SDKs provide ways for you to add this as part of the various `authUrlBuilder` or `getAuthUrl` methods.
</Tip>

```plaintext Connect URL w/ country feature flag theme={null}
https://connect.smartcar.com/oauth/authorize?
response_type=code
&client_id=8229df9f-91a0-4ff0-a1ae-a1f38ee24d07
&scope=read_odometer read_vehicle_info
&redirect_uri=https://example.com/home
&flags=country:GB
```

Alternatively, your users can manually change their country and language on Connect's preamble screen:

# Connect Flows
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/flows

Connect can be launched with three different workflows (default, single select, and single select with VIN). Depending on your use case and what information you  have about the vehicle ahead of a launching Connect, you may be able to leverage one of these flows for a more streamlined Connect experience.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default">
    When you launch Connect, users will be able to select the brand of their vehicle from a list before they enter their credentials and grant access to your application.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Authorizing a Single Vehicle">
    In some cases you may only want to connect to a single vehicle, even if there are more than one on your user's connected services account. Smartcar provides two ways for you to do this:

    * Single Select
    * Single Select with VIN

    ### Single Select

    Limits the user's selection on the permissions screen to a single car if there are multiple vehicles on their connected services account. Notice that check-boxes turn into radio buttons, and the call to action wording changes slightly.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    To enable Single Select, you can pass `single_select=true` as URL parameter when launching Smartcar Connect.

    ### Single Select with VIN

    In addition, if you know the user’s VIN ahead of time you can pass this over to us in the connect URL. In doing so:

    1. Smartcar  decodes the VIN to get the brand and send the user to the appropriate login form directly
    2. If the owner has more than one vehicle on their connected services account, we’ll only show the VIN that was passed to us on the permission grant screen.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    To enable Single Select with VIN, you can pass `single_select=true` and `single_select_vin=:vin` as URL parameters when launching Smartcar Connect.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bypassing the Brand Selection Screen">
    ### Brand Select

    Instead of having users go through the brand selector screen, you can pass us a brand in the Connect URL and send the user to the appropriate login form directly.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    To enable Brand Select, you can pass `make` as URL parameter when launching Connect. For example, `make=TESLA`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


# Modes
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/modes

Connect can be launched in different modes depending on whether you want to interact with real vehicles or test your integration.

<Tip>
  If no mode is specified, Connect will launch in `live` mode by default.
</Tip>

| Mode      | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| live      | Launches Connect in live mode allowing a user to log in with a real connected services account.                       |
| simulated | Launches Connect in simulated mode allowing developers to connect to vehicles created on Dashboard via the Simulator. |


# SDKs for Connect
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/connect-sdks

Our SDKs make integrating Smartcar fast and easy in different languages and frameworks.

For mobile or single page web apps, you can use one of our frontend SDKs. Please note that our frontend SDKs only handle
integrating Connect into your application. You will still need to use a [backend SDK](/api-reference/api-sdks) to manage tokens and make API requests to vehicles.

<Snippet />

<Note>**Note:** In addition to using a frontend SDK to integrate with Smartcar Connect, a backend SDK is strongly recommended to securely manage tokens, receive data from Smartcar, and make API requests to issue commands to vehicles. The backend SDK facilitates authentication, token exchange, and all communication with Smartcar’s APIs.</Note>

For server-side rendered applications, you can use one of our backend SDKs:

<Snippet />

<br />

<Tip>
  Don't see an SDK for your language? No problem!
  As long as you can build a URL and handle HTTP requests, you're good to go.
</Tip>


# Dashboard Configuration
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/dashboard-config



## Registration

To get started, register your application with Smartcar by navigating to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/login).

After registration, your application will be assigned a `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET`. The `CLIENT_SECRET` must be kept safe and used only in exchanges between your application’s server and Smartcar’s <Tooltip>authorization server</Tooltip>.

## Redirect URIs

To authorize with Smartcar, you’ll need to provide one or more redirect URIs. The user will be redirected to the specified URI upon authorization. On redirect, the URI will contain an authorization `code` query parameter that must be exchanged with Smartcar’s authorization server for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

The first redirect URI you add to your application is automatically set as the default. If you do not specify a `redirect_uri` in your Connect URL, Smartcar will use this default URI. You can add multiple URIs and set any of them as the default in the Smartcar Dashboard.

The redirect URIs must match one of the following formats:

| Protocol       | Format                                                                                   | Example                                                                        |

# Rivian Bluetooth Pairing
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/other-actions/rivian-bluetooth-pairing

To support vehicle commands such as lock/unlock or start/stop charge, Rivian requires a mobile device to be paired via Bluetooth with the vehicle.

If permissions for commands are requested in your Connect URL (i.e. `control_security`, `control_charge`), Rivian owners will be prompted to pair their phone to the vehicle to complete the connection. After successful login, users will see a list of vehicles within their Rivian account to pair to. It is important that the mobile phone has Bluetooth enabled at this time.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

After selecting the vehicle, the user will be prompted to tap “Set up now” on the Rivian vehicle’s display and follow any on-screen prompts to connect.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Once setup is complete, the application will be able to issue commands to the Rivian vehicle.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Should Bluetooth be disabled or the Rivian display prompts not followed, the Bluetooth connection will not be established and the vehicle will not be connected to your application.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Notes

* Rivian vehicles must be paired via Bluetooth to support commands. Data permissions (i.e. `read_location`, `read_charge`) do not require Bluetooth pairing.
* The following commands are supported for Rivian vehicles: lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and set charge limit.
* If a user has multiple Rivian vehicles, they will be prompted to pair each vehicle that they wish to connect to your application.
* At least one vehicle must be paired via Bluetooth to complete the pairing process before the user can continue with the Connect flow and connect their Rivian to your application.
* If there are multiple drivers associated with a Rivian account and both drivers want to connect to your application, each driver must pair their mobile device to the vehicle via Bluetooth.
* There is a limit of four devices that can be paired to a Rivian vehicle at one time. If a user has already paired four devices to their Rivian, they will need to unpair one of the existing devices from the vehicle before they can pair their mobile device and complete the connection to your application.
* Smartcar mobile SDKs for iOS and Android are required to pair the vehicle via Bluetooth.


# Tesla Virtual Keys
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/other-actions/tesla-virtual-key

To support vehicle commands such as lock/unlock or start/stop charge, and benefit from faster data frequencies, Tesla requires a Virtual Key to be added to the vehicle.

For more information about Virtual Keys, please visit the [Virtual Key page](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/virtual-key-tesla).

### Vehicle Owners adding a Virtual Key

Smartcar Connect will present Tesla vehicle owners a prompt to install the Tesla Virtual Key after granting access and prior to redirecting them back to your application.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

When users open the virtual key link, depending on their device, they will be redirected to the Tesla app or prompted to scan a QR code.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mobile Device">
    On mobile devices, they will be redirected to the Tesla app and prompted to add the Virtual Key

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Desktop">
    On Desktop, they will be prompted to scan the QR code which in turn opens up the Tesla app and prompts them to add a Virtual Key

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Virtual Key status can be checked at any time from the Tesla infotainment screen under Settings > Locks.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Smartcar will automatically determine which Tesla vehicles require a Virtual Key and prompt users to add it only for those vehicles. If a user has multiple Tesla vehicles, they will be prompted to add a Virtual Key for each vehicle that requires it. At least one vehicle must complete the pairing process before the user can continue with the Connect flow and connect their Tesla to your application.

### 2020 and Earlier Model S/X with Streaming Support

For 2020 and earlier Model S and X vehicles that support streaming (via a software update), Smartcar Connect handles this differently:

* These vehicles **do not require Virtual Key installation**
* During the Connect flow, users are prompted about enabling streaming via an in-vehicle toggle
* Users can request email instructions on how to enable the streaming setting in their vehicle's infotainment screen
* Once the streaming toggle is enabled in the vehicle, data will be refreshed more frequently
* Without streaming enabled, data is refreshed every 5 minutes while the vehicle is awake


# Handle the Response
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/re-auth/handle-response

If the re-auth is successful, the redirect to your application will contain a vehicle ID. In the case of an error, we'll provide an error and description as parameters instead.

# OEM Migrations and Re-authentication
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/re-auth/oem-migrations

Understanding when and why vehicle owners need to re-authenticate due to OEM infrastructure changes and migrations.

## Overview

As automakers evolve their connected services infrastructure, Smartcar occasionally needs to migrate integrations to newer OEM APIs or authentication systems. These migrations ensure your application maintains access to the latest features, improved reliability, and continued compatibility with OEM platforms. Smartcar does this work on your behalf to minimize disruption.

**Important**: Some OEM migrations will require vehicle owners to re-authenticate through Smartcar Connect. This is a necessary step to maintain secure access to vehicle data.

<Warning>
  Re-authentication requirements are an inevitable part of working with automotive APIs. Ensuring your application can gracefully manage [re-atuthentication](/connect/re-auth/redirect-to-connect) will help minimize disruption to your users.
</Warning>

## When Re-authentication Is Required

Vehicle owners may need to re-authenticate in several scenarios:

### Common Scenarios

Re-authentication may be required when:

* Vehicle owners change their OEM account credentials
* Connected services subscriptions are renewed or modified
* Vehicle owners revoke and re-grant access through OEM portals

### OEM Infrastructure Changes

When an automaker upgrades their API infrastructure or releases a new connected services platform, existing connections may need to be re-established. Examples include:

* **New APIs**: When OEMs annouce a new API platform for third-parties requiring all connected vehicles to re-authenticate
* **OEM Platform Updates**: When OEMs periodically update their authentication systems invalidating existing tokens forcing re-authentication
* **OEM Migrations**: When accounts or platforms are migrated between regions or systems deprecating legacy platforms

## Migration Communication

When a migration requiring re-authentication is necessary, Smartcar will:

1. **Notify you in advance** via email and your dedicated Slack channel
2. **Provide migration timelines** so you can plan communications with your users
3. **Offer technical support** throughout the migration process
4. **Provide documentation** outlining required actions (if any)

## Implementation Best Practices

### Plan for Re-authentication

Build your application with the expectation that re-authentication will be needed:

```javascript theme={null}
// Example: Handle authentication errors gracefully
try {
  const response = await vehicle.odometer();
} catch (error) {
  if (error.type === 'AUTHENTICATION' || 
      error.statusCode === 'CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT:AUTHENTICATION_FAILED') {
    // Prompt user to re-authenticate
    const reauthUrl = error.resolution?.url;
    redirectToReauth(reauthUrl);
  }
}
```

### Monitor for Authentication Errors

Watch for authentication-related errors in your API responses:

* `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`: Indicates credentials are invalid or expired
* `PERMISSION` errors: May require permission updates through re-authentication
* API errors with `resolution.url`: Often include a pre-built re-authentication URL

See our [error documentation](/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors) for complete details.

### Use Webhooks for Proactive Detection

Subscribe to [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview) to detect authentication issues before users report them:

```json theme={null}
{
  "eventId": "5a537912-9ad3-424b-ba33-65a1704567e9",

    "webhookName": "Your Webhook's Name",
    "mode": "LIVE"
  }
}
```

### Implement Streamlined Re-authentication

Use Smartcar's [re-authentication flow](/connect/re-auth/redirect-to-connect) to make the process seamless:

* Pre-populate the vehicle ID to skip vehicle selection
* Use the error's `resolution.url` field when available
* Provide clear messaging about why re-authentication is needed

### Communicate Proactively

When a migration is announced:

1. **Email users ahead of time** explaining the need and benefits
2. **Show in-app notifications** with clear calls-to-action
3. **Provide support resources** for users who have questions
4. **Track re-authentication completion** to follow up with users who haven't completed the process

### Example User Communication

<Accordion title="Sample email template">
  **Subject**: Action Required: Reconnect Your \[Vehicle Make] to \[Your App Name]

  Hi \[User Name],

  \[Your App Name] lost connection to your \[Vehicle Make]. Your action is needed to continue receiving \[Your app's benefits].

  **Why is this needed?**
  Connections to \[Vehicle Make] may expire from time to time. To maintain secure access to your vehicle data, you need to reconnect your vehicle.

  **What you need to do:**

  1. Click the button below to reconnect your vehicle
  2. Log in with your \[Vehicle Make] account credentials
  3. Approve the connection

  \[Reconnect My Vehicle Button]

  This process takes less than a minute. Your vehicle data and preferences will not be affected.

  If you have questions, reply to this email or contact our support team.

  Thank you,
  The \[Your App Name] Team
</Accordion>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will all OEM migrations require re-authentication?">
    No. Smartcar handles many OEM updates transparently without requiring user action. Re-authentication is only required when the changes are not compatible with the current integration. Smartcar does its best to minimize re-authentication related to OEM platform changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much notice will we receive for migrations?">
    Smartcar provides advance notice for planned migrations, typically several weeks to months depending on the scope. In rare cases where OEMs make unexpected changes, we'll communicate as soon as possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if users don't re-authenticate?">
    API requests will continue to fail with authentication errors until re-authentication is completed. The vehicle connection will remain in your system, but no data can be retrieved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can we force re-authentication for all users at once?">
    Yes. The sooner re-authentication occurs, the sooner you and your users can leverage new features or resolve downtime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will access tokens and refresh tokens change?">
    This depends on the migration. In some cases, existing connections will remain valid. In other cases, existing tokens will expire and re-authentication is required to resolve re-establish a connection. Smartcar will specify this in migration communication.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Redirect to Connect
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/re-auth/redirect-to-connect



There will be times when a user updates credentials to their connected services account. When this happens, the user will need to go through Connect
again to update your authorization through Smartcar.

You can do this with a streamlined Connect flow using a special re-auth URL with the parameters below.

<Info>
  Re-authentication is also required when OEMs migrate to new API platforms. See [OEM Migrations and Re-authentication](/connect/re-auth/oem-migrations) to understand when and why these migrations occur, and how to prepare your implementation.
</Info>

<Tip>
  The [`AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`](/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#authentication-failed) API error contains a partially constructed re-authentication URL in the `resolution.url` field.
</Tip>

<br />

<ParamField type="string">
  The application’s unique identifier.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  The URI a user will be redirected to after authorization. This value **must** match one of the redirect URIs set in the credentials tab of the dashboard.

  The first redirect URI you add to your application is automatically set as the default. If you do not specify a `redirect_uri` in your Connect URL, Smartcar will use this default URI. You can add multiple URIs and set any of them as the default in the Smartcar Dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  This value must be set to `vehicle_id`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  The id of the vehicle you are reauthenticating.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  An optional value included as a query parameter in the redirect\_uri back to your application. This value is often used to identify a user and/or prevent cross-site request forgery
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  Specify a unique identifier for the vehicle owner to track and aggregate analytics across Connect sessions for each vehicle owner on Dashboard.

  Note: Use the `state` parameter in order to identify the user at your callback URI when receiving an authorization or error code after the user exits the Connect flow.
</ParamField>

# Build the Connect URL
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/redirect-to-connect

Learn how to construct the Smartcar Connect URL to redirect users through the vehicle authorization flow.

<Tip>
  For mobile or single-page web applications you can use one of our [frontend SDKs](/connect/connect-sdks), or for server-side rendered applications you can use one of
  our [backend SDKs](/connect/connect-sdks). Using our SDKs makes it much easier to generate the Connect URL with the proper parameters.
</Tip>

You can configure default permissions for your application in the "Vehicle Access" tab of your application's Configuration page in the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com). These settings will determine what permissions are requested during the Connect flow. Any `scope` parameters you specify in the Connect URL will override these dashboard settings.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Smartcar Dashboard Configuration Page For Vehicle Access" />
</Frame>

Once you have configured your application, you can get a pre-built Connect URL by clicking the "Share Connect Link" button at the top right in the Smartcar Dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Getting the Connect URL" />
</Frame>

To build the Connect URL manually by overriding your dashboard settings, pass the following parameters:

<Warning>
  Any parameters you specify in the Connect URL will override your dashboard settings.
</Warning>

<ParamField type="string">
  The application’s unique identifier. This is available on the credentials tab of the dashboard
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  The URI a user will be redirected to after authorization. This value must match one of the redirect URIs set in the credentials tab of the dashboard.

  The first redirect URI you add to your application is automatically set as the default. If you do not specify a `redirect_uri` in your Connect URL, Smartcar will use this default URI. You can add multiple URIs and set any of them as the default in the Smartcar Dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  This value must be set to `code` during the initial authentication. OAuth2 outlines multiple authorization types. Smartcar Connect utilizes the “Authorization Code” flow.

  To reauthenticate a user after they have already connected a vehicle, you can set this value to the `vehicle_id` of a previously connected vehicle.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="[permissions]">
  A space-separated list of permissions that your application is requesting access to. The valid permission names can be found in the permissions section. A permission is optional by default. It can be made required by adding the required: prefix to the permission name, e.g. required:read\_odometer.

  <Info>
    **Regional Difference:** This parameter is only suppported in the US & Canada. For European vehicles, the `required:` prefix is not enforced. Vehicles can complete the Connect flow even if they don't support all required permissions, as capability validation happens when you make an API request rather than during Connect. If a vehicle doesn't support a required permission, you'll receive a [VEHICLE\_NOT\_CAPABLE](/errors/api-errors/compatibility-errors#vehicle-not-capable) error when attempting to use that endpoint.
  </Info>

  If you don't specify a `scope` parameter, Smartcar will use the permissions configured in the "Vehicle Access" tab of your application's Configuration page in the Dashboard. Any `scope` parameters passed in the Connect URL will override those dashboard settings.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  An optional value included as a query parameter in the `REDIRECT_URI` back to your application. This value is often used to identify a user and/or prevent cross-site request forgery
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  An optional value that sets the behavior of the approval dialog displayed to the user.
  Defaults to `auto` and will only display the approval dialog if the user has not previously approved the scope.
  Set this to `force` to ensure the approval dialog is always shown to the user even if they have previously approved the same scope.

# User Selected Battery Capacity
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/user-selected-batcap

This flow can be launched using the URL provided by the [battery capacity](/docs/api-reference/get-nominal-capacity) endpoint.

## Automatic Battery Capacity Selection

When you request the `read_battery` permission, users will automatically be prompted to select their vehicle's battery capacity during the Smartcar Connect flow if we cannot determine the specific capacity for their vehicle(s). This ensures accurate battery information for your application is readily available.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

For users that skip the selection prompt or were connected prior to September 18th, 2025, you can still launch the battery capacity selection flow manually using the URL provided by the [GET /battery/nominal\_capacity](/api-reference/get-nominal-capacity) endpoint.

### Append your redirect URI

Smartcar will provide a URL with the following parameters from the [GET
/battery/nominal\_capacity](/api-reference/get-nominal-capacity) endpoint:

```http theme={null}
https://connect.smartcar.com/battery-capacity
?vehicle_id=36ab27d0-fd9d-4455-823a-ce30af709ffc

<ParamField type="string">
  The `client_id` from the Smartcar Dashboard for your application.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  Must be set to `vehicle_id`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  The URI you would like the response sent to after a user exits the
  flow.

  **NOTE:** this is the only parameter that will **not** be prepopulated as
  part of the API response. You **must** append it in order to launch the
  flow successfully and receive confirmation the user has exited the flow.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  A token to validate that the URL was provided from a [battery capacity](/api-reference/get-nominal-capacity)
  response for your application. The token is valid for 30 days. If a token is not provided or is no longer valid,
  the user will be directed to re-auth prior to selecting their capacity.
</ParamField>

## Response

### Success

After the user selects a capacity and completes the flow, Smartcar will send
the following to your redirect URI:

```http Success theme={null}
https://example.com/home
?vehicle_id=36ab27d0-fd9d-4455-823a-ce30af709ffc
&selected_capacity=80.9
&reason=battery_capacity
```

Upon receiving a success response, you can access the `selected_capacity` by calling the GET
[/battery/nominal\_capacity](/api-reference/get-nominal-capacity) endpoint to
view the selection in the `capacity.nominal` field.

### Error

When you redirect the user to select a battery capacity and they select "I don't know the battery capacity", Smartcar will send the
following to your redirect URI:

```http Error theme={null}
https://example.com/home
?error=battery_capacity_no_selection
&error_description=user did not know battery capacity
&vehicle_id=36ab27d0-fd9d-4455-823a-ce30af709ffc
```

# What is Connect?
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/what-is-connect



Smartcar Connect is the fastest and most transparent way to collect user consent. Before you can make API requests to a car, your customer needs to link the vehicle to your app. It’s a simple process for your users to enroll their vehicles:

1. Select the car brand
2. Sign in
3. Give consent

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

From your app, you'll [redirect your users to Connect](/connect/redirect-to-connect), and [handle the response](/connect/handle-the-response) once the user completes or exits the Connect flow. You'll receive a `code` that you'll use to [exchange](/api-reference/authorization/auth-code-exchange) for an access token to start making requests to their vehicle(s).

We have designed Connect in compliance with the OAuth2 authorization protocol, safely handling all user information.

Connect comes with robust configurations to fit your needs and frontend [SDKs](/connect/connect-sdks) for faster integration.


# Authentication Errors

```

### Suggested Resolution

You can resolve this error by referring to our API reference and ensuring that you pass all the parameters as specified. If you are certain that your request is well-formed, please try refreshing your access token.

### Troubleshooting Steps

Refer to our API reference and ensure that you use the correct authentication mechanism for your request

* Check constants like Bearer and Basic for spelling mistakes.
* If you make a request to a vehicle endpoint, verify that your access token grants you access to the correct vehicle. You can do so by making a request to the /vehicles endpoint and ensuring that the correct vehicle ID is included in the returned response.
* If you have refreshed your access token, make sure that it persists and that you use your new token to make your request.

This error occurs when the user has encountered an Error page in Connect and has chosen to return to your application.

| Parameter           | Required | Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `error`             | `true`   | `configuration_error`                                             |
| `error_description` | `true`   | There has been an error in the configuration of your application. |
| `status_code`       | `true`   | The status code of the error encountered in Connect               |
| `error_message`     | `true`   | The error message seen by the user                                |

```http Example redirect uri theme={null}
HTTP/1.1 302 Found

```

On redirect, Connect will return the status code and message of the error that they encountered. This will be triggered if:

* A user tried to directly navigate to a page that is past their current step in Connect (i.e. going directly from the Preamble screen to the Permission Grants screen by directly going to connect.smartcar.com/grant).
* A user is trying to use Single Select in live mode with a test mode VIN or with a simulated VIN in a non-simulated mode.
* A user is trying to use Single Select with an invalid mock VIN.
* A validation error occurs when trying to check compatibility by VIN.

These cases will trigger the following error and give the user the ability to “Exit” Connect.

```

<Note>
  We only show the “Exit” button if a redirect URI is available. If there is a failure before the validation of the redirect URI,  we are unable to include the “Exit” button on the Error page. In those cases, we would not be able to report the `status_code` and `error_message` back to the developer, but they will still be available on screen in the Error page.

# Vehicle Incompatible
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/connect-errors/vehicle-incompatible

This error occurs when a user tries to authorize an incompatible vehicle in Smartcar Connect.

| Parameter           | Required | Description                           |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `error`             | `true`   | `vehicle_incompatible`                |
| `error_description` | `true`   | The user’s vehicle is not compatible. |
| `make`              | `false`  | The manufacturer of the vehicle.      |
| `vin`               | `false`  | The VIN of the vehicle.               |

In order to be compatible, a vehicle must:

* Have the hardware required for internet connectivity
* Belong to the makes and models Smartcar is compatible with
* Be capable of the required permissions that your application is requesting access to
* If the user’s vehicle is incompatible, Smartcar will let the user know and offer them to share their vehicle’s VIN, make, model, and year with your application.

This error is triggered when a user selects an unsupported make, or selects "I don't see my brand..." and then hits "Back to application"

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

We recommend that your application provides a flow for incompatible vehicles like in the example below.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

<Info>
  Note: This error will never occur if your application uses the Compatibility API. The Compatibility API verifies the compatibility of a vehicle before the user enters Smartcar Connect.

# Implementation Checklist
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/Implementation-Checklist

Use this guide to track your progress through the Smartcar integration process, from initial setup to production launch.

## Phase 0: Pre-Kickoff

* **Tech Stack:** Identify technology stack for implementation and explore appropriate SDKs ([frontend](https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/connect-sdks) and [backend](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/api-sdks)) and [getting started resources](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
* **Tesla Tenanting:** (*Enterprise Only*) Check in with your Solution Architect to ensure you have your Tesla Tenant set up enabling your org to have a [Virtual Key with your own brand name](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/virtual-key-tesla#enterprise-plan).
* **Slack Channel**: (*Enterprise Only*) Smartcar will set up a [dedicated Slack channel](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/assist-ai-slack) for technical communications - ensure the relevant stakeholders are added.

## Phase 1: Application Setup & Security Foundation

* **Team Access:** [Invite relevant team members](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/dashboard/teams#members) to your Smartcar Dashboard account.
* **Subscribe to Updates:** Ensure your team subscribes to [status.smartcar.com](https://status.smartcar.com), [brandreliability.smartcar.com](https://brandreliability.smartcar.com) and [product changelogs](https://smartcar.com/docs/changelog/latest) to stay informed on platform health and updates.
* **Environment Setup:** Create distinct **Test** and **Production** applications in the dashboard with clear naming conventions.
* **Credentials:** Capture and securely store your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Application Management Token`.
* **Secret Management:** Integrate your `Client Secret` into an enterprise secrets management system (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, Vault). **Never commit secrets to version control.**
* **Connect Configuration:** Set each application’s Privacy Policy URL and Logo.
* **Redirect URIs:** Configure the Redirect URI for each application (ensure they are externally accessible).
* **Scope Definition:** [Define your Vehicle Access Configuration](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/configure-permissions#how-to-configure-permissions-for-vehicle-data-collection) (OAuth scopes) based on the specific signals and commands your application requires.
* **Scope Minimization:** Strictly enforce **Scope Minimization** by requesting only the minimum necessary data permissions from the user.
* **Brand Select:** Confirm and specify which OEM Brands will be displayed to the user and if you want to automatically add any new brands as they become available.
* **Compatibility Check:** *(Enterprise Only)* Validate target vehicle compatibility using the [Region and Make Compatibility API](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/compatibility/by-region-and-make).

## Phase 2: Connect Flow & Conversion Optimization

* **User Journey:** Determine how your application will funnel users into the Smartcar Connect flow.
* **Frontend Implementation:** Implement the frontend Connect flow to generate the authorization URL (using `link.getAuthUrl()`).
* **First Connection:** Onboard your first test vehicle and review its data in the Smartcar Dashboard.
* **Brand Select:** Assess and implement [**Brand Select**](https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/flows#bypassing-the-brand-selection-screen) functionality (if applicable) to skip the brand selection screen and accelerate the user flow.
* **Error Simulation:** Validate your application’s error handling by testing with [simulated error VINs ](https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/testing-errors#testing-errors)(e.g., using the `invalid_subscription` trigger).

## Phase 3: Core Implementation & Token Resilience

* **Architecture**: Design the backend architecture.
* **Webhook Endpoint:** Implement a [backend endpoint to receive webhook data](https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/receiving-webhooks) and error payloads.
* **Callback Endpoint:** Implement a backend endpoint to receive the authorization code at your [Redirect URI.](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/backend)
* **Token Exchange:** Implement the logic to [exchange](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/authorization/overview#token-management) the authorization `code` for an `accessToken` (valid for 2 hours) and `refreshToken` (valid for 60 days). **This must be done server-side.**
* **Secure Storage:** [Securely store tokens](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/get-an-access-token) in an **encrypted backend database**. Tokens must never be stored client-side.
* **Proactive Renewal:** Implement a service to exchange the `refreshToken` for a new token pair before the 60-day expiration window closes.
* **Atomic Token Rotation:** Implement **Atomic Token Rotation** logic to ensure new token pairs are persisted reliably, preventing race conditions that could invalidate single-use tokens.
* **Support Protocol:** Establish internal support protocols to handle questions from your vehicle owners (ensure your team acts as Tier 1 support before escalating to Smartcar).

## Phase 4: Operational Scale & Error Handling

* **Webhooks-First:** *(If migrating)* Shift data ingestion models from polling to a **Webhooks-First** architecture for real-time scalability.
* **Webhook Configuration:** Configure Webhook integrations in the Smartcar Dashboard (select triggers, set callback URI).
* **Payload Verification:** Implement the mandatory callback URI verification logic (responding to the `VERIFY` event with the challenge hash).
* **User Error Handling:** Map Connect errors (e.g. `no_vehicles`) to clear, actionable messages for your users.
* **Vehicle Error Handling:** Handle `VEHICLE_ERROR` events and trigger user notifications when specific vehicle owner actions are required to resolve the issue.
* **Re-authentication:** Implement resolution logic for `ACCOUNT_ISSUE` errors by prompting the user to re-authenticate via Smartcar Connect.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement **Exponential Backoff** strategies for retrying API errors (429) and adhere to `Retry-After` headers.

## Phase 5: Production Readiness Review

* **Access Control:** Ensure all service-specific IAM roles adhere to the principle of least privilege.
* **Secret Management:** Verify all secrets are stored and accessed via a dedicated secrets manager.
* **Encryption:** Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Confirm that dependency and vulnerability scans pass with zero critical/high issues.
* **Network Security:** Configure firewalls/security groups to block unauthorized ports and apply WAF rules where appropriate.
* **Logging:** Ensure structured logs are successfully ingested for staging and production environments, with configurable log levels.
* **Observability:** Configure a dashboard to capture essential metrics (Latency, Error Rate, Traffic).
* **Alerting:** Configure critical alerts to route to your on-call channels.
* **CI/CD:** Ensure a fully automated build and deployment pipeline is in place for all environments.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: The service infrastructure is managed using IaC (e.g., Terraform, CDK).
* **Architecture Review Complete:** The service architecture has passed the formal review.
* **Service Runbook:** A complete runbook exists detailing: service owners, quick start, deployment, scaling, and incident response.
* **Tagging:** Tagging policy is applied to infrastructure.
* **Support Review:** Review the vehicle owner support approach again and ensure VO's are not channeled to Smartcar support directly and that Smartcar support is used as Tier 3


# Configure Your Application
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/configure-application

Learn how to configure your Smartcar application, including setting up permissions and redirect URIs.

Once you have registered your application in the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com), you can configure it to suit your business needs.

## Application Configuration Overview

Your application configuration includes several key components:

* **Application Name & Description**: A clear name and description help users understand what your application does.
* **Redirect URI**: The URL to which users will be redirected after they authorize your application. This must match the redirect URI you use in your OAuth flow.
* **Privacy Policy URL**: A link to your application's privacy policy that will be presented to users during the authorization process.
* **Vehicle Data**: Select the specific vehicle data signals your application will request access to. This determines the permissions your application will need from users.

# Connect Vehicles
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/connect-vehicles

Learn how to connect vehicles to your Smartcar application using Smartcar Connect.

Smartcar Connect is the starting point for connecting vehicles to your application. It uses Smartcar's patented and secure [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) flow to let vehicle owners grant your app access to their car data and control features.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [configured](/getting-started/configure-application) your Smartcar application in the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/configuration). You will need:

* Your application's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
* A valid `redirect_uri` for your application
* The vehicle data you want to access (e.g., odometer, location, etc.)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Launch Smartcar Connect">
    Direct your users to the Smartcar Connect URL. This can be done using the Smartcar SDK for your platform (web, iOS, or Android) or copying the URL from the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/configuration). The user will:

    * Select their vehicle brand
    * Log in with their connected services account
    * Review and approve the requested permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Handle the Redirect and Get the Authorization Code">
    After the user authorizes access, Smartcar will redirect them back to your application using the default `redirect_uri` you provided in your app configuration. The redirect will include an authorization `code` as a query parameter.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Exchange the Code for an Access Token">
    Your backend exchanges the authorization code for an access token and refresh token by making a request to [Smartcar’s token endpoint](/api-reference/authorization/auth-code-exchange). You’ll need your app’s `client_id`, `client_secret`, and the same `redirect_uri`.

    ```
    POST https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
    ```

    The response will include an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Store Tokens">
    Store the `access_token` and `refresh_token` securely in your application's database. These tokens are sensitive credentials that allow access to vehicle data and actions, so:

    * Use encrypted storage or a secrets manager whenever possible.
    * Never log tokens or expose them in client-side code.
    * Associate tokens with the correct user and vehicle in your database for easy lookup and management. Here is a [recommended architecture structure](/getting-started/how-to/architecture-design).
    * The `access_token` expires after two hours. You will need to use the `refresh_token` to obtain new access tokens when needed. The `refresh_token` expires after 60 days. If the `refresh_token` expires, the user will need to reauthorize your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Vehicle owners may occasionally need to re-authenticate due to OEM platform migrations, credential changes, or permission updates. Build your integration to handle these scenarios gracefully. See [Handle Re-authentication](/connect/re-auth/oem-migrations) for implementation guidance.

# Vehicle Simulator
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/dashboard/simulator



Before launching your integration, we recommend using Smartcar’s Vehicle Simulator to test your application on a simulated vehicle. With the Simulator, you can choose the vehicle's region, make, model and year as well as the vehicle state to test with. Watch your simulated vehicle travel in real-time from the Smartcar Dashboard as you test API requests from your application with realistic vehicle data responses.

<Frame type="glass">
  <img />
</Frame>

## 1. Create a simulated vehicle

#### Create a simulated vehicle

Begin by logging into the Smartcar Dashboard and navigating to the Simulator tab. Choose your region and select a Smartcar-compatible vehicle using the Make, Model, and Year dropdowns. Or, use the VIN search feature to create a simulated vehicle of the same Make, Model and Year as the VIN entered, as long as the vehicle is compatible with Smartcar. Please note the VIN search is only available for US-based VINs at this time.

#### Review the vehicle capabilities

Confirm the vehicle's supported capabilities includes those you wish to test.

#### Select a vehicle state

Select from one of three available vehicle states for your simulated vehicle. The states vary in duration from 8 to 24 hours and include driving, charging, and parked vehicle states for a wide range of test scenarios.

## 2. Connect your app to the simulated vehicle

Once you've selected a vehicle and state, you are ready to connect the simulated vehicle to your application for testing.

Grab the simulated vehicle credentials
On the simulation screen, you will find a Connect Credentials button that will open a modal containing the simulated vehicle's credentials. You will need these to connect your app and vehicle using Smartcar Connect.

#### Launch Smartcar Connect in simulated mode

When launching Smartcar Connect, pass in the query parameter mode=simulated to enable simulated mode and ensure you can connect to your newly created simulated vehicle. Smartcar's SDKs provide a convenient option to facilitate this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Node theme={null}
  const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
    mode: "simulated",
  });
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  client = smartcar.AuthClient(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,
    mode="simulated"
  )
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  AuthClient authClient = new AuthClient.Builder()
    .clientId(CLIENT_ID)
    .clientSecret(CLIENT_SECRET)
    .redirectUri(REDIRECT_URI)
    .mode("simulated")
    .build();
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby theme={null}
  client = Smartcar::AuthClient.new({
    client_id: CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
    mode: "simulated"
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Log into a connected services account

After launching Smartcar Connect, select the brand that matches your simulated vehicle and enter the credentials pulled from the Smartcar Dashboard simulation screen on the brand login page. You will then be prompted to grant access to your selected permissions.

Upon completing the Smartcar Connect flow, return to the Smartcar Dashboard. It may take up to a minute to reflect that your vehicle is now connected. Once connected, the vehicle ID will appear next to the vehicle's VIN near the top of the simulation screen.

## 3. Start the simulation and begin testing

Once the vehicle is connected to your application, you are ready to start the simulation and begin making API requests to the simulated vehicle.

### Start the simulation

In the Smartcar Dashboard on the simulation screen for your selected simulated vehicle, start the simulation by pressing the Play button. You have the option to pause, resume or restart the simulation at any time. Additional controls you have over the simulation:

#### Control the simulation speed

You can control the simulation's speed in case you would like to test the vehicle at various stages at a faster or slower pace.

#### Change the simulation stage

Once the simulation has started, you can jump to any stage of the simulation in the event you would like to test the vehicle in a particular state.

#### Set the API response latency

Control the response latency of any API requests you make to the simulated vehicle.

`Ideal` - API responses are returned immediately upon request.

`Realistic` - API responses are delayed a certain amount of time based on average API response latency statistics that Smartcar has gathered for each supported brand.

A breakdown of estimated response latencies can be viewed by clicking on the ‘View latencies’ link directly underneath the Request Latency dropdown in the Dashboard. Please note latency estimates may not be available for all brands. In these cases, the Realistic setting will return immediate responses -- same as Ideal.

#### Change the vehicle state

You can select a different vehicle state for your simulated vehicle at any time. Select the Edit icon in the `Trip type` card on the simulation screen.

### Send an API request to the simulated vehicle

The Smartcar API will return realistic data matching the current state of the simulated vehicle as displayed on the simulation screen. Note that if you've selected Realistic API response latency, the data returned to your application may appear somewhat delayed.


# Single Sign-on (SSO)
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/dashboard/single-sign-on

Smartcar offers SSO through your identity provider (IdP) for Enterprise customers.

## About SSO with Smartcar

Our Dashboard supports SSO integrations with popular identity providers
including:

* Okta
* Microsoft Azure AD
* Google Workspace
* OneLogin
* Ping Identity
* ADFS
* Custom SAML 2.0 providers

To set up SSO for your organization's Dashboard accounts, you'll need to:

1. Be an Owner for an existing Team on an Enterprise plan
2. Verify your domain
3. Configure your identity provider

The following section will guide you through each step of this process.

## Setting up SSO

On Dashboard navigate to **Team settings > Security** and select **Enable SSO**

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

You’ll be redirected to start the SSO configuration process.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

Depending on your DNS provider, you'll receive instructions on how to verify your domain.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

Once your domain is verified, you’ll be able to select your Identity Provider
(IdP).

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

You'll be provided a guide on how to get set up based on your IdP.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

Once you’ve got everything configured, you’ll be prompted to test SSO.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

<br />

<Tip>
  If you exit the flow at any time before finalizing your configuration, you
  can jump back in from Dashboard.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

## Disabling SSO

If you have SSO configured, the Team Owner can disable it from **Team
settings > Security**.

<Warning>
  Disabling SSO will require you to go through the whole setup process
  again.
</Warning>

## Inviting team members with SSO enabled

Once enabled, you’ll need to add members to your team through your identity
provider. Invites via the Dashboard will be disabled while SSO is enabled.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

When a newly added member has signed in via SSO, they will have the Viewer role
by default. Other team members with the appropriate role can promote these
members as needed.

<Note>
  If a user creates a Dashboard account with their email prior to being added
  to your IdP, they will be added to their own Team initially. When they are
  added to your IdP they will be able to switch Teams in Dashboard.
</Note>

## A note on aliased emails

If members of your team have Dashboard accounts using email aliases prior to
enabling SSO e.g. [rover+thebest@dog.com](mailto:rover+thebest@dog.com), once SSO is enabled for your Team and
they’re added to your IdP, their login will be tied to their non-aliased email
address e.g. [rover@dog.com](mailto:rover@dog.com).

SSO is only available on the **Enterprise** plan, please reach out to your Account Manager for more details.

Owners have full control and access to the team. They're able to add and remove members, create and modify applications, edit billing information and more.

A team **can** have multiple Owners, but **must** have at least one.

### Admin

Admins have similar access to Owners but can't edit or view billing information.

### Editor

Editors have similar access to Admins but are limited to specific applications. They're unable to manage team members, view the team's billing information, create applications, or delete applications they're allowed to access.

### Viewer

Viewers have similar permissions to Editors but only have read-only access to applications they've been invited to.


# How to Design Your Backend Architecture for Smartcar
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/architecture-design

Learn how to design your backend to integrate your application with Smartcar.

Designing your backend architecture for Smartcar integration ensures secure storage of credentials, reliable webhook handling, and a scalable implementation. This guide walks you through the essential database tables and backend endpoints you’ll need.

## What You'll Achieve

* Set up database tables to store vehicles, users, and tokens
* Create backend endpoints to handle OAuth and webhooks
* Understand the data flow between Smartcar and your backend

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Plan Your Database Tables">
    You’ll need tables to track users, vehicles, and Smartcar tokens. Here’s a recommended schema:

    | Table             | Purpose                                                                   | Key Fields                                                                                                                                   |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `users`           | You probably already have this table to store your app's users            | `id`, `email`, `name`, etc.                                                                                                                  |
    | `smartcar_tokens` | Stores Smartcar access and refresh tokens pairs with user and vehicle IDs | `id`, `your_app_user_id`, `smartcar_vehicle_id`, `smartcar_access_token`, `smartcar_refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
    | `vehicles`        | Stores connected vehicle information                                      | `id`, `smartcar_user_id`, `your_app_user_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`, `created_at`, `updated_at`                                            |
    | `vehicle_data`    | Stores data about your vehicles (i.e. odometer readings, location, etc.)  | `id`, `smartcar_vehicle_id`, `created_at`, `data_type`, `data_value`                                                                         |
    | `webhook_logs`    | Log incoming webhook events (optional)                                    | `id`, `smartcar_vehicle_id`, `event_type`, `payload`, `received_at`                                                                          |

    <Note>
      Always encrypt tokens at rest and never expose them to the client.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Implement OAuth Code Exchange Endpoint">
    Create a backend endpoint to handle the OAuth redirect from Smartcar and exchange the authorization code for tokens.

    **Example: `/api/smartcar/callback`**

    1. Receive the `code` and `state` query parameters from Smartcar.
    2. Exchange the code for tokens using Smartcar’s token endpoint.
    3. Store the tokens in your `tokens` table, linked to the user and vehicle.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    POST https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Create a Webhook Receiver Endpoint">
    Set up an endpoint to receive webhook POST requests from Smartcar.

    **Example: `/api/webhooks/smartcar`**

    * Validate the webhook signature (see [Smartcar webhook docs](/integrations/webhooks)).
    * Parse the event payload and update your database as needed.
    * Log the event in `webhook_logs` for auditing and debugging.

    <Info>
      Want a production-ready AWS implementation? Use the <a href="/getting-started/tutorials/webhook-receiver-recipe">Webhook Receiver Recipe</a>. It includes everything you need to get up and running so you can focus on business logic instead of infrastructure.
    </Info>

    ```javascript theme={null}
    // Example Express.js handler
    app.post('/api/webhooks/smartcar', async (req, res) => {
      try {
        // 1. Validate webhook signature
        const isValid = await validateWebhookSignature(req);
        if (!isValid) {
          return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
        }

        // 2. Parse event and update database
        const event = req.body;
        await processWebhookEvent(event);

        // 3. Respond with 200 OK
        res.status(200).send('Received');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing webhook:', error);
        res.status(500).send('Error processing webhook');
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Secure Your Endpoints">
    * Restrict access to OAuth and webhook endpoints.
    * Use HTTPS for all traffic.
    * Never expose access or refresh tokens to the frontend.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# How to Configure Permissions for Vehicle Data Collection
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/configure-permissions

Step-by-step guide to selecting signals, commands, and attributes in the Smartcar Dashboard and requesting the right permissions from vehicle owners.

To retrieve vehicle data through Smartcar, you must configure your application to request the correct permissions from vehicle owners. This guide walks you through the process using the Smartcar Dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Configuration Page in the Dashboard">
    Go to the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/configuration) and select your application. Navigate to the <b>Configuration</b> section and choose the <b>Vehicle access</b> tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Signals, Commands, and Attributes">
    Under the <b>Signals</b>, <b>Commands</b>, and <b>Attributes</b> tabs, select the specific vehicle data points and actions your application needs. Each selection corresponds to a permission that the vehicle owner must approve.

    <Frame type="simple">
      <img alt="Smartcar Dashboard configuration page showing signal selection and Connect Preview." />
    </Frame>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Signals:</b> Dynamic vehicle data (e.g., battery level, odometer, location).</li>
      <li><b>Commands:</b> Actions your app can perform (e.g., lock/unlock, start charging).</li>
      <li><b>Attributes:</b> Static vehicle info (e.g., make, model, year).</li>
    </ul>

    <Note>
      Only select the permissions your application truly needs. This improves user trust and increases the likelihood of successful connections.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview the Owner Experience">
    As you select signals, commands, and attributes, the <b>Connect Preview</b> on the right updates to show what the vehicle owner will see when connecting their vehicle. This preview lists the permissions your app is requesting and the vehicles that will be connected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Your Configuration">
    Once you are satisfied with your selections, click <b>Publish</b> to save your configuration. Your application will now request these permissions from vehicle owners during the Smartcar Connect flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dynamic Permissions

If your application needs to access different permissions based on user actions or vehicle types, you can leverage the `scope` parameter in the Smartcar Connect URL to dynamically request permissions at runtime. This allows you to tailor the permissions based on the specific vehicle or user context.
Keep in mind that any permissions you pass via the `scope` parameter will override the permissions configured in the Smartcar Dashboard for that specific connection.

### Notes

* If you need to change permissions later, you can return to this configuration page and update your selections. Vehicle owners will need to reauthorize your application to grant any new permissions.
* The permissions you select here will determine the data and actions available to your application. Make sure to choose only what is necessary for your use case.

# How to Detect and Process Charging Sessions with Webhooks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/detect-charging-session

Learn how to use Smartcar webhooks to detect when a vehicle starts and ends charging, and how to process charging session data.

Smartcar webhooks make it easy to detect and process vehicle charging sessions in real time. This guide explains how to configure your webhook, handle charging events, and process charging session data in your backend.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your Webhook for Charging Events">
    In the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/integrations), create or edit a webhook integration. Under <b>Triggers</b>, select the following events:

    <ul>
      <li>Charge.IsCharging</li>
      <li>Charge.IsChargingCableConnected</li>
    </ul>

    These signals will act as triggers for detecting when a vehicle starts and stops charging and when it is plugged in or unplugged. Whenever these signals change, Smartcar will send a webhook event to your configured endpoint.
    Next, you'll configure your **data**. This is the information you want to receive in your webhook payload every time you receive a webhook event. Triggers are included by default, but you can also add additional signals to the data payload, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>Charge.StateOfCharge (included as a trigger)</li>
      <li>Charge.ChargingCurrent (included as a trigger)</li>
      <li>Charge.ActiveLimit</li>
      <li>Charge.Amperage</li>
      <li>Charge.Voltage</li>
      <li>Charge.Wattage</li>
      <li>Charge.EnergyAdded</li>
      <li>Charge.TimeToComplete</li>
      <li>TractionBattery.Range</li>
      <li>TractionBattery.NominalCapacity</li>
      <li>Location.PreciseLocation</li>
    </ul>

    These data signals will be delivered for every webhook event, allowing you to track the state of charge and other relevant metrics while the vehicle is charging.
    Next, provide your webhook URL where Smartcar will send the events. Make sure your endpoint is publicly accessible and can handle POST requests. You can choose to auto enroll all your vehicles to this webhook or manually subscribe vehicles later (you can do this from the Dashboard). For this guide, select "don't subscribe any vehicles".
    Now it is time to save and verify your webhook.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Webhook Events">
    Smartcar will send a verification request to your endpoint, which you must respond to with a 200 OK status code to complete the setup (see [Webhook Verification guide](/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification)).
    Once verified, you will start to receive vehicle data for the vehicles you have subscribed to this webhook. For this guide, we chose not to auto subscribe vehicles, so let's head over to the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/vehicles) to manually subscribe a vehicle to your webhook.
    Select a vehicle from your list of connected vehicles and click on the three dots action menu to the right of the row and click subscribe. Select your newly created webhook from the options and click subscribe.

    <Frame type="simple">
      <img alt="Smartcar Dashboard showing how to subscribe a vehicle to a webhook." />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

At this point, your webhook is fully configured to receive charging events from the subscribed vehicle. Now let's handle the incoming webhook events in your backend.

Every webhook will include an `eventId` and an `eventType` field. The `eventType` will indicate the type of event that occurred, such as `VEHICLE_STATE` or `VEHICLE_ERROR`.
Your handler should gracefully handle both event types. For `VEHICLE_STATE` events, you will receive the updated vehicle data. For `VEHICLE_ERROR` events, you may want to log the error.
For `VEHICLE_STATE` events, you will receive the data in a `data` property of the payload. There will also be an array of signals under a `triggers` property that caused the event to be sent. Lastly, you will also receive a `meta` property with additional context about the event, such as the webhook ID, name, delivery ID, delivery timestamp, etc.

### How to track charging sessions

When a vehicle starts charging, you will receive a webhook event with the `eventType` of `VEHICLE_STATE` and the `Charge.IsCharging` signal set to `true`. When the vehicle stops charging, you will receive another event with `Charge.IsCharging` set to `false`. You can use these events to track the start and end of each charging session.

Example event payload:

```json theme={null}
{
  "eventId": "a7738a15-7ee2-40b3-9815-823d146230cd",
  "eventType": "VEHICLE_STATE",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "deee49b6-d638-4be4-82dc-121ea613eed9"
    },
    "vehicle": {
      "id": "829e30ab-5a13-40b5-9f8a-8538af86ed95",
      "make": "Tesla",
      "model": "Model 3",
      "year": 2020
    },
    "signals": [
      {
        "code": "charge-ischarging",
        "name": "IsCharging",
        "group": "Charge",
        "body": {
          "value": true
        },
        "status": {
          "value": "SUCCESS"
        },
        "meta": {
          "oemUpdatedAt": 1754365413366,
          "retrievedAt": 1754365413366
        }
      }
    ],
    "triggers": [
      {
        "type": "SIGNAL_UPDATED",
        "signal": {
          "code": "charge-ischarging",
          "name": "IsCharging",
          "group": "Charge"
        }
      }
    ],
    "meta": {
      "webhookId": "f1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
      "webhookName": "My Charging Webhook",
      "deliveryId": "b1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
      "deliveryTimestamp": "2024-08-04T17:00:00Z",
      "mode": "LIVE",
      "signalCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Tip: Always validate the webhook signature to ensure the request is from Smartcar.

# How to Get an API Access Token
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/get-an-access-token

Learn how to obtain your first Smartcar API access token by exchanging an authorization code.

To make requests to the Smartcar API, you first need to obtain an access token. This guide walks you through the process of getting the authorization code and exchanging it for an access token for the first time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Launch Smartcar Connect">
    Direct your user to the Smartcar Connect URL. The user will:

    * Select their vehicle brand
    * Log in with their connected services account
    * Approve the requested permissions

    After successful authorization, Smartcar will redirect the user to your application's `redirect_uri` with an authorization `code` as a query parameter.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Handle the Redirect and Extract the Code">
    Your application should listen for requests to the `redirect_uri`. When Smartcar redirects the user, extract the `code` parameter from the query string.
    <b>Example redirect:</b>

    ```
    https://your-app.com/callback?code=AUTH_CODE&state=STATE
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Exchange the Code for an Access Token">
    Use the authorization code to request an access token and refresh token from [Smartcar’s OAuth token endpoint](/api-reference/authorization/auth-code-exchange).

    Here is an example using the Smartcar Node.js SDK:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    const smartcar = require('smartcar'); //Smartcar backend Node SDK

    smartcar.OAuth.getToken({
      client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      code: 'AUTH_CODE', //extracted from the URL query parameter
      redirect_uri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI'
    });
    ```

    The response will include an `access_token`, an `expires_in` field, and a `refresh_token`. Store these securely in your backend database.
    The `access_token` expires after two hours, and the `refresh_token` expires after 60 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# How to Manage API Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/how-to/manage-api-tokens

Best practices for securely storing, refreshing, and rotating Smartcar API tokens.

This guide explains how to store, refresh, and rotate tokens using the Smartcar API.

<Info>
  <b>API Access Token vs. Application Management Token</b><br />

  <ul>
    <li><b>API Access Token:</b> Used to access vehicle data and issue commands on behalf of a vehicle owner. These tokens are obtained through the OAuth flow after a user connects their vehicle and are required for all Smartcar API requests involving vehicle data.</li>
    <li><b>Application Management Token:</b> Used to manage your Smartcar application itself (e.g., configuring webhooks or managing your vehicles). This token is found in the Smartcar Dashboard and is <b>not</b> used for accessing vehicle data or making API requests on behalf of users.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Always use the correct token type for your use case:</b> API access tokens for vehicle data, and management tokens for application configuration.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Store Tokens Securely">
    * Store both the `access_token` and `refresh_token` in your backend database, never in client-side code.
    * Encrypt tokens at rest and restrict access to only necessary backend services.
    * Associate tokens with the correct user and vehicle for easy lookup and management.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Access Token for API Requests">
    * Use the `access_token` as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all API requests.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    GET https://vehicle.api.smartcar.com/v3/vehicles/{vehicleId}
    Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

    * If the access token is valid, the API will return the requested data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect Expired Access Tokens">
    * If an API request returns a 401 Unauthorized error, the access token may have expired.
    * In this case, use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refresh the Access Token">
    * Make a POST request to the Smartcar OAuth token endpoint with `grant_type=refresh_token`.

    ```javascript theme={null}
    POST https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    ```

    * Store the new `access_token` and `refresh_token` in your database, replacing the old values.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rotate and Revoke Tokens">
    * Always update both tokens after a refresh to maintain security.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Integrate with Smartcar To Receive Vehicle Data
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/integration-overview

Welcome to the integration phase of your Smartcar journey! After configuring your application and connecting vehicles, the next crucial step is to integrate your systems with Smartcar to receive vehicle data.

## Choosing Webhooks or the REST API

Understanding the differences between webhooks and the REST API will help you choose the right integration method for your use case.

### When to Use Webhooks

**[Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview) are the recommended approach** for applications that need real-time or frequently updated vehicle data. Use webhooks when:

* You need real-time notifications when vehicle data changes
* You're monitoring vehicle data continuously (e.g., fleet tracking, charging monitoring)
* You're building applications that react to vehicle events (e.g., alerts, automation)
* You need to scale to monitor many vehicles efficiently
* You want to avoid rate limits and reduce server load

**Advantages of webhooks:**

* **Require less effort and resources** - no polling the API repeatedly
* **Scale better** - Scale effortlessly to monitor thousands of vehicles, with no complex polling logic to maintain
* **Near real-time updates** - receive data within seconds of changes being detected
* **Avoid rate limits** - Smartcar pushes data to you instead of you calling the API
* **More reliable** - no missed updates due to polling intervals
* **Automatic optimizations** - Smartcar continuously optimizes data retrieval, and your application benefits immediately without code changes

**Quick Start**: Deploy a production-ready webhook receiver in minutes with our [Webhook Receiver Recipe](/getting-started/tutorials/webhook-receiver-recipe) - a complete AWS serverless solution that implements best practices for you.

Learn more about [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview).

### When to Use the REST API

The Vehicles API is designed for **infrequent data retrieval and command execution**. Use the API when:

* You need vehicle data only once or occasionally (e.g., user profile display)
* You're issuing commands to vehicles (lock/unlock, start/stop charging)
* You're exploring available signals or testing your integration
* You have a small number of vehicles and don't need continuous monitoring

The Vehicles API is designed primarily for exploration and non-frequent data retrieval. This API is not designed for continuous polling or real-time monitoring. Data is typically updated once every 24 hours unless the vehicle is actively subscribed to a webhook, which enables more frequent updates. For most use cases, you should avoid polling the Vehicles API at high frequency leverage [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview) instead.

Learn more about the [Vehicles API](/api-reference/vehicles-api-intro).

<Warning>
  **Do not poll the Vehicles API for real-time monitoring.** The API is not designed for continuous polling. Frequent polling will:

  * Consume your API rate limit quota quickly
  * Put unnecessary load on your servers and Smartcar's infrastructure
  * Provide stale data (updated only every 24 hours without webhook subscriptions)
  * Not scale as your fleet grows

  Use webhooks instead for any use case requiring frequent or real-time data.
</Warning>

***

## CSVs (coming soon)

This integration will help you receive vehicle data in a CSV file where you can integrate analyze using your existing tools and workflows.

With CSV integrations, you will be able to:

* Receive vehicle data from Smartcar at a specified cadence (e.g., weekly, monthly)
* Choose the data fields you want to include in the CSV export (e.g., vehicle info, location, odometer, battery level)
* Have CSV files automatically delivered to your preferred destination, such as an SFTP server, cloud storage bucket, etc.
* Easily import Smartcar data into your analytics, reporting, or business intelligence tools

This solution is ideal for customers who need scheduled, automated data exports for compliance, reporting, or integration with legacy systems.

<Note>
  CSV integration is coming soon! If you are interested in early access or have specific requirements, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@smartcar.com">[support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com)</a>.

    1. Log in or sign up via the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com)
    2. Fill in your app name, description, and redirect URI in the configuration page of the dashboard.
    3. Copy your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in a safe location. These credentials identify your app during the authorization process. **Do not commit your client secret to version control**.
    4. Select the data you want to access from vehicles by choosing the data signals (e.g. `odometer`, `location`, etc.).

    The necessary permissions will be derived from these signals and presented to your users.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Start Connecting Vehicles via Smartcar Connect">
    [Smartcar Connect](/connect) is an OAuth 2.0 consent flow that lets your users link their vehicles securely.

    The vehicle access tab in the Smartcar Dashboard will generate a Connect URL for you. You can also generate the URL programmatically using one of our SDKs.

    ```javascript theme={null}

    const link = new Smartcar.AuthClient({ //Smartcar frontend SDK
      clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
      redirectUri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
      scope: ['read_vehicle_info', 'read_odometer'], // add other scopes as needed
      mode: 'live', // use 'simulated' for testing with simulated vehicles
    });

    window.location.href = link.getAuthUrl();
    ```

    This will take your user to the Smartcar Connect screen to authorize access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Exchange Authorization Code for Access Tokens">
    After the user grants access, Smartcar redirects back to your app with an authorization code. This is where the redirect URI you configured earlier comes into play.

    Use this code in your backend to exchange for access and refresh tokens:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    const smartcar = require('smartcar'); //Smartcar backend SDK

    const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
      clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
      clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
      redirectUri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
      mode: 'live', //use 'simulated' for testing with simulated vehicles
    });

    const access = await client.exchangeCode('AUTHORIZATION_CODE_FROM_QUERY');

    ```

    You’ll receive:

    * `accessToken`: used to make API calls
    * `refreshToken`: used to obtain new access tokens
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Configure an Integration To Receive Vehicle Data">
    Our recommended method is to use webhooks, allowing you to choose triggers (e.g. location changes, battery state of charge changes) and the data to be sent upon those triggers.

    **Quick Start**: Deploy a production-ready webhook receiver in minutes with our [Webhook Receiver Recipe](/getting-started/tutorials/webhook-receiver-recipe) - a complete AWS serverless solution.

# Android Tutorial
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/android

In this tutorial, we will use the Android SDK to integrate Connect into your application.

<Warning>
  Our frontend SDKs handle getting an authorization code representing a vehicle owner's consent for your application to interact with their vehicle
  for the requested permissions. In order to make requests to a vehicle, please use one of our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks).

  For security, token exchanges and requests to vehicles **should not** be made client side.
</Warning>

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Mobile Application launches a `Chrome Custom Tab` with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with their vehicle credentials and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The `Chrome Tab` is redirected to a specified `REDIRECT_URI` along with an authorization `code`.
   This will be the custom scheme set on the application. The Smartcar Android receives the authorization `code` in a view listening
   for the specified custom scheme URI, and passes it to the Mobile Application.
3. The Mobile Application sends the received authorization `code` to the Application’s backend service.
4. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization code along with the Application’s
   `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
6. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add a custom scheme redirect URI to your application configuration.
* Add the `app_server` redirect URI from [Setup step 2.](/getting-started/tutorials/android#setup) to your application configuration.

<Note>
  For Android, we require the custom URI scheme to be in the format of `sc` + `clientId` + `://` + `hostname`.
  For now, you can just set it to `sc` + `clientId` + `://exchange`.

  Please see our [Connect Docs](/connect/dashboard-config#redirect-uris) for more information.
</Note>

# Setup

1. Clone our repo and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash theme={null}
   $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-android-sdk.git
   ```
   <Note>
     Do not “checkout from version control” with the Getting Started repo in Android Studio, as it will not open the proper module.
   </Note>

2. Open `getting-started-android-sdk/tutorial` in Android Studio as an existing project and build from existing sources.
   Android Studio should automatically import the required dependencies and build gradle. We're setting `app_server` to `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
   to pass the authorization `code` from the [Handle the Response](/getting-started/tutorials/android#handle-the-response) step later on in the tutorial to our backend.
   ```xml strings.xml theme={null}
   <string name="smartcar_auth_scheme">sc[yourClientId]</string>
   <string name="client_id">[yourClientId]</string>
   <string name="app_server">http://10.0.2.2:8000</string>
   ```

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `smartcarAuth` object in the `onCreate` function of the `MainActivity`.
   ```java MainActivity.java theme={null}
   // TODO: Authorization Step 1a: Initialize the Smartcar object
   private static String CLIENT_ID;
   private static String REDIRECT_URI;
   private static String[] SCOPE;
   private SmartcarAuth smartcarAuth;

   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       ...
       
       // TODO: Authorization Step 1b: Initialize the Smartcar object
       CLIENT_ID = getString(R.string.client_id);
       REDIRECT_URI = getString(R.string.smartcar_auth_scheme) + "://" + getString(R.string.smartcar_auth_host);
       SCOPE = new String[]{"required:read_vehicle_info"};
       
       smartcarAuth = new SmartcarAuth(
           CLIENT_ID,
           REDIRECT_URI,
           SCOPE,
           true,
           new SmartcarCallback() {
               // TODO: Authorization Step 3b: Receive an authorization code
           }
       );
   }
   ```

<Info>
  The Android SDK does not support `simulated` mode at this time - only `test` and `live`.
  Feel free to set `testMode` to `false` where you instantiate your `SmartcarAuth` object to
  connect to a real vehicle.
</Info>

2. The Android application will launch a Chrome Tab with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account and grants the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we can use the `addClickHandler` function that our `smartcarAuth` object has access to.

   ```java MainActivity.java theme={null}
   // TODO: Authorization Step 2: Launch Connect
   smartcarAuth.addClickHandler(appContext, connectButton);
   ```

# Registering your Custom Scheme

Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `REDIRECT_URI` with an authorization `code` as a query parameter.

Android applications use custom URI schemes to intercept calls and launch the relevant application. This is defined within the `AndroidManifest`.

```xml AndroidManifest.xml theme={null}
<!-- TODO: Authorization Step 3a: Receive an authorization code -->
<activity android:name="com.smartcar.sdk.SmartcarCodeReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data
            android:host="@string/smartcar_auth_host"
            android:scheme="@string/smartcar_auth_scheme" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

# Handle the response

Using the Android SDK, the application can receive the code in the `SmartcarCallback` object passed into the `SmartcarAuth` object.

```java MainActivity.java theme={null}
smartcarAuth = new SmartcarAuth(
    CLIENT_ID,
    REDIRECT_URI,
    SCOPE,
    true,
    new SmartcarCallback() {
        // TODO: Authorization Step 3b: Receive an authorization code
        @Override
        public void handleResponse(final SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
            Log.i("MainActivity", smartcarResponse.getCode());

            // TODO: Request Step 1: Obtain an access token

            //TODO: Request Step 2: Get vehicle information
        }
    }
);
```

# Launching Connect

Build your application in Android Studio and click on the **Connect your vehicle** button.

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

# Getting your first access token

After receiving the authorization `code`, your iOS application must exchange it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. To do so, we can send
the code to a backend service. Let’s assume our backend service contains an endpoint `/exchange` that receives an authorization `code` as a query parameter and exchanges it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

```swift ViewController.swift theme={null}
// TODO: Obtain an access token
public void handleResponse(final SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
    Log.i("MainActivity", smartcarResponse.getCode());

    final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

    // TODO: Request Step 1: Obtain and access token

    // Request can not run on the Main Thread
    // Main Thread is used for UI and therefore can not be blocked
    new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
    
            // send request to exchange the auth code for the access token
            Request exchangeRequest = new Request.Builder()
                .url(getString(R.string.app_server) + "/exchange?code=" + smartcarResponse.getCode())
                .build();
        
            try {
                client.newCall(exchangeRequest).execute();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }).start();
}
```

<Warning>
  Notice that our backend service **does not** return the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.
  This is by design. For security, our frontend should never have access
  to the `ACCESS_TOKEN` and should always be stored in the backend.
</Warning>

# Getting data from a vehicle

Once the backend has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API. The Android app will
have to send a request to the backend service which in turn sends a request to Smartcar. We have to do this because
our frontend **does not** have the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Assuming our backend has a `/vehicle` endpoint that returns the information of a user’s vehicle, we can make this query in
our `completion callback` and start another `activity` to show the returned vehicle attributes.

```java MainActivity.java theme={null}
public void handleResponse(final SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
    ...
    
    // TODO: Request Step 2: Get vehicle information

    // send request to retrieve the vehicle info
    Request infoRequest = new Request.Builder()
        .url(getString(R.string.app_server) + "/vehicle")
        .build();
    
    try {
        Response response = client.newCall(infoRequest).execute();
    
        String jsonBody = response.body().string();
        JSONObject JObject = new JSONObject(jsonBody);
    
        String make = JObject.getString("make");
        String model = JObject.getString("model");
        String year = JObject.getString("year");
    
        Intent intent = new Intent(appContext, DisplayInfoActivity.class);
        intent.putExtra("INFO", make + " " + model + " " + year);
        startActivity(intent);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (JSONException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

# Setting up your backend

Now that our frontend is complete, we will need to create a backend service that contains the logic for the `/exchange` and `/vehicle` endpoints.
You can use any of our backend SDKs below to set up the service starting from the **Obtaining an Access Token** step.

<Note>
  When setting up the environment variables for your  backend SDK, make sure to set `REDIRECT_URI` to the custom scheme
  used for this tutorial i.e. `sc + "clientId" + ://exchange`.

# Backend SDK Tutorials
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/backend

In this tutorial, we will go over how to integrate Connect into your application and make requests to a vehicle using our backend SDKs.

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Application redirects the user to Smartcar Connect to request access to the user’s vehicle. In Connect,
   the user logs in with their vehicle credentials and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The user’s browser is redirected to a specified `REDIRECT_URI`. The Application Server, which is listening
   at the `REDIRECT_URI`, will retrieve the authorization code from query parameters sent to the `REDIRECT_URI`.
3. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization `code` along with
   the Application’s `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
5. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add the following `REDIRECT_URI` to your application configuration: `http://localhost:8000/exchange`

# Setup

1. Clone the repo for the SDK you want to use and install the required dependencies:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Node theme={null}
     $ git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-express.git
     $ cd getting-started-express/tutorial
     $ npm install
     ```

     ```bash Python theme={null}
     $ git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-python-sdk.git
     $ cd getting-started-python-sdk/tutorial
     $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

     ```bash Java theme={null}
     $ git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-java-sdk.git
     $ cd getting-started-java-sdk/tutorial
     $ gradlew build
     ```

     ```bash Ruby theme={null}
     $ git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-ruby-sdk.git
     $ cd getting-started-ruby-sdk/tutorial
     $ bundle install
     $ ruby app.rb
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
2. You will also have to set the following environment variables

<Warning>
  If you've used one of our frontend SDKs to integrate connect, you'll want to set the
  `SMARTCAR_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable to the URI you used for that application.
</Warning>

```bash theme={null}
$export SMARTCAR_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
$export SMARTCAR_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
$export SMARTCAR_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/exchange
```

<Note>
  If you are using Windows, ensure you are appropriately setting environment variables for your shell.
  Please refer to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9249830/how-can-i-set-node-env-production-on-windows/9250168#9250168) which details how to set environment variables on Windows.
</Note>

<br />

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `Smartcar` object in the constructor of the App component.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js index.js theme={null}
     const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
         mode: 'simulated',
     });
     ```

     ```python main.py theme={null}
     client = smartcar.AuthClient(mode='simulated')
     ```

     ```java Main.java theme={null}
     String mode = "simulated";

     AuthClient client = new AuthClient.Builder()
     .mode(mode)
     .build();
     ```

     ```ruby index.rb theme={null}
     @@client = Smartcar::AuthClient.new({
         mode: 'simulated',
     })
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Feel free to set `mode` to `simulated` or `live` where you instantiate your `Smartcar` object to
  connect to a simulated or real vehicle.
</Info>

2. A Server-side rendered application will redirect to Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account
   and grants the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we need to redirect the user to the appropriate URL. We can make use of the `AUTHORIZATION_URL`
   function in our Smartcar object and redirect the user to the URL to launch the Connect flow.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js index.js theme={null}
     app.get('/login', function(req, res) {
         const scope = ['read_vehicle_info'];
         const authUrl = client.getAuthUrl(scope);

         res.render('home', {
             url: authUrl,
         });
     });
     ```

     ```python main.py theme={null}
     @app.route('/login', methods=['GET'])
     def login():
         scope = ['read_vehicle_info']
         auth_url = client.get_auth_url(scope)
         return redirect(auth_url)        
     ```

     ```java Main.java theme={null}
     get("/login", (req, res) -> {
         // TODO: Authorization Step 2: Launch Smartcar authentication dialog
         String[] scope = {"read_odometer"};
         String link = client.authUrlBuilder(scope).build();
         res.redirect(link);
         return null;
     });
     ```

     ```ruby index.rb theme={null}
     get "/login" do
         redirect @@client.get_auth_url(['required:read_vehicle_info'])
     end
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<br />

# Handle the response

Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `REDIRECT_URI`
with an authorization `code` as a query parameter. In the previous section, we had set our `REDIRECT_URI` as `localhost:8000/exchange`.
Now, our server can be set up as follows to receive the authorization `code`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.js theme={null}
  app.get('/exchange', function(req, res) {
  const code = req.query.code;

  console.log(code);

  res.sendStatus(200);
  });
  ```

  ```python main.py theme={null}
  @app.route('/exchange', methods=['GET'])
  def exchange():
      code = request.args.get('code')
      
      print(code)
      
      return '', 200      
  ```

  ```java Main.java theme={null}
  get("/exchange", (req, res) -> {
      String code = req.queryMap("code").value();

      System.out.println(code);

      return "";
  });
  ```

  ```ruby index.rb theme={null}
  get "/exchange" do
      code = params[:code]

      puts code

      "OK"
  end
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

# Launching Connect

Let’s try authenticating a vehicle! Restart your server, open up your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/login`

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Node theme={null}
  $node index.js
  ```

  ```bash Python theme={null}
  $python main.py
  ```

  ```bash Java theme={null}
  $./gradlew run
  ```

  ```bash Ruby theme={null}
  $bundle exec ruby app.rb
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

<br />

# Getting your first access token

<Note>
  If you've used one of our frontend SDKs to integrate Connect, this is where you'll need to fetch your access token.
</Note>

In the previous section, we retrieved an authorization `code`. The application must exchange the code for an `ACCESS_TOKEN` to make a request.
After receiving the ACCESS\_TOKEN, the user can be redirected to the `/vehicle` route.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.js theme={null}
  // Global variable to save our access_token
  let access;

  app.get('/exchange', async function(req, res) {
      const code = req.query.code;
      
      // Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
      // In a production app you'll want to store this in some 
      // kind of persistent storage
      access = await client.exchangeCode(code);
      res.redirect('/vehicle');
  });
  ```

  ```python main.py theme={null}
  # Global variable to save our access_token
  access = None

  @app.route('/exchange', methods=['GET'])
  def exchange():
      code = request.args.get('code')

      # Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
      # In a production app you'll want to store this in some
      # kind of persistent storage
      global access

      access = client.exchange_code(code)
      return redirect('/vehicle')      
  ```

  ```java Main.java theme={null}
  // Global variable to save our access_token
  private static String access;

  public static void main(String[] args) {

      get("/exchange", (req, res) -> {
          String code = req.queryMap("code").value();

          Auth auth = client.exchangeCode(code);
          
          // Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
          // In a production app you'll want to store this in some kind of persistent storage
          access = auth.getAccessToken();
          
          res.redirect("/vehicle");
          return null;
      })
  }
  ```

  ```ruby index.rb theme={null}
  # Global variable to store the token
  @@token = ''

  get "/exchange" do
      code = params[:code]
      # Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
      # In a production app you'll want to store this in 
      # some kind of persistent storage
      @@token = @@client.exchange_code(code)[:access_token]
      redirect '/vehicle'
  end
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

# Getting data from a vehicle

1. Once the backend service or server-side application has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API.
   First we'll need to fetch the `vehicle_id`s associated with the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, then fetch vehicle attributes for one of them. After
   receiving the `vehicle_attributes` object, we can render it in a simple table on the page.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js index.js theme={null}
     app.get('/vehicle', async function(req, res) {
         // Get the smartcar vehicleIds associated with the access_token
         const { vehicles } = await smartcar.getVehicles(access.accessToken);
         
         // Instantiate the first vehicle in the vehicle id list
         const vehicle = new smartcar.Vehicle(vehicles[0], access.accessToken);

         // Make a request to Smartcar API

# iOS Tutorial
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/ios

In this tutorial, we will use the iOS SDK to integrate Connect into your application.

<Warning>
  Our frontend SDKs handle getting an authorization code representing a vehicle owner's consent for your application to interact with their vehicle
  for the requested permissions. In order to make requests to a vehicle, please use one of our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks).

  For security, token exchanges and requests to vehicles **should not** be made client side.
</Warning>

<br />

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Mobile Application launches a `SafariView` with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with their vehicle credentials and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The `SafariView` is redirected to a specified `REDIRECT_URI` along with an authorization `code`.
   This will be the custom scheme set on the application. The Smartcar iOS SDK receives the authorization `code` in a view listening
   for the specified custom scheme URI, and passes it to the Mobile Application.
3. The Mobile Application sends the received authorization `code` to the Application’s back-end service.
4. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization code along with the Application’s
   `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
6. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add a custom scheme redirect URI to your application configuration.
* Add the `appServer` redirect URI from [step 2](/getting-started/tutorials/ios/#setup) below to your application configuration.

<Note>
  For iOS, we require the custom URI scheme to be in the format of `sc` + `clientId` + `://` + `hostname`.
  For now, you can just set it to `sc` + `clientId` + `://exchange`.

  Please see our [Connect Docs](/connect/dashboard-config#redirect-uris) for more information.
</Note>

# Setup

1. Clone our repo and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash theme={null}
   $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-ios-sdk.git
   $cd getting-started-ios-sdk/tutorial
   $pod install
   $open getting-started-ios-sdk.xcworkspace
   ```
2. Set the following constants in `Constants.swift`. We're setting `appServer` to `http://localhost:8000` to pass the authorization `code` from
   the [Handle the Response](/getting-started/tutorials/ios#handle-the-response) step later on in the tutorial to our backend.
   ```swift Constants.swift theme={null}
   struct Constants {
       static let clientId = "<your-client-id>";
       static let appServer = "http://localhost:8000";
   }
   ```

# Build your Connect URL

Instantiate a `SmartcarAuth` object in the `viewdidLoad` function of the `ViewController`.
The iOS application will launch a `WebView` with Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account
and grants the application access to their vehicle.

To launch Connect, we can use the `launchAuthFlow` function that our `SmartcarAuth` object has access to. We can place
this within the `connectPressed` action function.

```swift ViewController.swift theme={null}
let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate

func completionHandler(code: String?, state: String?, virtualKeyUrl: String?, err: AuthorizationError?,) -> Void {
// Receive authorization code
}

appDelegate.smartcar = SmartcarAuth(
  clientId: "afb0b7d3-807f-4c61-9b04-352e91fe3134",
  redirectUri: "scafb0b7d3-807f-4c61-9b04-352e91fe3134://exchange",
  scope: ["read_vin", "read_vehicle_info", "read_odometer"],
  mode: SCMode.simulated, //use SCMode.live to connect to a real vehicles
  completionHandler: completionHandler
)
let smartcar = appDelegate.smartcar

// Generate a Connect URL
let authUrl = smartcar.authUrlBuilder().build()

// Pass in the generated Connect URL and a UIViewController
smartcar.launchAuthFlow(url: authUrl, viewController: viewController)
```

<br />

# Registering your Custom Scheme

Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `REDIRECT_URI` with an authorization code as a query parameter.

iOS applications use custom URI schemes to intercept calls and launch the relevant application. This is defined within the `Info.plist`.

1. Open up `Info.plist` and click on the grey arrow next to **URL types**.
2. Next, click on the grey arrow next to the `Item 0` dictionary and `URL Schemes` array.
3. Finally, set your `Item 0` string to the redirect URI you set up in the [Prerequisites](/getting-started/tutorials/ios#prerequisites) section (i.e. 'sc' + clientId).

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

# Handle the response

1. The iOS application will now receive the request in the `application:(_:open:options:)` function within the AppDelegate.
   ```swift AppDelegate.swift theme={null}
   func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
       {/* TODO: Authorization Step 3a: Receive the authorization code */}
       window!.rootViewController?.presentedViewController?.dismiss(animated: true , completion: nil)
       smartcar!.handleCallback(with: url)
       
       return true
   }
   ```
2. Using the iOS SDK, the application can receive the code in the `completion callback` passed into the `SmartcarAuth` object.
   ```swift AppDelegate.swift theme={null}
   func completion(err: Error?, code: String?, state: String?) -> Any {
       {/* TODO: Authorization Step 3b: Receive the authorization code */}
       print(code!);
       {/* prints out the authorization code */}
   }
   ```

# Launching Connect

Build your application in XCode and click on the **Connect your vehicle** button.

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

# Getting your first Access Token

After receiving the authorization `code`, your iOS application must exchange it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. To do so, we can send
the code to a backend service. Let’s assume our backend service contains an endpoint `/exchange` that receives an authorization `code` as a query parameter and exchanges it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

```swift ViewController.swift theme={null}
// TODO: Obtain an access token
Alamofire.request("\(Constants.appServer)/exchange?code=\(code!)", method: .get)
    .responseJSON {_ in}
```

<Warning>
  Notice that our backend service **does not** return the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.
  This is by design. For security, our frontend should never have access
  to the `ACCESS_TOKEN` and should always be stored in the backend.
</Warning>

# Getting data from a vehicle

Once the backend has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API. The iOS app will
have to send a request to the backend service which in turn sends a request to Smartcar. We have to do this because
our frontend **does not** have the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Assuming our backend has a `/vehicle` endpoint that returns the information of a user’s vehicle, we can make this query in
our `completion callback` and segue into another `view` to show the returned  vehicle attributes

```swift ViewController.swift theme={null}
func completion(err: Error?, code: String?, state: String?) -> Any {

    // send request to exchange auth code for access token
    Alamofire.request("\(Constants.appServer)/exchange?code=\(code!)", method: .get).responseJSON {_ in

        // TODO: Request Step 2: Get vehicle information
        // send request to retrieve the vehicle info
        Alamofire.request("\(Constants.appServer)/vehicle", method: .get).responseJSON { response in
            print(response.result.value!)
            
            if let result = response.result.value {
                let JSON = result as! NSDictionary
                
                let make = JSON.object(forKey: "make")!  as! String
                let model = JSON.object(forKey: "model")!  as! String
                let year = String(JSON.object(forKey: "year")!  as! Int)
                
                let vehicle = "\(year) \(make) \(model)"
                self.vehicleText = vehicle
                
                self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "displayVehicleInfo", sender: self)
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ""
}
```

# Setting up your backend

Now that our frontend is complete, we will need to create a backend service that contains the logic for the `/exchange` and `/vehicle` endpoints.
You can use any of our backend SDKs below to set up the service starting from the **Obtaining an Access Token** step.

<Note>
  When setting up the environment variables for your  backend SDK, make sure to set `REDIRECT_URI` to the custom scheme
  used for this tutorial i.e. `sc + "clientId" + ://exchange`.

# React Tutorial
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/react

In this tutorial, we will use the JavaScript SDK to integrate Connect into your application.

<Warning>
  Our frontend SDKs handle getting an authorization code representing a vehicle owner's consent for your application to interact with their vehicle
  for the requested permissions. In order to make requests to a vehicle, please use one of our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks).

  For security, token exchanges and requests to vehicles **should not** be made client side.
</Warning>

<br />

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Single-Page Application launches a pop-up window with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   It does so by using the Smartcar JavaScript SDK. On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for
   their vehicle’s connected services account and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The user’s browser is redirected to a specified Smartcar-hosted `REDIRECT_URI` - the Smartcar JavaScript SDK redirect page.
3. The Smartcar JavaScript SDK redirect page will receive an authorization `code` as a query parameter. The redirect page will then
   send the code to the Single-Page Application’s `onComplete` callback using the `postMessage` web API. **This step is handled entirely
   by the JavaScript SDK.**
4. The Single-Page Application sends the received authorization `code` to the Application’s backend service.
5. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization code along with the Application’s
   `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
6. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
7. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add the special JavaScript SDK redirect URI to your application configuration.
* Add the `REACT_APP_SERVER` redirect URI from [Setup step 2.](/getting-started/tutorials/react#setup) to your application configuration.

<Note>
  To use the JavaScript SDK, we require the special redirect URI to provide a simpler flow to retrieve authorization codes.
  For this tutorial you can use the following:

  `https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000`
</Note>

# Setup

1. Clone our repo and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash theme={null}
   $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-javascript-sdk-react.git
   $cd getting-started-javascript-sdk-react/tutorial
   $npm install
   ```
2. Set the following environment variables. We will be setting up a server later for our React front-end to communicate with.
   For now, let’s assume our server is listening on `http://localhost:8000`.
   ```bash theme={null}
   $export REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
   $export REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI= https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000
   $export REACT_APP_SERVER=http://localhost:8000
   ```

<Note>
  Note: If you are using Windows, ensure you are appropriately setting environment variables for your shell.
  Please refer to this post which details how to set environment variables on Windows.
</Note>

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `Smartcar` object in the `constructor` of the App component.
   ```js App.jsx theme={null}
   constructor(props) {
   ...
   // TODO: Authorization Step 1: Initialize the Smartcar object
   this.smartcar = new Smartcar({
       clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
       redirectUri: process.env.REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI,
       scope: ['required:read_vehicle_info'],
       mode: 'test',
       onComplete: this.onComplete,
   });
   }
   ```

<Snippet />

2. A single-page application will launch a pop-up window with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account and grants
   the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we can use the `openDialog` function that our `Smartcar` object has access to. We can place this is
   an `onClick` handler of an HTML button.

   ```js App.jsx theme={null}
   authorize() {
       // TODO: Authorization Step 2a: Launch Connect
       this.smartcar.openDialog({forcePrompt: true});
   }

   render() {
       // TODO: Authorization Step 2b: Render the Connect component
       return <Connect onClick={this.authorize} />;
   }
   ```

# Handle the response

1. Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `redirect_uri` with an
   authorization code as a query parameter and the pop-up dialog is closed. Using the JavaScript SDK, the frontend can
   receive this `code` in the `onComplete` callback passed into the `Smartcar` object.
   ```js App.jsx theme={null}
   onComplete(err, code, status) {
       //TODO: Authorization Step 3: Receive the authorization code
       console.log(code);
       //prints out the authorization code
   };
   ```

# Launching Connect

Restart your server, open up your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/login`. You should be reciderect to Smartcar Connect.

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

# Getting your first access token

After receiving the authorization code, the React application must exchange it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. To do so, we can send
the code to the backend service which we will implement in a bit. Until then, let’s assume our backend service contains
an endpoint `/exchange` that receives an authorization code as a query parameter and exchanges it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

We can add this logic in our `onComplete` callback

```js App.jsx theme={null}
onComplete(err, code, status) {
  // TODO: Request Step 1: Obtain an access token
  return axios
    .get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER}/exchange?code=${code}`);
}

```

# Getting data from a vehicle

Once the back-end has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API. The React app will
have to send a request to the backend service which in turn sends a request to Smartcar. We have to do this because
our frontend does not have the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Assuming our backend has a `/vehicle` endpoint that returns the information of a user’s vehicle, we can make this query in
our `completion callback` and and set the state of the React app with the returned vehicle attributes.

```js App.jsx theme={null}
onComplete(err, code, status) {
  // TODO: Request Step 2a: Get vehicle information
  return axios
    .get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER}/exchange?code=${code}`)
    .then(_ => {
      return axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER}/vehicle`);
    })
    .then(res => {
      this.setState({vehicle: res.data});
    });
}

```

Now that we have the vehicle attributes, we can render a simple Vehicle component that shows the vehicle attributes in a table.

```js App.jsx theme={null}
render() {
  // TODO: Request Step 2b: Get vehicle information
  return Object.keys(this.state.vehicle).length !== 0 ? (
    <Vehicle info={this.state.vehicle} />
  ) : (
    <Connect onClick={this.authorize} />
  );
}
```

# Setting up your backend

Now that our frontend is complete, we will need to create a backend service that contains the logic for the `/exchange` and `/vehicle` endpoints.
You can use any of our backend SDKs below to set up the service starting from the **Obtaining an access token** step.

<Note>
  When setting up the environment variables for your  backend SDK, make sure to set `REDIRECT_URI` to the custom scheme
  used for this tutorial i.e. `https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000`.

  * Learn how to [configure your application](/getting-started/configure-application)

### Deployment Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash theme={null}
    git clone https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe.git
    cd typescript-webhook-recipe
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the Project">
    ```bash theme={null}
    make build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to AWS">
    The recipe uses AWS CDK for infrastructure deployment. First, create a secret to store your Application Management Token, then deploy the stack.

    ```bash theme={null}
    # Step 1: Create the secret for your Application Management Token
    make create-secret appName=your-app-name amt=your_smartcar_application_management_token

    # Step 2: Deploy the infrastructure
    make deploy appName=your-app-name

    # Note the ApiEndpointUrl from the output
    # Example: https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
    ```

    <Note>
      Use the same `appName` value for both commands. This name will be used to identify your CloudFormation stack and associated resources.
    </Note>

    For detailed deployment instructions including environment-specific configuration, see the [GitHub repository README](https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe#usage).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Webhook in Dashboard">
    Now that your receiver is deployed, configure the webhook integration in Smartcar Dashboard:

    1. Go to your [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/integrations)
    2. Click **+ Add Integration** and select **Webhooks**
    3. Configure your webhook:
       * **Webhook URL**: Use the deployed URL from the previous step
       * **Trigger**: Choose when to send webhooks (e.g., "State of charge changes")
       * **Signals**: Select the vehicle data you want to receive (e.g., battery level, location, odometer)
    4. Click **Save** - Smartcar will automatically verify your endpoint

    <Note>
      The recipe automatically handles webhook verification. If verification fails, check CloudWatch logs for errors.
    </Note>

    For detailed webhook configuration guidance, see [Webhooks Setup](/integrations/webhooks/overview).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Subscribe Vehicles (Optional)">
    Depending on your webhook configuration, you may need to manually subscribe vehicles:

    * **Auto-subscribe enabled**: New vehicle connections will automatically start sending webhook data
    * **Manual subscription**: Use the [Subscribe endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe-webhook) or Dashboard to subscribe specific vehicles

    Learn more about [subscribing vehicles to webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/overview#subscribing-vehicles-to-a-webhook).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes. The recipe will output your webhook URL and other important configuration details upon completion.
</Note>

## Customizing Your Webhook Processor

The recipe includes a sample processor that logs webhook data. To implement your business logic:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript src/lambdas/sqs/index.ts theme={null}
  import { Logger } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger';
  import { getSignalByCode, Signals, type TractionBatteryStateOfCharge } from "@smartcar/signals";
  import type { WebhookDataPayload } from '@smartcar/webhooks';
  import { parseEnvelope } from '@smartcar/webhooks';
  import { Context, SQSEvent, SQSHandler } from 'aws-lambda';

  const logger = new Logger();

  export const processor: SQSHandler = async (
    event: SQSEvent,
    context: Context
  ) => {
    const batchItemFailures: { itemIdentifier: string }[] = [];

    for (const record of event.Records) {
      try {
        const eventBody: WebhookDataPayload = parseEnvelope(record.body);
        const signals: Signals = eventBody.data.signals as Signals;
        const { errors } = eventBody.data;

        // Example: Process signals data
        if (signals && signals.length > 0) {
          const stateOfChargeSignal: TractionBatteryStateOfCharge | undefined = 
            getSignalByCode<TractionBatteryStateOfCharge>(signals, 'tractionbattery-stateofcharge');
          
          if (stateOfChargeSignal) {
            logger.info('State of Charge Signal', stateOfChargeSignal.body);
            
            // Replace with your business logic
            if (stateOfChargeSignal.body.value < 50) {
              logger.info('Battery below 50% - get charged!');
            }
          }
        }
        
        // Handle errors in webhook payload
        if (errors && errors.length > 0) {
          logger.warn('Errors in webhook payload', { errors });
        }
      } catch (err) {
        logger.error('Error during processing', { error: err, record });
        batchItemFailures.push({ itemIdentifier: record.messageId });
      }
    }

    return { batchItemFailures };
  };
  ```

  ```typescript External API Integration theme={null}
  // Example: Send data to external service
  async function sendToExternalAPI(payload: WebhookPayload) {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/webhook-data', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API call failed: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuration Options

The recipe uses AWS CDK for infrastructure configuration. You can customize various aspects by modifying the CDK stack configuration in `lib/webhook-receiver-stack.ts`.

### Common Configuration Options

Use these CDK properties (not environment variables) to tune the stack. Their camelCase names match the props in `lib/webhook-receiver-stack.ts`.

| Configuration       | Description                             | Example                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `logLevel`          | Logging verbosity for Lambda functions  | [See example](https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe/blob/61485696ed459ee21ed5aa9d967373f5ecee651f/lib/webhook-receiver-stack.ts#L46) |
| `memorySize`        | Lambda function memory allocation in MB | [See example](https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe/blob/61485696ed459ee21ed5aa9d967373f5ecee651f/lib/webhook-receiver-stack.ts#L41) |
| `visibilityTimeout` | SQS message visibility timeout          | [See example](https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe/blob/61485696ed459ee21ed5aa9d967373f5ecee651f/lib/webhook-receiver-stack.ts#L29) |
| `maxReceiveCount`   | Max retries before dead letter queue    | [See example](https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe/blob/61485696ed459ee21ed5aa9d967373f5ecee651f/lib/webhook-receiver-stack.ts#L30) |

For environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production), you'll define these in your CDK code rather than using environment variables. This allows you to manage infrastructure differences across environments programmatically.

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smartcar/typescript-webhook-recipe) for detailed configuration examples.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### CloudWatch Logging

The recipe includes built-in CloudWatch logging for debugging and monitoring. You can:

* View Lambda execution logs
* Track webhook deliveries and failures
* Monitor SQS queue metrics

<Note>
  CloudWatch alarms are not included by default. You can add custom alarms on top of CloudWatch metrics based on your monitoring needs.
</Note>

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook verification failing">
    * Check that your Smartcar Application Management Token is correct
    * Verify the webhook URL matches your deployed endpoint
    * Check CloudWatch logs for verification errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages stuck in dead letter queue">
    * Review CloudWatch logs for processing errors
    * Check if external services (databases, APIs) are accessible
    * Verify IAM permissions for Lambda functions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High latency or timeouts">
    * Consider increasing Lambda memory allocation in CDK configuration
    * Optimize external API calls and database queries
    * Check for cold start issues in Lambda functions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Debugging Commands

```bash theme={null}
# Monitor queue depths
aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url <queue-url> --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages

# Redrive messages from dead letter queue
aws sqs receive-message --queue-url <dlq-url> --max-number-of-messages 10
```

## Next Steps

After deploying your webhook receiver:

1. **Test Your Integration**: Use the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/) to test webhook delivery
2. **Monitor Performance**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for error rates and queue depths
3. **Scale as Needed**: Adjust Lambda memory and SQS settings based on usage patterns
4. **Add Features**: Extend the processor logic for your specific use cases

# Testing with Postman
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/using-vs-with-postman

In this tutorial we'll go over how to use Vehicle Simulator to test out Smartcar using Postman.

## What is Postman?

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIs - faster.
You’ll need a few things to start making API calls with Smartcar and Postman:

* [A Postman Account](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.postman.co%2Fbuild)
* [Smartcar’s Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/smartcar/smartcar-api/collection/qk7g8v2/smartcar-api-v3?action=share\&creator=33621094)
* [A Smartcar Developer Account](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup)

## Configuring the Connect flow in Postman

1. Install the latest [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and log in
2. Import the [Smartcar collection](https://www.postman.com/smartcar/smartcar-api/collection/qk7g8v2/smartcar-api-v3?action=share\&creator=33621094) into your local Postman workspace. Hit Import.
3. Click Link, paste in [the link](https://www.postman.com/smartcar/smartcar-api/collection/qk7g8v2/smartcar-api-v3?action=share\&creator=33621094) to the collection and hit Continue.
4. On the next screen, hit Import.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Smartcar Application Configuration

If you haven’t already signed up for a Smartcar Developer account, you can do so from this [**sign-up link**](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup).

* Grab your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Configuration page after you sign in, and copy them to someplace secure. You’ll need those tokens a little later in this setup.
* Under the Credentials tab for your application, you’ll need to add the following Redirect URIs. This will ensure that Smartcar Connect exits successfully with both Postman’s Native and Web clients.

```
https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback 
http://localhost:8000/exchange
```

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

Through the Connect flow, you’re able to get consent from vehicle owners to connect their vehicle to your application. Postman provides an easy way to manage OAuth 2.0 flows under the Authorization tab of a Collection. Set up the Configuration Options for either a live or simulated vehicle.

<Frame type="simple">

| Access Token URL | `https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token`                                                                           |
| Client ID        | `client_id` from your Dashboard                                                                                   |
| Client Secret    | `client_secret` from your Dashboard                                                                               |
| Scope            | A space-separated list of [permissions](/api-reference/permissions) that your application is requesting access to |

## Setting up a Simulated Vehicle

Under the Simulator tab on Dashboard, hit Add Vehicle. Note that you may already have a pre-created simulated vehicle available, if so skip to **Connecting to a vehicle** below.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

Select a region and MMY for your vehicle, then hit Search by MMY

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

After selecting Use Vehicle, you’ll want to select a state for the vehicle. After that, you’ll get a set of credentials to use in the Connect flow.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

Before proceeding to the next step, you’ll want to start the simulation in the Smartcar Dashboard.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

## Connecting to a vehicle

If configured correctly, when you click **Get New Access Token** in Postman, you should see the first screen of the Connect flow.

<Tip>
  Before hitting Continue, make sure to select a country from the dropdown appropriate to the region you selected for your simulated vehicle.
</Tip>

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

Continue through the Connect flow, select the brand of your simulated vehicle and enter in the credentials you were issued for your simulated vehicle.
After accepting the permissions you’ll be met with the following screen:

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

Hit Use Token. You should see Access Token under Current Token populate with the access\_token from the popup. Using this access\_token you can make API requests to Smartcar's API.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

<Warning>
  Access tokens are only valid for two hours. If you want to make API requests after it has expired, you'll need to generate a
  new one by stepping through the Connect Flow again, or through a [token refresh](/api-reference/authorization/refreshing-access-token).
</Warning>

## Making an API request

<Tip>
  Thanks to Postman, requests in the collection will inherit the `access_token` from the OAuth 2.0 Authorization flow we went through in the steps above.
</Tip>

In order to make API requests, we’ll need to first get a Smartcar `vehicle Id`. A `vehicle Id` is a unique identifier for a vehicle on Smartcar’s platform.

This can be done with the `All Vehicles` request. Making this request will assign the `vehicle Id` to the `{{vehicle_id}}` variable for other requests in the Collection.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

Now that you've got a vehicle Id, you can make a request to other endpoints. Hitting Vehicle Info, we can see the MMY of the vehicle.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

<br />

Checking `EV Battery Level`, we can see the response matches the vehicle state on the simulator

<Frame type="simple">

<br />

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I’m getting an Invalid Credentials error in the Connect flow">
    * Check that you’re launching Connect in simulated mode
    * If you’re still running into an error make sure you’ve selected a country that matches the region you selected for your simulated vehicle.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I’m getting a 403 - Permission error on API requests">
    * Check that the vehicle you’ve created supports the endpoint. Select View Estimated Latencies to see a list of endpoints supported for the vehicle.
    * If you’re still running into the error, check that you’ve requested the appropriate permission in the scope parameter of the Connect URL.

    <Tip>
      You can always check the `/permissions` endpoint to see what endpoints you have access to.

# Smartcar Usage Limits
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/api-limits

Learn about limits you may encounter when using Smartcar.

## Overview

There are several types of limits that govern your use of Smartcar. The nature of telematics requires us to carefully manage vehicle connections and traffic to ensure the stability of our platform and those of our upstream providers.

There are two major types of limits - **Billing Limits** and **Operational Rate Limits**.

# Billing Limits

### [BILLING : VEHICLE\_REQUEST\_LIMIT](/errors/api-errors/billing-errors#vehicle-request-limit)

Your Smartcar plan specifies a maximum number of API calls you are permitted to make to each single vehicle in a given month. If you exceed this limit, you will receive the `VEHICLE_REQUEST_LIMIT` error.

For example: you have been allocated 500 API calls per vehicle per month, but you made the 501<sup>st</sup> call to a single vehicle during the billing period.

**This limit can be changed.** If you require more calls per vehicle per month, contact [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) or your Account Manager and we can work with you to understand your options.

### [BILLING : VEHICLE\_LIMIT](/errors/api-errors/billing-errors#vehicle-request-limit)

Your Smartcar plan specifies a maximum number of vehicles that you may have connected at any one time. This limit applies to vehicle connections, and is separate from the limit regarding the number of API calls to those vehicles. If you receive this error, you have exceeded your maximum number of connected vehicles.

**This limit can be changed.** Reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) or your Account Manager to discuss your options.

# Operational Rate Limits

### [RATE\_LIMIT : SMARTCAR\_API](/errors/api-errors/rate-limit-errors#smartcar-api)

Smartcar limits the total number of requests a single application can make over a given period of time to ensure platform stability for all customers. The Smartcar API Limit is defined as a "bucket" of requests that refills at a constant rate over time.

The default Smartcar API Limit is a **bucket of 120 requests that refills at a rate of 2 requests per minute.**

If you receive a `RATE_LIMIT:SMARTCAR_API` response, your application has exceeded this limit. You should implement an exponential backoff strategy when retrying requests.

**This limit can be changed.** Reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) or your Account Manager to discuss your options.

### [RATE\_LIMIT : VEHICLE](/errors/api-errors/rate-limit-errors#vehicle)

Sending telematics requests to a vehicle causes it to wake up from its sleep state and consume energy and data resources. Excessive requests to a single vehicle can result in:

* EV battery drain
* 12 volt battery drain
* `UPSTREAM:RATE_LIMIT` errors that prevent you from making requests for a longer period of time

Smartcar enforces a per-vehicle rate limit that governs the rate of requests to a single vehicle and mitigates these potential issues. These limits can differ based on the vehicle manufacturer and a number of other factors, and are set by Smartcar to ensure consistent and timely data can be retrieved from vehicles.

**This limit cannot be changed.** If you receive this response, refer to the `retry-after` header (returned as seconds) for when to retry the request.

### [UPSTREAM : RATE\_LIMIT](/errors/api-errors/upstream-errors#rate-limit)

Vehicle manufacturers sometimes impose rate limits on requests to vehicles. The Smartcar Vehicle Rate Limit will generally prevent those limits from being reached, but outside requests from other providers may cause the upstream limit to be exceeded. If the OEM upstream rate limit is exceeded, you will receive `UPSTREAM:RATE_LIMIT` from the Smartcar API for the affected vehicle until the limit is reset.

**This limit cannot be changed.** Smartcar cannot control rate limits imposed by our upstream providers. If you consistently receive this response for a single vehicle, reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) and we can investigate.

# Beta
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/beta

Understand Smartcar's approach to features in beta.

Beta is an option that allows developers to test and integrate new Smartcar features before they are fully released. Beta refers to a phase where certain features are made available for testing and feedback prior to general availability. These features are functional but may still be under development or refinement.

## Benefits of Beta Features

Participating in beta allows developers to get a head start on integrating new features, a chance to influence the feature in development through feedback and help Smartcar ensure your app’s needs are met.

## Considerations for features in Beta

# Brand Quirks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/brand-quirks

Brand specific quirks to keep in mind while building out your application.

## Acura

### Ignition On

Depending on model year, certain Acura vehicles do not return data when the ignition/engine is on.

### Sleep State

Most Acuras will go into a sleep state after about a week of inactivity,

## Audi

### Primary Key User

In order to have access to all vehicle functionality the account that connects to Smartcar will need to be flagged as a Key User by Audi.

## BMW/MINI

### CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT - SUBSCRIPTION errors

Smartcar API will throw a CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT - SUBSCRIPTION when the data we receive from the vehicle is older than a month as this normally indicates a subscription issue.

## BYD

### Concurrent login requirement

BYD accounts can only maintain one active session at a time. Vehicle owners should sign in with a dedicated BYD login for Smartcar that is separate from the credentials used in the BYD mobile app. If the same account signs into the OEM app after connecting through Smartcar, the Smartcar session will be revoked and require re-authentication.

If customers reach out about being logged out of their BYD mobile app, we recommend instructing users to create a secondary BYD account exclusively for your app.

## GM (Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC)

### VEHICLE\_STATE - ASLEEP errors

After 3-4 days of no activity, GM vehicles will enter a deep sleep state at which point they will no longer respond to API requests to preserve their 12v battery. In order to get data from the vehicle again, the car will need to go through an ignition cycle.

### UPSTREAM - RATE\_LIMIT errors

In order to avoid hitting UPSTREAM - RATE\_LIMIT errors use batch requests and ping no more than once every 30 minutes. Use of the OEM app also counts towards the rate limit.

## Hyundai/Kia

### Telemetry Update Behavior

#### Pre-2025 Models (Gen 2 Navigation)

Hyundai/Kia vehicles have event-based logic that sends telemetry updates based on state changes such as:

* Every 10% of SoC while charging
* 5 minutes after ignition off
* Vehicle doors are left unlocked for 5 minutes
* After a command successfully completes
* Whenever charging stops

#### 2025+ Models (Gen 3 / CCnC Navigation)

Newer Hyundai/Kia models update more frequently, as often as every five minutes, including while the vehicle is driving.

## Nissan

### “Vehicle has been found” MyNISSAN notifications

Vehicle owners may receive a notification from the MyNISSAN app stating “Success! We found the location of your vehicle. Check the map for the location of your YYYY Model.” every time the location endpoint is hit.

The app appears to have an option to edit notifications, but as of Feb 2024 they are not available in the app. Notifications may need to be turned off at the iOS/Android level by the vehicle owner.

## PSA Group (Citroen, DS, Opel, Peugeot, Vauxhall)

### Requesting control\_charge permissions

If you request control\_charge permissions for PSA EVs, upon login owners will be presented with a PIN and MFA screen in Connect upon submitting their credentials. They will need to have set this up on their OEMs application in order to grant your application this permission.

## Polestar

### Stop charge command limitations

Smartcar cannot fulfill stop charge commands if the vehicle is below 40% state of charge due to limitations with the current Polestar APIs.

## Rivian

### MFA

If MFA is enabled the vehicle owner will need to re-authorize via Connect about every 2 weeks.

## Tesla

### Remote Access

It may take a few hours or up to a full day for the REMOTE\_ACCESS\_DISABLED errors to subside after remote access is enabled.

### Charge Billing Records

In order to retrieve charge billing records, the main Tesla account must connect the vehicle, as driver profiles do not have access to this data.

### Virtual Key

Tesla now requires virtual keys for 3rd-party applications in order to issue commands for the following models:

* All Cybertrucks, Model 3 and Model Y
* 2021+ Model S and X

Please see [Virtual Keys](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/virtual-key-tesla) for more information.

### Enterprise Tenant Configuration

<Warning>
  For enterprise customers, Tesla tenant setup must occur **before** any customer-facing Tesla vehicles are onboarded. Configure this during initial implementation, coordinated with Smartcar.
</Warning>

Changing Tesla tenant configurations after vehicles are already connected will require all affected users to re-authenticate. See [OEM Migrations and Re-authentication](/connect/re-auth/oem-migrations) for guidance on handling this scenario.

## Volkswagen

### Control charge limits

Volkswagen limits charge commands to safeguard battery longevity based on environmental and system conditions. Excessive consecutive requests may result in being temporarily rate limited. To restore functionality, the vehicle must be driven again.

### CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT errors on lock/unlock commands

In addition to verifying the VW account with the activation code, some cars will need to undergo the VW Ident Process before you can access remote lock/unlock functionality. This involves contacting the dealership to verify your ownership of the vehicle.

### Missing Subscription (European VWs)

Upon purchasing (or activating the free trial), VW needs to review the request. You will get an email confirmation once they've cleared everything on their side.

### Primary Driver Status

In order to fully interact with Smartcar, the credentials need to be flagged as the primary driver. You'll need to tap the "become primary driver" flow in the VW app. Depending on the model, this may require you to be in the car to interact with the infotainment system.

A vehicle owner can verify whether or not they are the primary driver by following the steps below:

1. Open the VW mobile app tap the profile icon in the bottom right
2. Go to **Vehicle Management**
3. If there’s an **Additional Users** section, tap their name to see whether it says **Primary User** or **Additional User**

## Volvo

### Lock/unlock commands

Volvo is an outlier regarding how unlock requests are processed. After initiating the request, after about 10 seconds you'll need to open the trunk (boot) to successfully complete the request. You'll know the car is ready to unlock the trunk as the hazard lights will flash. We recommend adding a notification for Volvos as part of the request loading animation to inform the user of this process.

### Phone number username

Smartcar Connect currently checks for an email format, as such phone number usernames cannot be used. The owner will need to add their email to their Volvo account via the web portal.

### Compatibility

Some models are not compatible because the device needs to be physically in the vehicle during authentication, which Connect doesn’t support at the moment:

* 2021+: XC40 Recharge
* 2022+: S90, S90 Recharge, V90, V90 Recharge, V90 Cross Country, XC60, XC60 Recharge, C40 Recharge
* 2023+: All models with the exception of the XC40

Even if the vehicle has been connected to and shows up in the Volvo app, if they go through Connect the account will present as if there are no vehicles on the account.

## Notes

### Audi

* Owners will need to ensure they're the Primary or Key user for the vehicle connected to their account in order to access all Smartcar functionality.

### Ford and Lincoln

* Owners that use a username to login to their connected services app will need to migrate to using their email address under account settings in their Ford Pass or Lincoln Way portal.

### OnStar

* Chevy Bolts MY 2020+ come with the **EV Mobile Command** service included for 5 years with the purchase of a new vehicle. Location data is not included in the package. Bolt owners will need to also subscribe to **Remote Access** to be able to get access to location data.
* For all other OnStar accounts, we require the modern **Remote Access** plan as our base subscription. This plan comes with the **Vehicle Status** feature set, which is what enables our remote access to data from cars.
  More information can be found [in this PDF](https://my.chevrolet.com/content/dam/gmownercenter/gmna/dynamic/onstar/comparePlans/nbm/OC_Compare-Plans-Chevy.pdf).
* There are certain legacy OnStar accounts floating around with similar names. A good check on whether a customer has the correct plan or not is the ability to view vehicle information like fuel level, EV battery level, odometer, or tire pressure from within their vehicle’s mobile app.

### Nissan US

* Convenience features are included as part of the Premium package.

### Toyota

* The Remote Connect subscription is tied to the audio package purchased with the vehicle. Compatible audio package availability is determined based on the trim of the vehicle model and varies model year to model year.
  Toyota provides PDFs for Remote Connect availability [here](https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/#:~:text=Learn%20about%20your%20Connected%20Services).

### Uconnect

* For all Uconnect accounts, we require the ability to interact with vehicle information through the Uconnect portal
* A Uconnect account may have access to Mopar, but not all Mopar accounts have access to Uconnect. If a user can see information in Mopar but not Uconnect, they'll need to reach out to Uconnect support to set up the right Uconnect plan for their vehicle.
* 2021+ Jeeps have their own connected service - Jeep Connect
* 2022+ Rams have their own connected service - Ram Connect
* 2022+ Jeep Wagoneers have their own connected service - Wagoneer Connect
* Canada has limited support listed [here](https://www.driveuconnect.ca/en/sirius-xm-guardian-vehicles)

### Volkswagen ID Series

* Model year 2021 and certain 2022 Volkswagen ID vehicles require an upgrade to vehicle software version 3 which will allow you to get location and odometer data. This is a requirement for both US and European vehicles.

### Volvo

The following models are not currently compatible with Smartcar:

* 2021+ : XC40 Recharge
* 2022+ : S90, S90 Recharge, V90, V90 Recharge, V90 Cross Country, XC60, XC60 Recharge
* 2023+ : All models with the exception of the XC40

# Data Freshness Frequencies
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/frequencies

Smartcar's goal is to provide as close to real-time data as possible based on available technologies and capabilities from OEMs. Although real-time is not yet available across all OEMs outside of commercial fleets, Smartcar continues to improve these frequencies as platforms and technologies evolve.

## Understanding Real Vehicle Data Freshness Frequencies

At Smartcar, we are committed to transparency about our data. When we report data freshness, we're referring to actual data retrieved directly from vehicles, not cached information. Cached data can be returned instantly.

### What Does The Table Data Mean

* **True Vehicle Freshness**: A frequency range of 30 minutes means how often the vehicle can safely provide new data without side effects. Even if we attempt to fetch it every 5 seconds, the data won't change for 30 minutes.
* **Data Delivery**: Rather than polling our API to determine when the data has changed, create a [Webhook](/integrations/webhooks/overview) and Smartcar will send you data as frequently as it changes. It provides both the convenience of immediate notifications AND the reliability of truly fresh vehicle data.

### Why This Matters

**Honest Reporting**: We publish actual vehicle data freshness rates rather than platform latency rates that can be misleading. Developers need to understand the true age of the data they're receiving to build reliable applications. When you come across promises of data "every minute" for a brand we show as 30 minutes, this often means you're repeatedly receiving the same cached information at that frequency, not retrieving fresh data from the vehicle.

***

<Note>
  The values below indicate a range of how quickly you can expect to see fresh data and not how frequent you can receive data from Smartcar. i.e. You may request/receive odometer every three minutes from Smartcar, but its value won't change until it is refreshed by the OEM.
</Note>

**Data Frequency**: This indicates the frequency at which you receive vehicle data updates that Smartcar delivers to you via webhooks. This frequency can vary based on the vehicle make, the data type (such as location, odometer, or battery), and how frequently the vehicle is driven. In general, you can expect updates to arrive anywhere from every few minutes to once every few hours. While our slowest data rates for all OEMs is an hour, for many vehicles (including the fastest), when the vehicle is idle or "asleep", no updates will be provided since no change has occurred.

Smartcar automatically adjusts polling frequency based on vehicle status to balance timely updates with efficient resource use. While we aim to provide near real-time data when possible, exact timing depends on factors outside of Smartcar's control, such as OEM behavior and vehicle connectivity.

## Geofence restriction

<Warning>
  Data and commands are only available when the vehicle is within approximately 200 meters of the consented address. Data streaming from BMW to Smartcar and from Smartcar to your app automatically stops when the vehicle exits the Geofence.
</Warning>

When vehicle owners grant consent, they specify a single address where managed charging will occur. This Geofence defines where data streaming and charge commands are available. This design ensures data privacy and compliance with BMW's requirements.

## Consent Flow

Vehicle owners grant consent through the BMW Connected Drive Portal as part of the Smartcar Connect flow. During this process, they:

1. Log in with their BMW ID
2. Select the vehicle(s) to connect
3. Specify the address where managed charging will occur
4. Accept BMW's terms for data sharing

## Limitations

<Info>
  Keep these constraints in mind when building your integration.
</Info>

* **Charging-only scope** — This integration focuses on charging and battery data. Broader vehicle data (odometer, tire pressure, etc.) is not available through the Energy API.
* **Geofence-restricted** — Data and commands only work within the \~200m Geofence radius.
* **AC charging only** — Remote charge control is limited to AC charging sessions.
* **No public charging data** — Data from public charging sessions is not supported.
* **No cross-border data** — Cross-border data streaming is not currently supported.
* **Charge stop rate limit** — BMW enforces a rolling 30-day limit of 80 charge stop commands per vehicle.

If you have any questions about these limitations or need additional capabilities, please our support team. We're continuously working with BMW to expand the integration's features and coverage.

* [Charge Stop](/api-reference/evs/control-charge)

### Notes

This Mercedes-Benz integration is automatically enabled for your application when connecting vehicles out of Europe.

* Supported European markets: Reach customers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland
* As part of this integration, drivers will be asked to enter their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) during the new consent authentication flow. We recommend preparing your customer guidance and support content accordingly
* If charge control permissions are requested by the connecting application only EQA, EQB, EQE and EQS vehicles are compatible
* Only EQ models support control charge at this time. For EQE and EQS models, if the state of charge is lower than 20%, stop commands are rejected by Mercedes. For all other EQ models, if the state of charge is below 50%, stopping the charging process is rejected by Mercedes and the car will continue to charge until it reaches at least 50% for vehicle reliability reasons,

# Tesla Permission Info
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers

This page has information regarding Smartcar's upgraded Tesla integration.

## Updating access with Tesla

You can use either of the following URLs to prompt users for more Tesla
permissions in the event you need additional access from the
vehicle owner due to:

* A [PERMISSION](/errors/api-errors/permission-errors) error from API

* A [CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT:PERMISSION](/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#permission) error from API

* Needing access to an endpoint out of scope for your existing permissions

If one or more of the Smartcar scopes you pass map to a new Tesla permission(s)
for the account, the user will be prompted to update access after they log in
with Tesla.

## Requiring Tesla Permissions

To ensure users select the necessary permissions with Tesla before
being able to connect their vehicle via Smartcar, please append the `required:`
prefix to Smartcar scopes in your Connect URL e.g. `required:read_location`.

As a result if they do not select the necessary permissions with Tesla, they will see the
following screen and be prompted to return to Tesla to update their permissions.

## Permission Mappings

Tesla provides a limited set of permissions. To ensure vehicle data is shared only with explicit consent, Smartcar has mapped Tesla’s permissions into its existing more granular options. For example, granting access to “vehicle commands” in a Tesla account allows an application to start or stop charging, lock or unlock doors, enable or disable Sentry Mode, and more. Smartcar separates these permissions so that applications must request access to control charging separately from access to vehicle security, control navigation, etc. Smartcar does not use or share vehicle data beyond the permissions listed in this table. An application with the ability to control the charge status of a vehicle, does not have access to control other aspects of the car unless explictly requested and granted by a vehicle owner.

| Smartcar Permission          | Tesla Permission                                    |

# Tesla FAQs
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/faqs

FAQs on our new Tesla integration. For an overview of the changes see [this page](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new).

#### What happens if I connect to one of my applications with the legacy flow and another with the new flow?

As long as you have access to the same set of permissions on Tesla’s side and have added our virtual key there will not be any conflicts while the legacy API is active.

#### If my users have more than one Tesla on their account, will they need to add the virtual key to all of their vehicles?

Yes. You will need to add our virtual key to each vehicle on the Tesla account.

#### What happens if I issue a command but Smartcar’s virtual key hasn’t been added to the vehicle?

We will throw a `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT:VIRTUAL_KEY_REQUIRED` error.

## Do all vehicles need a virtual key?

2020 and earlier Model S and X **do not** require a virtual key installation. However, these vehicles can support streaming data access (faster, more frequent updates) if the owner enables a streaming toggle within the vehicle settings. Smartcar Connect will prompt users about this option and can send email instructions on how to enable it.

Older models without streaming enabled, Smartcar will poll these vehicles in the background every 5 minutes for data. These requests **will not** wake the vehicle.

#### How can users enable streaming for 2020 and earlier Model S/X?

During the Smartcar Connect flow, users will be prompted to enable streaming for eligible vehicles. They can request email instructions that will guide them through toggling the streaming setting in their vehicle's infotainment screen. This does not require Virtual Key installation.

#### What happens if a user does not add a virtual key for vehicles that support streaming?

If a vehicle is streaming capable via virtual key and does not yet have a virtual key installed,
requests to the vehicle will be limited to 1 request every 8 hours for data. These requests **will
not** wake the vehicle. Older models that are streaming capable via in-vehicle toggle, will continue to be polled every 5 minutes for data if the toggle is off.

#### What happens if I issue a command but the owner has revoked access through their Tesla portal?

We will throw a `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT:PERMISSION` error.

#### What happens if a user doesn’t select the correct permissions on Tesla’s side?

Connect maps Tesla’s permissions to Smartcar’s and only grants your application access to the ones requested. If we do not get the corresponding permission from Tesla, we will not grant your application access and throw the `PERMISSION:NULL` error as per usual when you make an API request.

Your users will need to [revoke access](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/faqs#how-can-my-users-update-their-permissions-with-tesla) through the Tesla portal, then step through the flow again in order to fix this.

#### How can I tell which cars have gone through the new flow?

The [Migration Status](/api-reference/tesla/get-migration-status) make specific endpoint indicates if a vehicle still needs to be migrated to Tesla's new API.

#### Can owner and driver accounts authorize access with Smartcar through Connect?

Yes. Either account type can go through the Connect flow. As long as the Tesla account is attached to the vehicle, you can make requests to it.

#### Does the user need to be next to vehicle when adding a virtual key?

Owner accounts can add a virtual key remotely. Driver accounts need to be in
Bluetooth range in order to add a virtual key.

#### Can driver accounts add a virtual key?

Yes. However, driver accounts can only pair virtual keys via Bluetooth. They
cannot add a virtual key remotely.

#### Why are my users are seeing a location sharing notification on their navigation unit?

With the [recent changes to data
access](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new), vehicles will transmit their
live location if your application has requested access to location data. This
notification was put in place by Tesla to ensure transparency for owners about
what data is being shared and with whom.

The domain displayed will match the Virtual Key for your application.

#### How can my users update their permissions with Tesla?

Please [this guide](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#updating-access-with-tesla) for details on how to do facilitate this for your users.


# Virtual Keys
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/virtual-key-tesla

This page has information regarding the use of Virtual Keys for Tesla vehicles.

## What is a Virtual Key?

A Virtual Key is a digital access method required by Tesla for third-party
applications to issue commands to Tesla vehicles and the preferred method for accessing data.
Please see [this
section](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key)
for more information.

### Adding the Virtual Key

Smartcar handles this step on your behalf in the Connect flow. You can get started with the default Smartcar Virtual Key with no configurations required.

If you're on an **Enterprise** plan, please reach out to your Account Manager or
Solutions Architect for information on setting up a custom Virtual Key with your own brand name.

## Where can I find my Virtual Key?

Although Smartcar handles this step on your behalf, the Virtual Key URL for your application is sent back along with the authorization code after a user completes the Connect flow. You can redirect users to this URL if they need to add the Virtual Key again.

### Vehicle Owners adding a Virtual Key

Smartcar Connect will present Tesla vehicle owners a prompt to install the Tesla Virtual Key after granting access and prior to redirecting them back to your application.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The Virtual Key is a URL in the form:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Free or Build Plans">
    ```
    https://www.tesla.com/_ak/smartcar.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enterprise Plan">
    ```
    https://www.tesla.com/_ak/{{custom_subdomain}}.app.car
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After prompting your users to open the link, depending on their device, they will be redirected to the Tesla app or prompted to scan a QR code.

<Tip>
  Adding a Virtual Key will need to be done after a user has granted your application access to their Tesla account in the Connect flow.

  Please see our [FAQs](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/faqs#can-owner-and-driver-accounts-authorize-access-with-smartcar-through-connect) for details on adding a virtual key for accounts with multiple vehicles and different account types.

## Do all vehicles need a virtual key?

2020 and earlier Model S and X **do not** require a virtual key installation. However, to enable streaming data access (faster, more frequent updates), owners can enable streaming by toggling a setting within the vehicle.

### Enabling Streaming for 2020 and Earlier Model S/X

For 2020 or earlier Model S or X that supports streaming (requires a software update), users can enable streaming without installing a Virtual Key:

1. During the Smartcar Connect flow, drivers will be prompted about enabling streaming for their vehicle
2. Drivers can choose to receive email instructions on how to enable the streaming toggle in their vehicle
3. Access the streaming settings from the Tesla infotainment screen
4. Toggle the streaming setting on to enable faster data updates

Once streaming is enabled via the vehicle toggle, data will be refreshed more frequently without requiring Virtual Key installation for these modals. If streaming toggle is not enabled, data for these older models is refreshed every 5 minutes while the vehicle is awake.

## What if a streaming capable vehicle does not have a virtual key installed?

If a vehicle is streaming capable via virtual key and does not yet have a virtual key installed,
requests to the vehicle will be limited to 1 request every 8 hours for data. These requests **will
not** wake the vehicle.


# Important Updates
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new

Upcoming changes to data access and permissions in 2025

## May 20, 2025

Smartcar now handles adding Virtual Keys for Tesla vehicles on your behalf in the Connect flow. Virtual Keys are required for third-party applications to issue commands to Tesla vehicles and are the preferred method for accessing data.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img />
</Frame>

For more details, visit the [Virtual Key documentation](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/virtual-key-tesla).

## January 10, 2025

Starting in March 2025, Tesla will require a new permission to access live
location data for its vehicles. Due to this change, you have two options:

**If your application needs live location data:**<br />
Users will need to reauthenticate and grant explicit access to the Vehicle
Location permission to continue receiving location data beyond March 2025, if
they haven’t already done so. This permission was previously included as part of
the Vehicle Information permission.

**If your application only needs to know whether the vehicle is at home:**<br />
A new boolean value will be available soon, and it will not require
reauthentication. Vehicle owners can set their home location in the Tesla
application.

### Why is this change occurring?

Tesla now provides users more granular data access control, and requires vehicle
owners to explicitly consent to sharing location data with 3rd parties like
Smartcar. This ultimately gives drivers more control and awareness of how and
what data they decide to share.

### Next steps if you need live location data

**1. Check existing permissions** <br />
Use the [User Access](/api-reference/tesla/get-user-access) endpoint to verify whether a vehicle has already
been granted the required permission on Tesla's side.

**2. Update Smartcar Connect scopes**<br />
To ensure vehicle owners grant the new permission, append `required:` to your
scopes in the Smartcar Connect URL (for example, `required:read_location`). For
detailed instructions, please refer to [this guide](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#requiring-tesla-permissions).

**3. Prompt users to reauthenticate**<br />
If needed, guide users to reauthenticate their Tesla vehicles using the methods outlined
[here](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#updating-access-with-tesla).

<br />

<Warning>
  If the Vehicle Location permission isn’t granted by March 2025, you may
  encounter a `PERMISSION` error. As a result, your
  application will no longer receive live location data from affected Tesla
  vehicles until they reauthenticate.
</Warning>

## December 19, 2024

Starting **January 21, 2025**, a Virtual Key will be required to maintain access to
Tesla vehicle data. Failure to make the necessary changes could result in a
disruption to your service after this date. Below, we’ve outlined the steps you
need to take to prepare, depending on your situation.

### For new developers

If you're on an **Enterprise** plan, please reach out to your Account Manager or
Solutions Architect for information on setting up your own Virtual Key.

**Free** and **Build** customers can get started with the default Virtual Key.

### For existing developers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm using an app.car subdomain that Smartcar has created for me">
    **What’s changing?**

    Telsa is changing the way data can be accessed by 3rd party applications.

    **What do you need to do?**

    To ensure continuous data access, please have your users add your Virtual Key to
    their vehicles if they haven’t already.  They can follow [this
    guide](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key)
    for more information. If you already prompt users to add a Virtual Key as your
    application issues commands - no additional work is needed, please continue to
    do so.

    **What is a Virtual Key?**

    A virtual key is a digital access method required by Tesla for third-party
    applications to receive vehicle data and issue commands to Tesla vehicles.
    Please see [this
    guide](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key)
    for more information.

    **Where can I find my Virtual Key?**

    The Virtual Key URL for your application will be sent back along with the
    authorization code after a user completes the Connect flow.
    Alternatively, you can reach out to Support or your Account Manager and they'll be able to provide
    it to you.

    **What happens if my users do not add my Virtual Key?**

    Starting January 21, 2025 you will not be able to get data from Tesla vehicles
    you are connected to and will receive a `virtual_key_required` error instead
    ([docs](https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#virtual-key-required)).

    **What about vehicles that do not support Virtual Keys?**

    2020 and earlier Model S and X **do not** require a Virtual Key installation. However, these vehicles can support streaming data access if the owner enables a streaming toggle within the vehicle settings. Smartcar Connect will prompt users about this option and can send email instructions. Without streaming enabled, you may not always receive the latest data from the vehicle when you make an API request to Smartcar.

    **Will my users need to reauthenticate?**

    No. They simply need to add the Virtual Key to their vehicle.

# Vehicle Simulator
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/vehicle-simulator

Learn about what to expect from Vehicle Simulator and how it compares to Live mode.

Vehicle Simulator allows you to test your application in realistic scenarios with a simulated Smartcar-compatible vehicle. Simulator responds to API requests just like a real vehicle. You can choose a simulated trip for your vehicle to take, and track it over time.

You can use the simulator for initial testing before you have a real vehicle to connect, or as part of an end-to-end testing suite.

## Creating a Simulated Vehicle

Simulated vehicles are managed in the Smartcar Dashboard.

Select "Add a vehicle" and select a vehicle by Make, Model, and Year, or provide a VIN for a US-based vehicle that you want to simulate. You'll be able to preview the API endpoints that are supported for the vehicle model you select.

Once you create your simulated vehicle, you'll select a simulated trip profile that the vehicle will follow. This profile can run automatically over time, or you can manually select a stage of the trip for the vehicle in the Dashboard.

## Connecting a Simulated Vehicle

Simulated vehicles generate a special set of credentials that mimic what a real-world vehicle owner would have. You'll use these credentials to establish a vehicle connection through the same Smartcar Connect flow that you will use for live vehicles.

In order for Connect to know you're using credentials generated from Vehicle Simulator, you'll need to pass `mode=simulated` in the [Connect URL](/connect/redirect-to-connect).

<Info>
  Please ensure you're passing or changing the country flag for Connect based on the region you've created your vehicle for.
  Failure to do so will result in an invalid credential error on login. You can read more about country selection for Connect [here](/connect/advanced-config/country-flag).
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SDKs">
    You can set `mode` in the auth client builder to `simulated`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No SDK">
    You'll need to pass `mode=simulated` in the Connect URL
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Making requests to a Simulated Vehicle

Once your simulated vehicle is connected, you can make API requests to it just as you would a real vehicle.

Supported endpoints for the simulated vehicle will send responses with simulated data - unsupported endpoints will return errors just as they would with a real vehicle.

You can also send commands to simulated vehicles, like start/stop charge or lock/unlock doors. These requests will send responses that mimic that of a real vehicle, but the vehicle state will continue to reflect the simulated trip that was selected.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are tokens handled?">
    Access and refresh tokens behave as they do in `live` mode:

    * Access Tokens are valid for 2 hours
    * Refresh Tokens are valid for 60 days.
    * Using a refresh token to fetch an new access/refresh token pair will invalidate the refresh token that you used.

    **Reusing simulated vehicle credentials**<br />
    If you use the same simulated credentials for multiple Connect flow sessions, we'll issue a new set of tokens each time.
    This will not invalidate any existing tokens from previous logins so you'll be able to keep them refreshed in parallel without impacting the validity of the others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any limits on how many vehicles I can create?">
    The number of simulated vehicles that can be created depends on your Smartcar plan tier. Please see [here](https://smartcar.com/pricing#plans) for more information.

# What is a Connected Car?
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/what-is-a-connected-car

Learn about how to build applications that connect to millions of vehicles around the world.

Connected cars are vehicles that have in-built cellular modems. Most vehicles manufactured after 2015 have been shipping with this connectivity, or "embedded telematics." This essentially makes cars "smart" allowing them to communicate with the Internet. Take a look at this blog post for an in depth primer.


# What is Smartcar?
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/what-is-smartcar

Learn about how to build applications that connect to millions of vehicles around the world.

The Smartcar platform allows mobility businesses to easily connect with their customers’ cars. Whether you need to track a vehicle’s location,
verify its mileage, share a virtual key, start charging an EV, monitor a car’s fuel tank level, inspect the tire pressure, or check the engine
oil life, Smartcar lets you do so with a single API request.

Take a look at the video below for a quick overview of how Smartcar works.

# Architecture Patterns
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/architecture

Design patterns for reliable webhook processing

The most critical pattern for reliable webhook handling is separating acknowledgment from processing.

## Decouple Receipt from Processing

**Return 200 immediately, process asynchronously.** This is the foundation of a reliable webhook integration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive the webhook">
    Your endpoint receives the POST request from Smartcar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Persist immediately">
    Write the raw payload to a queue, database, or object storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Return 200">
    Acknowledge receipt with a 200 status code (within 15 seconds)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process asynchronously">
    A background worker processes the persisted payload
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why This Matters

* **Prevents timeouts** from slow business logic
* **Allows retry of processing** without requesting redelivery
* **Enables processing updates** without losing historical events
* **Survives outages** in downstream systems

### Implementation Examples

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js (Express + AWS SQS) theme={null}
  const express = require('express');
  const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

  const app = express();
  const sqs = new AWS.SQS();

  app.post('/webhooks/smartcar', async (req, res) => {
    try {
      // 1. Get the raw payload
      const payload = req.body;
      
      // 2. Queue for processing
      await sqs.sendMessage({
        QueueUrl: process.env.WEBHOOK_QUEUE_URL,
        MessageBody: JSON.stringify(payload)
      }).promise();
      
      // 3. Return immediately
      res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to queue webhook:', error);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal error' });
    }
  });

  // Separate worker processes the queue
  async function processWebhook(payload) {
    const { eventType } = payload;
    
    if (eventType === 'VEHICLE_STATE') {
      await updateVehicleState(payload);
    } else if (eventType === 'VEHICLE_ERROR') {
      await handleVehicleError(payload);
    }
  }
  ```

  ```python Python (Flask + Redis Queue) theme={null}
  from flask import Flask, request
  from rq import Queue
  from redis import Redis

  app = Flask(__name__)
  redis_conn = Redis()
  queue = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

  @app.post("/webhooks/smartcar")
  def webhook_handler():
      # 1. Get the raw payload
      payload = request.get_json()
      
      # 2. Queue for processing
      queue.enqueue(process_webhook, payload)
      
      # 3. Return immediately
      return {"status": "received"}, 200

  def process_webhook(payload):
      # This runs asynchronously in a worker
      event_type = payload.get("eventType")
      
      if event_type == "VEHICLE_STATE":
          update_vehicle_state(payload)
      elif event_type == "VEHICLE_ERROR":
          handle_vehicle_error(payload)
  ```

  ```java Java (Spring Boot + RabbitMQ) theme={null}
  @RestController
  public class WebhookController {
      
      @Autowired
      private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;
      
      @PostMapping("/webhooks/smartcar")
      public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> handleWebhook(
          @RequestBody String payload
      ) {
          // 1. Queue for processing
          rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(
              "webhook-queue", 
              payload
          );
          
          // 2. Return immediately
          return ResponseEntity.ok(
              Map.of("status", "received")
          );
      }
  }

  @Component
  public class WebhookProcessor {
      
      @RabbitListener(queues = "webhook-queue")
      public void processWebhook(String payload) {
          // This runs asynchronously
          JsonNode json = objectMapper.readTree(payload);
          String eventType = json.get("eventType").asText();
          
          if ("VEHICLE_STATE".equals(eventType)) {
              updateVehicleState(json);
          } else if ("VEHICLE_ERROR".equals(eventType)) {
              handleVehicleError(json);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **Don't do this:** If you perform heavy processing before returning a response, your endpoint may timeout and Smartcar will retry, creating duplicate processing work.

  ```python Bad Example theme={null}
  @app.post("/webhooks/smartcar")
  def webhook_handler():
      payload = request.get_json()
      
      # DON'T DO THIS: These operations might take too long
      update_database(payload)
      call_external_api(payload)
      send_notifications(payload)
      
      # Might timeout before reaching this line
      return {"status": "received"}, 200
  ```
</Warning>

# Reliability
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/reliability

Build resilient webhook processing that handles retries and out-of-order delivery

Design your webhook integration to handle the realities of distributed systems: retries, out-of-order delivery, and duplicate events.

## Implement Idempotency

Use the `eventId` field to ensure you process each event exactly once, even if Smartcar retries delivery or you reprocess from your queue.

### Why Idempotency Matters

* Smartcar retries failed deliveries with the same `eventId`
* Your queue worker might process the same message multiple times
* Prevents duplicate database updates or notifications
* Enables safe reprocessing of historical events

### Implementation Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Redis">
    ```python theme={null}
    import redis

    redis_client = redis.Redis()

    def process_webhook(payload):
        event_id = payload.get("eventId")
        
        # Check if already processed
        if redis_client.exists(f"processed:{event_id}"):
            print(f"Already processed {event_id}, skipping")
            return
        
        # Process the event
        process_vehicle_data(payload)
        
        # Mark as processed (expires after 7 days)
        redis_client.setex(
            f"processed:{event_id}",
            time=604800,  # 7 days
            value="1"
        )
    ```

      const existing = await dynamodb.get({
        TableName: 'ProcessedEvents',
        Key: { eventId }
      }).promise();
      
      if (existing.Item) {
        console.log(`Already processed ${eventId}, skipping`);
        return;
      }
      
      // Process the event
      await processVehicleData(payload);
      
      // Mark as processed with TTL
      await dynamodb.put({
        TableName: 'ProcessedEvents',

          eventId,
          processedAt: new Date().toISOString(),

    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="PostgreSQL">
    ```python theme={null}
    def process_webhook(payload):

        # Use unique constraint to prevent duplicates
        try:
            db.execute(
                "INSERT INTO processed_events (event_id, processed_at) VALUES (%s, NOW())",
                (event_id,)
            )
        except IntegrityError:
            # Already processed
            print(f"Already processed {event_id}, skipping")
            return

    -- Table schema
    CREATE TABLE processed_events (
        event_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
        processed_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
    );

    -- Add TTL-style cleanup (run periodically)
    DELETE FROM processed_events 
    WHERE processed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Retention period:** Store processed `eventId` values for at least 7 days to handle all retries and late reprocessing scenarios.
</Tip>

***

## Handle Out-of-Order Delivery

Webhook events are delivered **concurrently** and may arrive out of order. Never assume events arrive in chronological sequence.

### Use Timestamps for Freshness

Always check if incoming data is newer than your current stored state:

```python theme={null}
def update_vehicle_state(payload):
    vehicle_id = payload.get("vehicleId")
    delivered_at = payload["meta"]["deliveredAt"]
    
    # Get current stored state
    current = db.get_vehicle_state(vehicle_id)
    
    # Only update if this event is newer
    if current and current.updated_at > delivered_at:
        print(f"Ignoring older event for {vehicle_id}")
        return
    
    # Safe to update
    db.update_vehicle_state(vehicle_id, payload["data"], delivered_at)
```

### Why Order Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Network Delays" icon="network-wired">
    Events sent at different times may experience different network latencies, causing them to arrive out of sequence.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Retry Timing" icon="rotate">
    If an older event fails initially and is retried later, it might arrive after newer events that succeeded on first attempt.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Concurrent Delivery" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Smartcar delivers events concurrently for performance. Events sent milliseconds apart might arrive in reverse order.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Timestamp-Based Updates

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  def update_signal_value(vehicle_id, signal_path, value, timestamp):
      """Update signal only if timestamp is newer"""
      with db.transaction():
          current = db.query(
              "SELECT value, updated_at FROM signals WHERE vehicle_id = %s AND path = %s",
              (vehicle_id, signal_path)
          )
          
          if current and current['updated_at'] >= timestamp:
              # Existing value is newer or same age
              return False
          
          # Update with newer value
          db.execute(
              "INSERT INTO signals (vehicle_id, path, value, updated_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s) ON CONFLICT (vehicle_id, path) DO UPDATE SET value = EXCLUDED.value, updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at WHERE signals.updated_at < EXCLUDED.updated_at",
              (vehicle_id, signal_path, value, timestamp)
          )
          return True
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
  async function updateSignalValue(vehicleId, signalPath, value, timestamp) {
    // Conditional update: only if timestamp is newer
    const result = await db.query(`
      UPDATE signals 
      SET value = $1, updated_at = $2
      WHERE vehicle_id = $3 
        AND path = $4 
        AND (updated_at < $2 OR updated_at IS NULL)
      RETURNING *
    `, [value, timestamp, vehicleId, signalPath]);
    
    return result.rowCount > 0;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Handle Retries Gracefully

Smartcar automatically retries failed deliveries up to 3 times with exponential backoff.

### Retry Identification

Each delivery attempt receives a unique `deliveryId`, but the `eventId` remains constant:

```json theme={null}
{
  "eventId": "abc-123",         // Same across all retries
  "meta": {
    "deliveryId": "xyz-789",    // Unique per attempt
    "deliveredAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:45Z"
  }
}
```

### Processing Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for duplicate eventId">
    Use idempotency check to skip already-processed events
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process the payload">
    Perform your business logic
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark as processed">
    Store the eventId to prevent reprocessing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Return 200">
    Acknowledge successful processing
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Don't trigger retries manually.** If you return a 2xx status code and then discover an issue, you cannot ask Smartcar to retry. The delivery is considered successful.
</Warning>

***

## Transactional Processing

Ensure database updates and idempotency tracking happen atomically:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js (PostgreSQL) theme={null}
  async function processWebhook(payload) {
    const { eventId } = payload;
    
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');
      
      // Try to insert processed event
      const result = await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO processed_events (event_id, processed_at) 
         VALUES ($1, NOW()) 
         ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING 
         RETURNING event_id`,
        [eventId]
      );
      
      if (result.rowCount === 0) {
        // Already processed
        await client.query('ROLLBACK');
        return;
      }
      
      // Process within same transaction
      await updateVehicleData(client, payload);
      await sendNotifications(client, payload);
      
      await client.query('COMMIT');
    } catch (error) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      throw error;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  }
  ```

  ```python Python (PostgreSQL) theme={null}
  def process_webhook(payload):
      event_id = payload.get("eventId")
      
      with db.transaction():
          # Check and mark as processed in one transaction
          result = db.execute(
              """
              INSERT INTO processed_events (event_id, processed_at)
              VALUES (%s, NOW())
              ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING
              RETURNING event_id
              """,
              (event_id,)
          )
          
          if not result:
              # Already processed in another transaction
              return
          
          # Process within same transaction
          update_vehicle_data(payload)
          send_notifications(payload)
          
          # Both updates committed together
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Recovery Strategies

### Dead Letter Queue

Route persistently failing events to a dead letter queue for manual investigation:

```javascript theme={null}
async function processWebhook(payload) {
  const maxRetries = 3;
  let retryCount = 0;
  
  while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
      await doProcessing(payload);
      return; // Success
    } catch (error) {
      retryCount++;
      if (retryCount >= maxRetries) {
        // Move to DLQ
        await dlq.send({
          payload,
          error: error.message,
          attempts: retryCount
        });
      } else {
        // Wait before retry
        await sleep(Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Circuit Breaker

Stop processing if downstream dependencies are failing:

```python theme={null}
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.is_open = False
        self.last_failure_time = None
    
    def call(self, func, *args):
        if self.is_open:
            # Check if we should try again
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > 60:
                self.is_open = False
                self.failure_count = 0
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker is open")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args)
            self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.is_open = True
            
            raise e

# Usage
breaker = CircuitBreaker()

def process_webhook(payload):
    try:
        breaker.call(update_database, payload)
    except Exception:
        # Return 503 to trigger Smartcar retry later
        return {"error": "Service unavailable"}, 503
```

# Security
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/security

Protect your webhook endpoint from spoofed and malicious requests

Always verify that webhook payloads actually came from Smartcar before processing them.

## Verify Payload Signatures

Every webhook payload includes an `SC-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. **Always verify this signature** before processing the payload.

### How It Works

1. Smartcar creates an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the payload using your Application Management Token as the secret key
2. The hash is sent in the `SC-Signature` header
3. You recreate the hash using the same secret and compare it to the received signature
4. If they match, the payload is authentic

### Implementation

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
  const crypto = require('crypto');

  function verifySignature(payload, signature, managementToken) {
    // Create HMAC hash
    const hmac = crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', managementToken)
      .update(payload)
      .digest('hex');
    
    // Use timingSafeEqual to prevent timing attacks
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(hmac),
      Buffer.from(signature)
    );
  }

  app.post('/webhooks/smartcar', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
    // Get signature from header
    const signature = req.headers['sc-signature'];
    
    // Get raw body
    const rawBody = req.body.toString();
    
    // Verify before processing
    if (!verifySignature(rawBody, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN)) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
    }
    
    // Safe to process
    const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
    processWebhook(payload);
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
  });
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import hmac
  import hashlib

  def verify_signature(payload, signature, management_token):
      """Verify webhook payload authenticity"""
      expected = hmac.new(
          management_token.encode(),
          payload.encode(),
          hashlib.sha256
      ).hexdigest()
      
      # Use compare_digest to prevent timing attacks
      return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)

  @app.post("/webhooks/smartcar")
  def webhook_handler():
      # Get signature from header
      signature = request.headers.get('SC-Signature')
      
      # Get raw body (before JSON parsing)
      raw_body = request.data.decode('utf-8')
      
      # Verify before processing
      if not verify_signature(raw_body, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN):
          return {"error": "Invalid signature"}, 401
      
      # Safe to process
      payload = request.get_json()
      process_webhook(payload)
      return {"status": "received"}, 200
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  import javax.crypto.Mac;
  import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
  import java.security.MessageDigest;

  public class WebhookSecurity {
      
      public static boolean verifySignature(
          String payload, 
          String signature, 
          String managementToken
      ) throws Exception {
          // Create HMAC
          Mac hmac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
          SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(
              managementToken.getBytes(), 
              "HmacSHA256"
          );
          hmac.init(secretKey);
          
          // Generate hash
          byte[] hash = hmac.doFinal(payload.getBytes());
          String expected = bytesToHex(hash);
          
          // Compare securely
          return MessageDigest.isEqual(
              expected.getBytes(),
              signature.getBytes()
          );
      }
      
      private static String bytesToHex(byte[] bytes) {
          StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
          for (byte b : bytes) {
              result.append(String.format("%02x", b));
          }
          return result.toString();
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **Critical:** You must verify the signature against the raw request body, **before** parsing it as JSON. Many frameworks automatically parse JSON, which can alter the body and break signature verification.
</Warning>

## Why Signature Verification Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prevents Spoofed Requests" icon="user-secret">
    Without verification, anyone could send fake webhook payloads to your endpoint. Signature verification proves the payload came from Smartcar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Protects Against Replay Attacks" icon="rotate">
    While signatures don't prevent replays alone, combining them with `eventId` deduplication creates a complete defense.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ensures Data Integrity" icon="shield-halved">
    If the payload is tampered with in transit, the signature won't match, alerting you to the modification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compliance Requirements" icon="building-columns">
    Many security standards and regulations require verification of external data sources.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

***

## Additional Security Measures

### Use HTTPS Only

Smartcar only delivers webhooks to HTTPS endpoints with valid SSL certificates.

<Check>
  **Required:** Your callback URL must use HTTPS with a valid, trusted SSL certificate. Self-signed certificates are not supported.
</Check>

### Restrict Access by IP (Optional)

While Smartcar doesn't publish a fixed IP range (addresses may change), you can add an extra layer of security by:

1. Logging all webhook source IPs
2. Alerting on unusual source addresses
3. Rate limiting by IP to prevent abuse

<Note>
  **Don't rely on IP filtering alone.** Signature verification is the primary security mechanism. IP-based restrictions should be supplementary.
</Note>

### Rotate Management Tokens Periodically

Your Application Management Token is used to verify webhook signatures. Rotate it periodically for security:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate new token">
    Create a new Application Management Token in the Dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update your code">
    Deploy code that accepts either the old or new token temporarily
  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch to new token">
    Once deployed, switch Dashboard to use the new token
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove old token">
    After confirming all webhooks use the new token, remove old token support
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Monitor Failed Verifications

Track and alert on signature verification failures:

```python theme={null}
@app.post("/webhooks/smartcar")
def webhook_handler():
    signature = request.headers.get('SC-Signature')
    raw_body = request.data.decode('utf-8')
    
    if not verify_signature(raw_body, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN):
        # Log the failure
        logger.warning(
            "Invalid webhook signature",
            extra={
                "source_ip": request.remote_addr,
                "signature": signature,
                "payload_size": len(raw_body)
            }
        )
        
        # Alert if threshold exceeded
        if recent_failures_count() > 10:
            send_security_alert("High rate of invalid webhook signatures")
        
        return {"error": "Invalid signature"}, 401
```

***

## Using SDK Helpers

Smartcar's SDKs provide built-in methods for signature verification:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js SDK theme={null}
  const smartcar = require('smartcar');

  // Verify signature
  const isValid = smartcar.verifyPayload(
    managementToken,
    signature,
    rawBody
  );
  ```

  ```python Python SDK theme={null}
  import smartcar

  # Verify signature
  is_valid = smartcar.verify_payload(
      management_token,
      signature,
      raw_body
  )
  ```

  ```java Java SDK theme={null}
  import com.smartcar.sdk.Smartcar;

  // Verify signature
  boolean isValid = Smartcar.verifyPayload(
      managementToken,
      signature,
      rawBody
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Testing
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/testing

Test your webhook integration before going to production

Thoroughly test your webhook integration to catch issues before they affect users.

## Test in Development

Use the Smartcar Dashboard to trigger test webhook deliveries.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up local tunnel">
    Use ngrok or similar to expose your local server:

    ```bash theme={null}
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    This creates a public HTTPS URL that forwards to your local development server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure webhook">
    In the Smartcar Dashboard, set your ngrok URL as the callback URI (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/smartcar`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify webhook">
    Complete the VERIFY challenge to activate the webhook
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger test events">
    Use the Dashboard to send test `VEHICLE_STATE` and `VEHICLE_ERROR` events to your endpoint
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify handling">
    Check logs to confirm:

    * Signature verification works
    * Payload is queued successfully
    * Processing logic executes correctly
    * Idempotency prevents duplicates
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Callback URI Verification
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification

Verify your webhook endpoint can receive deliveries

<Info>
  **This page covers initial endpoint verification.** For verifying webhook payload signatures from vehicles, see [Payload Verification](/integrations/webhooks/payload-verification).
</Info>

When you create a webhook or update a callback URI in the Smartcar Dashboard, Smartcar sends a one-time `VERIFY` event to confirm your endpoint is ready. Your endpoint must respond correctly before Smartcar will deliver any vehicle data.

## The VERIFY Event

Smartcar sends a challenge request to your callback URI in this format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Version 4.0 (NEW) theme={null}
  {
    "eventId": "52f6e0bb-1369-45da-a61c-9e67d092d6db",
    "eventType": "VERIFY",
    "data": {
      "challenge": "<random-string>"
    },
    "meta": {
      "version": "4.0",
      "webhookId": "5a8e5e38-1e12-4011-a36d-56f120053f9e",
      "webhookName": "Example Webhook",
      "deliveryId": "5d569643-3a47-4cd1-a3ec-db5fc1f6f03b",
      "deliveredAt": "2025-07-31T19:38:42.332Z"
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json Version 2.0 theme={null}
  {
    "version": "2.0",
    "webhookId": "<uuid>",
    "eventName": "verify",
    "payload": { 
      "challenge": "<random-string>" 
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Required Response

Your endpoint must respond with:

1. **Status code**: `200 OK`
2. **Content-Type header**: `application/json`
3. **Response body**: A JSON object containing the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the challenge

### Generate the HMAC

Create an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the `challenge` string using your **Application Management Token** as the secret key:

<Tip>
  Our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks) have helper methods to generate the HMAC.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Node theme={null}
      let hmac = smartcar.hashChallenge(
          application_management_token, 
          payload.challenge
      ); 
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
      hmac = smartcar.hash_challenge(
              application_management_token, 
              payload.challenge
          )
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  String hmac =  Smartcar.hashChallenge(
              application_management_token, 
              payload.challenge
          );
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby theme={null}
      hmac = Smartcar.hash_challenge(
          application_management_token, 
          payload.challenge
      )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Return the Response

Return the hex-encoded hash in your response body with the key `challenge`:

```json Response Body theme={null}
{
  "challenge": "{HMAC-hex-string}"
}
```

<Warning>
  If your endpoint fails to respond correctly within 15 seconds, Smartcar will not activate the webhook. You can retry verification from the Dashboard at any time.
</Warning>

***

## Verify webhook challenges inside the Dashboard

Use the Smartcar Dashboard to understand exactly what Smartcar expects before you enable webhooks in production. The **Verify webhook** modal shows a sample challenge string plus language-specific snippets so you can implement the same HMAC signature in your code.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement the signature in your handler">
    Copy the challenge string from the modal and use the embedded snippets (Python, Node, Java, or Ruby) as references while you code the signature logic on your server. Run your handler locally or in staging so it is ready to answer Smartcar’s challenge.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Smartcar’s verification call">
    Once your server is ready, click **Verify this webhook**. Smartcar sends the challenge payload to your callback URL, and your code responds with the signature it just produced.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare expected vs actual responses">
    The Response tab displays the HTTP status, the challenge Smartcar sent, the signature Smartcar expected, and the body your server returned. Use this side-by-side view to confirm success or adjust your implementation before retrying.

# Creating Webhooks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/creating-webhooks

Step-by-step guide to creating and configuring webhook integrations in the Smartcar Dashboard

Head over to the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/integrations) to set up your webhook integration. There are four main steps to create a webhook in Smartcar:

<Frame type="simple">
  <img alt="Application Configuration in Smartcar Dashboard" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an Integration Type">
    From the integrations page, start by creating a new integration and choosing webhook. For most use cases, webhooks are the recommended option.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Trigger">
    Define **when** Smartcar should send you a webhook. This is the vehicle event or condition that causes data to be delivered.

    **Example triggers:**

    * Vehicle's battery percentage changes
    * Vehicle is plugged in or unplugged
    * Odometer changes
    * Doors or windows open
    * Vehicle location changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Data (Signals)">
    After choosing a trigger, specify **what** vehicle data ("signals") should be included in the webhook payload. Browse the complete [Vehicle Signals catalog](/api-reference/signals/schema) to see all available data points.

    <Note>
      **All selected signals are delivered in every webhook event**, not just the signals that triggered it. This ensures you always receive complete vehicle state data.
    </Note>

    Your selection directly maps to the permissions that the vehicle owner granted your application during the connection process. Smartcar offers over 20 specific [permissions](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/permissions) for granular control.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide a Callback URI & Verify Your Webhook">
    Enter the destination URL where Smartcar should send the data. This should be your application's endpoint to receive webhook payloads.

    Your callback URI must handle the `"eventType": "VERIFY"` received in the request payload and respond with a `200` status code and a `{"challenge": "{HMAC}"}` body.

    <Info>
      **Optional: Separate Error Callback URI**

      You can optionally configure a separate callback URI specifically for `VEHICLE_ERROR` events. If not specified, all events (`VEHICLE_STATE` and `VEHICLE_ERROR`) will be sent to the same callback URI.

# Webhooks Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/overview

Receive real-time vehicle data automatically with Smartcar's event-based webhooks

Smartcar's webhooks provide a scalable, event-driven way to receive vehicle data in real-time. Instead of polling the API, your application receives automatic updates when vehicle state changes—reducing latency, server load, and API costs.

<Info>
  Webhooks are the recommended way to receive real-time vehicle data from Smartcar. You can still use the REST API for retrieving data and issuing commands, but webhooks are the most scalable and reliable option for most use cases.
</Info>

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Configure triggers** - Define which vehicle events should send you data (e.g., battery percentage changes, location changes, etc.)
2. **Select signals** - Choose what data points to include in webhook payloads (see [available signals](/api-reference/signals/schema))
3. **Receive events** - Smartcar automatically sends HTTP POST requests to your endpoint when conditions are met
4. **Process data** - Your application handles incoming webhook deliveries and updates your system

## Webhook Components

Understanding Smartcar's webhook system involves three main areas:

### 1. Setup & Configuration

* [Creating Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/creating-webhooks) - Configure webhooks in the Smartcar Dashboard
* [Callback Verification](/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification) - Verify your endpoint URL
* [Receiving Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/receiving-webhooks) - Build your webhook receiver

### 2. Security & Validation

* [Payload Verification](/integrations/webhooks/payload-verification) - Validate webhook signatures
* [Best Practices](/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/overview) - Secure your integration

### 3. Technical Reference

* [Event Reference](/api-reference/webhooks/events/overview) - Complete event and payload documentation
* [Delivery Behavior](/api-reference/webhooks/delivery-behavior) - Retry policies, ordering, and guarantees

# Payload Verification
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/payload-verification

Verify webhook payloads are authentic using signature verification

<Info>
  **This page covers verifying ongoing webhook payloads.** For initial endpoint verification when creating a webhook, see [Callback URI Verification](/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification).
</Info>

Always verify that webhook payloads actually came from Smartcar before processing them. Every webhook includes an `SC-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the payload.

## Why Verification Matters

Without signature verification:

* Anyone could send fake webhook payloads to your endpoint
* Malicious actors could inject false vehicle data
* You have no guarantee the payload came from Smartcar

Signature verification ensures:

* The payload was sent by Smartcar
* The payload wasn't tampered with in transit
* You can safely process the data

***

## How Signature Verification Works

1. Smartcar creates an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the raw request body using your **Application Management Token** as the secret key
2. The hash is sent in the `SC-Signature` header
3. You recreate the hash using the same secret and compare it to the received signature
4. If they match, the payload is authentic and unmodified

***

## Quick Implementation

Use our SDKs for automatic signature verification:

<Tip>
  Our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks) have helper methods that return `true` if the payload is valid.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Node.js theme={null}
  smartcar.verifyPayload(
      application_management_token,
      sc_signature_header, 
      raw_webhook_body
  );
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  Smartcar.verify_payload(
      application_management_token,
      sc_signature_header, 
      raw_webhook_body
  )
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  Smartcar.verifyPayload(
      application_management_token,
      sc_signature_header, 
      raw_webhook_body
  );
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby theme={null}
  Smartcar.verify_payload(
      application_management_token,
      sc_signature_header, 
      raw_webhook_body
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Manual Implementation

If you're not using an SDK, implement signature verification manually:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
  const crypto = require('crypto');

  function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, managementToken) {
    // Create HMAC hash of the raw body
    const hmac = crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', managementToken)
      .update(payload)
      .digest('hex');
    
    // Securely compare (prevents timing attacks)
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(hmac),
      Buffer.from(signature)
    );
  }

  // Important: Use raw body parser
  app.post('/webhooks/smartcar', 
    express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), 
    (req, res) => {
      // Get the signature from headers
      const signature = req.headers['sc-signature'];
      
      // Get the raw body
      const rawBody = req.body.toString();
      
      // Verify signature
      if (!verifyWebhookSignature(rawBody, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN)) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
      }
      
      // Now safe to process
      const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
      processWebhook(payload);
      res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
    }
  );
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import hmac
  import hashlib

  def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, management_token):
      """Verify the SC-Signature header matches the payload"""
      # Create HMAC hash of the raw body
      expected = hmac.new(
          management_token.encode(),
          payload.encode(),
          hashlib.sha256
      ).hexdigest()
      
      # Securely compare (prevents timing attacks)
      return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)

  @app.post('/webhooks/smartcar')
  def webhook_handler():
      # Get the signature from headers
      signature = request.headers.get('SC-Signature')
      
      # Get the raw body (BEFORE parsing as JSON)
      raw_body = request.data.decode('utf-8')
      
      # Verify signature
      if not verify_webhook_signature(raw_body, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN):
          return {"error": "Invalid signature"}, 401
      
      # Now safe to process
      payload = request.get_json()
      process_webhook(payload)
      return {"status": "received"}, 200
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  import javax.crypto.Mac;
  import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
  import java.security.MessageDigest;

  public class WebhookVerification {
      
      public static boolean verifySignature(
          String payload, 
          String signature, 
          String managementToken
      ) throws Exception {
          // Create HMAC-SHA256
          Mac hmac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
          SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(
              managementToken.getBytes(), 
              "HmacSHA256"
          );
          hmac.init(secretKey);
          
          // Generate hash
          byte[] hash = hmac.doFinal(payload.getBytes());
          String expected = bytesToHex(hash);
          
          // Securely compare
          return MessageDigest.isEqual(
              expected.getBytes(),
              signature.getBytes()
          );
      }
      
      private static String bytesToHex(byte[] bytes) {
          StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
          for (byte b : bytes) {
              result.append(String.format("%02x", b));
          }
          return result.toString();
      }
  }

  @PostMapping("/webhooks/smartcar")
  public ResponseEntity<?> handleWebhook(
      @RequestBody String rawBody,
      @RequestHeader("SC-Signature") String signature
  ) {
      // Verify signature
      if (!WebhookVerification.verifySignature(rawBody, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN)) {
          return ResponseEntity.status(401).body(Map.of("error", "Invalid signature"));
      }
      
      // Now safe to process
      processWebhook(rawBody);
      return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("status", "received"));
  }
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby theme={null}
  require 'openssl'

  def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, management_token)
    # Create HMAC hash of the raw body
    expected = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
      'SHA256',
      management_token,
      payload
    )
    
    # Securely compare
    Rack::Utils.secure_compare(expected, signature)
  end

  post '/webhooks/smartcar' do
    # Get the signature from headers
    signature = request.env['HTTP_SC_SIGNATURE']
    
    # Get the raw body
    raw_body = request.body.read
    
    # Verify signature
    unless verify_webhook_signature(raw_body, signature, MANAGEMENT_TOKEN)
      halt 401, { error: 'Invalid signature' }.to_json
    end
    
    # Now safe to process
    payload = JSON.parse(raw_body)
    process_webhook(payload)
    
    status 200
    { status: 'received' }.to_json
  end
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **Critical:** You must verify the signature against the **raw request body** before parsing it as JSON. Many frameworks automatically parse JSON, which can alter the body and break signature verification.
</Warning>

# Receiving Webhooks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/receiving-webhooks

Set up an endpoint to receive and parse webhook payloads from Smartcar

Learn how to build a basic webhook endpoint that receives, parses, and acknowledges Smartcar webhook deliveries.

<Tip>
  **Want to skip the manual setup?**

  Deploy a production-ready webhook receiver to AWS in minutes with our [Webhook Receiver Recipe](/getting-started/tutorials/webhook-receiver-recipe). It includes complete serverless infrastructure (Lambda + API Gateway + SQS), built-in signature verification, automatic error handling, and TypeScript type safety.

  **Perfect for:** New implementations, AWS environments, or teams wanting to deploy quickly without infrastructure overhead.
</Tip>

## Basic Requirements

Your webhook endpoint must meet these requirements:

* **Accept POST requests** - Smartcar sends all webhooks as HTTP POST requests
* **Return 2xx status code** - Any status code from 200-299 acknowledges successful receipt
* **Use HTTPS** - Your endpoint must use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
* **Respond within 15 seconds** - Return a status code before the timeout window
* **Publicly accessible** - Your endpoint must be accessible from the public internet

***

## Quick Start Examples

Here are minimal webhook receivers that handle the required `VERIFY` event and acknowledge all other events:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js (Express) theme={null}
  const express = require('express');
  const smartcar = require('smartcar');
  const app = express();

  app.use(express.json());

  app.post('/webhooks/smartcar', (req, res) => {
    const { eventType, data } = req.body;
    
    // Handle VERIFY event (required)
    if (eventType === 'VERIFY') {
      const hmac = smartcar.hashChallenge(
        process.env.SMARTCAR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN,
        data.challenge
      );
      return res.status(200).json({ challenge: hmac });
    }
    
    // Log other events
    console.log('Received webhook:', eventType);
    
    // Acknowledge receipt
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
    
    // Process asynchronously (recommended)
    // processWebhook(req.body);
  });

  app.listen(3000);
  ```

  ```python Python (Flask) theme={null}
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
  import smartcar
  import os

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.post('/webhooks/smartcar')
  def webhook_handler():
      payload = request.get_json()
      event_type = payload.get('eventType')
      
      # Handle VERIFY event (required)
      if event_type == 'VERIFY':
          hmac = smartcar.hash_challenge(
              os.environ['SMARTCAR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN'],
              payload['data']['challenge']
          )
          return jsonify({"challenge": hmac}), 200
      
      # Log other events
      print(f"Received webhook: {event_type}")
      
      # Acknowledge receipt
      return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200
      
      # Process asynchronously (recommended)
      # process_webhook(payload)

          // Process asynchronously (recommended)
          // processWebhook(payload);
      }
  }
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby (Sinatra) theme={null}
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'smartcar'
  require 'json'

  post '/webhooks/smartcar' do
    payload = JSON.parse(request.body.read)
    event_type = payload['eventType']
    
    # Handle VERIFY event (required)
    if event_type == 'VERIFY'
      hmac = Smartcar.hash_challenge(
        ENV['SMARTCAR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN'],

    { status: 'received' }.to_json
    
    # Process asynchronously (recommended)
    # process_webhook(payload)
  end
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **VERIFY event required** - Your endpoint must successfully respond to the `VERIFY` event before Smartcar delivers any vehicle data. See [Callback Verification](/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Best practice:** Return 200 immediately and process the webhook asynchronously. See [Architecture Best Practices](/integrations/webhooks/best-practices/architecture) for the queue-based pattern.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Any 2xx works:** You can return 200, 201, 202, 204, or any other 2xx status code. Smartcar treats all 2xx responses as successful delivery.
</Info>

***

## What Happens After Verification

After your endpoint successfully responds to the `VERIFY` event, Smartcar will begin delivering `VEHICLE_STATE` and `VEHICLE_ERROR` events for [subscribed vehicles](/integrations/webhooks/subscribing-vehicles).

<Info>
  **Understanding payloads:** For detailed payload structure, field definitions, and event-specific schemas, see the [Event Reference Overview](/api-reference/webhooks/events/overview).
</Info>

## Next Steps

<Warning>
  **Complete the VERIFY challenge first** - Your endpoint must successfully respond to the `VERIFY` event before Smartcar delivers any vehicle data. See [Handling the VERIFY Event](#handling-the-verify-event) above.

# Subscribing Vehicles
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/subscribing-vehicles

Learn how to subscribe and unsubscribe vehicles to webhooks using auto-enrollment, the Dashboard, or the API

Once you've [created a webhook](/integrations/webhooks/creating-webhooks), you need to subscribe vehicles to it before they'll start receiving data. Smartcar offers three methods to manage vehicle subscriptions: automatic enrollment, Dashboard management, and programmatic API control.

<Info>
  Data will only be sent after your webhook has been verified. See [Callback Verification](/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification) for details.
</Info>

***

## Subscription Methods

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Auto-Enrollment" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/integrations/webhooks/subscribing-vehicles#method-1%3A-auto-enrollment-recommended">
    Automatic subscription for all connected vehicles
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dashboard" icon="browser" href="/integrations/webhooks/subscribing-vehicles#method-2%3A-dashboard-management">
    Manual subscription through the Smartcar Dashboard
  </Card>

  <Card title="API" icon="code" href="/integrations/webhooks/subscribing-vehicles#method-3%3A-api-subscription">
    Programmatic subscription via REST API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

***

## Method 1: Auto-Enrollment (Recommended for Production)

The simplest way to manage subscriptions is to enable auto-enrollment when creating your webhook. This automatically subscribes all vehicles connected to your application.

<Warning>
  **All vehicles will be subscribed immediately.** When you enable auto-enrollment, all currently connected vehicles will be subscribed to the webhook right away. Only enable this feature when you're ready to receive data for all vehicles in your application.
</Warning>

### How It Works

When auto-enrollment is enabled:

* **Existing vehicles** are immediately subscribed to the webhook
* **New connections** are automatically subscribed when users connect vehicles
* **No manual management** required for individual vehicles

### Enable Auto-Enrollment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dashboard">
    Go to the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/integrations) and create or edit a webhook
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Auto-Subscribe">
    Check the "Automatically subscribe all vehicles" option during webhook creation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Complete webhook creation - all vehicles will be subscribed automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Best for:** Production deployments where all connected vehicles should receive webhook data
</Check>

***

## Method 2: Dashboard Management

For selective subscription, you can manually subscribe individual vehicles through the Dashboard.

### Subscribe via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Vehicle List">
    Navigate to [Vehicles](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/vehicles) in the Dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Vehicle">
    Click on the vehicle you want to subscribe
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage Subscriptions">
    In the vehicle details, find the "Webhook Subscriptions" section

    <Frame type="simple">
      <img alt="Webhook Subscription in Smartcar Dashboard" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add or Remove">
    Click "Subscribe" to add the vehicle to a webhook, or "Unsubscribe" to remove it
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Best for:** Testing and development, selective vehicle management, or gradual rollouts
</Check>

## Method 3: API Subscription

For programmatic control, use the subscribe and unsubscribe API endpoints.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple subscription methods together?">
    Yes! You can enable auto-enrollment for most vehicles and use the API or Dashboard for exceptions. However, be aware that auto-enrollment will automatically subscribe new vehicles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I unsubscribe a vehicle?">
    The vehicle immediately stops receiving webhook deliveries. You can re-subscribe at any time, and a new first payload will be sent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which vehicles are subscribed?">
    You can view all vehicle subscriptions in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/vehicles) or use the [Management API](/api-reference/management/get-vehicle-connections) to programmatically list subscriptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many vehicles I can subscribe?">
    No, you can subscribe as many vehicles as are connected to your application. Webhooks scale automatically to handle your fleet size.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need different webhooks for different vehicle types?">
    Not necessarily. You can use one webhook for all vehicles and handle signal availability differences using the `VEHICLE_ERROR` events for unsupported signals.
