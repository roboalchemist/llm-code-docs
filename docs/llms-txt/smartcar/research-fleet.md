# Join the Research Fleet

Smartcar is the easiest way to integrate apps with cars, funded by [a16z](https://a16z.com/), [NEA](https://www.nea.com/) and [Energize Capital](https://www.energizecap.com/).\
We enable companies like [Uber](https://smartcar.com/blog/uber), [Lyft](https://smartcar.com/blog/lyft), [Emulate](https://smartcar.com/blog/emulate), [Bluewave](https://smartcar.com/blog/bluwave-ai), [Neowatt](https://smartcar.com/blog/revenue-for-energy-retailers), and [more](https://smartcar.com/customers) to monitor a car's battery state of charge, verify mileage, manage EV charging, and much more.

We are always expanding to new makes and models of cars and we'd love your help!

## What are we asking for?

Building and maintaining our APIs is a complex endeavor. Smartcar operates a research fleet of vehicles across brands, models, and geographies to ensure we can provide the best product possible. **This is where you come in**. We'd like your help with understanding real-world vehicle behaviors with your car and improve the quality of our platform. Understanding things like:

* Does your car’s odometer update in real-time?
* What's the amount of fuel/battery your car has remaining?
* What data and remote actions are available for your specific car's brand, model, year?

## Perks of being part of the Research Fleet

* 💰 You will receive \$250 for the 6 months that your car is part of the fleet
* 🧥 Smartcar swag
* 🙋 Assistance setting up your car's connected services
