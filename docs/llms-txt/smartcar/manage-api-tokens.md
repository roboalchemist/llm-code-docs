# How to Manage API Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens

> Best practices for securely storing, refreshing, and rotating Smartcar API tokens.

This guide explains how to store, refresh, and rotate tokens using the Smartcar API.

<Info>
  <b>API Access Token vs. Application Management Token</b><br />

  <ul>
    <li><b>API Access Token:</b> Used to access vehicle data and issue commands on behalf of a vehicle owner. These tokens are obtained through the OAuth flow after a user connects their vehicle and are required for all Smartcar API requests involving vehicle data.</li>
    <li><b>Application Management Token:</b> Used to manage your Smartcar application itself (e.g., configuring webhooks or managing your vehicles). This token is found in the Smartcar Dashboard and is <b>not</b> used for accessing vehicle data or making API requests on behalf of users.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Always use the correct token type for your use case:</b> API access tokens for vehicle data, and management tokens for application configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Store Tokens Securely">
    * Store both the `access_token` and `refresh_token` in your backend database, never in client-side code.
    * Encrypt tokens at rest and restrict access to only necessary backend services.
    * Associate tokens with the correct user and vehicle for easy lookup and management.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Access Token for API Requests">
    * Use the `access_token` as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all API requests.

    ```javascript  theme={null}
    GET https://vehicle.api.smartcar.com/v3/vehicles/{vehicleId}
    Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

    * If the access token is valid, the API will return the requested data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect Expired Access Tokens">
    * If an API request returns a 401 Unauthorized error, the access token may have expired.
    * In this case, use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refresh the Access Token">
    * Make a POST request to the Smartcar OAuth token endpoint with `grant_type=refresh_token`.

    ```javascript  theme={null}
    POST https://auth.smartcar.com/oauth/token?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    ```

    * Store the new `access_token` and `refresh_token` in your database, replacing the old values.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rotate and Revoke Tokens">
    * Always update both tokens after a refresh to maintain security.
  </Step>
</Steps>
