## Roles

### Owner

Owners have full control and access to the team. They're able to add and remove members, create and modify applications, edit billing information and more.

A team **can** have multiple Owners, but **must** have at least one.

### Admin

Admins have similar access to Owners but can't edit or view billing information.

### Editor

Editors have similar access to Admins but are limited to specific applications. They're unable to manage team members, view the team's billing information, create applications, or delete applications they're allowed to access.

### Viewer

Viewers have similar permissions to Editors but only have read-only access to applications they've been invited to.
