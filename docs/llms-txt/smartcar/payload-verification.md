# Payload Verification

> Verify webhook payloads from vehicles to ensure data integrity and security.

<Info>
  This page covers verification of payloads from vehicles.
  Please see our [callback verification](/integrations/webhooks/callback-verification) section for
  information on how to initially verify your callback uri.
</Info>

Verify webhook payloads against the `SC-Signature` header and a `SHA-256` based `HMAC` generated by hashing
your `application_management_token` and the body.

<Tip>
  Our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks) have helper methods that return `true` if the payload is good.
