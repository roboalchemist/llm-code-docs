> Understand Smartcar's approach to features in beta.

Beta is an option that allows developers to test and integrate new Smartcar features before they are fully released. Beta refers to a phase where certain features are made available for testing and feedback prior to general availability. These features are functional but may still be under development or refinement.

## Benefits of Beta Features

Participating in beta allows developers to get a head start on integrating new features, a chance to influence the feature in development through feedback and help Smartcar ensure your app’s needs are met.

## Considerations for features in Beta

When working with beta features, keep in mind that features may change before final release. As such, extra caution is advised when using these features in production environments.

## How to Participate

If you would like to get involved in testing a beta features, contact your Account Manager or our Support team at [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) for guidance.
