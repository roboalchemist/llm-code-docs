### Managed packages

Managed packages are **enabled** by default.

This setting allows you to control whether your organization's users can create and use managed packages.
By disabling this feature and [no-code simulations]({{< ref "#no-code-simulations" >}}), you enforce the exclusive use of [private packages]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/private-packages" >}}) for all load tests.

When disabled, users in your organization are prevented from:

* creating, uploading or updating packages from the **Sources** view,
* creating new simulations with a managed package,
* launching any pre-existing simulation that is configured with a managed package.

Note: Any managed packages that were created before this feature was disabled remain visible in the **Sources** view. Users can delete these if necessary.

### Managed locations

Managed locations are **enabled** by default.

This setting allows you to control whether your users can deploy load tests to Gatling-managed locations, including locations using a dedicated IP.
By disabling this feature, you enforce the exclusive use of [private locations]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/introduction" >}}) for all load tests.

When disabled, users in your organization are prevented from:

* creating new simulations with a managed location, or a location with a dedicated IP,
* launching any pre-existing simulation configured with at least one managed/dedicated IP location.

### No-code simulations

No-code simulations are **enabled** by default.

This setting allows you to control whether your users can deploy load tests using [no-code simulations]({{< ref "reference/run-tests/simulations/no-code" >}}).
By disabling this feature and [managed packages]({{< ref "#managed-packages" >}}), you enforce the exclusive use of [private packages]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/private-packages" >}}) for all load tests.

When disabled, users in your organization are prevented from:

* creating new simulations with a no-code configuration,
* launching any pre-existing simulation configured no-code.

### Public links

Public links are **enabled** by default.

This setting allows you to control whether your users can create [public links]({{< ref "reference/stats/reports/cloud#shareable-links" >}}).

When disabled, users in your organization are prevented from:

* sharing public links to run reports,
* and existing public links are invalidated.

### Custom build command

Custom build commands are **disabled** by default.

This setting allows you to control whether your users can create a [simulation from a git repository]({{< ref "reference/run-tests/simulations/git-repository" >}}) using a [custom build command]({{< ref "reference/run-tests/simulations/git-repository#custom-build-command" >}}).

When enabled, users in your organization are allowed to:

* configure a custom build command on simulations that clone a git repository
