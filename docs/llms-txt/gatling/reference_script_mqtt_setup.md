## License and limitations {#license}

**The Gatling MQTT component is distributed under the
[Gatling Enterprise Component License]({{< ref "/project/licenses/enterprise-component" >}}).**

The Gatling MQTT protocol can be used with both the [Community Edition](https://gatling.io/products) and
[Enterprise](https://gatling.io/products) versions of Gatling.

Its usage is unlimited when running tests on [Gatling Enterprise](https://gatling.io/products). When used with
[Gatling Community Edition](https://gatling.io/products), usage is limited to:

- 5 users maximum
- 5 minute duration tests

Limits after which the test will stop. This means that all locally executed tests using the MQTT protocol are limited by these values.
