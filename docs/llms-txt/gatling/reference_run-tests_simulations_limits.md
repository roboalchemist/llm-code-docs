## Package limits

Uploading a package will fail if the following limits are violated.

| Description                   | Limit   |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| Maximum size                  | 5 GB    |
| Maximum number of zip entries | 100,000 |

## Metrics limits

The number of different metrics is limited:
* to not saturate our platform
* because metrics only make sense if they aggregate lots of events. Unique events are useless in a load test.

| Description                  | Limit | Overflow consequence |
|------------------------------|-------|----------------------|
| Unique scenario names        | 100   | Test crash           |
| Unique group names           | 500   | Test crash           |
| Unique request names         | 2000  | Test crash           |
| Unique error messages        | 2000  | Test crash           |
| Unique hostnames             | 1000  | Test crash           |
| Unique remote addresses      | 1000  | Test crash           |
| Maximum error message length | 5000  | Truncation           |

## Important timeouts

Please be aware that some timeouts are applied the different phases of your tests.
