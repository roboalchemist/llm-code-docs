## Extra credits

{{< alert warning >}}
This section is only available for payments made by Stripe.

When you approach the  credit limits of your plan:

And you don't want to wait the next filling of credit, you can activate extra credits by clicking button **Edit spending limit**

{{< img src="credit_edit_limit.png" alt="Edit extra credits limit" >}}

And set new extra credit limit.
