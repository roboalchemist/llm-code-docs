## Introduction

Gatling Enterprise Edition has many reporting features that make analyzing a single load test or a time series of tests faster and easier. Our reporting is designed for collaboration across your organization. The following guide gives you an overview of each reporting feature and how to use it to improve your testing. 

## Community Edition vs. Enterprise Edition reporting

Gatling Community Edition reports while powerful and a great start are stored in separate HTML files. For Gatling Enterprise Edition one of the first and most important changes is how reports are kept. In order to compare two reports with Gatling Community Edition you need to open two reports separately and compare the results manually. However, with Gatling Enterprise Edition you can directly and quickly compare any two reports with the click of a button.

### Run trends and comparison

When you upload a script to Gatling Enterprise Edition and set up a simulation it is saved for you in your simulation dashboard. Part of a great load testing strategy is to run the same set of simulations time after time as you make changes and your application evolves to make sure itâs still reacting well to the traffic youâre expecting. By using Gatling Enterprise Edition's Run History you can get a quick snapshot of how your changes have affected your application or do a more detailed dive into the difference in response times and error rates in each request in your simulation.

#### Comparing runs

Once you enter your Run History for a simulation youâll be able to see and access each report for each run.

{{< img src="run-table-trends.png" alt="Run history table showing past simulation runs with trend graphs" >}}

On the Run History page for a simulation, you also get access to 3 Trends graphs that give you a quick snapshot of the Requests and Responses, Response Time Percentiles, and Throughput over the history of a test youâve run.

This allows you a simple way to see the results of your changes, especially if youâre using Gatling Enterprise Edition in your CI/CD process.

If youâd like to make a comparison between runs click the âCompareâ button, which launches the multiple run, interactive comparison mode. 

{{< img src="run-compare.png" alt="Interactive side-by-side comparison of two simulation runs" >}}

#### How is this helpful?

You can view your application's general performance over a long period of time easily or do a quick comparison to see if any changes youâve made between runs have caused any improvements or regression in terms of performance. Thatâs a quick overview of our Run History and Trends for Gatling Enterprise Edition.

Letâs get into the full reports now.

## Gatling Enterprise Edition's reports in detail

### Filtering, sharing, and collaboration

As mentioned before Gatling Community Edition reports are static html files that canât be changed or modified. Gatling Enterprise Edition reports are designed for collaboration.

To start with you have your run bar:

{{< img src="run-bar-gatling.webp" alt="Gatling Enterprise Edition run bar for filtering and sharing simulation results" >}}

You can use the run bar to focus on specific sections of your simulation results. You can also collaborate with teammates by creating and sharing a public link, exporting to a PDF, or having Gatling Users in your organization leave comments on specific sections of a report.

### How is this helpful?

This allows you to work with a full set of team members collaboratively on your load testing and also to get specific about which areas of your simulation youâd like to highlight.

## All about the report tabs

Weâre now going to dive into the tabs of a report and give you a little more information about each one, what they do, and how it can be helpful for you.

### The Requests tab

The requests tab in Gatling Enterprise Edition allows you to see the response times and error ratios for each individual request. In the default view you also can get global overviews of your errors per second, responses per second (with status), response time distributions, and response time percentile distributions:

{{< img src="requests-tab-gatling.webp" alt="Requests tab showing response times and error ratios for each individual request" >}}

If youâd like a closer look at individual requests you can switch from the chart view to the summary view to get a look at the response times and error ratios for individual requests.

### How is this helpful?

That should be pretty obvious. This is where you can see the performance of your application based on the scenario youâve created. You can look at your overall performance to see where you might be experiencing issues or drill into individual requests to see what might be causing a bottleneck in terms of performance.

### The Groups Tab

When designing a scenario, you can create a group of requests to organize and model processes on a page. You can even nest your groups to get a little more organized.  Hereâs a look at how to create a group in your scenario using our Java SDK:

```java 
group("foo").on(
 exec(http("name").get("/"))
);
```

So, if youâve created any groups in your scenario the Groups tab will give you the same information as the Requests tab but the results will be based on the groups of requests youâve designated rather than individual requests.

{{< img src="groups-tab-gatling.webp" alt="Groups tab showing response times and error ratios for request groups" >}}

As with the requests tab you can switch to a summary view as well to view response times and error ratios based on the group.

### How is this helpful?
The groups tab helps you organize your requests and lets you see if specific processes will experience any issues under load when running your tests.

### The Users tab

Load testing is all about seeing how your application reacts to traffic or simulated users. The âUsersâ tab lets you see how many users you have arriving, leaving (terminating), and at a given time (concurrently) in your simulation.

{{< img src="users-tab-gatling.webp" alt="Users tab showing arriving, concurrent, and terminating users over time" >}}

### How is this helpful?

On its own, itâs a great way to visualize the users arriving in your test. In terms of testing though you can use it in conjunction with your requests page and the run bar to see what number of users is starting to cause problems in your application. By right-clicking anywhere on a chart you can add a marker that will carry across all charts. As an example below I have added a marker on the response time chart when load times start spiking so I can see on the âUsersâ tab how many concurrent users I have when the issues begin.

### The Connections tab

Here, you can find information about the transport layer of your simulation. This tab is full of tons of data including connection open and closing rates, information about the TCP connections, and the TLS handshakes:

- 0 TCP Connections: used as the transport layer of the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols, this metric represents the time it takes for a server to acknowledge new clients so they can start sending data.
- TLS Handshake: if using HTTPS, we also measure the time it takes for the server and client to perform a verification handshake after opening the connection.

{{< img src="connections-tab-gatling.webp" alt="Connections tab showing TCP connection rates and TLS handshake data" >}}

### How is this helpful?

Looking at the connections and their open and closing rates allows you to see if the test is running as expected. Looking at the TLS handshakes can help to see if the encryption process is a bottleneck in the response time of your website or application. TCP connections can help you understand the traffic that is coming to your application and help show you if accepting new clients on your application is working successfully or causing unwanted issues.

### The âDNSâ tab

The DNS tab is incredibly helpful in determining, you guessed it, everything you need to know about the DNS for your website or application. Gatling Enterprise Edition gives you the option of examining the DNS resolutions per second, DNS percentiles, DNS duration distribution, and percentiles for each hostname your website or application is using.

{{< img src="dns-tab-gatling.webp" alt="DNS tab showing resolution rates, percentiles, and duration distributions per hostname" >}}

### How is this helpful?

If youâre using a custom DNS you can use the information in the DNS tab to answer the below questions:

- Is my DNS resolution fast enough?
- Is my first DNS query for my website too slow?
- Do I need DNS servers closer to my customers?
- Are the queries cached properly?

By answering these questions you can correctly configure your DNS in the best way to serve your clients faster and more efficiently.

### The Load Generators tab

In the load generators tab, you can see how much of each load generator you use. Youâll generally notice a spike in the CPU usage at the start of your simulation, this is the JVM warming up. Afterward, youâll see how much load generator power you use to run your simulation.

When creating or editing your simulation on Gatling Enterprise Edition you can go to the âTime Windowâ screen and set a ramp-up and ramp-down time to make your simulation cleaner and more accurate as both your application and Gatlingâs load generators may need some warm-up time.

{{< img src="time-window-gatling.webp" alt="Time window configuration screen for setting ramp-up and ramp-down periods in a simulation" >}}

Once youâve done this you can get a good idea of how many virtual users you can have in your simulation using the load generators youâve selected and reconfigure your script to add more if you choose to.

When discussing Gatling Enterprise Edition the most common question weâre asked is âHow many virtual users can I generate with one load generator?â The answer from our end is âIt depends on the scenario youâre trying to test. The theoretical limit is 35,000 - 40,000 users can be generated with one load generator or 300,000 requests per second. But, it depends on your scenario and the requests and API calls it contains. By using the load generators tab you can determine how much youâre stressing the load generator and get a real expectation of the load youâll be able to generate for your specific scenario.

{{< img src="load-generator-tab-gatling.webp" alt="Load generators tab showing CPU and resource usage per load generator" >}}

### How is this helpful?

The load generators tab can let you know if performance issues in your simulation are a result of your application or whether youâre actually stressing the load generator too much with the load youâre trying to generate. You can also see how much load generator power youâre using and decide to add more users or load generators if necessary. This can help you choose your Gatling Enterprise Edition subscription based on how many load generators youâll need and how many credits youâll use in your testing as well.
