## Introduction

Private Locations facilitate running simulations in your dedicated cloud environment. 
Ensure secure storage of sensitive simulation packages in your private cloud. 

The control plane offers a private repository; enable it for confidential package management!

{{< img src="generic-diagram.png" alt="Infrastructure schema" >}}

## Private packages

A private package is uploaded through the control plane into a private repository.
_Gatling Enterprise Edition only receives the Gatling version associated with the package and the names of simulation classes, which helps in simulation configuration_

When initiating a Gatling run, the control plane generates a temporary signed link to allow the download of the private package from the load generators.

{{< alert info >}}
Private Packages are based on Private Locations. You can not use them with managed locations.
{{< /alert >}}

## Infrastructure

Currently, Private Packages support the following underlying storages:

* AWS S3
* GCP Cloud Storage
* Azure Blob Storage
* the Control Plane host filesystem

{{< alert info >}}
Before going further, ensure that your repository is ready to hold your packages.
{{< /alert >}}

### Control plane repository

The control plane repository uses the control plane server to manage uploads to the repository, secured by a Gatling Enterprise Edition API Token with `Configure` role.
You can modify the [server configuration]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/introduction/#control-plane-server" >}}) in the Control Plane configuration.

#### AWS S3

{{<alert tip >}}
Accelerate deployment and simplify configuration with Gatling's pre-built [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">infrastructure-as-code configurations</span>]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#aws" >}}).
{{</alert>}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Control plane with private repository needs AWS permissions `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject` and `s3:GetObject` on the bucket.

To download a private package, the location requires outbound connection access to `https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

To upload a private package using HTTPS, please check this [section]({{< ref "#enableHttps" >}})
{{< /alert >}}

Once it is done, add the private repository configuration section in your [control plane configuration]({{< ref "introduction" >}}) file:

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # S3 Bucket configuration
    type = "aws"
    bucket = "bucket-name"
    path = "folder/to/upload" # (optional, default: root)
    # server-side-encryption = "AES256" # (optional, default: none, values: AES256, aws:fsx, aws:kms, aws:kms:dsse)
    # endpoint-override = "https://s3.example.com" # (optional, default: none)
  }
}
```

This configuration includes the following parameters:
- **bucket**: The name of the bucket where packages are uploaded to on AWS S3.
- **path:** The path of a folder in AWS S3 bucket. (optional)

##### Build caching

If you are using [build from a Git repository]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git" >}}) and want to enable
[private storage build cache]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git#private-storage-build-cache" >}}),
you need to enable caching in the configuration:

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # S3 Bucket configuration
    type = "aws"
    bucket = "bucket-name"
    path = "folder/to/upload" # (optional, default: root)
    # ...
    cache {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}
```

Cached builds are stored under the path `<bucket>/<path>/cache/builds/*`.

Automatically clean up expired cache entries by configuring an  [S3 Lifecycle rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-expire-general-considerations.html) to delete objects after a specified number of days.
Set the rule's prefix to `<path>/cache` to limit the scope to cached builds only.

#### Azure Blob Storage

{{<alert tip >}}
Accelerate deployment and simplify configuration with Gatling's pre-built [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">infrastructure-as-code configurations</span>]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#azure" >}}).
{{</alert>}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Control plane with private repository needs to be associate with Azure storage account role `Storage Blob Data Contributor`.
For more information, check [Authenticate to Azure and authorize access to blob data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-java?tabs=powershell%2Cmanaged-identity%2Croles-azure-portal%2Csign-in-azure-cli#authenticate-to-azure-and-authorize-access-to-blob-data)

To download a private package, the location requires outbound connection access to `https://<storage-account>>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>`
{{< /alert >}}

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # Azure Blob Storage configuration
    type = "azure"
    storage-account = "storage-account-name"
    container = "container-name"
    path = "folder/to/upload" # (optional, default: root)
  }
}
```

##### Build caching

If you are using [build from a Git repository]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git" >}}) and want to enable
[private storage build cache]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git#private-storage-build-cache" >}}),
you need to enable caching in the configuration:

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # Azure Blob Storage configuration
    type = "azure"
    storage-account = "storage-account-name"
    container = "container-name"
    path = "folder/to/upload" # (optional, default: root)
    # ...
    cache {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}
```

Cached builds are stored under the path `<storage-account>/<container>/<path>/cache/builds/*`.

Automatically clean up expired cache entries by configuring a [Storage Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage-actions/storage-tasks/storage-task-create) with the following conditions:
* Creation time is older than your desired cache time-to-live
* Container name matches your configured container
* Blob name starts with `<path>/cache`

Set the task operation to `Delete blob`.

#### GCP Cloud Storage
{{<alert tip >}}
Accelerate deployment and simplify configuration with Gatling's pre-built [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">infrastructure-as-code configurations</span>]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#gcp" >}}).
{{</alert>}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Control plane with private repository needs GCP service account role with permissions `storage.objects.create`, 
`storage.objects.delete` and `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` on the bucket.

To download a private package, the location requires outbound connection access to `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucket>`.

To upload a private package using HTTPS, please check this [section]({{< ref "#enableHttps" >}})
{{< /alert >}}

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # Cloud Storage Bucket configuration
    type = "gcp"
    bucket = "bucket-name"
    path = "folder/to/upload" # (optional, default: root)
    project = "project-name"
  }
}
```

This configuration includes the following parameters:
- **bucket**: The name of the bucket where packages are uploaded to on GCP Cloud Storage.
- **path:** The path of a folder in Cloud Storage bucket. (optional)

##### Build caching

If you are using [build from a Git repository]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git" >}}) and want to enable
[private storage build cache]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git#private-storage-build-cache" >}}),
you need to enable caching in the configuration:

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # Cloud Storage Bucket configuration
    type = "gcp"
    bucket = "bucket-name"
    path = "folder/to/upload" # (optional, default: root)
    project = "project-name"
    # ...
    cache {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}
```

Cached builds are stored under the path `<project>/<bucket>/<path>/cache/builds/*`.

Automatically clean up expired cache entries by configuring an  [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle) rule with the following settings:
* Action: Delete object
* Object name matches prefix `<path>/cache`
* Age is older than your desired cache time-to-live

#### Filesystem Storage

{{<alert tip >}}
Accelerate deployment and simplify configuration with Gatling's pre-built [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">infrastructure-as-code configurations</span>]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code" >}}).
{{</alert>}}

{{< alert warning >}}
To download a private package, the location requires outbound connection access to configured `download-base-url`.
{{< /alert >}}

This option allows the storage of simulations directly on the control-plane filesystem.
```bash
  repository = {
    # Filesystem configuration
    type = "filesystem"
    # Directory to store your private packages
    directory = "/data/gatling-repository"
    upload {
      # Directory to temporarily store your incoming simulation during the upload process
      directory = "/tmp" # (optional, default: /tmp)
    }
    location {
      # URL of your control-plane from your private locations
      download-base-url = "http://www.example.com:8080"
    }
  }
```

{{< alert warning >}}
Please note that the optional `upload.directory` configuration, which defaults to /tmp, will be used to temporarily store your incoming simulation during the upload process.
Once the upload is complete, the file will be stored in your configured directory (`/data/gatling-repository` in the provided example).
{{< /alert >}}

This configuration includes the following parameters:
- **directory**: The directory where the simulations will be stored.
- **location.download-base-url**: The access URL for the control-plane. This URL will be provided to the load-generators so that they can download your simulations. 

##### Build caching

If you are using [build from a Git repository]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git" >}}) and want to enable
[private storage build cache]({{< ref "reference/deploy/private-locations/build-from-git#private-storage-build-cache" >}}),
you need to enable caching in the configuration:

```bash
control-plane {
  repository {
    # Filesystem configuration
    type = "filesystem"
    # Directory to store your private packages
    directory = "/data/gatling-repository"
    # ...
    cache {
      enabled = true
      ttl = 7 days # (optional, default 7 days)
      cleanup-interval = 1 day # (optional, default: 1 day)
    }
  }
}
```

Cached builds are stored under the path `<directory>/cache/builds/*`.

When enabled, the cache is automatically cleaned up at the interval specified by `cache.cleanup-interval` (default: 1 day). 
Cache entries older than `cache.ttl` (default: 7 days) are deleted.

### Configure Private Packages with Infrastructure-as-code

Gatling provides infrastructure-as-code configurations to set up your infrastructure for Private Locations & Packages.

- [AWS S3]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#aws" >}})
- [Azure Blob Storage]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#azure" >}})
- [GCP Cloud Storage]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#gcp" >}})
- [Helm chart]({{< ref "infrastructure-as-code/#kubernetes" >}}) (for Kubernetes; supporting AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage & Filesystem Storage)

### Upload Private Packages using HTTPS {#enableHttps}

#### AWS

To enable HTTPS for your Control Plane container, there are two options:

- Using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) (Recommended for production)
  - Obtain a valid Domain Name and TLS Certificate. You can use AWS Certificate Manager for simplicity.
  - Create an Application Load Balancer and configure it to listen on port 443.
  - Attach TLS Certificate to the Application Load Balancer.
  - If you optionally wish to implement TLS encryption on the traffic between ALB and Control Plane server, generate a certificate for the server and update [repository server configuration]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/introduction/#control-plane-server" >}}) in the Control Plane configuration with the generated certificate.
  - Register your Control Plane as a target group associated with the ALB.
  - Update ALB Security Group to allow inbound traffic on port 443 and allow outbound on your server's port (default: 8080) for the Control Plane Security Group.
  - Update your Route53 or DNS provider settings to point domain or subdomain to the ALB using a CNAME record.
- Direct IP Aliasing
  - Obtain a valid Domain Name and TLS Certificate.
  - Update the [repository server configuration]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/introduction/#control-plane-server" >}}) in the Control Plane configuration with the generated certificate.
  - Update your Route53 or DNS provider settings to point domain or subdomain to the Control Plane's public IP using an A record.

#### Azure

By default, HTTPS is enabled for your Control Plane container on Azure when Ingress is enabled.

- Use the Application URL with the following: `https://<app-name>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io`
- Modify Ingress settings in order adjust the Control Plane's Ingress configuration as needed.

#### GCP

To enable HTTPS for your Control Plane container on GCP, there are two options:

- Using a Google Cloud HTTPS Load Balancer (Recommended for production)
  - Obtain a valid domain name and TLS certificate. You can use Google-managed certificates for simplicity.
  - Create a Google Cloud HTTPS Load Balancer and configure it to listen on port 443.
  - Attach the TLS certificate to the HTTPS Load Balancer.
  - If you optionally wish to implement TLS encryption on the traffic between Google Cloud HTTPS Load Balancer and Control Plane server, generate a certificate for the server and update [repository server configuration]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/introduction/#control-plane-server" >}}) in the Control Plane configuration with the generated certificate.
  - Register your Control Plane as a backend service associated with the Load Balancer.
  - Update the firewall rules to allow inbound traffic on port 443 and allow outbound traffic on your server's port (default: 8080) for the Control Plane's network.
  - Update your Cloud DNS settings or your DNS provider to point your domain or subdomain to the Load Balancer's IP address using a CNAME or A record.
- Direct IP Aliasing
  - Obtain a valid domain name and TLS certificate.
  - Update the [repository server configuration]({{< ref "/reference/deploy/private-locations/introduction/#control-plane-server" >}}) in the Control Plane configuration with the generated certificate.
  - Update your Cloud DNS settings or your DNS provider to point your domain or subdomain to the Control Plane's public IP address using an A record.

## Usage 

After configuration, restart the control plane to start the server.

### Create a private package

To create a private package, use Gatling Plugin deployment commands with control plane URL configured:
- [Maven plugin]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/maven-plugin#private-packages" >}})
- [Gradle plugin]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/gradle-plugin#private-packages" >}})
- [sbt plugin]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/sbt-plugin#private-packages" >}})
- [JavaScript CLI]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/js-cli#private-packages" >}})

### Delete a private package

To delete a private package, delete the package within Gatling Enterprise Edition. 
The control plane will receive the order to delete the package on the configured private repository.
