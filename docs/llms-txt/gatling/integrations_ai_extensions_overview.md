## Installation

### Installation for Claude Code

The plugin can be installed directly from our marketplace via Claude Code's plugin system.

First, configure the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add gatling/gatling-ai-extensions
```

Then, install the plugin:

```
/plugin install gatling@gatling-ai-extensions
```

Or browse for the plugin via `/plugin > Discover`.

Finally, reload Claude.

## Gatling AI Extensions

The plugin is a Gatling projects helper to deploy and run tests on [Gatling Enterprise](https://gatling.io/platform).
It contains a set of skills and an MCP server:

- `gatling-configuration-as-code`: Generate or update the `.gatling/package.conf` package descriptor file for Gatling Enterprise deployments. Collects simulation class names, queries your account for teams, packages, tests, and locations, then writes or updates the configuration file following Configuration as Code rules.
- `gatling-enterprise-build-tools`: Deploy and start Gatling tests on Gatling Enterprise using your project's build tool (Maven, Gradle, sbt, or the JavaScript CLI). Detects the build tool, verifies prerequisites, runs the deploy command, and optionally starts a test run.

The AI extensions are packaged as a plugin inside a Claude Marketplace but all components can be used or run manually
in any LLM client that supports skills or local MCP servers.

For the Gatling MCP server details, tools reference, and setup instructions,
see the [dedicated page]({{< ref "./mcp-server" >}}).

When using either the skills or the MCP server, a valid [**API Token**]({{< ref "/reference/administration/api-tokens" >}})
is required with at least the **Configure** role provided as environment variable `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN`.
