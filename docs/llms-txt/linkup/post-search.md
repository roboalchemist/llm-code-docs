The **`/search`** endpoint is a context retrieval tool for Web content. For a natural language query, it finds online information to ground your LLM's answer, along with sources.

<Tip>Our search is optimized for precision. Make sure to craft detailed prompts for optimal results. Learn more [here](../../../documentation/get-started/prompting).</Tip>

Depending on the `depth` parameter, results may be faster (`standard`) or slower but more complete (`deep`).

If `outputType` is set to `structured`, you may provide a JSON `structuredOutputSchema` to dictate the response format.

<Tip>JSON formats are tricky. Learn more about structured output in [our guide](../../../documentation/tutorials/structured-output-guide).</Tip>

Learn more about these parameters in [Concepts](/pages/documentation/get-started/concepts).
