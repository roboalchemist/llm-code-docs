# IncidentTrigger Configuration

> Learn how to configure status page incident automation with the Checkly CLI.

<Tip>
  Learn more about Status Pages in [the Status Pages overview](/communicate/status-pages/overview).
</Tip>

Use incident triggers to automatically create and resolve an incident and notify subscribers based on the alert configuration of a monitor or check. This allows you to link synthetic monitoring failures directly to incidents on your status pages.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts Basic Example highlight={12-19,28} theme={null}
  import {
    Frequency,
    IncidentTrigger,
    PlaywrightCheck,
    StatusPageService,
  } from "checkly/constructs";

  const searchService = new StatusPageService("search-service", {
    name: "Search Service",
  });

  const searchIncidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
    service: searchService,
    severity: "MINOR",
    name: "Search is down",
    description:
      "Some users experience issues with the product search. We're investigating.",
    notifySubscribers: true,
  };

  new PlaywrightCheck("playwright-check-suite", {
    name: "Search Monitoring",
    playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
    activated: true,
    pwProjects: ["Search Monitoring"],
    locations: ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-2"],
    frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
    triggerIncident: searchIncidentTrigger,
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `IncidentTrigger` Options

<ResponseField name="service" type="StatusPageService" required>
  The status page service that this incident will be associated with. When a check or monitor fails, an incident is created for this service and connected status pages.

  **Usage:**

  ```ts highlight={6} theme={null}
  const searchService = new StatusPageService("search-service", {
    name: "Search Service",
  })

  const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
    service: searchService,
    /* More options... */
  }
  ```

  **Use cases**: Linking monitors to specific services, automatic incident creation, service-based status tracking.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="severity" type="IncidentSeverity" required>
  The severity level of the incident. Determines how the incident is displayed and prioritized.

  **Options:**

  * `MINOR` - Minor impact, most users unaffected
  * `MEDIUM` - Moderate impact, some users affected
  * `MAJOR` - Major impact, many users affected
  * `CRITICAL` - Critical impact, all users affected

  **Usage:**

  ```ts highlight={3} theme={null}
  const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
    service: searchService,
    severity: "MAJOR",
    /* More options... */
  }
  ```

  **Use cases**: Incident prioritization, user communication, escalation workflows.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the incident displayed on the status page. Should clearly communicate the issue to users.

  **Usage:**

  ```ts highlight={3} theme={null}
  const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
    service: searchService,
    name: "Search is down",
    /* More options... */
  }
  ```

  **Use cases**: User communication, incident identification, status page clarity.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string" required>
  A detailed description of the incident. Provides context to users about what's happening and potential impact.

  **Usage:**

  ```ts highlight={3-4} theme={null}
  const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
    service: searchService,
    description:
      "Some users experience issues with the product search. We're investigating.",
    /* More options... */
  }
  ```

  **Use cases**: User communication, incident context, expectation setting.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="notifySubscribers" type="boolean" required>
  Whether to notify status page subscribers when the incident is triggered. When `true`, subscribers receive notifications via their configured channels.

  **Usage:**

  ```ts highlight={3} theme={null}
  const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
    service: searchService,
    notifySubscribers: true,
    /* More options... */
  }
  ```

  **Use cases**: Proactive user communication, incident awareness, stakeholder updates.
