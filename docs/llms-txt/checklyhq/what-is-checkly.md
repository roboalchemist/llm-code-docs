Checkly is a Application Reliability platform that enables teams to **test, monitor, and observe** their web applications, APIs, and other services in a unified workflow. Built for modern development teams, Checkly uses [Monitoring as Code](/guides/getting-started-with-monitoring-as-code) to help define your monitoring setup in code and integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines. Rely on a single workflow to define your monitoring in code, automatically test it in preview environments and deploy with your production code.

**The platform combines three core reliability capabilities:**

## Why Checkly?

Checkly helps developers increase uptime and reliability, improve shipping velocity, and improve incident response time through a unified workflow that's scalable, automated, and AI-ready. Teams most often choose Checkly for:

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Monitoring as Code" href="/concepts/monitoring-as-code" cta="Learn more" horizontal>
    Instead of monitoring being configured through a bulky, limited UI that is slow to keep up with the pace of development, Checkly enables engineers to build and configure their entire monitoring process with Typescript constructs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Native end-to-end reliability with Playwright" href="/detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview" cta="Learn more" horizontal>
    Checkly's browser monitoring is powered natively by Playwright, the world's most popular open-source testing framework. It's fast, robust, reliable, and enables engineers to easily build tests that can monitor fully replicated end-to-end scenarios.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delightful Developer Experience" href="/cli/authentication" cta="Learn more" horizontal>
    Checkly is a code-driven platform with all the constructs, APIs, and integrations that your engineering team needs to automate & program their entire observability process. The Checkly CLI manages the entire lifecycle of your monitors.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unified Testing, Monitoring, Tracing, and Incident Management" href="/detect/testing/overview" cta="Learn more" horizontal>
    Checkly proactively improves application reliability by unifying testing, monitoring, and observability into a single workflow using technologies like Playwright and Open Telemetry.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reliable Functional and Performance Error Detection" href="/concepts/results" cta="Learn more" horizontal>
    Checkly accurately detects both **functional** and **performance errors** in pre-production and production environments. This helps consolidate tooling and improving the velocity of teams shipping quality features and services.

## Checkly Is Best Fit For

**DevOps and SRE Teams** looking for programmable monitoring that integrates seamlessly with their existing infrastructure-as-code and GitOps workflows.

**Full-Stack Engineering Teams** who want to shift monitoring left and treat monitoring as an integral part of their development process rather than an afterthought.

**Engineering Teams Using Modern Web Technologies** who want monitoring that understands modern JavaScript frameworks, SPAs, and API-first architectures.
