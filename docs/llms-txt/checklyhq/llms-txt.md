> Use the Checkly llms.txt file to discover and crawl all available documentation pages as markdown.

The [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/) provides a machine-readable index of all available documentation pages. Checkly publishes an `llms.txt` file at [`checklyhq.com/llms.txt`](https://www.checklyhq.com/llms.txt) that lists every documentation page with its markdown URL and a short description.

```txt llms.txt (first 15 lines) theme={null}
