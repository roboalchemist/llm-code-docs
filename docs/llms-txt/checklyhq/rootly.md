# Send Alerts via Rootly

> Configure Rootly integration to receive real-time alerts from Checkly monitors

Checkly integrates with [Rootly](https://rootly.com/) and can deliver failure, degradation, and recovery messages to any Rootly service. More specifically, Checkly will:

* Open new incidents when a check fails.
* Close incidents automatically when a failing check recovers.
* Alert when SSL certificates are about to expire.

1. Log in to Rootly and navigate to **Alerts > Alert Sources**, click **Add Alert Source** and select "Checkly"."

2. Take note of the following:
   * The **Secret** that Rootly.io provides you with.
   * The **type** you want to target: either **Service**, **Group** or **Escalation Policy**.
   * The **ID** of the target.
     Now head over to [Checkly > Alerts](https://app.checklyhq.com/alerts/settings), click **Add more channels** and select **Rootly**.

3. Copy and paste in the API key, select the type and paste in the ID.

4. Hit **Test Rootly alert** to verify the connection. On the Incident.io side, you should now see a test alert pop up!

5. Now you are all set up! When an alert is triggered, an incident will be created in Rootly.

You now have successfully integrated Checkly with Rootly.
