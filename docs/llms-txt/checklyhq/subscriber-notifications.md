    To subscribe to notifications, users click the "Get updates" button at the top of the Status Page, and then fill out a form to enter their email address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify email">
    A verification email is sent to the user's email address to confirm the subscription.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive incident notifications">
    From that moment on, users with a confirmed subscription will receive emails for incident updates and resolutions. They can choose to unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

## How Checkly deals with subscribers limits based on your plan

To ensure your users can subscribe to your status page, **extra subscribers will be automatically billed as overages** once you've bought a Communicate Starter or Communicate Team add-on.
You can monitor your subscribers and overages from [your Checkly account billing page](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/billing).

If you have not purchased any Communicate add-on, we will continue accepting new subscribers to your page, yet will only send notifications to the first 250 subscribers. Once you upgrade to get more subscribers, those existing subscribers will start receiving notifications. [View pricing for more details about limits](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing).
