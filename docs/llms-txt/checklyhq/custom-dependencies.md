# Custom Dependencies in Playwright Check Suites

> Use private packages, custom registries, and additional dependencies in your Playwright Check Suites.

Use the [Checkly CLI](/cli/) to turn your Playwright tests into globally distributed monitors. Checkly uses your existing `package.json` dependencies and Playwright configuration.

<Info>
  **Runtime Environment**: Playwright Check Suites run in a Node.js runtime containing your custom dependencies. See the [runtime specification](/platform/runtimes/runtime-specification) for further details.
</Info>

## Using JavaScript/Node.js dependencies

Checkly installs dependencies from your `package.json` and lock files. It works with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

By default, Checkly installs all dependencies (both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`).

```json package.json theme={null}
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.6.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@faker-js/faker": "^9.7.0",
    "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0"
  }
}
```

Checkly detects your package manager from your lock file:

| Lock file           | Package manager |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `package-lock.json` | npm             |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml`    | pnpm            |
| `yarn.lock`         | yarn            |

### Workspace support

Starting from [Checkly CLI 7.1.](https://github.com/checkly/checkly-cli/releases/tag/7.1.0), Checkly supports `npm` and `pnpm` workspaces in Playwright Check Suites, while Yarn workspaces remain unsupported.

If your Playwright tests are stored in a monorepo, Checkly automatically recognizes and manages dependencies based on your workspace configuration.
When using workspaces, packages in your workspace can depend on other packages in the same workspace, including those from the root package. Check out [pnpm workspaces docs](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)([https://pnpm.io/workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)) or [npm workspaces docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to get an overview on workspaces.

**Requirements:**

* Place your lock file (`package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) at the workspace root
* Include both root and workspace `package.json` files in your project

**Example workspace structure:**

```
my-monorepo/
├── package.json              # Root workspace config
├── package-lock.json         # or pnpm-lock.yaml
├── packages/
│   └── e2e-tests/
│       ├── package.json      # Can depend on other workspace packages
│       └── playwright.config.ts
```

Checkly supports the `exports` and `imports` features in `package.json`.

No additional configuration is needed in `checkly.config.ts` for workspace support.

## Using private dependencies

Checkly supports private packages. To authenticate with your private registry, configure your credentials in Checkly.

```json package.json theme={null}
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@your-org/private-package": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```

You need to:

1. Add authentication configuration to your `.npmrc` file
2. Include the `.npmrc` file in your `checkly.config.ts`
3. Store authentication tokens as [environment variables](/platform/variables) in Checkly

### Configure authentication to private dependencies

All package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) use `.npmrc` files to authenticate with private registries.

<Note>
  Store authentication tokens as Checkly [environment variables](/platform/variables). Reference them in your `.npmrc` file using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax.
</Note>

#### Using private npm packages

```txt  theme={null}
# Using an environment variable (recommended)
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}

# Hard-coded token (not recommended)
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_abc...
```

#### Using JFrog Artifactory

```txt  theme={null}
# Using an environment variable (recommended)
registry=https://yourcompany.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/:_authToken=${ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN}

# Hard-coded token (not recommended)
registry=https://yourcompany.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/:_authToken=abc...
```

#### Using GitHub Packages

```txt  theme={null}
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
@your-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

### Using yarn or pnpm with private packages

**yarn** and **pnpm** also use `.npmrc` for authentication (same format as npm examples above).

### Include authentication files

Add your `.npmrc` file to the `checks.include` property in your `checkly.config.ts`.

When you run `npx checkly test` or `npx checkly deploy`, the CLI bundles and uploads these files. This makes them available when Checkly runs `installCommand` to install your dependencies.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={6} theme={null}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    // Include .npmrc for authentication with private registries
    // Works with npm, yarn, and pnpm
    include: ['.npmrc'],
    playwrightChecks: [
      // ...
    ]
  }
})
```

#### Using lifecycle scripts

Some npm packages define lifecycle scripts (such as `prepare`, `postinstall`, or `preinstall`) that run during installation and may require access to files not automatically included in the CLI's code bundle.

If you're confident your dependencies work without lifecycle scripts, you can use the [`installCommand`](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/configuration#customize-install-and-test-commands) property to pass the `--ignore-scripts` flag to your package manager:

```typescript checkly.config.ts theme={null}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'My Check Suite',
        logicalId: 'my-check-suite',
        installCommand: 'npm install --ignore-scripts',
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

If a dependency does require its install hooks to function correctly, use the [`include`](/constructs/playwright-check#param-include) option to add any required files to the code bundle:

```typescript checkly.config.ts theme={null}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    include: ['scripts/**/*', 'config/**/*'],
    playwrightChecks: [
      // ...
    ]
  }
})
```

## Dependency Caching

Checkly caches installed packages between check runs to speed up execution and reduce installation time. Dependencies are installed once and reused for subsequent runs until your lock files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `yarn.lock`), your `installCommand` or your working directory change.

### How caching works

When dependency caching is enabled:

1. On the first run, Checkly installs all packages from your lock file and stores them in cache
2. On subsequent runs, Checkly checks if your lock file, `installCommand` or working directory have changed
3. If unchanged, Checkly uses the cached packages, skipping the installation step
4. If changed, Checkly installs packages again and updates the cache

Caching significantly reduces check execution time, especially for projects with many or large dependencies.

### Cache behavior by location type

**Public Locations**: Dependency caching is **Always ON**.

**Private Locations**: Dependency caching is **OFF by default**. To enable caching and speed up check runs, set `DEPENDENCY_CACHE=CHECKLY_S3` in your [agent configuration](/platform/private-locations/agent-configuration).

## Troubleshooting

### Package not found

If you see errors like `404 Not Found` or `Package '@your-org/package' not found`:

* Verify your `.npmrc` file is included in `checks.include`
* Check that the registry URL is correct
* Ensure your package name matches exactly (including scope)

### Authentication failed

If you see `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` errors:

* Verify the environment secret is set in Checkly (see [environment variables](/platform/variables))
* Ensure the variable name in your `.npmrc` file matches exactly (e.g., `${NPM_TOKEN}`)
* Confirm that your token has the necessary permissions to access the package

### Wrong package manager detected

If Checkly uses the wrong package manager:

* Verify the correct lock file is present (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.json`)
* Remove any conflicting lock files
* Override with a custom `installCommand` if needed (see [customize install commands](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/configuration#customize-install-and-test-commands))

### Installation timeout

If package installation exceeds time limits:

* Check for large dependencies that can be optimized
* Consider using a custom `installCommand` to install only required packages

### Memory usage exceeded

If you see errors indicating that memory limits were exceeded during installation:

* Optimize your dependencies to reduce memory consumption
* Consider using a custom `installCommand` to install only necessary packages

### General installation failures

If you encounter general installation errors:

* Review the full error logs for specific issues
* Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the Node.js version used by Checkly
* Consider using a custom `installCommand` to handle complex installations
