# Performance & Web Vitals

> Web Vitals for browser checks

Checkly automatically collect Network Waterfalls & Performance signals (**Web Vitals**) for each of the pages you visit in the browser session.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Checkly only collects tracing and web vitals data if your browser check meets the following criteria:

  * It is based on **Playwright**.
  * It runs on any **runtime above [2021.06](/cli/checkly-runtimes)**
</Callout>

## Network Waterfalls

For each page you visit, we automatically collect the following:

1. Any `error`, `warning` or `info` level console messages.
2. Any network requests, like `xhr/fetch`, `javascript`, `css` and others.

You can use this data to quickly find issues with the pages you visit. Use cases are:

* Finding critical errors in your JavaScript by scanning the console logs.
* Pinpoint missing images or other resources: they will show a `404` in the network tab.

## Web Performance Vitals

For each page your script visits, we automatically collect a set of five [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/).
Web Vitals are user focused quality signals for web pages that indicate a good, ok or poor user experience.

<Accordion title="First Contentful Paint (FCP)" icon="paintbrush">
  **Initial Content Display**
  Measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any content is rendered. A large FCP means users see a white screen for too long, doubting whether the page works at all.

  [Read more about FCP over at web.dev](https://web.dev/fcp/)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)" icon="image">
  **Main Content Loading**
  Measures the time to render the largest visual item within the browser viewport. High LCP means users wait too long before the most useful part of your page loads.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)" icon="arrows-to-circle">
  **Visual Stability**
  An aggregate metric that signals screen elements "jumping around" as the page loads. Low CLS means you have a stable page layout.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Total Blocking Time (TBT)" icon="clock">
  **Main Thread Responsiveness**
  Reflects the time a web page is "blocked" from receiving user input because the main rendering thread is busy. High TBT means sluggish user interactions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Time to First Byte (TTFB)" icon="server">
  **Server Response Time**
  Indicates how long it took for your server to respond with the first byte of content. TTFB can vary based on location and network conditions.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  Web Vitals are a part [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), but the two are not the same: Web Vitals are a lighter, higher-level tool built on existing browser APIs. Being less resource-intensive than Lighthouse, Web Vitals can be reliably calculated for you on cloud resources every minute.

### Why are some Web Vitals not reported?

Checkly automatically instruments your Playwright code to collect Web Vitals metrics. However, in some cases we will not
be able to collect a good measurement. There are multiple reasons for this:

#### Route-Based Navigation

A Single Page App like a React, Vue or Angular app only has one HTML page load event and then relies on route changes.
The underlying [library we use for collecting Web Vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) does not yet account for this.
The folks over at Google are aware of this and [posted an FAQ](https://web.dev/vitals-spa-faq/).

#### Insufficient Measurement Time

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) relies on layout events accumulating over time. If your script exits very fast, or triggers
a redirect, there might not be enough time to actually "catch" this metric.

#### User Interaction Needed

Some metrics require a small amount of interaction to effectively "trigger". Clicking a button or other screen element
in your Playwright script can help here.

  We are constantly tweaking and updating our Web Vitals collection code, so expect improvements in the future!

### Lab metrics vs. Field metrics

Checkly collects "lab" metrics for you. These are different from "field" metrics.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lab Metrics" icon="flask">
    **Controlled Environment**

    * Collected in synthetic environments
    * Generated by your Browser check scripts
    * Useful for establishing baselines
    * Helps identify performance regressions
    * Perfect for pre-deployment testing
  </Card>

  <Card title="Field Metrics" icon="users">
    **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**

    * Based on real user traffic
    * Collected "in the wild"
    * Varies by device, location, network
    * Provides actual user experience data
    * Essential for production monitoring
