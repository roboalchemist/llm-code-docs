# Admin Overview

> Comprehensive guide to managing your Checkly account, team members, security, and integrations

This section covers all aspects of administering your Checkly account, from managing team members and permissions to setting up advanced security features and API access.

## Team Member Roles

When inviting a team member to join your account you can assign one of five roles: **Owner**, **Admin**, **Read & Write**, **Read & Run**, or **Read Only**. Each role inherits all permissions from the roles below it.

Only the initial account creator has the Owner role. You can change assigned roles at any time after a teammate joins.

| Capability                 | Owner | Admin | Read & Write | Read & Run | Read Only |
