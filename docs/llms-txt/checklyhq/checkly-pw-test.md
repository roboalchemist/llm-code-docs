# checkly pw-test

> Run Playwright tests with Checkly monitoring features

<Note>Available since CLI v6.1.0.</Note>

The `checkly pw-test` command runs Playwright tests on Checkly's cloud infrastructure and supports standard Playwright CLI arguments.
This command records test sessions by default.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
  Before using `checkly pw-test`, ensure you have:

  * An initialized Checkly CLI project
  * Valid Checkly account authentication (run `npx checkly login` if needed)
  * Playwright tests in your project
  * A `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` file.
</Accordion>

## Basic Usage

Use `--` to separate Checkly flags from Playwright test options.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test [checkly options] -- [playwright options]
```

### Common Playwright Test Options

The `pw-test` command reuses your `playwright.config` settings. To overwrite these values from the command line, [Playwright Check Suites](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) supports most [Playwright test runner options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli).

<ResponseField name="--project" type="string">
  Select specific Playwright projects to run. This allows you to run only a subset of your configured projects from your Playwright configuration.

  **Usage:**

  ```bash Terminal theme={null}
  npx checkly pw-test -- --project="chromium"
  npx checkly pw-test -- --project="firefox"
  ```

  <Note>You can only run projects specified in your `playwright.config` file.</Note>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--grep" type="string">
  Filter tests to run based on a pattern match against test titles. Only tests matching the pattern will be executed.

  **Usage:**

  ```bash Terminal theme={null}
  npx checkly pw-test -- --grep="@smoke"
  npx checkly pw-test -- --grep="login|authentication"
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--grep-invert" type="string">
  Exclude tests from running based on a pattern match against test titles. Tests matching the pattern will be skipped.

  **Usage:**

  ```bash Terminal theme={null}
  npx checkly pw-test -- --grep-invert="@slow"
  npx checkly pw-test -- --grep-invert="flaky|unstable"
  ```
</ResponseField>

## Playwright Configuration vs. Applied Command Line Options

[Playwright Check Suites](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) and the `pw-test` command read and parse your existing `playwright.config` to apply your configuration.

To differentiate between your local testing setup and the Checkly monitoring environment, you can rely on the set `CI` environment variable or override specific settings using command line options.

```ts playwright.config.ts theme={null}
export default defineConfig({
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    // ...
  ]
});
```

If you run `npx checkly pw-test` without additional arguments, the test suite will:

* run with `2` retries
* use `1` worker
* run all defined projects including `chromium`

All these options can be further customized by passing command line arguments to `pw-test`.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
# Run with 4 workers, only in chromium, and 3 retries
npx checkly pw-test -- --workers=4 --project="chromium" --retries=3
```

## Examples

### Validate smoke tagged tests from `us-east-1`

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test --location="us-east-1" -- --grep="@smoke"
```

### Debug production issues

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test --verbose -- tests/checkout.spec.ts
```

### Test from different locations

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test --location="ap-southeast-1"
npx checkly pw-test --location="eu-west-1"
```

### Run critical tests only

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test --env ENVIRONMENT=production -- --grep="@critical"
```

### Run tests in multiple browsers

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test -- --project=chromium --project=firefox
```

### Run a specific test file

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly pw-test -- test.spec.ts
```
