# Password Protection

> Restrict access to your status page so only authorized users can view your service health and incidents.

<Note>
  Password protection is available as a Communicate Team add-on. [View pricing](https://checklyhq.com/pricing)
</Note>

Password protection makes your status page private. Visitors must authenticate before they can view service health, uptime data, or incidents. This is useful when your status page contains sensitive operational information intended for internal teams or select customers.

## Enabling password protection

1. Open your status page from the [Status Pages overview](https://app.checklyhq.com/status-pages).
2. In the status page settings, enable the **Private** toggle.
3. A password is automatically generated. Copy it and store it somewhere safe — it is only displayed once.
4. Save your status page.

Your status page is now private. Share the password with external users who need access — members of your Checkly account can sign in directly with their Checkly credentials.

<Warning>
  The password is only shown once when it is generated. If you lose it, you will need to regenerate a new one.
</Warning>

## How visitors access a private status page

When someone visits a password-protected status page, they see a login form with two ways to authenticate:

* **Password**: Enter the shared password provided by the status page owner.
* **Checkly account**: Members of the Checkly account that owns the status page can click **Sign in with Checkly account** to log in with their existing Checkly credentials. This does not require the shared password.

After authenticating with either method, visitors are authenticated for **30 days** before needing to sign in again.

<Note>
  Only members of the Checkly account that owns the status page can use the **Sign in with Checkly account** option. Other Checkly users will be rejected.
</Note>

<Note>
  If your status page uses both a subdomain (`your-page.checkly-status-page.com`) and a [custom domain](/communicate/status-pages/customization#custom-domain), visitors need to log in separately on each domain. Authentication does not carry over between domains.
</Note>

## Rotating the password

You can regenerate the password at any time from the status page settings. When you do:

* A new password is generated and displayed once — store it somewhere safe.
* All existing sessions are invalidated, including those authenticated via **Sign in with Checkly account**. Every viewer will need to re-authenticate.

Use password rotation when someone who had access no longer should, if the password is lost, or as a routine security practice.

## Disabling password protection

To make your status page public again, turn off the **Private** toggle in your status page settings and save. The password is deleted and anyone can view the page without authentication.
