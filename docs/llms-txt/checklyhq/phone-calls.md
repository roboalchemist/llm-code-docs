# Phone Calls

> Configure phone call notifications for critical alerts and emergency escalation

<Tip>
  **Monitoring as Code**: Learn more about the [Phone Call Alert Channel Construct](/constructs/phone-call-alert-channel).
</Tip>

The phone numbers used for phone call alerting need to be in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164). Stick to the following rules, and you'll be fine:

* Prepend international access codes with a + sign
* Do not use any white spaces
* Use up to 15 characters
