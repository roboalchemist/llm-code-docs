        The Checkly Public API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can
        get the API Key
        [here](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys). Your API key
        is like a password:  keep it secure!

        Authentication to the API is performed using the Bearer auth method in
        the Authorization header and using the account ID.

        For example, set **Authorization** header while using cURL: `curl -H
        "Authorization: Bearer [apiKey]" "X-Checkly-Account: [accountId]"`
