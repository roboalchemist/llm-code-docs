# Client certificates

Use client certificates to authenticate your API checks to APIs that require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, or
any other authentication scheme where the requester needs to provide a certificate.

Each client certificate is specific to a domain name, e.g. `acme.com` and will be used automatically by any API checks
targeting that domain.

<Note>Client certificates are available on the [**Enterprise** plan](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing/) only.</Note>

## Adding a certificate

Go to the **[Client Certificates](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/client-certificates)** tab on the Account settings screen.

1. Click "Add client certificate".
2. Provide the **host name** for the certificate. You can use wildcard like `*.acme.com`. Under the hood we use [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch)
3. Select the **certificate file** and **private key** file. Both need to be in `PEM` format.
4. If your client certificate requires a custom **Certificate Authority**, you can add another `PEM` file that contains one or more concatenated CA certificates.
5. If you provided a **passphrase** when generating your certificate and private key files, provide it in the passphrase input. You can leave it empty if no passphrase is needed.

<Note>
  Note that your passphrase will be encrypted at rest, in transit and only used at very end when executing your API check.
</Note>

## Using a certificate

Client certificates are automatically used by API checks that match the host name of the certificate. Client certificates
are active account wide and cannot be limited to a specific group.

You can add multiple certificate for the same host. In this case we match the certificate by the following rules:

1. The most recently added certificate that matches the host name wins. This goes for both full hostname and ones with wildcards.
2. A certificate with a full hostname wins over one that matches on a wildcard, e.g. `www.acme.com` wins from `*.acme.com` for the host `www.acme.com`

## Editing a certificate

Client certificates cannot be edited. You can only remove or add client certificates.

## Removing a certificate

You can remove a certificate by going to [Client Certificates](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/client-certificates)
tab and clicking the **delete** icon. Note that any API checks that require a client certificate will start failing.

## Known limitations

1. Because we need to match your certificate to your target endpoint for your API checks, you cannot change the `request.url`
   in [a setup script as described here](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/api-checks/setup-and-teardown#request).

2. We do not support `PKCS12` certificate bundles. You can convert your `PKCS12` bundles to `PEM` format using `openssl`

```bash  theme={null}
openssl pkcs12 -in <CERT>.p12 -out <PRIVATE_KEY>.key -nodes -nocerts
openssl pkcs12 -in <CERT>.p12 -out <CERTIFICATE>.cert -nokeys
```
