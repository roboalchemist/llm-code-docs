</Frame>

Integrate Playwright test results with Checkly monitoring. Upload test results, screenshots, videos, and traces to gain visibility into your application's health across test runs.

**Fully compatible with Playwright's native JSON reporter** - use it as a drop-in replacement that adds Checkly integration.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
  Before using the Playwright reporter, ensure you have:

  * Node.js >= 18.0.0
  * Playwright >= 1.40.0
  * A Checkly account ([sign up](https://www.checklyhq.com/signup))
</Accordion>

## Install the Playwright Reporter

Install [the Playwright reporter package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@checkly/playwright-reporter) via npm.

```bash  theme={null}
npm install --save-dev @checkly/playwright-reporter
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create an API key and get your Account ID

Authenticate the reporter with your Checkly Account ID and an API Key:

1. [Log in to Checkly](https://app.checklyhq.com)
2. Get your Account ID from [Account Settings > General](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general)
3. Create an API key in [User Settings > API Keys](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys)

Set your credentials as environment variables:

```bash  theme={null}
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=cu_123...
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=b2f...
```

The reporter automatically detects `CHECKLY_API_KEY` and `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables.

<Tip>
  Use inline environment variables if needed:

  ```bash  theme={null}
  CHECKLY_API_KEY=... CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=... npx playwright test
  ```
</Tip>

### 2. Add the reporter to your Playwright configuration

```ts playwright.config.ts theme={null}
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    createChecklyReporter(),
  ],
});
```

<Tip>
  `createChecklyReporter()` provides full IntelliSense for configuration options. Alternatively, use array syntax: `['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {}]`
</Tip>

### 3. Run your tests

```bash  theme={null}
npx playwright test
```

You'll see real-time test progress and a session URL in the output:

```console  theme={null}
Running 5 tests using 5 workers

| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`       | Your Checkly account ID                 |
| `CHECKLY_REPORTER_VERBOSE` | Set to `true` for detailed debug output |

<Warning>
  **Security Note**: Always use environment variables for credentials. Never commit API keys to version control.
</Warning>

## What Gets Uploaded

* Test results and status (passed/failed/flaky)
* Execution duration and timing
* Screenshots (on failure or explicit capture)
* Video recordings
* Playwright traces
* Console logs and network requests (extracted from traces)
* Git information (branch, commit, author) - automatically detected from CI or local git

<Tip>
  If your Checkly reports don't include traces or videos, ensure that your `playwright.config.ts` enables these Playwright features. The reporter only uploads what your Playwright test run creates.
</Tip>

## Understanding Test Sessions

The reporter creates **suite-level test sessions**, not individual test file results.

When you run `npx playwright test`:

1. **One test session** is created for the entire run
2. **All test results** are grouped together
3. **All assets uploaded** in a single ZIP file

This provides a consolidated view of your test suite, efficient storage, and the ability to track overall pass/fail rates over time.

View your results at [app.checklyhq.com/test-sessions](https://app.checklyhq.com/test-sessions).

## Features

### Real-time Test Progress

Shows test results as they run with status icons and error details. Similar to Playwright's `list` reporter with Checkly integration.

Set `showProgress: false` when using another reporter for terminal output.

### Summary Table

Displays a summary table with per-project breakdown of test results. Set `showSummaryTable: false` to disable.

```console  theme={null}
Project   Total  Pass  Fail  Flaky  Skip  Rate
chromium     10     9     0      1     0  90.00%
firefox      10    10     0      0     0  100.00%
webkit       10     8     2      0     0  80.00%
```

### Multi-Provider Git Detection

Automatically detects git information (branch, commit, author) from:

* GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI
* Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket Pipelines
* Local git repository (when running locally)

### Test Step Code Snippets

Includes source code context in test step reports. View the exact line of code that executed with surrounding context for easier debugging.

## Dry Run Mode

Skip uploading to Checkly while still generating local files:

**Without credentials** (automatic skip):

```bash  theme={null}
# Don't set CHECKLY_API_KEY or CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
npx playwright test
```

**With `dryRun` option** (explicit skip):

```ts playwright.config.ts theme={null}
createChecklyReporter({
  dryRun: true,
})
```

**Upload only in CI**:

```ts playwright.config.ts theme={null}
createChecklyReporter({
  dryRun: !process.env.CI,
})
```

Both approaches create `checkly-report.json` and `checkly-report.zip` in your output directory for local inspection.

## Multiple Reporters

Combine with other Playwright reporters:

```ts playwright.config.ts theme={null}
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    createChecklyReporter(),
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['list'],
    ['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results/junit.xml' }],
  ],
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing traces or videos

Ensure your `playwright.config.ts` enables these features:

```ts playwright.config.ts theme={null}
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
  },
});
```

See [Playwright's trace options](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer#recording-a-trace) and [video options](https://playwright.dev/docs/videos) for all configuration options.

### Authentication errors

Verify your environment variables are set correctly:

```bash  theme={null}
echo $CHECKLY_API_KEY
echo $CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
```

If empty, set them before running tests:

```bash  theme={null}
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=cu_123...
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=b2f...
```

### Upload failures

* Enable verbose logging with `verbose: true` or `CHECKLY_REPORTER_VERBOSE=true` for detailed error messages
* Verify your API key exists in [Checkly API Keys settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/accounts/settings/user/api-keys)
