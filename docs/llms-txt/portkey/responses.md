            The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:


            - **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend

              model's capabilities, like [web search](/docs/guides/tools-web-search)

              [built-in tools](/docs/guides/tools).
            - **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by
            you,
              enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about

        Configuring `{ "type": "json_schema" }` enables Structured Outputs, 

        which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
        in the 

        [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).


        The default format is `{ "type": "text" }` with no additional options.


        **Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:**


        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode,
        which

        ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using
        `json_schema`

        is preferred for models that support it.
