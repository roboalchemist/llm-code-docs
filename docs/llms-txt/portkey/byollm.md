# Bring Your Own LLM

> Integrate your privately hosted LLMs with Portkey for unified management, observability, and reliability.

Portkey's Bring Your Own LLM feature allows you to seamlessly integrate privately hosted language models into your AI infrastructure. This powerful capability enables unified management of both private and commercial LLMs through a consistent interface while leveraging Portkey's comprehensive suite of observability and reliability features.

## Key Benefits

* **Unified API Access**: Manage private and commercial LLMs through a single, consistent interface
* **Enhanced Reliability**: Leverage Portkey's fallbacks, retries, and load balancing for your private deployments
* **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track performance, usage, and costs alongside your commercial LLM usage
* **Simplified Access Control**: Manage team-specific permissions and usage limits
* **Secure Credential Management**: Protect sensitive authentication details through Portkey's secure vault

## Integration Options

<Note>
  **Prerequisites**

  Your private LLM must implement an API specification compatible with one of Portkey's [supported providers](/integrations/llms) (e.g., OpenAI's `/chat/completions`, Anthropic's `/messages`, etc.).
</Note>

Portkey offers two primary methods to integrate your private LLMs:

1. **Using Model Catalog**: Store your deployment details securely in Portkey's Model Catalog
2. **Direct Integration**: Pass deployment details in your requests without storing them

### Option 1: Using Model Catalog

#### Step 1: Add Your Private LLM to Model Catalog

Navigate to [**Model Catalog → Add Provider**](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog/providers) in your Portkey dashboard.

<Frame caption="Adding a private LLM to Model Catalog">
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/portkey-docs/wAHXB_jjwLt8bYcN/images/private-llm.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=wAHXB_jjwLt8bYcN&q=85&s=b8aa18e1d761c2dd1dac020d0d5727fb" alt="Model Catalog setup for private LLM" width="1174" height="914" data-path="images/private-llm.png" />
</Frame>

1. Click **"Add Provider"** and enable the **"Local/Privately hosted provider"** toggle
2. Configure your deployment:
   * Select the matching provider API specification (typically `OpenAI`)
   * Enter your model's base URL in the `Custom Host` field
   * Add required authentication headers and their values
3. Name your provider (e.g., `my-private-llm`)
4. Click **"Create"** to save your configuration

#### Step 2: Use Your Provider in Requests

After adding your provider to the Model Catalog, you can use it in your applications:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js NodeJS theme={"system"}
  import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

  const portkey = new Portkey({
      apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
      provider:"@YOUR_PRIVATE_LLM_PROVIDER"
  })

  async function main() {
    const response = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" }],
      model: "YOUR_MODEL_NAME",  // The model name your private deployment expects
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
  }

  main();
  ```

  ```py Python theme={"system"}
  from portkey_ai import Portkey

  portkey = Portkey(
      api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
      provider="@YOUR_PRIVATE_LLM_PROVIDER"
  )

  response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    model="YOUR_MODEL_NAME",  # The model name your private deployment expects
    messages=[
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
    ]
  )

  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

  ```sh cURL theme={"system"}
  curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
    -H "x-portkey-provider: @my-private-llm" \
    -d '{
      "model": "YOUR_MODEL_NAME",
      "messages": [
        { "role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" }
      ]
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Option 2: Direct Integration Without Model Catalog

If you prefer not to store your private LLM details in Portkey's Model Catalog, you can pass them directly in your API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js NodeJS theme={"system"}
  import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

  const portkey = new Portkey({
      apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
      provider: "openai",  // The API spec your LLM implements
      customHost: "https://your-llm-server.com/v1/",  // Include the API version
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",  // Optional: Any auth headers needed
      forwardHeaders: ["Authorization"]  // Headers to forward without processing
  })

  async function main() {
    const response = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" }],
      model: "YOUR_MODEL_NAME",
    });

    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
  }

  main();
  ```

  ```py Python theme={"system"}
  from portkey_ai import Portkey

  portkey = Portkey(
      api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
      provider="openai",  # The API spec your LLM implements
      custom_host="https://your-llm-server.com/v1/",  # Include the API version
      Authorization="Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",  # Optional: Any auth headers needed
      forward_headers=["Authorization"]  # Headers to forward without processing
  )

  response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
      model="YOUR_MODEL_NAME",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}]
  )

  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

  ```sh cURL theme={"system"}
  curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
    -H "x-portkey-provider: openai" \
    -H "x-portkey-custom-host: https://your-llm-server.com/v1" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -H "x-portkey-forward-headers: Authorization" \
    -d '{
      "model": "YOUR_MODEL_NAME",
      "messages": [
        { "role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms" }
      ]
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The `custom_host` must include the API version path (e.g., `/v1/`). Portkey will automatically append the endpoint path (`/chat/completions`, `/completions`, or `/embeddings`).
</Note>

## Securely Forwarding Sensitive Headers

For headers containing sensitive information that shouldn't be logged or processed by Portkey, use the `forward_headers` parameter to pass them directly to your private LLM:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ```js  theme={"system"}
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

    const portkey = new Portkey({
        apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider: "openai",
        customHost: "https://your-llm-server.com/v1/",
        // Headers to include with requests
        Authorization: "Bearer sk_live_xxxxx",
        xApiKey: "sensitive-key-value",
        xOrgId: "org-12345",
        // Headers to forward without processing
        forwardHeaders: ["Authorization", "xApiKey", "xOrgId"]
    })
    ```

    <Note>
      In the JavaScript SDK, convert header names to **camelCase**. For example, `X-My-Custom-Header` becomes `xMyCustomHeader`.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python  theme={"system"}
    from portkey_ai import Portkey

    portkey = Portkey(
        api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="openai",
        custom_host="https://your-llm-server.com/v1/",
        # Headers to include with requests
        Authorization="Bearer sk_live_xxxxx",
        x_api_key="sensitive-key-value",
        x_org_id="org-12345",
        # Headers to forward without processing
        forward_headers=["Authorization", "x_api_key", "x_org_id"]
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      In the Python SDK, convert header names to **snake\_case**. For example, `X-My-Custom-Header` becomes `x_my_custom_header`.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```sh  theme={"system"}
    curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
      -H "x-portkey-provider: openai" \
      -H "x-portkey-custom-host: https://your-llm-server.com/v1" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xxxxx" \
      -H "x-api-key: sensitive-key-value" \
      -H "x-org-id: org-12345" \
      -H "x-portkey-forward-headers: Authorization, x-api-key, x-org-id" \
      -d '{
        "model": "YOUR_MODEL_NAME",
        "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }]
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Using Forward Headers in Gateway Configs

You can also specify `forward_headers` in your Gateway Config for consistent header forwarding:

```json  theme={"system"}
{
  "strategy": { "mode": "fallback" },
  "targets": [
    {
      "provider": "openai",
      "custom_host": "https://your-private-llm.com/v1",
      "forward_headers": ["Authorization", "x-api-key", "x-custom-token"]
    },
    {
      "provider": "openai",
      "api_key": "sk-xxxxx"  // Fallback to commercial provider
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Using Private LLMs with Gateway Configs

Private LLMs work seamlessly with all Portkey Gateway features. Some common use cases:

* **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple private LLM instances
* **Fallbacks**: Set up automatic failover between private and commercial LLMs
* **Conditional Routing**: Route requests to different LLMs based on metadata

```json  theme={"system"}
{
    "strategy": {
        "mode": "fallback"
    },
    "targets": [
        {
            "provider": "openai",
            "custom_host": "http://PRIVATE_LLM/v1",
            "forward_headers": ["Authorization"]
        },
        {
            "provider":"@openai-key"
        }
    ]
}
```

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use any private LLM with Portkey?">
    Yes, as long as it implements an API specification compatible with one of Portkey's supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). The model should accept requests and return responses in the format expected by that provider.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle multiple deployment endpoints?">
    You have two options:

    1. Create separate integration for each endpoint
    2. Use Gateway Configs with load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple endpoints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any request volume limitations?">
    Portkey itself doesn't impose specific request volume limitations for private LLMs. Your throughput will be limited only by your private LLM deployment's capabilities and any rate limits you configure in Portkey.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use different models with the same private deployment?">
    Yes, you can specify different model names in your requests as long as your private LLM deployment supports them. The model name is passed through to your deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I mix private and commercial LLMs in the same application?">
    Absolutely! One of Portkey's key benefits is the ability to manage both private and commercial LLMs through a unified interface. You can even set up fallbacks between them or route requests conditionally.
