# Update Prompt

> Update a prompt's metadata and/or create a new version with updated template content.

**Partial version updates:** Set `patch: true` to perform a partial update of version fields (`string`, `parameters`, `model`, `virtual_key`, `version_description`, `functions`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `is_raw_template`, `prompt_metadata`). When enabled, any version fields omitted from the request are backfilled from the current latest version, allowing you to update only the fields you need. When `patch` is omitted or `false`, all version fields must be provided together (original strict validation).

**Metadata-only updates:** Fields like `name`, `collection_id`, `version_description`, and `virtual_key` can always be updated independently without affecting versioning.
