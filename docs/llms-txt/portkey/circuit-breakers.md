# Circuit Breakers

> Automatic failure handling for upstream MCP servers.

<Info>
  This feature is coming soon. Contact us at [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai) for early access.
</Info>

Circuit breakers automatically detect unhealthy upstream MCP servers and fail fast to protect your agents.

## What's coming

* **Automatic detection.** Monitor failure rates and response times.
* **Fast failure.** Stop sending requests to unhealthy servers immediately.
* **Recovery checks.** Periodically test if servers have recovered.
* **Configurable thresholds.** Set failure rate and latency thresholds per server.
* **Status visibility.** See circuit state (closed, open, half-open) in the dashboard.
