# OpenAI Codex

> Add usage tracking, cost controls, and security guardrails to Codex with Portkey

**Codex** is OpenAI’s coding agent for terminal, IDE extension, and CLI. It uses a shared config (user-level `~/.codex/config.toml` and optional project-level `.codex/config.toml`) for default model, approval policies, sandbox settings, and provider details. Add Portkey to get:

* **1600+ LLMs** through one interface — switch providers by updating `model` in config
* **Observability** — track costs, tokens, and latency for every request
* **Reliability** — automatic fallbacks, retries, and caching
* **Governance** — budget limits, usage tracking, and team access controls

Configure Codex with Portkey in a few minutes.

<Note>
  For enterprise deployments across teams, see [Enterprise Governance](#3-enterprise-governance).

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Portkey API Key">
    Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) and generate your Portkey API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Configure Portkey in Codex

Codex loads config from `~/.codex/config.toml` (overridable with `.codex/config.toml` in a repo; see [Config basics](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic) for precedence).

Add Portkey as the provider by setting `model_provider` and defining `[model_providers.portkey]` with `base_url` and `env_key` (see [Config reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference)):

```toml  theme={"system"}
model_provider = "portkey"
model = "@openai-prod/gpt-4o"

[model_providers.portkey]
name = "Portkey"
base_url = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
env_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY"
# wire_api = "chat"   # optional: "chat" (default) or "responses"
```

### Multiple model providers

Define multiple entries under `model_providers` to switch between environments or backends by changing `model_provider`:

```toml  theme={"system"}
model_provider = "portkey-prod"
model = "@openai-prod/gpt-4o"

[model_providers.portkey-prod]
name = "Portkey (prod)"
base_url = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
env_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY"

[model_providers.portkey-dev]
name = "Portkey (dev)"
base_url = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
env_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY_DEV"
```

Use `.codex/config.toml` in a repository to override `model_provider` and `model` for that project while keeping the shared `~/.codex/config.toml` as the default.

Set `PORTKEY_API_KEY` in the environment:

```shell  theme={"system"}
export PORTKEY_API_KEY="<portkey-api-key>"
```

<Note>
  Add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` for persistence.
</Note>

Test the integration:

```shell  theme={"system"}
codex "explain this repository to me"
```

Monitor usage in the [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/dashboard).

## 3. Using Codex with 1600+ Models

Codex uses the `model` value in `config.toml` to decide which model to call. With Portkey, set `model` to a [Model Catalog](/product/model-catalog) slug in the form `@<provider-slug>/<model-name>`. Change providers or models by updating `model` in the config.

Example:

```toml  theme={"system"}
model = "@openai-prod/gpt-4o"
```

### Using Responses API

Codex supports OpenAI's Responses API natively. Configure `config.toml` with keys from the [Codex config reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

**Provider protocol (`wire_api`)**\
Under `[model_providers.portkey]`, set `wire_api` to choose which API protocol Codex uses when talking to the provider:

| Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"chat"`      | Chat Completions API (default if omitted). Use for standard chat/completion models.                                                                        |
| `"responses"` | [Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/docs/guides/responses). Use for models that support structured reasoning and tool use via the Responses API. |

Example with protocol and optional retry/timeout tuning:

```toml  theme={"system"}
[model_providers.portkey]
name = "Portkey"
base_url = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
env_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
# request_max_retries = 4
# stream_idle_timeout_ms = 300000
```

### Adding Model Capabilities

**Reasoning, output, and tools (top-level)**\
These top-level keys apply to the current session model and control reasoning, output, and tool behavior:

| Key                       | Values                                      | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `model_reasoning_effort`  | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` | How much reasoning effort the model uses (Responses API). Higher values can improve quality; `xhigh` is model-dependent. |
| `model_reasoning_summary` | `auto`, `concise`, `detailed`, `none`       | How much reasoning summary to include or whether to disable summaries.                                                   |
| `personality`             | `none`, `friendly`, `pragmatic`             | Default communication style for models that support it. Overridable per thread or via `/personality` in-session.         |
| `temperature`             | `0`–`2` (for example `0.1`)                 | Sampling temperature. Lower values make outputs more deterministic; `0.1` is a good default for coding and tooling.      |
| `max_output_tokens`       | Integer (for example `8192`)                | Maximum number of tokens in the response. Prevents run-away output; upper bound is model-dependent.                      |
| `parallel_tool_calls`     | `true` / `false`                            | Allow the model to call multiple tools in parallel when tools are configured.                                            |
| `tool_choice`             | `"auto"`, `"required"`, `"none"`            | Control whether the model decides when to call tools (`"auto"`), must call tools, or never uses tools.                   |

Example:

```toml  theme={"system"}
model_provider = "portkey"
model = "@openai-prod/gpt-4o"

model_reasoning_effort = "high"
model_reasoning_summary = "concise"
personality = "pragmatic"
temperature = 0.1
max_output_tokens = 8192
parallel_tool_calls = true
tool_choice = "auto"

[model_providers.portkey]
name = "Portkey"
base_url = "https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
env_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY"
wire_api = "chat"
```

<Note>
  **Fallbacks, load balancing, or caching?** Create a [Portkey Config](/product/ai-gateway/configs), attach it to your API key, and set `model` to the config’s virtual model. See [Enterprise Governance](#3-enterprise-governance) for examples.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
    ### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

    Model Catalog enables you to have granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:

    * Set up [budget limits](/product/model-catalog/budget-limits)
    * Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
    * Track departmental spending

    #### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:

    1. Navigate to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) in Portkey dashboard
    2. Create new Provider for each engineering team with budget limits and rate limits
    3. Configure department-specific limits

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Set Routing Configuration">
    Portkey allows you to control your routing logic very simply with it's Configs feature. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with things like:

    * **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive code and data
    * **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks, load-balance, retry and smart conditional routing logic
    * **Caching**: Implement Simple and Semantic Caching. and more....

    #### Example Configuration:

    Here's a basic configuration to load-balance requests to OpenAI and Anthropic:

    ```json  theme={"system"}
    {
    	"strategy": {
    		"mode": "load-balance"
    	},
    	"targets": [
    		{
    			"override_params": {
    				"model": "@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER_SLUG/gpt-model"
    			}
    		},
    		{
    			"override_params": {
    				"model": "@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER/claude-sonnet-model"
    			}
    		}
    	]
    }
    ```

    Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting.

    <Note>
      Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
