            An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus
            sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with

            top 10% probability mass are considered.


            We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which
        guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.


        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the
        model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without
        this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the
        generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and
        seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be
        partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the
        generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max
        context length.
