## Emoji Ticketing

This feature allows you to easily create support tickets directly from Slack using emoji reactions.

1. Send a message in the Together shared channel
2. Add the 🎫 (ticket) emoji reaction to convert the thread into a ticket
3. A message will pop-up in the channel. Click on the `File ticket` button to proceed
4. In the form modal, fill out the required information and click `File ticket` to submit
5. Check the thread for ticket details
