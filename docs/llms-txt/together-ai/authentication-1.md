# Authentication

## Creating an Account

Creating an account is a simple process, just head to our [homepage](https://www.together.ai/) and click the **Get Started** button in the top right.

You will then be taken to our sign in page, where you can choose to sign in using Google or Github.

Once you've selected your login provider, you will be prompted to log in using your username/email and password. Then, you'll be taken straight to your [together.ai](http://together.ai/) dashboard!

[together.ai](http://together.ai/) accounts use OAuth (Open Authorisation) for authentication instead of a traditional username/password system. This not only helps keep your account more secure, but means you have one less password to remember!

**Important:** Once you create your account using one of these OAuth providers (Google or GitHub), you must continue using the same provider for all future logins. If you try to sign in with a different provider than the one you originally used, you'll receive an error message stating "This email is already linked to another sign-in method." Make sure to remember which provider you used when first creating your account.

**Note:** LinkedIn authentication was previously available but has been discontinued. If you previously signed up using LinkedIn, you can now access your account by signing in with Google or GitHub using the same email address.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Create an account at [api.together.ai](https://api.together.ai/) or log in if you have one already
2. Tap on the person icon at the top right corner, and click `Settings`
3. On the left side bar, navigate to `API Keys`
4. Copy your API key, and you're ready to go!

## API Key Security

Together does not put any restrictions on what you can do with the API keys assigned to/created by your account.

We recommend that you do not publish your key on any publicly accessible repository or site.

Exercise care when choosing to enter your key on any website or service and only share keys with people that you trust.

Each key generated by your account (and your generated main account key) give you and anybody with those keys full access to your accounts resources, including any available credits, which will top up if you have a recharge mechanism set, and your \$100 negative balance.

If your key is leaked or shared with somebody who uses it beyond the guidelines you set out, Together takes no responsibility for any additional charges or balance due on your account unless our systems are found to be at fault.

If you suspect your API key has been leaked, or want to block an existing key from being used you can rotate your main account key and delete additional keys in your [account settings](https://api.together.ai/settings/api-keys).

### Regenerating Your API Key

If your API key is compromised or you need to change it:

1. Go to your [API Keys settings](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys)
2. Click the triple dot button next to your key
3. Select "Regenerate API key"

This will immediately cancel the existing key and display a new one to use moving forward.

## Inviting Others to Use Your Account

At the moment Together AI only has User Management features available to our GPU Cluster customers.

We can offer username/password logins to our Scale and Enterprise customers as a way of allowing multiple individuals to work from the same account.

If you're on a Build plan, or don't wish to share your credentials you can allow others to use Together AI services via your account by creating and then sharing additional API keys through your account settings.

## Changing Your Email Address

Due to our OAuth authentication system, email addresses cannot be changed directly on existing accounts. However, you can transfer your account to a new email address by following these steps:

1. **Create a new account** using your preferred email address at our sign-up page

2. **Contact our Support team** from your current account email address and provide the new email address

3. **Old account deactivation** - Your original account will be blocked to prevent any confusion

4. **Update integrations** - Make sure to update any API integrations to use your new account's API key

When contacting support, please include your new email address and any relevant account details to help verify your identity.

Once the transfer is complete, you'll be able to access all your previous account features and credits using your new email address.

## Deleting Your Account

You can delete your Together AI account and associated data through our self-service process. This process ensures compliance with data protection regulations including GDPR.

### Steps to Delete Your Account

1. Log in to your Together AI account

2. Navigate to your profile settings at [api.together.xyz/settings/profile](https://api.together.xyz/settings/profile)

3. Scroll down to the "Privacy and Security" section

4. Click the "delete your account" link at the bottom of the page

5. Follow the prompts to confirm account deletion

**Important:** Account deletion will remove all your personal data from our systems and unsubscribe you from all mailing lists. This action cannot be undone. Additionally, due to OAuth authentication, you cannot create a new account using the same email address after deletion - you would need to use a different email address to sign up again.

If you experience any issues with the account deletion process, please contact our support team through the platform and we will assist you promptly.
