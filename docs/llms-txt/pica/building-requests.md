# Building Requests

> Learn how to construct requests to the Passthrough API.

## Constructing the Request

The easiest way to construct the request is to use the [Pica MCP Server](https://github.com/picahq/mcp) in your IDE.

In Cursor, open the MCP Settings and add the following:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pica": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@picahq/mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PICA_SECRET": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once you've added the MCP Server, you can simply prompt Cursor to construct the request for you based on all the specific details (filters, fields, etc.) you need.

## Examples

1. Add an endpoint that uses Pica to fetch the list of contacts from Salesforce.

2. When my form is submitted, use Pica to send an email using Gmail.

3. Using Pica, create a new lead in HubSpot when a user signs up.

4. Using Pica, add an endpoint that fetches the list of invoices from QuickBooks and displays them in a table.

5. Build a paginatable table component that fetches and displays QuickBooks invoices with search and sort using Pica.

6. Create a page with a form that can post messages to multiple Slack channels with message scheduling using Pica.
