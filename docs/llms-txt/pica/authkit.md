# What is AuthKit?

> A secure, multi-tenant authentication component that lets your users connect their third-party tools directly in your app

<Frame caption="AuthKit is a pre-built, embeddable authentication UI that makes it easy for your users to securely connect their third-party accounts (Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, QuickBooks, etc.) directly within your application. Think of it as “Plaid for integrations.”">

<Note>
  At Pica, we dogfood our own products. AuthKit powers the connection experience in Pica's dashboard. [Create a free account](https://app.picaos.com), navigate to the Connected Integrations tab, click "Add Connection", and see AuthKit in action!

## Why use AuthKit?

Building authentication flows that handle every possible error state and edge case across multiple integrations is complex and time-consuming. AuthKit solves this by providing:

</CardGroup>

## How it works

AuthKit follows a secure, token-based flow to authenticate your users' third-party accounts:

```mermaid  theme={null}
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant YourApp as Your Application
    participant YourBackend as Your Backend
    participant Pica as Pica AuthKit
    participant Integration as Third-party Integration

    User->>YourApp: Clicks "Connect Integration"
    YourApp->>Pica: Open AuthKit modal
    Pica->>YourBackend: Request AuthKit token
    YourBackend->>Pica: Generate token with user identity
    Pica->>Pica: Display integrations list
    User->>Pica: Select integration & authenticate
    Pica->>Integration: OAuth handshake
    Integration->>Pica: Access token
    Pica->>Pica: Store encrypted credentials
    Pica->>YourApp: Return connection details
    YourApp->>User: Connection successful!
```

### The authentication flow explained

<Steps>
  <Step title="User clicks to connect">
    Your user clicks a button in your app to connect an integration (e.g., "Connect Gmail"). This triggers the AuthKit modal to open.
  </Step>

  <Step title="AuthKit requests token">
    As the modal opens, AuthKit automatically requests a secure token from your backend. Your backend generates the token with the user's identity (like `userId`, `teamId`, or `organizationId`) which determines who owns the connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display integrations">
    AuthKit displays the list of available integrations for the user to browse and select from.
  </Step>

  <Step title="User authenticates">
    The user selects an integration and completes the OAuth flow or enters their API key. Pica securely stores the encrypted credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connection created">
    AuthKit returns the connection details to your app, including a `connectionKey` that you'll use to make authenticated API requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Your backend never sees or stores the user's third-party credentials. Pica handles all authentication securely and returns only the connection metadata to your app.
</Info>

## Key concepts

### Identity and Identity Types

Every connection created through AuthKit is scoped to an **identity**—a unique identifier you provide that represents who owns the connection.

| Identity Type  | Example Use Case                                     | Example Identity            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `user`         | B2C apps where each user connects their own accounts | `user_123`, email address   |
| `team`         | Apps where team members share connections            | `team_abc`, workspace ID    |
| `organization` | Enterprise apps with org-wide integrations           | `org_xyz`, company ID       |
| `project`      | Project-based tools with isolated resources          | `project_456`, project UUID |

This identity system enables you to:

* Filter connections by user, team, or organization
* Build multi-tenant applications with proper data isolation
* List and manage connections for specific identities
* Ensure users only access their own integration data

### Connection Keys

When a connection is successfully created, Pica returns a **connection key**—a unique identifier for that specific authenticated connection. You'll use this key when making API requests to access that user's data from the integration.

Example: `test::exa::default::af92aee9cbcd4aae904b9b01d3c75c40|user-123`

## Use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="B2B or B2C SaaS with customer integrations" icon="briefcase">
    Let your customers connect their Salesforce, HubSpot, or QuickBooks accounts to sync data with your platform. Each customer's connections are isolated by their organization ID.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Productivity apps with personal accounts" icon="user-check">
    Enable users to connect their personal Gmail, Google Calendar, or Slack accounts to automate workflows. Each user owns their own connections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team collaboration tools" icon="users">
    Allow teams to share integration connections across all team members. Set the identity to a team ID so everyone on the team can access the same connected accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="White-label platforms" icon="palette">
    Build a platform where your customers can offer integrations to their end users.
  </Accordion>
