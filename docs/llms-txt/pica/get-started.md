  <Tab title="AI Agent">
    ### Building an AI agent that needs to use tools?

    **Use ToolKit** to give your agent instant access to any integration.

    ToolKit works with every major agentic framework—Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Mastra, and more. Simply load the toolkit and your agent can execute actions across 200+ integrations with proper authentication and error handling built in.

    **Key features:**

    * Scope access by connection, action, and permission level
    * Works with all frameworks (SDK-agnostic)
    * Automatic retry logic and edge case handling
    * Intelligent knowledge base so your agent always executes actions correctly

    <Card title="Get started with ToolKit" icon="robot" href="/toolkit">
      Add tools to your agent in minutes with any framework
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SaaS App">
    ### Building a SaaS app that needs integrations?

    **Use AuthKit** to let your users connect their accounts.

    AuthKit is an embeddable component that works with React, Next.js, Vue, and all major frameworks. Your users can securely connect their third-party accounts through a pre-built UI that handles OAuth flows, token management, and authentication.

    **Perfect for:**

    * B2B or B2C SaaS products needing customer integrations
    * Apps that sync data from user accounts (CRM, calendar, email, etc.)
    * Platforms that need user-scoped access to third-party tools

    <Card title="Get started with AuthKit" icon="plug" href="/authkit">
      Learn how to embed AuthKit in your app and let users connect their accounts
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Direct API">
    ### Need to make direct HTTP requests to integrations?

    **Use the Passthrough API** for full control over your integration requests.

    The Passthrough API lets you make authenticated HTTP requests to any integration without managing API keys, OAuth flows, or tokens. Pica handles authentication and provides deep knowledge of every endpoint's schemas, edge cases, and dependencies.

    **Build faster with:**

    * Direct data passthrough—we never store or access your integration data
    * Our MCP server in Cursor, Windsurf, or any other MCP-compatible IDE
    * Prompt-based request building powered by our knowledge base
    * Schema validation and error handling

    <Card title="Get started with Passthrough API" icon="code" href="/api-reference/passthrough/overview">
      Make your first authenticated API request
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Vibe Coding">
    ### Using Lovable, V0, Bolt, or other AI coding tools?

    **Use BuildKit** to add integration logic with copy-paste prompts.

    BuildKit provides pre-written prompts that you can paste into any vibe coding tool to instantly generate integration features. Each prompt includes the full context needed—schemas, authentication patterns, edge cases, and best practices.

    **Works with:**

    * [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)
    * [Vercel V0](https://v0.app)
    * [Bolt](https://bolt.new)
    * [Base44](https://base44.com)
    * [Tempo](https://tempo.new) (Natively powered by Pica)
    * Any AI coding assistant that accepts prompts
