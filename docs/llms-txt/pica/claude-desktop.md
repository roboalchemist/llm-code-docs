## Overview

Claude Desktop is Anthropic's desktop application that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

2. **Pica Account** - Create a [free account](https://app.picaos.com)
3. **Pica API Key** - Get from [Settings > API Keys](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys)
4. **Connected Integrations** - Connect at least one integration from the [Connections page](https://app.picaos.com/connections)

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Claude Desktop config file">
    Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:

    **On MacOS:**

    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    **On Windows:**

    ```
    %APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    <Info>
      If the file doesn't exist, create it in the appropriate directory.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Pica MCP Server configuration">
    Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add the following configuration:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pica": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@picahq/mcp"],
          "env": {
            "PICA_SECRET": "your-pica-secret-key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Replace `your-pica-secret-key` with your actual Pica API key.

    <Warning>
      Make sure to keep your API key secure. Never share the config file publicly.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the installation">
    Start a new conversation in Claude and ask:

    ```
    What connections do I have access to?
    ```

    If configured correctly, Claude will list your connected Pica integrations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can Do

Once set up, you can use Claude to interact with your integrations in three main ways:

### Execute Actions Directly

Ask Claude to perform actions on your connected platforms:

  <Card icon="envelope" title="Email Management">
    * "Get my last 5 emails from Gmail"
    * "Send an email to [hello@picaos.com](mailto:hello@picaos.com) with subject 'Hello'"
    * "Search my emails for messages from John"
  </Card>

  <Card icon="calendar" title="Calendar Operations">
    * "Create a meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
    * "Show my calendar events for this week"
    * "Find free time slots on Friday"
  </Card>

  <Card icon="slack" title="Slack Communication">
    * "Send a message to #general: 'Meeting in 10 minutes'"
    * "List all channels in my Slack workspace"
    * "Post an update to the #announcements channel"
  </Card>

  <Card icon="users" title="CRM Management">
    * "Create a lead in Salesforce for Jane Doe at Acme Corp"
    * "Show me recent leads from HubSpot"
    * "Update the status of contact ID 12345"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Docker

If you prefer running the MCP server in Docker, you can configure Claude Desktop to use a Docker container instead of the NPX command.

**Step 1: Build the Docker image**

First, build the Pica MCP Server Docker image:

```bash  theme={null}
docker build -t pica-mcp-server .
```

Or pull from the repository if available.

**Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop**

Update your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**On MacOS:** `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pica": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "PICA_SECRET=YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY",
        "pica-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Pica API key.

### Using Local Build

For development or custom modifications:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pica": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/pica-mcp-server/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PICA_SECRET": "YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude doesn't see the MCP server" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Problem**: Claude doesn't respond to integration-related questions.

    **Solutions**:

    1. Verify the config file path is correct
    2. Check that the JSON syntax is valid
    3. Ensure your API key is correct
    4. Restart Claude Desktop completely
    5. Check Claude's developer console for errors (if available)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication errors" icon="key">
    **Problem**: Getting 401 or authentication errors.

    **Solutions**:

    1. Verify your API key at [Settings > API Keys](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys)

    3. Ensure connections haven't expired
    4. Try re-authenticating the integration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No connections found" icon="plug">
    **Problem**: Claude says no connections are available.

    **Solutions**:

    1. Connect integrations at [app.picaos.com/connections](https://app.picaos.com/connections)
    2. Verify connections are active (not expired or revoked)
    3. Check that your API key has access to the connections
    4. Restart Claude Desktop after connecting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actions fail to execute" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Problem**: Claude can't execute actions on platforms.

    **Solutions**:

    1. Ask Claude to check action requirements first
    2. Verify all required parameters are provided
    3. Check connection permissions for the action
    4. Look for rate limits or API restrictions
    5. Test the action in the Pica dashboard first

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific with requests" icon="bullseye">
    Instead of "send an email," say "send an email to [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) with subject 'Meeting' and body 'Let's meet tomorrow at 2pm'"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check connections first" icon="plug">
    Start conversations with "What connections do I have?" to see what's available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask for knowledge before executing" icon="book">
    For complex actions, ask "What parameters does \[action] require?" before executing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide context for code generation" icon="code">
    When asking for code, specify:

    * Framework/language (React, Next.js, etc.)
    * UI requirements
    * Error handling needs
    * Authentication approach
