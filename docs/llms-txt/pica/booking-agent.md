Scheduling meetings is a time-consuming task that involves:

* **Back-and-forth emails** to find availability
* **Manually checking calendars** to avoid conflicts
* **Creating calendar events** and sending invitations
* **Confirming details** with all participants

What if you could automate all of this with an AI agent?

With [**OpenAI's Agent Builder**](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder/) and [**Pica**](https://picaos.com/), you can build an intelligent booking agent that handles meeting scheduling automatically.

***

## What You'll Build

An AI booking agent that:

* 🤖 **Greets users** and collects meeting requirements
* 📅 **Checks your Google Calendar** for availability using Pica
* ⏰ **Suggests available time slots** based on preferences
* ✉️ **Creates calendar events** with guest invitations
* ✅ **Confirms bookings** with the user

All with natural language conversations!

***

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

* An OpenAI account with access to [Agent Builder](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder/)
* A Pica account ([sign up here](https://app.picaos.com))

***

## Part 1: Build the Agent in OpenAI Agent Builder

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    Navigate to [OpenAI's Agent Builder](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder/) and create a new agent.

    Click **+ New Agent** to get started.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Agent Node">
    Add an **Agent** node to your workflow and configure it with the following system prompt:

    ```text  theme={null}
    You are a helpful meeting scheduling assistant with access to my Google Calendar via Pica. Your job is to find an available time on my calendar to schedule a meeting with the user.

    Meeting times are 30 minutes.

    Instructions:
    1. Greet the user and let them know you're here to help schedule a meeting.
    2. Ask the user for:
       - Their full name
       - Their email address
       - Any preferred date/time range (if they have one)
    3. Check my Google Calendar via Pica for available times that fit their preferences.
    4. Suggest available meeting time options to the user (or choose the earliest suitable time if they don't specify).
    5. Once confirmed, create the event in my calendar and include the user's name and email as a guest.
    6. Confirm with the user that the meeting has been scheduled.

    Be polite, efficient, and clear throughout the process.
    ```

    <Tip>
      Copy the prompt above and paste it into your Agent node's system prompt field. This gives your agent clear instructions on how to handle the booking flow.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Pica MCP Server">
    Click **+ New Tools** → **MCP Server** → **+ Server**

    Configure the MCP server with these settings:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```text URL theme={null}
      https://mcp.picaos.com/mcp
      ```

      ```text Label theme={null}
      pica_mcp_server
      ```

      ```text Authentication theme={null}
      Custom Headers
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    For the **Header Value**, you'll need your Pica Secret Key:

    1. Visit [Pica API Keys](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys)
    2. Copy your secret key
    3. Add it as a custom header:

    ```text  theme={null}
    x-pica-secret: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    ```

    <Warning>
      Keep your Pica secret key secure! Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Google Calendar">
    Your agent needs access to Google Calendar:

    1. Go to [Pica Dashboard Connections](https://app.picaos.com/connections)
    2. Click **+ Add Connection**
    3. Select **Google Calendar**
    4. Authorize Pica to access your calendar

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Your Agent">
    Once everything is configured:

    1. Test your agent using the preview panel on the right
    2. Click **Publish** in the top-right corner
    3. Copy the **Workflow ID** that appears after publishing

    You'll need this Workflow ID for the next part!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Part 2: Build the ChatKit Interface

Now let's create a beautiful chat interface for your booking agent using OpenAI's ChatKit.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the ChatKit Starter App">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-chatkit-starter-app.git
    cd openai-chatkit-starter-app
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID=your_workflow_id
    ```

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Where do I find these values?">
        **OPENAI\_API\_KEY**:

        * Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
        * Create a new key within the same org & project as your Agent Builder

        **NEXT\_PUBLIC\_CHATKIT\_WORKFLOW\_ID**:

        * This is the Workflow ID you copied after publishing your agent
        * It should look something like: `wf_abc123xyz`
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Application">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Booking Agent">
    Try starting a conversation:

    * "I'd like to schedule a meeting"
    * "Can you help me book a 30-minute call?"
    * "I want to meet tomorrow afternoon"

    Your agent should:

    1. Greet you warmly
    2. Ask for your details
    3. Check your calendar for availability
    4. Suggest time slots
    5. Create the meeting when confirmed

    <Frame>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Extend the Agent

You can enhance your booking agent by:

* **Adding timezone support** for international meetings
* **Integrating Gmail** to send custom confirmation emails
* **Checking multiple calendars** for team availability
* **Adding meeting types** (15min, 30min, 60min calls)
* **Collecting meeting agendas** before scheduling

### Connect More Services

Pica supports 200+ integrations through the MCP server. Add more tools to your agent:

* **Slack** - Send meeting notifications
* **Notion** - Create meeting notes pages
* **Zoom** - Generate video meeting links
* **Linear** - Create follow-up tasks

Visit the [Pica Dashboard](https://app.picaos.com/connections) to explore available connections.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent isn't connecting to calendar">
    Make sure:

    * Your Google Calendar connection is active in [Pica Dashboard](https://app.picaos.com/connections)
    * The `x-pica-secret` header is correctly set in Agent Builder
    * You've published the agent after making changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ChatKit won't load the workflow">
    Verify:

    * `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID` matches your published workflow ID
    * `OPENAI_API_KEY` is from the same org/project as Agent Builder
    * The workflow is published (not just saved as draft)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calendar events aren't being created">
    Check:

    * The agent has permission to write to your calendar
