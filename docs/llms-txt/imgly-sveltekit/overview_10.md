# Overview

In CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK), a _composition_ is an arrangement of multiple design elements—such as images, text, shapes, graphics, and effects—combined into a single, cohesive visual layout. Unlike working with isolated elements, compositions allow you to design complex, multi-element visuals that tell a richer story or support more advanced use cases.

All composition processing is handled entirely on the client side, ensuring fast, secure, and efficient editing without requiring server infrastructure.

You can use compositions to create a wide variety of projects, including social media posts, marketing materials, collages, and multi-page exports like PDFs. Whether you are building layouts manually through the UI or generating them dynamically with code, compositions give you the flexibility and control to design at scale.

## Working with Multiple Pages and Artboards[#](#working-with-multiple-pages-and-artboards)

CE.SDK supports working with multiple artboards or canvases within a single document, enabling you to design multi-page layouts or create several design variations within the same project.

Typical multi-page use cases include:

*   Designing multi-page marketing brochures.
*   Exporting designs as multi-page PDFs.
*   Building multiple versions of a design for different audiences or platforms.

## Working with Elements[#](#working-with-elements)

You can easily arrange and manage elements within a composition:

*   **Positioning and Aligning:** Move elements precisely and align them to each other or to the canvas.
*   **Guides and Snapping:** Use visual guides and automatic snapping to align objects accurately.
*   **Grouping:** Group elements for easier collective movement and editing.
*   **Layer Management:** Control the stacking order and organize elements in layers.
*   **Locking:** Lock elements to prevent accidental changes during editing.

## UI vs. Programmatic Creation[#](#ui-vs-programmatic-creation)

### Using the UI[#](#using-the-ui)

The CE.SDK UI provides drag-and-drop editing, alignment tools, a layer panel, and snapping guides, making it easy to visually build complex compositions. You can group, align, lock, and arrange elements directly through intuitive controls.

### Programmatic Creation[#](#programmatic-creation)

You can also build compositions programmatically by using CE.SDK’s APIs. This is especially useful for:

*   Automatically generating large volumes of designs.
*   Creating data-driven layouts.
*   Integrating CE.SDK into a larger automated workflow.

## Exporting Compositions[#](#exporting-compositions)

CE.SDK compositions can be exported in several formats:

| Category | Supported Formats |
| --- | --- |
| **Images** | `.png` (with transparency), `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.tga` |
| **Video** | `.mp4` (H.264 or H.265 on supported platforms with limited transparency support) |
| **Print** | `.pdf` (supports underlayer printing and spot colors) |
| **Scene** | `.scene` (description of the scene without any assets) |
| **Archive** | `.zip` (fully self-contained archive that bundles the `.scene` file with all assets) |

Our custom cross-platform C++ based rendering and layout engine ensures consistent output quality across devices.
