# Smart routing

# Smart Routing: Let AI Choose the Best Model

Get optimal model selection automatically with Eden AI's smart routing feature. Instead of manually selecting models, let the system intelligently route your requests based on context.

## Overview

Smart routing uses the special model identifier `@edenai` to dynamically select the best LLM model for your request. The system analyzes your messages, tools, and other context to route to the optimal provider/model combination.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Automatic optimization** - No need to research and compare models
* **Cost efficiency** - Routes to models with the best price/performance ratio
* **Context-aware** - Selection adapts to your specific request
* **Fallback resilience** - Automatic fallback if routing fails
* **Works with all features** - Streaming, function calling, vision, etc.

**Powered by:** [NotDiamond](https://notdiamond.ai/) routing engine

## Quick Start: Your First Routed Request

The simplest way to use smart routing is to set `model: "@edenai"`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = "https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm/chat/completions"
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }

  payload = {
      "model": "@edenai",  # Let Eden AI choose the best model
      "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
      ]
  }

  # The system automatically selects the optimal model
  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

  print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  const url = 'https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm/chat/completions';
  const headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  };

  const payload = {
    model: '@edenai',  // Let Eden AI choose the best model
    messages: [
      {role: 'user', content: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms'}
    ]
  };

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  ```

  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl -X POST https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "@edenai",
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
      ]
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

That's it! The system will automatically select the best model from all available options.

## How It Works

When you use `model: "@edenai"`, here's what happens:

1. **Request Analysis** - The system analyzes your messages, tools, and parameters
2. **Model Selection** - NotDiamond's routing engine selects the optimal model from available candidates
3. **Transparent Routing** - Your request is routed to the selected model
4. **Normal Response** - You receive the response as if you had specified the model directly

**Typical latency:** 100-500ms additional processing time for model selection

## Customizing Model Candidates

By default, smart routing considers all available models. You can customize the candidate pool with `router_candidates`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = "https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm/chat/completions"
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }

  payload = {
      "model": "@edenai",
      "router_candidates": [
          "openai/gpt-4o",
          "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
          "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
      ],
      "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to sort a list"}
      ]
  }

  # Router will choose from only these 3 models
  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

  print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  const payload = {
    model: '@edenai',
    router_candidates: [
      'openai/gpt-4o',
      'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5',
      'google/gemini-2.5-flash'
    ],
    messages: [
      {role: 'user', content: 'Write a Python function to sort a list'}
    ]
  };

  const response = await fetch('https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  });
  ```

  ```bash cURL theme={null}
  curl -X POST https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "@edenai",
      "router_candidates": [
        "openai/gpt-4o",
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
        "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
      ],
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to sort a list"}
      ]
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## When to Use Smart Routing

### ✅ Great Use Cases

* **General-purpose chatbots** - Let the router optimize for diverse queries
* **Cost-sensitive applications** - Router balances quality and cost
* **Multi-task applications** - Different queries benefit from different models
* **Experimentation** - Compare router performance vs. fixed models

### ⚠️ Consider Fixed Models Instead

* **Specific model requirements** - You need a particular model's unique features
* **Latency-critical** - Every 100ms matters (smart routing adds overhead)
* **Consistent behavior** - You need identical model behavior across requests
* **High-volume production** - You've already optimized model selection

## Model Selection Criteria

The routing engine considers multiple factors:

* **Task type** - Code generation, creative writing, analysis, etc.
* **Conversation context** - Prior messages and conversation flow
* **Tool/function calls** - Compatibility with function calling requirements
* **Quality requirements** - Implicit in message complexity
* **Cost efficiency** - Price/performance optimization

## Default Model Pool

When you don't specify `router_candidates`, the system uses all available LLM models, including:

**Top-tier Models:**

* OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-5 (latest versions)
* Anthropic: Claude Haiku, Sonnet, Opus (4.x series)
* Google: Gemini 2.0/2.5/3.0 (Flash and Pro)
* Mistral: Large, Medium, Small models

**Specialized Models:**

* X.AI: Grok 3, Grok 4
* Together.ai: Llama 3/3.1 models
* Cohere: Command R, Command R+
* Perplexity: Sonar

The exact pool is dynamically managed and may change as new models become available.

## Fallback Behavior

Smart routing includes intelligent fallbacks:

1. **With custom candidates** - Falls back to first candidate on routing failure
2. **Without candidates** - Falls back to `openai/gpt-4o` (reliable default)
3. **Transparent errors** - You'll see clear error messages if routing fails completely

<Info>
  **Reliability:** Fallback ensures your requests always succeed, even if the routing service is temporarily unavailable.
</Info>

## Response Format

Smart routing responses are identical to fixed-model responses. The streaming format follows OpenAI's SSE standard:

```
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1234567890,"model":"openai/gpt-4o","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1234567890,"model":"openai/gpt-4o","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"!"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1234567890,"model":"openai/gpt-4o","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}

data: [DONE]
```

<Tip>
  **Tracking:** The `model` field in the response shows which model was selected by the router.
</Tip>

## OpenAI SDK Compatibility

Smart routing works seamlessly with the OpenAI Python SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python (OpenAI SDK) theme={null}
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
      api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
      base_url="https://api.edenai.run/v3/llm"
  )

  # Use smart routing with OpenAI SDK
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="@edenai",
      messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}
      ],
      extra_body={  # Custom parameters
          "router_candidates": [
              "openai/gpt-4o",
              "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
          ]
      }
  )

  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **SDK Integration:** Use `extra_body` to pass the `router_candidates` parameter when using the OpenAI SDK.
</Info>

## Pricing

Smart routing costs are based on the **selected model's pricing**. The routing decision itself is free.

**Example:**

* If router selects `openai/gpt-4o` → You pay GPT-4o rates
* If router selects `google/gemini-2.5-flash` → You pay Gemini Flash rates

The router optimizes for cost-effectiveness, often selecting cheaper models when they meet quality requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### Router returns error "no candidates provided"

**Cause:** Empty `router_candidates` list or all candidates filtered out
**Solution:** Omit `router_candidates` to use default pool, or provide valid model strings

### Higher latency than expected

**Cause:** Routing decision adds 100-500ms overhead
**Solution:** Use fixed models for latency-critical applications

### Unexpected model selection

**Cause:** Router optimizes for multiple factors, not just quality
**Solution:** Use `router_candidates` to limit selection pool, or switch to fixed models

### "Router API unavailable" errors

**Cause:** Temporary routing service outage
**Solution:** System automatically falls back - check if fallback model meets your needs

<Tip>
  **Getting Started:** Start with default routing (`model: "@edenai"`), then customize with `router_candidates` if needed.
