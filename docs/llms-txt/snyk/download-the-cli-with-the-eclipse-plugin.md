# Download the CLI with the Eclipse plugin

When you install the Eclipse plugin and open a file that Snyk supports, the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli) is downloaded automatically unless you have opted out. The [Language Server](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/snyk-language-server) is also downloaded. The Language Server works with the CLI to give you an optimal Eclipse experience.
