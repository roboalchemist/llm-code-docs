# Scan and maintain Projects using the CLI

This group of pages provides detailed "how-to" information for the Snyk CLI.

* The [CLI tools](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools) provide ways to perform tasks that cannot be done using CLI commands and options.
* [Use Snyk Open Source from the CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-open-source), [Analyze code with the Snyk Code CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code), and [Use Snyk Container from the CLI ](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-container)explain how to perform basic operations with Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code, and Snyk Container using the CLI.

The remaining pages address [Scanning Projects](#scanning-projects), [Monitoring Projects](#monitoring-projects), and [Maintaining Projects](#maintaining-projects). The pages are arranged in alphabetical order by keyword.
