# Regional API endpoints

By default, the task uses the <https://api.snyk.io> endpoint. To configure Snyk to use a different endpoint set a `SNYK_API` environment variable in the pipeline, for example, `https://api.eu.snyk.io`.

For more information about environment configuration, see [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli). For more details, see the [list of available regions on the Regional hosting and data residency page](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#available-snyk-regions).

An example follows of how you can modify the Snyk scan task to use an alternate endpoint:

```
variables:
  SNYK_API: https://api.us.snyk.io/
...

- task: SnykSecurityScan@1
  inputs:
   ...
  env:
    SNYK_API: '$(SNYK_API)'
```
