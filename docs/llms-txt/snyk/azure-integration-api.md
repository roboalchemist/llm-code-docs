# Azure Integration: API

To onboard an Azure subscription to Snyk via the API:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template or Bash script:](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/azure-integration-for-cloud-configurations/azure-integration-api/step-1-download-azure-app-registration-iac-template-or-script-api) to give Snyk permissions to scan your subscription.
2. [Create an Entra ID app registration:](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/azure-integration-for-cloud-configurations/azure-integration-api/step-2-create-the-entra-id-app-registration-api) using the template or script you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Cloud Environment.](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/azure-integration-for-cloud-configurations/azure-integration-api/step-3-create-and-scan-a-cloud-environment-for-azure-api)

When you have completed the steps, you will be able to do the following:

* View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See [Manage cloud issues](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/getting-started-with-cloud-scans/manage-cloud-issues).
* Prioritize your vulnerabilities with cloud context.
