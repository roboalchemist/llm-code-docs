# Add project attributes

After importing your projects, you can add metadata to your Projects using [Project Attributes](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-attributes). This allows you to filter and report on specific subsets of your Organization.

For example, if you add Project Attributes to all of your Projects, you can easily filter Projects to those that are "frontend critical vulnerabilities in production" from the Projects page.
