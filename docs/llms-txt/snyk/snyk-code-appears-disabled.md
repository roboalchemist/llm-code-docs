# Snyk Code appears disabled

## **Problem**

Snyk Code is marked as disabled in the IDE plugin. The preferred Organization is set to the one with Snyk Code enabled.

## **Solution**

In your Snyk account (<https://app.snyk.io/account> in `SNYK US-01`), try updating your preferred Organization to another one and then back to the original.
