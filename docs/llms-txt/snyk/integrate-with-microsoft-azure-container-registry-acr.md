# Integrate with Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Snyk integrates with Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR) so you can import your Projects and monitor your containers for vulnerabilities. Snyk tests the Projects you have imported for any known security vulnerabilities found, testing at a frequency you control.

Refer to the following pages for details:

* [Configure integration for ACR](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/container-registry-integrations/integrate-with-microsoft-azure-container-registry-acr/configure-integration-for-acr)
