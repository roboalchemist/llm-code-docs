Snyk supports role-based access control (RBAC). Permissions are granted to users according to their role.

Snyk Enterprise plan customers can [manage user roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management), [change the role of a user](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-role-management#change-the-role-of-a-user) in the Snyk Web UI, or [update member roles using the Snyk API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-management-with-the-api/update-member-roles-using-the-api).

When you create or edit a role, as explained on the [User role management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management) page, the Web UI displays a list of permissions you can associate with each role. For more information, see [Pre-defined user roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles).

There are many considerations involved in managing user roles. See these sections on the [User role management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management) page:

* [Permissions (role) required to edit Project attributes from the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-role-management#permissions-required-to-edit-project-attributes-from-the-snyk-cli)
* [Essential information for working with Member roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/user-role-management#essential-information-for-working-with-member-roles)
