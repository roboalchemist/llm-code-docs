# Advanced configuration for Snyk Broker Docker installation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Multi-tenant settings for regions other than the default**\
When you set up Snyk Broker for use in regions other than the default, additional environment variables with specific URLs are required. For the URLs and examples, see [Regional hosting and data residency, Broker URLs](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#broker-server-urls).
