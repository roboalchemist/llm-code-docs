# Create Organizations

You can use the [API-import tool](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import) and [create organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import/creating-organizations-in-snyk) accordingly.

See the [Snyk Account Structure](https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/groups-and-organizations/) lesson and the [Manage Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations/create-and-delete-organizations) documentation for how to create Organizations manually.
