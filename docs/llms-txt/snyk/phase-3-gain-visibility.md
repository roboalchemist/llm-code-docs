# Phase 3: Gain visibility

After the [Account configuration](https://docs.snyk.io/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-your-organization) phase is complete, you can import your repositories to scan your applications.

When importing your repositories, Snyk scans the contents to find all supported files and creates them in Snyk as Projects (for example, open-source manifest files, code files, IaC configuration files). For details, see [Import Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/import-projects).

You can optionally add Project Attributes, which can be useful to filter and organize your Projects when creating collections.
