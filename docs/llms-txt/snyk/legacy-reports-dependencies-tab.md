# Legacy reports dependencies tab

The **Dependencies** tab acts as a Bill Of Materials (BOM) for all the direct dependencies in all of the Projects in the selected Organization. This allows you to quickly and easily identify which Projects have a specific version of a dependency.

Dependencies information is available from the **Dependencies** menu option - see [View dependencies](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/reporting/dependencies-and-licenses/view-dependencies) for more details.
