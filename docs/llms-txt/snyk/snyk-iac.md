# Snyk IaC

With Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you can secure cloud infrastructure configurations before and after deployment.

With Snyk IaC, you can:

* Write secure configurations for [HashiCorp Terraform](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-terraform-files), [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-cloudformation-files), [Kubernetes](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-kubernetes-configuration-files), and [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-arm-configuration-files) - for IDE, SCM, CLI, and Terraform Cloud/Enterprise workflows.
* View issues and receive [fix advice](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/getting-started-with-current-iac) so you can make changes directly to code, before applications reach production.
* [Detect manually created resources](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/detect-manually-created-resources) in your cloud.
* Onboard, scan, and test deployed cloud environments for misconfigurations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments.
