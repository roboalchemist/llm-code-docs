# Troubleshoot fixing vulnerabilities with Snyk Open Source

When you find a vulnerability, you have the opportunity to report that vulnerability to Snyk. For details, see [Disclosure of a vulnerability in an open-source package](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-data-and-governance/disclosure-of-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

## Unable to open a pull request or merge request for issues found by Snyk

When you import a Project, either through integration or by using the CLI, both CLI and SCM projects receive fix advice, while SCM projects additionally offer the option to open a Fix PR.

Snyk does not open PRs for transitive dependencies. For more information, see [Fixing transitive dependencies](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/vulnerability-fix-types#fixing-transitive-dependencies).

## Languages supported for Fix Pull Requests or Merge Requests

Snyk can generate Fix Pull Requests (Fix PRs) or Merge Requests (MRs) for dependencies that may have a patch or an upgrade that will fix a vulnerability.

Snyk supports creating Fix PRs or MRs for the following languages:
