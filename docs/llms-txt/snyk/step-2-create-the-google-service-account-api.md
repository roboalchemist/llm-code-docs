The process to create the Google service account is the same whether you are using the Snyk Web UI or Snyk API to onboard your Google Project. Follow the instructions in [Step 2: Create the Google service account (Web UI)](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/google-cloud-integration/google-cloud-integration-web-ui/step-2-create-the-google-service-account-web-ui), and then return here to continue onboarding your Project.
