## Brownouts

Brownouts occur when Snyk temporarily suspends an API endpoint or a feature, making it unavailable for use. This situation indicates that the resource or service is still operational, but its performance is reduced compared to its normal or expected capacity.

### End of support features

When a feature transitions to an end-of-support stage, both development and support work are terminated.

The documentation page will announce the transition of a feature to End of Support six months before its start date.

### End of Life features

A feature can also be the subject of an end-of-life event, meaning that the feature or capability impacted by this process ceases to exist and is removed from the product and public documentation.

API endpoints have a dedicated section for the end of life process and also provide details about the migration steps. Navigate to the [API End of Life process and migration guides](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides) for more details.
