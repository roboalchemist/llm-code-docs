## Overview of compliance reporting

Snyk IaC supports [compliance reporting](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/reporting/available-snyk-reports#cloud-compliance-issues-report) and [cloud issue](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/getting-started-with-cloud-scans/manage-cloud-issues) triage for compliance standards and controls relevant to cloud services. With this information, developers can fix issues to bring cloud environments into compliance, and auditors can see appropriate evidence.

* To learn how to view the compliance report, see [Cloud Compliance Issues Report](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/reporting/available-snyk-reports#cloud-compliance-issues-report).
* To learn how to triage cloud issues by filtering them according to compliance standards and controls, see [Filter issues](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/getting-started-with-cloud-scans/manage-cloud-issues/view-cloud-issues-in-the-snyk-web-ui#filter-issues).

See [Key concepts](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/getting-started-with-cloud-scans/key-concepts-for-cloud-scans) for definitions of compliance standards and controls, security rules, and more.
