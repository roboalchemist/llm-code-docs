# AWS Lambda setup: expose a public URL

For Snyk to be able to send webhooks to the Lambda function you will need a public URL exposing the function. To do this you have two options, [API Gateway](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/using-specific-snyk-apis/webhooks-apis/guides-to-webhooks/how-to-use-snyk-webhooks-to-connect-snyk-to-slack-with-aws-lambda/aws-lambda-setup-set-up-the-trigger/with-api-gateway) or a [Lambda function URL](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/using-specific-snyk-apis/webhooks-apis/guides-to-webhooks/how-to-use-snyk-webhooks-to-connect-snyk-to-slack-with-aws-lambda/aws-lambda-setup-set-up-the-trigger/with-a-lambda-function-url). Choose the option that suits your current environments or needs the best.
