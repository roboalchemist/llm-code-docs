# Configure your Bitbucket Pipelines integration

To enable Snyk to test and monitor your code as an integral part of your CI/CD workflow in Bitbucket, add the Snyk pipe into your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` (YAML) file located in the root of your repository.

This file defines all your build configurations, that is, the pipelines for your CI/CD workflow.
