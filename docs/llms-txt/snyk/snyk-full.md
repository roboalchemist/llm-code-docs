# What's Snyk?

Snyk is a platform that allows you to scan, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in your code, open-source dependencies, container images, and infrastructure as code configurations. The Snyk platform uses a risk-based approach, focusing security efforts on issues that matter, and eliminating the noise of vulnerabilities that have no meaningful impact.

To manage and govern the security program, Snyk gives security teams immediate visibility into coverage and business context across all application assets, smart policies to automate and scale in large environments, and analytics and reporting to measure the performance of your security program.

* Snyk Open Source and Snyk Code: see [Supported languages, package managers, and frameworks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/supported-languages/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks).
* Snyk Container: see [Supported operating system distributions](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/how-snyk-container-works/operating-system-distributions-supported-by-snyk-container).
* Snyk Infrastructure as Code: see [Supported IaC and cloud providers](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/supported-iac-languages-cloud-providers-and-cloud-resources).
* Snyk Essentials: see [Snyk Essentials](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-essentials)
* Snyk API & Web: see [Snyk API & Web](https://snyk.io/product/dast-api-web/).

## The Snyk developer-first approach

Snyk provides visibility in a developer’s workflow and actionable insights. The benefit is engaging developers in security practices as part of their development work. Thus, the focus is on building a secure application rather than overhead-intensive work, such as putting in hard QA gates.

Developers now assemble applications with a combination of proprietary and open-source code, run that code in containers, and then deploy with infrastructure as code configurations using technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform.

A robust security process secures each component where they are built and maintained. Snyk integrates into DevOps processes to work with developers using the methods each prefers, while following and supporting industry best practices. Snyk integrates directly into your IDEs, workflows, and automation pipelines to add security expertise to your toolkit.

## Use Snyk in your workflow

* Secure your code: use [Snyk Open Source](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source) to fix vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies and [Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-code) to fix vulnerabilities in your source code.
* Secure your containers: use [Snyk Container](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container) to fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes applications.
* Secure your infrastructure: use [Snyk Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac) (IaC) to fix misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Azure templates.

## Choose how to run Snyk

You can run Snyk in the following ways:

* Web: the Snyk Web UI ([app.snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io)) provides a browser-based experience with functions such as configuration settings, filtering and fixing discovered issues, and reports.
* [CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli): the Snyk Command Line Interface enables you to run vulnerability scans on your local machine and integrate Snyk into your pipeline.
* [IDEs](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions): the Snyk IDE integrations enable you to embed Snyk in your development environment.
* [API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/snyk-api): the Snyk API enables you to integrate with Snyk programmatically, tuning Snyk security automation to your specific workflows.

## What can Snyk integrate with?

Snyk integrations for your software development process allow you to integrate Snyk into your development and security processes, including source control, IDE, CI/CD, and many others.

For details, see [Integrate with Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/integrations/integrate-with-snyk).

## **What does Snyk cost?**

# Getting started

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure you use languages, package managers, and frameworks supported by Snyk. See [Supported languages, package managers, and frameworks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/supported-languages/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks).
{% endhint %}

## Supported browsers

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk does not support Microsoft Internet Explorer.
{% endhint %}

Snyk supports the latest versions of the following web browsers:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?form=MA13FJ)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (except for [Opening Fix PR](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-pull-or-merge-requests))

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk requires Javascript to be enabled on your browser.
{% endhint %}

To start performing basic tasks in the Snyk application:

## Create or log in to a Snyk account

To create a free account or sign up for a pricing plan, navigate to [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/). For details, see [Snyk Pricing Plans](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/trial-limitations).

If your company has an existing Snyk account and uses single sign-on (SSO), use the SSO link provided by your administrators.

If your company requires an invitation to use Snyk, when you log in for the first time, you may see a list of Organizations, which in Snyk control access to Projects. To request access to an Organization, select the name of an Organization Admin in order to request access.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you log in with a different authentication provider from the one your company uses for the Snyk account, you create a new account. You will not be logged in to the correct Organization for your company.
{% endhint %}

When you log in to the Snyk Web UI, Snyk shows your preferred (default) Organization. Snyk also uses the settings for your preferred Organization when you test a Project locally using the CLI.

## Set up a Snyk integration

For Snyk to know where to scan, you must provide it with access to your environment. The type of integration you need depends on what systems you use, what you want to scan, and where you want to add the integrations - [Organization](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/integrations/integrate-with-snyk) or [Group](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/integrations/integrate-with-snyk). For information about available integrators, see [Snyk SCM integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations) and [Integrate with Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/integrations/integrate-with-snyk).

To scan your code, you must first integrate Snyk with the repository holding that code.

### Guided process

After creating a Snyk account, you can follow the optional getting-started walkthrough prompts to provide information and help Snyk guide your experience. This includes choosing an integration method, setting access permissions, configuring automation settings, and authenticating that integration.

Alternatively, if you want to scan your code without authenticating to your source code repository, you can select the CLI integration. This allows you to run scans from your local machine and upload results to your Organization in Snyk.

### Manual process

You can add an integration to Snyk manually at any point from the Snyk Web UI. To do this, navigate to **Integrations** > **Source Control**. For more information, see [Integrate with Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/integrations/integrate-with-snyk).

{% hint style="info" %}
If an integration is already configured for your Organization, it is marked as **Configured**.
{% endhint %}

## Obtain and use your Snyk API token

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before authenticating, be sure you have set your region properly. For details, see [Regional hosting and data residency](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency), which has the [list of regional URLs](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#regional-urls).
{% endhint %}

Your Snyk API token is a personal token available under your user profile. The Snyk API token is associated with your Snyk Account and not with a specific Organization.

Free and Team plan and trial users have access only to this personal token under the user profile. The personal token can be used to authenticate with the Snyk CLI running on a local or a build machine and an IDE when you are setting a token manually. Use a personal token with caution if you are authenticating for CI/CD or with the API, which is available for Enterprise plan users only.

To obtain your personal Snyk API token:

1. Log in to Snyk and navigate to your personal account settings.
2. In your **General** settings, under API Token, select **click to show**.
3. Highlight and copy your API key.

If you want a new API token, select **Revoke & Regenerate**, but be aware that this will make the previous API token invalid.

For information on when to use an API token and when to use a service account token, available to Enterprise plan users only, see [Authentication for API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/authentication-for-api).

## Import a Project to scan and identify issues

Snyk Projects are items that Snyk scans for issues, for example, a manifest file listing your open-source dependencies.

When you import a Project, Snyk scans that imported Project, and displays the results for you to review.

Importing a Project also does the following:

* Sets Snyk to run a regular scan on that Project for issues. See [Usage settings](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/usage-settings).
* Initiates some automation, especially default Snyk tests on pull and merge requests, which help prevent vulnerabilities from being added to the Project. This automation fails builds according to your conditions and can be disabled or customized in your [integration settings](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations).

## Set up Snyk Essentials

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk Essentials is available only with Enterprise plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
{% endhint %}

Snyk Essentials enables Application Security teams to implement, manage, and scale a modern, high-performing, developer security program. It covers use cases under Application Security Posture Management (ASPM).

For more information, see [Snyk Essentials](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-essentials).

## Review results and fix your issues

After you have imported a Project, and Snyk has scanned that Project for issues, you can view the results of your scan and take action to fix issues. You can see the number of issues found, grouped by severity level (**C**ritical, **H**igh, **M**edium or **L**ow). For details, see [Severity levels](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/severity-levels).

The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

* Open-source libraries: see [Snyk Open Source](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source).
* Application code: see [Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-code).
* Container images: see [Snyk Container](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/scan-container-images).
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform configuration files and cloud misconfigurations: see [Snyk IaC](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac).

### End of support features

When a feature transitions to an end-of-support stage, both development and support work are terminated.

The documentation page will announce the transition of a feature to End of Support six months before its start date.

### End of Life features

A feature can also be the subject of an end-of-life event, meaning that the feature or capability impacted by this process ceases to exist and is removed from the product and public documentation.

API endpoints have a dedicated section for the end of life process and also provide details about the migration steps. Navigate to the [API End of Life process and migration guides](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides) for more details.

### Advisor

See [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/).

### Agent

A software entity that uses an artificial intelligence model to reason, make decisions, and take autonomous actions to achieve a goal. It uses LLMs and various tools, memory, and external systems, not just generated text, to accomplish a specific task on the user’s behalf.

### Agent frameworks

Software libraries and platforms that provide the tools to build, manage, and coordinate the behavior of autonomous AI agents.

### AI evaluation

The process of measuring an AI system’s performance, quality, and safety against defined goals and benchmarks, using tests, metrics, and human judgement.

Snyk requires users to log in to the platform before they become active users and are available for assignments.
{% endhint %}

## Who can create assignments?

By default, only Snyk Org or Group admins can create assignments. Group admins can create custom roles by using the standard Snyk workflow. Learn more about the access controls for assignments at [Snyk Learn Access Controls](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/discover-snyk/snyk-learn/snyk-learn-access-controls).

# Snyk Learn access controls

This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to manage Snyk Learn access control.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Assignment permissions are available in the Snyk Learning Management add-on offering. Report permissions are available to Snyk Enterprise plan customers. For more information, contact your Snyk account team.
{% endhint %}

**Snyk Learn Access Controls** functionality enables you to manage user permissions for Snyk Learn using the same [access control model](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management) as the Snyk Platform. A Group Admin can create custom roles with a set of permissions related to Snyk Learn Assignments. These roles can reflect users and functions in the Organization. For example, you can limit permissions for education and training management functionality for Snyk Learn to the user who is the education and training manager at your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
Group and Organization Admins have access to Snyk Learn Reports and Assignments by default without extra permissions.
{% endhint %}

#### Assignments

To grant permissions for access to Assignments beyond the default Organization and Group Admin roles, you must create a [custom role](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/custom-role-templates/snyk-learn-learning-admin) with a set of permissions for assignments. The custom role must have the View Users permission in order for managing assignments to work. The following lists the permissions for managing assignments:

* View Organization assignments
* Edit Organization assignments
* Create Organization assignments
* Delete Organization assignments

After the role is created, a Group or Organization administrator can give this role to users of Snyk.

For more information, see [Snyk Learn Assignments](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/discover-snyk/snyk-learn/snyk-learn-assignments).

#### Reports

To grant permissions for access to Reports beyond the default Organization and Group Admin roles, you must create a [custom role](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/custom-role-templates/snyk-learn-learning-admin) with a set of permissions for reports. The custom role must have the View Reports permission for viewing and exporting reports to work. The following lists the permissions for viewing and exporting reports:

* View Organization reports

After the role is created, a Group or Organization administrator can give this role to users of Snyk.

# Overview

Implementing a developer security tool like Snyk is critical to ensuring the security of your applications, from development through deployment. Whatever the size of your team, the goals are to fix vulnerabilities and foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility across your entire business.

Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate your current security practices and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Planning**: use the provided project plans to outline your goals, timelines, and necessary resources.
3. **Configuration**: Follow configuration guidance to tailor the security platform to your needs, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with your existing tools and workflows.
4. **Rollout**: Implement the platform across your development teams, following the specific guidance for small teams or enterprise environments.
5. **Training**: Educate your developers on the importance of security and how to use the platform effectively.
6. **Monitoring and iteration**: Continuously monitor the health and performance of your applications and make adjustments as needed to maintain optimal security.

If you have a small team looking for guidance on rolling out Snyk within your processes, see the [Team implementation guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide).

If you are part of an enterprise implementing a large-scale rollout, see the [Enterprise implementation guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide).

The guides include a downloadable project plan, a planning phase, configuration guidance, and guidance on rollout specific to each context.


# Team implementation guide

Accelerate your team performance by using Snyk. This guide aims to help you implement Snyk for your team. The team plan applies to teams of up to 10 members.

We start with the awareness that most businesses:

* Have a backlog of issues in their existing software
* Are continuously creating new software and need to secure new code.

## **Typical timelines**

Once your Snyk Organization is set up, you can immediately start gaining visibility into your code by integrating your code repositories (with PR checks disabled), CI/CD pipelines, or container registries.

To minimize disruption, Snyk recommends a gradual rollout of your "shift left" security strategy, focusing on backlog remediation and prevention. Key recommendations include providing developers with access to the IDE and piloting on a single Project before expanding best practices to the wider team.

## Implementation strategy overview

This guide is composed of multiple phases, outlining a series of actions configuring your account, as well as actions outside the system, that align with the following goals:

* [Achieve visibility](#achieve-visibility)
* [Achieve prevention and drive developer adoption](#achieve-prevention-and-drive-developer-adoption)
* [Fix the backlog and triage issues](#fix-the-backlog-and-triage-issues)

### Achieve visibility

If you focus on visibility first, you can get a clear sense of the security issues, but without always fixing them.

{% hint style="info" %}
This does not stop you from fixing issues using Snyk. You can start fixing issues early, but the emphasis is to avoid blocking development early on, build trust, and slowly introduce gating in later phases, usually the prevention phase. This is true of the smallest or largest teams - communication is key.
{% endhint %}

Visibility achieves a broad view of security across your application portfolio, avoids Snyk scans being seen as a blocker, and minimizes impact on development processes.

This visibility helps build trust while rolling out Snyk. With the Team plan, this equates to onboarding your projects through Git repository and disabling PR Checks/Auto PRs in the integration settings. Choose an important project and enable PR checks after communicating with the relevant team members. This guide details this later on.

### Achieve prevention and drive developer adoption

Next is the prevention stage. You should stop new security issues from being added to your applications. During this stage, you can put controls in place to allow developers to see issues in their pipelines using Pull Request (PR)/Merge Request (MR) checks, and checks in the pipeline that may block.

As part of this, developers may use IDE plugins and other tools like [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor) to select secure packages and [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io/) to educate on secure coding, security, and the product. It's quite common to see developers download and use IDE plugins. Provide guides indicating the settings they should use and guidelines on what they should fix to start often Criticals and Highs, where fixes are available.

### Fix the backlog and triage issues

Finally, you can focus on fixing your backlog of security issues. This can take several forms:

* As part of the initial rollout, security or initial stakeholder may triage the initial results for the existing portfolio, create tickets for priority items to investigate or address, or have the teams do that for their applications as part of the weekly triage process.
* After getting visibility and achieving prevention, you can look at your backlog of issues. For example, a weekly triage process with the key stakeholders can guide the teams on what to address.

## Use enhanced resources with Snyk

Snyk was built with developers in mind, providing:

* Tools to create secure applications using integrations for IDE, Git, and CI/CD.
* [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor) and other tools to make decisions.
* [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io) training materials on products, securing code, and best practices.


# Prerequisites: project plan templates

The templates provided below are the basis of the following sections of this guide.\

# Phase 1: Discovery and planning

## Discovery phase steps

* [Validate your Snyk plan](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/validate-your-snyk-plan): confirm your license has been applied correctly.
* [Conduct discovery](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/discovery): identify stakeholders, integrations, and applications to monitor.
* [Name your Organization](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/name-your-organization): decide what to name your Organization.
* [Determine user roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/determine-member-roles): who will be administrators?
* [Plan for success](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/plan-for-success): decide how to judge the success of your rollout.
* [Choose rollout integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/choose-rollout-integrations): decide which integrations to implement initially.
* [Create rollout plan](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/create-rollout-plan): create your high-level plan for rolling out Snyk in your business.

## General pre-rollout questions

Before starting rollout, here are some initial questions you can ask to assist in planning, as an alternative way of deciding your rollout planning process.

### Who's involved?

* Who will manage and oversee the project?
* Who will champion Snyk?
* Who will be the administrators?

### What are your goals?

* Why did you choose Snyk?
* Why are you implementing it now?

### How will your users use Snyk?

How will you provision users, and integrate Snyk with your platforms?

* Who will need access to Snyk?
* Who can grant Snyk access to platforms like Git Repositories?

### What will you name your Organization?

* What will you name the Organization in Snyk? The Organization name will be public to all users.

### How will you measure success?

* What KPIs will be tracked?
* How will you know you’re making progress?
* Are there key development projects that progress tracking should be aligned with, or at least included to measure progress against?


# Validate your Snyk plan

Confirm your Snyk license has been applied correctly. Navigate to your Organization by clicking the Organization name on the left menu and click **Settings**. Confirm the license has been applied to this Organization by reviewing Usage, Plans, and Billing. Tests should be unlimited for the products purchased, and a Team plan should be indicated.

The proper license setup ensures you can fully use Snyk capabilities without limitations. It also guarantees you remain compliant with Snyk terms of use. If the license was incorrectly assigned, contact Snyk support.


# Discovery

## Identify business-critical applications

Identifying key applications early helps you identify important contacts to make, helps define success metrics, and helps early prioritization. Your business may have thousands of applications, but can you identify a few key applications to benchmark progress and priority?

For large enterprises, you can import everything, but that additional information can be collected in parallel to help prioritize work and measure success. This should not be a blocker or delay, it can be done in parallel in the planning and implementation phases.

## For implementations in smaller organizations/startups - confirm internal points of contact and roles

To successfully implement Snyk, you must identify the skills needed and the stakeholders who will be involved. For example, you must identify people who can:

* Perform the initial setup/admin tasks.
* The developers who may want to trial the workflows/functionality.
* Generate tokens with the necessary permissions for git repositories, and other integrations being considered like Jira, or container registries.
* Modify pipeline scripts.
* Who would want input on open-source licensing if this was a priority for purchasing, otherwise the default policy is often sufficient.
* Any stakeholders that need to be reported to.

## For implementations for a Team plan within an Enterprise - identify stakeholders with a RACI matrix

In smaller organizations where a few individuals may have the necessary access, involving the stakeholders can be quick and easy. For a small team, early startup, it can be as simple as finding who can create credentials for Snyk to access the system or update a CI/CD script. In a larger enterprise, where you may have a single team using Snyk, this tends to be more organizationally complex, and the following RACI matrix can assist in determining:

* **R**esponsible: the person ultimately accountable for carrying out the task or deliverable.
* **A**ccountable: the approver who must sign off on work before it is considered complete.
* **C**onsulted: those whose opinions are sought, two-way communication.
* **I**nformed: kept up-to-date on progress, one-way communication.

For large enterprises, the following RACI matrix is useful to clearly define roles and responsibilities during rollout:

<table><thead><tr><th width="179">Task</th><th width="136">Champion</th><th width="146">Admin</th><th width="132">Security</th><th>DevOps</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Onboarding</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>Admin Training</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>Security Training</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>DevOps Training</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Accountable</td></tr><tr><td>Source Control/IDE/PIPELINE Setup</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Accountable</td></tr><tr><td>License Policy Management</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Accountable</td></tr><tr><td>Security Triage</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Consulted</td></tr></tbody></table>

This ensures all stakeholders are engaged in suitable capacities without duplicated or neglected efforts. Following the matrix enables smooth collaboration, with individuals contributing specialized skills within their designated areas.

The clear delineation of duties promotes productivity, efficiency, and accountability. Overall, the RACI framework is an effective method for orchestrating a structured, well-coordinated onboarding process resulting in the successful implementation of Snyk.


# Name your Organization

Organizations contain your scan, setup integrations, and view results.

* A Group is only available on the Enterprise plan, typically named after the company or line of business.
* An Organization on the Team plan is the topmost level and is typically named after the company or name given to that company's Organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Team plan consists of one licensed Organization for your use.
{% endhint %}

The first step is to set the name of your Organization to be used by Snyk and others when referring to Snyk.

## Introduction to structure

<div align="left"><figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-93173639159011685ce8b0d83cb5bbf1acd8e974%2Fdetermine-account-structure.png?alt=media" alt="Determine your account structure" width="563"><figcaption><p>Determine your account structure</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Snyk uses a hierarchical approach to managing assets, access, and rollup reporting.

* **Snyk Group -** For Snyk Enterprise customers only. This is the top entity used to group Organizations.
* **Snyk Organizations**: below the Group level, typically representing:

  * Line of business
  * Git Organization or team structure
  * Types of application
  * Development teams.

  In the context of Snyk Team or Free plans, you are entitled to a single Organization. The expectation is usually to use a company name, or if there are several different teams with team plans in your company, use the company name with your team name or line of business as the name. For example, "Company - Team Name"
* **Snyk Projects:** The targets you have tested/monitored with Snyk, such as a CLI scan, a container being monitored in registry, or open source files identified.

For more details, see [Manage Groups and Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have hundreds or thousands of repositories, consider the Snyk Enterprise plan for access to multiple organizations to restrict access, separate reporting, and manageable lists to interact with.
{% endhint %}


# Determine user roles

## Default roles

A key consideration when setting up Snyk is determining which [default user roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles) align with your needs.

The Team plan has the following fixed roles in Snyk, each with a fixed set of permissions. These permissions cannot be changed on the Team plan.

The following are the default roles:

* **Org Admin**: Typically assigned to team leads. Users with this role can add/delete Projects, override Snyk checks, and provision users. It is common to assign this to team leads, admins, and security team users.
* **Org Collaborator**: This is the default role in Snyk used for developers. This role is ideal for small teams or for a very developer-first organizational approach.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need more granularity in roles/permissions, consider upgrading to Snyk Enterprise Plan to access Custom Roles and SSO functionality.
{% endhint %}


# Plan for success

## Determine success metrics with Snyk

Implementing Snyk provides an opportunity to enhance your application security. But how do you know if you're getting the most out of it? Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential measurements that track Snyk's impact and help guide your security journey.

KPIs give you valuable insights by monitoring key metrics at each adoption phase - from raising awareness to preventing new issues. They help you:

* Assess progress toward security goals
* Identify areas needing improvement
* Demonstrate Snyk's value to stakeholders

Tracking metrics aligned to each stage provides tangible insights into what's working well and where improvements may be needed. KPIs help optimize your use of Snyk and progress your application security program.

## Example metrics

These are just some potential examples of success metrics to consider. Analyzing relevant data points at each stage can provide insight into what's working well and identify areas for improvement.

### Gain visibility

* Percentage of Projects that have been successfully scanned for vulnerabilities
* The number of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities identified
* Mean time to complete the initial scan for a Project
* Progress in prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity level

### Prevent new issues

* Percentage of pull requests or builds that are failing based on Snyk automation
* Reduction in new vulnerabilities introduced after automation is turned on
* Time taken to address blocked pull requests and resolve them

### Build awareness

* Number of developers who have been introduced to Snyk
* Percentage of Projects that have been tested with Snyk during this phase

### Fix backlog

* Percentage of existing vulnerabilities that have been resolved
* Mean time to fix vulnerabilities from the backlog
* Number of auto-fix pull requests raised and successfully merged
* Progress in using Jira integration for managing vulnerabilities and tracking fixes


# Choose rollout integrations

## **SDLC integration points**

Snyk offers many integrations that seamlessly integrate into every stage of the SDLC.

Many businesses typically roll out automated solutions first, then slowly introduce tools to enable the developers. In addition, gating features are gradually turned on over a period of time to minimize disruption.

{% hint style="info" %}
As using multiple integrations can result in duplicate reporting of issues, you do not initially need to implement more than one integration type. For example, you can start by importing everything with Git repositories, then later use the CI/CD view for fine-grained detail (potentially removing the source control integration if both views are not desired).
{% endhint %}

## Integration types

Below are typical early integrations.

### Source Code Management (SCM) integrations

Integrations with popular version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, and Bitbucket seamlessly integrate Snyk security checks into the code review process. This ensures that potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before the code is merged into the main branch. Important features include:

* Daily testing/monitoring of a specified branch (typically "development" branch),
* (optional) Pull Request/Merge Request checks against any branch of the repository.
* (optional) Automated dependency upgrades and automated security fix upgrades using pull requests.

Advantages:

* Visibility into repository security posture
* Automatic Scan on code change
* Immediate feedback on issues for the developer
* Onboarding of repositories can be configured using the UI
* Supports Cloud Repositories on the Team plan

For more details, see [Git repositories (SCMs)](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a non-cloud-facing or your own instance of a Git SCM:

* Consider deploying a [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker) for Snyk to communicate with your repositories, which would also require a Snyk Enterprise Plan.
* Enterprise customers can enable and manage Snyk Broker using the API.

[Paid services](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/snyk-terms-of-support-and-services-glossary) can be engaged to assist in Broker deployments.
{% endhint %}

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline integrations

Integrating Snyk into CI/CD pipelines, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI, automates security checks during the build and deployment process. This ensures that vulnerabilities are detected early in the software development lifecycle and prevents their propagation into production. Typical features include:

* (Optional) Ability to passively monitor results during build and view results in Snyk
* (Optional) Ability to test and potentially break the build based on criteria you specified
* Integration can be achieved with specific Marketplace plugins or more generally, with the CLI as part of your pipeline script.

Advantages:

* Assess local code vulnerabilities
* Full control over testing (which tests to run, where in the build script)
* Can automate using CI/CD

For more details, see [Snyk CI/CD integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations).

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integrations

IDE integrations like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse allow developers to access Snyk's security features directly within their coding environment. This enables real-time scanning and issue remediation as developers write code at the earliest possible stages.

For more details, see [Use Snyk in your IDE](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions).

## Additional considerations

### Infrastructure as Code

For Snyk Infrastructure as Code, it is common that your Terraform or YAML configuration files are held in your SCM, but they may be in a separate area or repository. As a result, consider if there are other areas you need to import. You may also want to integrate with Terraform Cloud (if applicable) to enable Snyk tests as part of your "Terraform run" processes.

For complex environments, modules, and highly templated implementations, utilizing the CLI on your Terraform Plan file may provide the best results.

### CR (Container Registries)

Snyk also integrates with various [Container Registries](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/container-registry-integrations) to enable you to import and monitor your containers for vulnerabilities. Snyk tests the containers you have imported for any known security vulnerabilities found at a frequency you control.


# Create rollout plan

Every business is different. If your teams have already used security tools and are in a heavily compliance-focused industry, controls may be turned on relatively more quickly. However, if security as part of development is new, rolling out tools and controls in phases is strongly suggested.

## Suggested onboarding approach

When you are introducing Snyk to your business, Snyk suggests the following phased rollout after configuring integrations.

### 1. Kick off with a pilot team

Start by selecting a small group of engaged pilot users from:

* Application security teams (if applicable)
* Project teams building new applications
* Developers of business-critical applications.

This allows you to:

* Thoroughly onboard initial users
* Gather feedback to refine processes
* Identify issues before the broader rollout
* Build success stories to promote Snyk.

Typically, importing everything using a repository integration for visibility and working through the rollout with a small pilot team allows you to identify the best processes and ways to implement Snyk within your environment.

### 2. Gain visibility with Git repository integration

Next, set up Snyk integrations across your Git repositories to gain broad visibility into your security posture.

{% hint style="info" %}
To reduce noise, disable notifications before import if you have onboarded all your users.
{% endhint %}

The key advantages of using this process are:

* Widespread scanning across your codebase
* Automatic scanning triggered on code changes
* A convenient way to gain coverage.

### 3. Prioritize key applications

Have your pilot team focus on securing priority applications using targeted Snyk CLI scans.

The key advantages of using this process are:

* Enhanced visibility into critical apps
* Fine-tuned CLI testing for precision
* Removing repo noise for a focused view.

### 4. Expand access

With priorities addressed and processes refined, start expanding access more broadly across teams.

This phased approach allows thoughtful onboarding while rapidly gaining visibility and control.

### 5. Turn on gating

After the first month, gradually turn on gating measures.

* Pull Request/Merge Request Checks using criteria such as `severity` and `is fixable`.
* Fail builds based on criteria such as `High` or `Critical`, `CVSS`, `Mature Exploit` for Open Source and other criteria using the [Snyk Filter](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-filter) plugin.

It's recommended to start with a few applications, especially during the pilot team phase, work through the processes then roll out more widely.

## Exception handling

Ensure there is an exception process in place and users are aware. For example:

* If a pull request/merge request is failed by Snyk, let the users know who is the Snyk admin who can override it.
* Similarly, if Snyk fails in CI/CD, let users know who can create an ignore rule, authorize it to progress, or configure CI/CD to run without the Snyk `test` or set it to `monitor` only.


# Phase 2: Configure your Organization

## Name your Organization

This step is easiest performed prior to purchasing the license. If you did not, Snyk support can assist you.

### Changing the name prior to purchase

Click the arrows next to your Organization name, click **Create New Organization**. From the **Settings-Plans and Billing** page, purchase a team plan.

### Changing the name after purchase

After determining the name of your Organization in phase 1, navigate to **Settings** in the Snyk web UI and update your **Organization** **name**.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must contact Snyk support and submit a ticket to update the url slug. This can impact any existing CI/CD scripts that your team has previously created, so this step should be performed as early as possible and be communicated to your team if CLI has been in use for a while.
{% endhint %}

## Additional settings to consider

* Enable Snyk Code, if purchased, under **Settings-Snyk Code**.
* Require reason to ignore issues in **Settings**.
* Disable notifications at the Organization level under **Settings**. You can re-enable notifications after importing in the later step. This reduces noise during early testing/importing and is more appropriate for a steady state of the implementation.

### License policy (optional)

Snyk comes with a default policy. You can find this under **Settings-Licenses** if your team wants to add custom text when an issue is found or change severities for specific licenses.

Administrators can set license policies to define Snyk behavior for treating license issues. For example, you can allow or disallow packages with certain license types to avoid using packages containing incompatible licenses.

By default, Snyk determines the severity of licenses as follows:

* High severity - licenses that present issues for commercial software.
* Medium severity - licenses that have clauses that may be of concern and should be reviewed.

Configure policies to match your requirements.

For details, see [Getting Started with Snyk License Compliance Management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/scan-open-source-libraries-and-licenses/snyk-license-compliance-management).


# Configure integrations

Integrate Git or CI/CD integrations as identified in the previous phase.

## Git repositories

For Git integration, Snyk suggests the following settings:

To disable gating initially, use the daily monitoring that is automatically configured when a Project is onboarded in Snyk, and disable the following PR/MR Checks in the configuration settings:

* Automatic fixes Snyk can position
  * Automatic fix PRs
  * Automatic dependency upgrade PRs
  * Snyk vulnerability patches.
* Pull request status checks for
  * Open Source security and licenses
  * Code analysis

## CI/CD (Build pipelines)

Keep your applications secure by preventing deployment of vulnerable applications or components (registries), adding Snyk in the build as a step of the pipeline.

The CLI provides:

* Better resolution of dependencies for a number of specific package managers (such as Scala, Gradle, and GO).
* Supports private packages without having to configure an additional integration, providing that your build environment will have access to your private packages.
* Give visibility to components that are pushed to production by either breaking builds and reporting to Snyk or only reporting to Snyk.

There are several [CI/CD integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations) available, or you can use the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli) as part of your pipeline, in order to have more flexibility in the tests you are running.

In the initial phase, Snyk recommends using the “monitor” feature to import information into Snyk so you can see any discovered issues (unless you are already importing your repos using a source control integration to achieve this). Later, when you want to start gating/blocking new vulnerabilities from being added, you can introduce “test” features - initially failing builds on critical issues and then gradually adapting the fail criteria over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
For `snyk iac test --report`, finding issues will result in the build possibly stopping with a non-zero response code.\
\
If you want to test passively, the inclusion of the `--report` argument requires either setting the build step to always continue or an alternative like concatenating logic equating to "or true" (for example `snyk iac test --report || true`). The exact syntax depends on the ecosystem the CLI is run in.
{% endhint %}

When configuring pipelines, you can use popular plugins like [`snyk-filter`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-filter) for advanced filtering.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some plugins that require API access may not be usable on the Team plan, as API access is available on the Snyk Enterprise plan.
{% endhint %}

To see demonstrations of pipeline integrations, see [Snyk-Labs](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples).


# Phase 3: Gain visibility

After the [Account configuration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-your-organization) phase is complete, you can import your repositories to scan your applications.

When importing your repositories, Snyk scans the contents to find all supported files and creates them in Snyk as Projects (for example, open-source manifest files, code files, IaC configuration files). For details, see [Import Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/import-projects).

You can optionally add Project Attributes, which can be useful to filter and organize your Projects when creating collections.


# Import Projects

Depending on the integrations you have configured, and the language / package managers in your tech stack, you can import Projects into Snyk using:

* A source control integration with your Git repositories
* The Snyk CLI with CI/CD.

The best import route varies based on the languages and package managers in your tech stack.

Here are some key points to determine the best starting point.

## Getting started with Snyk

{% hint style="info" %}
For details, see [Getting started](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/discover-snyk/getting-started) and [Start scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/start-scanning).
{% endhint %}

Depending on your needs, Snyk offers various integration methods:

### Git Integration

For details, see [Git repositories (SCMs) integrations with Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations).

Connect your repositories for automatic scanning.

For a small number of applications, typically under a hundred:

1. From the Snyk Web UI, connect to Git code repositories from the **Settings-Integrations** page.
2. In the integration settings:
   1. Disable the automatic fixes and PR/Merge checks when first onboarding Projects.
   2. Enable them once a steady state is reached and blocking is desired.
3. From the **Projects** page, add the Projects.
4. Monitor results in Git code repositories.

For hundreds or thousands of repositories:

* At scale, Snyk recommends using the API. APIs are available with the Snyk Enterprise plan.
  * Use the [Snyk API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/snyk-api) to import your Projects. This leverages an existing source control integration and can be used to automate processes.
  * The [API-import](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import) tool uses the API to manage onboarding at scale for large enterprises and is the suggested tool to use at scale. The source control structure will need to be mirrored.

## Snyk CLI

For details, see [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli).

The CLI allows granular scanning of individual Projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
A command must be formulated for each type of test to perform (open source, code, infrastructure as code, and container).
{% endhint %}

To use the Snyk CLI:

1. [Install the CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli) using one of the appropriate methods as part of the build script.
2. [Authenticate to use the CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/authenticate-to-use-the-cli) by using the `snyk auth` command or an environment variable.
3. In the script, navigate to the Project folder.
4. Run the appropriate `snyk test` or `snyk monitor` commands and options for the type of scan you want to run.\
   \
   Where to implement testing in your scripts is generally flexible but most commonly prior to deployment. Use the monitor command alone for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container to passively report. When you are using gating through the `test` command, the purpose is to break the build if issues are found that meet particular criteria like `--severity-threshold` or any number of options in the CLI or the `snyk-filter` plugin.\
   \
   In general, Snyk Open source is typically run in `test` and/or `monitor` after the dependencies are installed on the build system.\
   \
   A typical command can look as follows:
   * Code: `snyk code test --org=[org-id]`
   * Open source:
     * `snyk test --all-projects --org=[org-id]`
     * `snyk monitor --all-projects --org=[org-id]`\
       Replace `[org-id]` with the ID of your Organization.
   * For Container and Infrastructure as Code scans, see [Container](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/scan-container-images) and [Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac), as this will vary based on the type being scanned.
5. Review results either locally when running `snyk test`, or on the Snyk Web UI when using `monitor` or report.

For demonstrations of various pipeline integrations, see [Snyk-Labs](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples).


# Add project attributes

After importing your projects, you can add metadata to your Projects using [Project Attributes](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-attributes). This allows you to filter and report on specific subsets of your Organization.

For example, if you add Project Attributes to all of your Projects, you can easily filter Projects to those that are "frontend critical vulnerabilities in production" from the Projects page.


# Invite Users

Click **Members** and invite your team members, applying the role alignments decided in Phase 1 for each member.

{% hint style="info" %}
Inviting members is generally suggested after importing your Projects. You may bring in a few initial members to start and then do a wider rollout. This can be done at any time as part of stages four and five. It is strongly recommended to communicate what is expected prior to the actual invitation and then communicate throughout the various stages as pull request checks are turned on, pipelines enabled, and as policies/practices change.
{% endhint %}


# Phase 4: Create a fix strategy

After setting up your integrations, creating your Organization, and importing your Projects, you now have visibility into your business's current vulnerability backlog.

## Decide important focus areas

Before diving into specific vulnerabilities, consider your Organizations and repositories (Targets in Snyk) to consider any areas of specific importance. The discovery of business-critical applications you did in Phase 1 can help inform and prioritize during this phase. For example, if your Organizations match different products, you can initially focus on the one product with the most users or where security matters most.

In your Organization, you can then consider the repositories that make up the application's different parts. Areas that handle sensitive data or are public-facing may be more important to secure, so this could be another way to narrow down your initial list of Projects to review.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have used **Attributes** to add metadata to your Projects, these can be a great way to filter down the number of Projects that you are considering.
{% endhint %}

## Group work by development teams

After you have your reduced set of Projects to prioritize, you may want to split these between different development teams. For example, you may have one Development team fixing issues with your open-source and first-party code and a separate DevOps team responsible for Containers and base image vulnerabilities.

## Prioritization method

Filters are available to help prioritize what issues need to be fixed more urgently. The following search criteria are most commonly used when building a prioritization plan and can be used iteratively or in combination as you analyze results.

* Severity (Start with **High** and **Critical**). It is common to filter by critical severity. However, Snyk Code, Snyk code only goes up to High, so if you are using Snyk Code, start there for Code Analysis results.
* [Exploit Maturity](https://snyk.io/blog/whats-so-wild-about-exploits-in-the-wild-and-how-can-we-prioritize-accordingly/) (Issues with **Mature** or **Proof of Concept** are more exploitable). By choosing this filter, you implicitly only filter the results to Open Source.
* Fixable (if there’s a fix available by upgrading a package, it’s much faster to fix).
* CVSS Score for Open Source Vulnerabilities
* [Priority Score](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/priority-score) (The above values are used to calculate this score). One strategy is to eliminate the vulnerabilities with a score of 900-1000, and then move to vulnerabilities with a score of 800-900, and so on.

Decide which metrics will be used when planning your fix strategy, and get specific with your timeline. If you choose to fix by severity, for example, estimate the time it will take to resolve a vulnerability per severity. It’s recommended to be specific with your fix strategy.

**Example**

If there are fifty critical-severity issues and one hundred high-severity issues, you may plan on two weeks to fix critical vulnerabilities and then four weeks to fix high-severity, based on the size of your team and workload.

Alternatively, you can fix by issue type.

## Fix by issue type

It is also common to initially focus on specific issue types (for example, open source vulnerabilities), as then you can more easily compare issues across different Projects.

Here are examples of processes based on whether fixes are led by different types of teams.

### Example: Developer-led priorities

Developer-led implementation, with instruction from executives to minimize license risk:

1. Resolve all License issues identified by Snyk Open Source.
2. Address all fixable Critical or High vulnerabilities in Snyk Open Source.
3. Shift focus to Code Analysis Projects (using Snyk Code), starting with High severity issues.
4. Scan the Containers and IaC files they are using to run their applications/environments.

### **Example: DevSecOps-led priorities**

DevSecOps-led implementation, focusing on securing your custom images and environment:

1. Scan and secure any custom base images that your development teams pull from.
2. Integrate with your Container Registry and scan the images you provide to your development teams.
   1. Scan the image you have chosen and built after adding common internal tools and standardizing image parameters.
   2. Ensure developers also scan their containers after adding their custom tools/packages to ensure that the container remains secure before deployment. This scan will also detect application vulnerabilities.
3. After you have secured your Containers, start actively scanning your IaC files and cloud environments for misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
4. Introduce Snyk to development teams to scan their Open Source and Code to reduce application vulnerabilities.

## Targeted Vulnerabilities Campaigns

As you operationalize security testing in your development process, another option for your fix strategy is to have campaigns to eliminate vulnerability types, for example, SQL injection. Using CWE in your search filters can be very useful in reporting to identify and log issues.

## Update your timeline

Once you have created your fix strategy, update the timeline for Phase 7.


# Phase 5: Rolling out the prevention stage

After you gain visibility on your security issues, you can now start to implement a prevention/gating system, to stop new vulnerabilities being added to your applications.

## Common prevention methods

Below are the two common areas that allow you to "prevent new issues":

* Snyk tests on pull request (PR)/merge checks (MR), currently available for Open Source.
* Adding "Snyk test" to your CI/CD pipelines (you may have already implemented "Snyk monitor" to import your Projects as part of the pipeline).
  * Additionally, open source, code, infrastructure as code, and container vulnerabilities can all be gated.

In either case, Snyk suggests that you communicate these changes clearly to your developers before implementing any form of gating.

## Tips

### Block the differences

If you are not already blocking vulnerabilities, start by blocking the difference.

This eases developers into the process, as they only take responsibility for vulnerabilities directly related to their changes.

To block new issues, you can use PR checks. For details, see [Run PR Checks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks).

### Communicate exception processes

It is important to ensure the teams know the exception processes and how to address if a PR is blocked or a build fails.

For example:

* Let the team know who has the authority to override a PR check if a pass is mandatory.
* If a build fails, can the issue be ignored and the test rerun? Who can run it? Or can a script be run allowing that step to pass? Who can make that determination?


# Enable and configure Snyk on PRs

## Use PR Checks to introduce gating

[Snyk Pull Request(PR)/Merge Request (MR) Checks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks) allow you to prevent new security issues from entering your codebase, by automatically scanning code changes when you submit a pull request (PR). PR Checks are available for open-source vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and your own code issues.

If you import Projects through a source control integration, then Snyk Open Source and Snyk Code PR Checks is a good place to start introducing gating.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommendes announcing the changes prior to rolling out the changes. See [Announcement Templates](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-6-rolling-out-the-prevention-stage/announcement-templates-for-prevention) for examples of how to message your developers.
{% endhint %}

### Implementing Open Source PR Checks

There are a number of different features available that can be used to help you gradually introduce the feature to avoid friction with your development teams:

* Fail conditions: You can control whether the test will "fail" if the PR itself is adding a dependency with issues (most common) or if the repository as a whole has any issues.

The criteria of what constitutes a "failed test" can also be customized. By default, the test does not filter based on severity or fixability, which can mean that PR tests will regularly fail. For Snyk Open Source you can customize what the criteria are to fail the test:

* **Only fail for high or critical severity issues**
* **Only fail when the issues found have a fix available**

When you first enable this feature, Snyk suggests ticking both of these boxes so that a test would fail if a **High or Critical** and **fixable** issue is found. In this case, you would want to encourage to developer to fix the issue before proceeding.

These PR tests are optional by default, meaning that even if the test fails, the developer may be able to continue and merge the PR. Controlling whether a PR test is optional or blocking is configured within your source control management platform, such as GitHub’s branch protection rules.

### Implementing Code PR Checks

When enabling static analysis of code changes and therefore new vulnerabilities, you can select the fail criteria to be **High** (the highest severity).

When you first enable this feature, Snyk suggests selecting **High** if an issue is found. In this case, you would want to encourage developers to fix the issue before proceeding. As your code base stabilizes and you have worked through the backlog, you can change the fail criteria to lower the severity (to either **Medium** or **Low)** in order to address broader issues or to match your internal policies.

### Using PR Checks for a phased rollout

It is common to have a phased rollout of these features. Using PR checks as an example:

* You may initially run Snyk tests and set, via your source control settings, as optional checks. The results are displayed, but the developer is not blocked from merging the PR.
* Over time, as developers adapt to seeing these results and begin addressing the high issues proactively, you can choose to start blocking PRs from being merged if there are any new highest severity issues or, in the case of Snyk Open Source, if a fix is available.

This phased rollout helps to decrease friction between your security and development teams.


# Add and configure Snyk to your CI/CD pipeline

Using Snyk as a gatekeeper in your build pipeline prevents the introduction of new vulnerabilities, based on the "fail" criteria you set.

After your teams understand the vulnerabilities in their applications and develop a process for fixing them early in the development cycle, you can configure Snyk to fail your builds if vulnerabilities are detected, to prevent introducing vulnerabilities into your applications.

## No import requirement

A benefit of adding tests to your pipeline is that you do not need to import the repository to Snyk using the source control integration (which is required for Snyk PR Checks). It can also be used as an additional gate, even if you are testing PRs, to further decrease the chance of new vulnerabilities entering your production builds.

## Pipeline options

When adding Snyk to a build pipeline, there are common options:

* Using the specific [pipeline integration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations) for your tool.
* Using the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli) and running the specific commands directly.

Each option has benefits - using an existing pipeline integration may be faster and easier to configure, but using the Snyk CLI will give you a greater range of options and flexibility in your "fail" criteria.

## Pipeline test filters

When running a test in your pipeline, there are filters available to determine what would result in a test passing or failing. The most common of these is "severity threshold", where you can specify to only fail a build if there are High or Critical severity vulnerabilities.

## CLI supporting tools

If you use the Snyk CLI in your pipeline, a range of supporting [Snyk Tools](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools) provide additional functionality, including [`snyk-filter`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-filter), which can be used for more complex "fail" criteria, such as “fail if more than three High severity vulnerabilities are found”.

## Also see

Here is a link to a webinar that covers CI/CD checks in more detail and includes an example of how you can gradually introduce this feature: [CI/CD Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QS9gRQ0WVU).


# Infrastructure as code

For Snyk IaC, you may choose to integrate with [Terraform Cloud](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/terraform-cloud-integration-for-snyk-iac-using-run-tasks/how-to-use-the-terraform-cloud-integration-for-iac) to run snyk iac test as part of a ‘run’ workflow, in addition to scanning Terraform and YAML files that are included as part of your source control repositories.

For instructions on how to implement Snyk per IaC type in the Snyk CLI, see [Snyk CLI for IaC](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac).


# Phase 6: triages, ignores and fixes

## Tips for deciding on prioritization

After you implement a strategy to prevent new issues from entering your repositories, whether blocking builds or running in a non-blocking/advisory mode, the next step is to prioritize and start fixing issues in your backlog.

* In [Phase 4: Create a Fix strategy](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/team-implementation-guide/phase-4-create-a-fix-strategy), you created a plan for prioritizing your Projects and issues. To implement this, you can schedule regular meetings with development team leads, to assist them with this process.
* If you use Jira Cloud, you can download and install the [Snyk Security in Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1230482/snyk-security-in-jira-cloud) plugin from the Atlassian marketplace. This allows you to view information on your Snyk Vulnerabilities directly in Jira, and use Jira Automation to create new tickets when new vulnerabilities are identified.

## When should you ignore an issue?

When deciding your priority for fixing issues, you may see specific packages or vulnerabilities that you do not currently want to fix. This could be for a range of reasons, such as:

* The fix introduces breaking changes, and you don't have time to fix them.
* This vulnerability does not apply to you for an environmental/contextual reason.

## Use the ignore feature

In each case, you can use the "ignore" feature to stop these from appearing each time you run a test.

{% hint style="info" %}
Confirm ignore with an Organization Admin (they may need to complete this step themselves).
{% endhint %}

When adding the ignore:

* Ensure you add a detailed reason, so the ignore reason is clear to others who see this issue.
* Set an expiration date for the ignore rather than having a permanent ignore. This is essential, as whilst the issue may not be fixable/relevant today, it should be reviewed regularly (monthly or quarterly) to see if it is possible to implement a fix.

{% hint style="info" %}
In **Settings-General** it's common to limit access to who can ignore an issue and require a reason.
{% endhint %}

By default, the **Organization Collaborator** role has permission to ignore issues, but this can be controlled per Organization in the **Settings** page (that is, restricted to **Organization admins** only).

See [Ignore issues](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/ignore-issues) for more details.

Each business and environment is different. With that in mind, this guide aims to help an enterprise business to implement Snyk. The guide provides recommendations on implementing a large-scale rollout, focusing on the stages needed to help get to an ideal rollout.

The guide starts by recognizing that most businesses:

* Have a backlog of issues in their existing software.
* Are continuously creating new software and need to secure new code.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are **typical timelines for implementation** depending on the size and scope of your business.

If your business is small and nimble, Snyk implementation can be achieved in days. You can start scanning with Snyk soon after purchasing, often using a Git integration and the [API Import Tool](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import). See the [Getting started](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/discover-snyk/getting-started) and [Start scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/start-scanning) sections for details of this type of process.

However, for larger, more process-oriented enterprises, the implementation process may take weeks or months and it requires more detailed planning to succeed.
{% endhint %}

The Snyk Essentials plan is included in the Snyk Enterprise plan, meaning that you will gain access to the following features:

* [Coverage control](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/coverage-and-coverage-gap-policies) for SCM.
* [Policy](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies) creation to automatically trigger specific actions.
* [Backstage file](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/application-context-for-scm-integrations) customization for SCM integrations.
* [Customized analytics](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/analytics) and reports about the application.

## Implementation strategy overview

This guide is composed of multiple phases, outlining a series of actions that align with three goals:

* [Achieve visibility](#achieve-visibility)
* [Achieve prevention and drive developer adoption](#achieve-prevention-and-drive-developer-adoption)
* [Fix the backlog and triage issues](#fix-the-backlog-and-triage-issues)

### Achieve visibility

For large businesses, Snyk recommends that you first focus on visibility - getting a clear sense of the security issues, but without always fixing them.

{% hint style="info" %}
This does not stop you from fixing issues using Snyk. You can start fixing issues early, but the emphasis is to avoid blocking development early on, build trust, and slowly introduce gating in later phases, usually the prevention phase.
{% endhint %}

Visibility achieves a broad view of security across your application portfolio, prevents Snyk scans from being seen as a blocker, and minimizes impact on development processes.

This visibility helps build trust while rolling out Snyk.

### Achieve prevention and drive developer adoption

Next is the prevention stage; stopping new security issues from being added to your applications. During this stage, you can put controls in place to allow developers to see issues in their pipelines using Pull Request (PR)/Merge Request (MR) checks, and checks in the pipeline that may block.

As part of this, developers may use IDE plugins and other tools like [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor) to select secure packages and [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io/) to educate on secure coding, security, and the product.

### Fix the backlog and triage issues

Finally, you can focus on fixing your backlog of security issues. This can take several forms:

* As part of the initial rollout, security or the initial stakeholder may triage the initial results for the existing portfolio, create tickets for priority items to investigate or address, or have the teams do that for their applications as part of the weekly triage process.
* After getting visibility and achieving prevention, you can look at your backlog of issues. For example, a weekly triage process with the key stakeholders can guide the teams on what to address.

## Use enhanced resources with Snyk

Snyk was built with developers in mind, providing:

* Tools to create secure applications using integrations for IDE, Git, and CI/CD.
* [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor) and other tools to make decisions.
* [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io) training materials on products, securing code, and best practices.
* [Policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies) that allow security and compliance teams to provide direction.


# Trial limitations

You can try out Snyk functionalities in several ways:

* Using the limited Free plan
* Using a self-serve 14-day trial
* By piloting the full product with the Enterprise plan

The Snyk 14-day trial offers a sample of the features available in the paid Enterprise plan. However, certain features will have limited functionality or be entirely unavailable in order to provide a seamless experience when the trial concludes.

{% hint style="info" %}
After implementing Snyk Essentials, you must access the Inventory page to ensure it is populated with all the necessary information. Depending on the number of repositories you have imported, the update may take up to several hours.
{% endhint %}

If you consider purchasing the Team plan, remember that the trial offers features beyond those included in the Team plan.

The following Enterprise features are limited or unavailable during the trial:

* [**Single Sign-On (SSO)**](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk)**:** Not available.

# Prerequisites

## Automated provisioning

Provisioning is the first interaction you have with Snyk before getting access to the Snyk platform and features on your plan. For a detailed walkthrough, see the [Auto-provisioning guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide).

Provisioning can be completed with a [new](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide#sign-up-start-from-scratch) or [existing](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide#logging-in-provision-using-an-existing-user-account) user account and must be completed before you continue the rest of the implementation process.

Automated provisioning is enabled only on multi-tenant environments for the following regions:

* 🇺🇸 **United States**: SNYK-US-01, SNYK-US-02
* 🇪🇺 **Europe**: SNYK-EU-01
* 🇦🇺 **Australia**: SNYK-AU-01

{% hint style="info" %}

# Phase 1: Discovery and planning

## Discovery phase steps

* [Connect with Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/connect-with-snyk): Connect with your Snyk account manager.
* [Conduct discovery](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/conduct-discovery): Identify stakeholders, integrations, and applications to monitor.
* [Plan Organization structure](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/plan-organization-structure): Decide how to organize and control access to content using the Snyk Organization structure.
* [Determine user roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/determine-member-roles): Decide whether your users need customized access to Snyk.
* [Decide SSO access](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/decide-sso-access): Identify initial Single Sign-On (SSO) settings.
* [Plan for success](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/plan-for-success): Decide how to judge the success of your rollout.
* [Choose rollout integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/choose-rollout-integrations): Decide which integrations to implement initially.
* [Create rollout plan](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/create-rollout-plan): Create a high-level plan for rolling out Snyk in your business.

## General pre-rollout questions

Some initial questions follow that you can ask to assist in planning before starting the rollout. This is one way of deciding on your rollout process.

### Who is involved?

* Who will manage and oversee the project?
* Who will champion Snyk?
* Who will be the Group Administrator?

### What are your goals?

* Why did you choose Snyk?
* Why are you implementing it now?

### How will your users use Snyk?

How will you provision users and integrate Snyk with your platforms?

* Who will need access to Snyk?
* What will they need access to?
* Will access be restricted to certain Projects?
* Who can grant Snyk access to platforms like SSO and Git repositories?

### How will you structure your account?

* How will you group your Projects?
  * By developer teams?
  * By product?
  * By business unit?
* If by developer teams, are there some teams that would need access to the same Projects? If yes, think about a different structure to avoid confusion.
* How many [Snyk Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations) do you need?

### How will you measure success?

* What KPIs will be tracked?
* How will you know that you are making progress?
* Are there key development projects that progress tracking should be aligned with, or at least included in the tracking, to measure progress against?

## Snyk Essentials considerations

Snyk Essentials is part of the Snyk Enterprise offering, and it provides discovery and visibility for your application assets and security tool coverage.

When or before you use Snyk Essentials, you should consider the following items:

* Who would want coverage visibility or is accountable if an important application is not being monitored by security tools?
* Who would you notify, using automated policies, if a repository were missing coverage by a security tool?
* Are you using [Application context](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/application-context-for-scm-integrations), and are there fields that might be valuable in automating policies with Snyk Essentials?
  * Is it possible to categorize important applications in Git or CMDB (ServiceNow) using topics or fields, such as a PCI topic or tag?
  * Would this also reduce noise about test applications and internal applications by implementing an internal tag, topic, or naming convention?
* Read the available examples of [common policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies#use-cases) that can be created using Snyk Essentials.


# Connect with Snyk

## Connect with your account manager

Before implementing Snyk, please contact your Snyk account manager to confirm you have the appropriate license for your use case. They can advise on the best license type and access level based on your business needs.

The proper license setup ensures you can fully use Snyk capabilities without limitations. It also guarantees you remain compliant with Snyk terms of use.

## License questions

Your account manager is your go-to resource for any account-related questions or updates. Reach out to your account manager directly regarding:

* Confirming your current license
* Adjusting license quantity or scope
* Renewing your license
* Adding new products and features
* Changing account access

With the right license in hand, you are set for a smooth and successful experience using Snyk.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most importantly, your account manager can confirm your Snyk license has been applied to an environment, has the correct naming, and is ready to be implemented.
{% endhint %}


# Conduct discovery

## Identify business-critical applications

Identifying key applications early helps you identify important contacts to make, helps define success metrics, and helps early prioritization. Your business may have thousands of applications, but can you identify a few key applications to benchmark progress and priority?

For large enterprises, you can import everything, but that additional information can be collected in parallel to help prioritize work and measure success. This should not be a blocker or delay, it can be done in parallel in the planning and implementation phases.

## Confirm internal points of contact and roles

To successfully implement Snyk, you must identify the skills needed and the stakeholders who will be involved. For example, you will want to start to identify people who can:

* Create the necessary single-sign-on (SSO) connections.
* Generate tokens with the necessary permissions for Git repositories and other integrations being considered.

## Identify stakeholders with a RACI matrix

In smaller organizations where a few individuals may have the necessary access, involving the stakeholders can be quick and easy. You can use a RACI matrix to determine who is:

* **R**esponsible: the person ultimately accountable for carrying out the task or deliverable
* **A**ccountable: the approver who must sign off on work before it is considered complete
* **C**onsulted: those whose opinions are sought, two-way communication
* **I**nformed: kept up-to-date on progress, one-way communication

For large enterprises, the following RACI matrix is useful to clearly define roles and responsibilities during rollout:

<table><thead><tr><th width="179">Task</th><th width="136">Champion</th><th width="146">Admin</th><th width="132">Security</th><th>DevOps</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Onboarding</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>SSO setup</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>Admin training</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>Security training</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Responsible</td></tr><tr><td>DevOps training</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Accountable</td></tr><tr><td>Source Control, IDE, pipeline setup</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Accountable</td></tr><tr><td>Policy management</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Accountable</td></tr><tr><td>Security triage</td><td>Responsible</td><td>Consulted</td><td>Accountable</td><td>Consulted</td></tr></tbody></table>

This ensures all stakeholders are engaged in suitable capacities without duplicated or neglected efforts. Following the matrix enables smooth collaboration, with individuals contributing specialized skills within their designated areas.

The clear delineation of duties promotes productivity, efficiency, and accountability. Overall, the RACI framework is an effective method for orchestrating a structured, well-coordinated onboarding process, resulting in the successful implementation of Snyk.


# Plan Organization structure

## Introduction to structure

Snyk uses a hierarchical approach to managing assets, access, and rollup reporting.

* **A Snyk Group**: the top level
  * Typically, this represents the account and is the company name.
  * The largest customers may have multiple groups representing each of their companies.
* **Snyk Organizations**: below the Group level, typically representing
  * Line of business
  * Git organization or team structure
  * Types of application
  * Dev teams
* **Snyk Projects**
  * The import you have tested and monitored with Snyk.
  * A CLI scan that is being monitored, a container that is being monitored in a registry or Kubernetes, or an asset detected during a Git import, such as an open-source manifest, a code analysis scan, or an infrastructure as code file detected.

For more details, see [Manage Tenants, Groups and Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations).

## Decide the structure

Deciding your structure is one of the earliest decisions you must make. When determining your account structure, structure Snyk Organizations to match your business needs.

Consider various factors when structuring Organizations, such as:

* Team-based structure: Link developer team A with Organization team A.
* Product-based structure:
  * Set up separate Organizations for distinct parts of an application, for example, Payment Front-End and Payment Back-End.
  * Allow full-stack developers to join multiple Organizations as needed.
* Git organization-based. : Some companies use a structure that mimics the organizations in Git, typically seen if a customer has 10-plus organizations in their Git platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you intend to use the [api-import-tool](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import), the Git organization-based approach will be your path forward.
{% endhint %}

By exploring these options and grasping your company's requirements, you can establish an account structure that enhances collaboration and efficiency.

## Additional information

See [Manage Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations/create-and-delete-organizations) for more details.


# Determine user roles

## Use default or custom roles?

A key consideration when setting up Snyk is determining if the [pre-defined user roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles) align with your needs or if you need to customize roles for your business requirements.

{% hint style="info" %}
The pre-defined user roles in Snyk have a fixed set of permissions that cannot be changed. One of the biggest advantages of customizing roles is that you can adjust the role permissions to align with your desired level of control.
{% endhint %}

## Pre-defined roles

The following are the standard pre-defined user roles. See [Pre-defined roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles) for more details.

* **Group Member**: a non-functional role in Snyk. The user can access the Group but requires Organization-level permissions to use Snyk.
* **Group Viewer**: a user that can access the Group level but requires Organization-level permissions to take actions in Snyk. This is normally used as a starting point during onboarding with Snyk to understand functions tied to Group permissions and design a custom Group role for post-deployment use.
* **Group Admin**: provides a full set of permissions at the Group and Organization level. No other roles need to be assigned. This role is typically used for users who manage Snyk.
* **Organization Admin**: Typically assigned to Team Leads. Users with this role can add and delete Projects, override Snyk checks, and provision Group users with an Organization-level role.
* **Organization Collaborator**: This is the standard role in Snyk used for developers. This role is ideal for small teams or a very developer-first organizational approach.

{% hint style="info" %}
Large enterprises typically limit access to actions such as who can add or delete Projects, and so reduce permissions early on. For this purpose, you should use Custom Roles, for example, creating a **Team Lead** role to provide a middle ground between the **Organization Collaborator** and **Organization Admin** roles.
{% endhint %}

## Custom roles

The [User role management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management) feature provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Snyk, allowing you to create and enforce customized access by assigning a set of permissions to a role that will be granted to users. The permissions within these roles can be updated and changed even after assigning them to users.

As with all pre-defined roles, the permissions within the **Organization Collaborator** role cannot be changed, so you cannot grant the developers the ability to **Mark SCM Check as Successful**. This pre-defined role can be helpful when introducing developers to Snyk PR Checks but cannot be expanded when a developer is fully functioning in a Snyk environment. This is where Custom Roles are useful.

The most common types of custom roles include [Team Lead](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/custom-role-templates/team-lead-role-template) and [Developer](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/custom-role-templates/developer-role-template), but your company can have custom roles that suit your business structure. Snyk has provided multiple templates for you to use in structuring your Enterprise in Snyk; for more custom role suggestions and the listed permissions, see [Custom role templates](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/custom-role-templates).


# Decide SSO access

## Deciding Single Sign-On (SSO) settings

For more information on SSO, see [Using Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk)

While it is common for the initial pilot or trial team to use personal authentication, before rolling Snyk out to users, you should implement SSO, including the following:

* Creating appropriate SSO accounts and promoting those accounts to Administrator
* Removing the personal accounts from Snyk before rolling it out to a wider group.

## SSO provisioning options

When you are setting up access for new users in your company, there are several approaches to consider that determine the user experience and access. In this step, consider **Open To All** or **Require an Invite**, and if **Custom Mapping** is desired. For more information, see [Choose a Provisioning Option](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/choose-a-provisioning-option).

For information on how to set up and pass custom roles to Snyk using your identity provider (IdP) see [Custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping).


# Plan for success

## Determine success metrics with Snyk

Implementing Snyk provides an opportunity to enhance your application security. But how do you know if you're getting the most out of it? Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential measurements that track Snyk's impact and help guide your security journey.

KPIs give you valuable insights by monitoring key metrics at each adoption phase, from raising awareness to preventing new issues. KPIs help you:

* Assess progress toward security goals
* Identify areas needing improvement
* Demonstrate Snyk's value to stakeholders

Tracking metrics aligned to each stage provides tangible insights into what's working well and where improvements may be needed. KPIs help optimize your use of Snyk and progress your application security program.

## Example metrics

Some examples of success metrics to consider are provided here. Analyzing relevant data points at each stage can provide insight into what's working well and help identify areas for improvement.

### Build awareness

* Number of developers who have been introduced to Snyk
* Percentage of Projects that have been tested with Snyk during this phase

### Gain visibility

* Percentage of Projects that have been successfully scanned for issues
* The number of critical and high-severity issues identified
* Mean time to complete the initial scan for a Project
* Progress in prioritizing issues by severity level

### Prevent new Issues

* Percentage of pull requests or builds that are being failed based on Snyk automation
* Reduction in new issues introduced after automation is turned on
* Time taken to address blocked pull requests and resolve them

### Fix backlog

* Percentage of existing issues that have been resolved
* Mean time to fix issues from the backlog
* Number of auto-fix pull requests raised and successfully merged
* Progress in using Jira integration for managing issues and tracking fixes


# Choose rollout integrations

## SDLC integration points

Snyk offers many integrations to work seamlessly with Snyk in every stage of the SDLC.

Many businesses roll out automated solutions first, and then slowly introduce tools to enable the developers. In addition, gating features are gradually turned on over a period of time, to minimize disruption.

{% hint style="info" %}
As using multiple integrations can result in duplicate reporting of issues, you do not initially need to implement more than one integration type. For example, you can start by importing everything with Git repositories, then later use the CI/CD view for fine-grained detail. You can remove the source control integration if both views are not desired.
{% endhint %}

## Integration types

The following are typical early integrations.

### Source Code Management (SCM) integrations

Integrations with popular version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, and Bitbucket seamlessly integrate Snyk security checks into the code review process. This ensures that potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before code is merged into the main branch. Important features include:

* Daily testing and monitoring of a specified branch, typically the development branch
* (optional) Pull Request/Merge Request checks against any branch of the repository
* (optional) Automated dependency upgrades and automated security fix upgrades through pull requests

The advantages of SCM integrations are:

* Visibility into repository security posture
* Automatic Scan on code change
* Immediate feedback on issues for the developer
* Onboarding repositories can be configured through the UI or [API/API Import Tool](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import)
* Support for Cloud and Private Code Repositories on the Snyk Enterprise plan

See [Snyk SCM integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations) for more details.

If you have an on-premise Git repository, you must consider deploying [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker) for Snyk to communicate with your repositories.

{% hint style="info" %}
Enterprise customers can enable and manage [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker) using the API.

[Paid services](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/snyk-terms-of-support-and-services-glossary) can be engaged to assist in Snyk Broker deployments.
{% endhint %}

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline integrations

Integrating Snyk into CI/CD pipelines, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI, automates security checks during the build and deployment process. This ensures that vulnerabilities are detected early in the software development lifecycle and prevents their propagation into production. Typical features include:

* (Optional) Ability to passively monitor results during build and view results in Snyk
* (Optional) Ability to test and potentially break the build if results are found based on the criteria you specified

The advantages of CI/CD integrations are:

* Assess local code vulnerabilities
* Full control over testing: which tests to run and where in the build script
* Automation by CI/CD if desired

See [Snyk CI/CD integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations) for more details.

### IDE Integrations

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integrations like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse allow developers to access Snyk security features directly within their coding environment. This enables real-time scanning and issue remediation as developers write code.

See [Snyk IDE plugins and extensions](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions) for more details.

## Additional considerations for integrations

### Infrastructure as Code integration

For Snyk Infrastructure as Code, it is common that your Terraform or YAML configuration files are held in your SCM, but they may be in a separate area or repository. Thus, consider whether there are other areas you need to import. You may also want to integrate with Terraform Cloud if applicable, to enable Snyk tests as part of your `terraform run` processes.

For complex environments, modules, and highly templated implementations, using the CLI on your Terraform Plan file may provide the best results.

### Container registry (CR) integrations

Snyk also integrates with various [container registries](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/container-registry-integrations) to enable you to import and monitor your containers for vulnerabilities. Snyk tests the containers you have imported for any known security vulnerabilities found, at a frequency you control.

### Kubernetes

Snyk can be configured to monitor workloads deployed to Kubernetes. See [Overview of Kubernetes integration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/kubernetes-integration/overview-of-kubernetes-integration) for more information on how to configure the controller.


# Create rollout plan

Every business is different. If your teams have already used security tools and are in a heavily compliance-focused industry, controls may be turned on relatively more quickly. However, if security as part of development is new, rolling out tools and controls in phases is strongly suggested.

## Suggested onboarding approach

When you are introducing Snyk to your business, Snyk suggests the following phased rollout after implementing access by SSO and configuring integrations.

### 1. Kick off with a pilot team

Start by selecting a small group of engaged pilot users from:

* Application security teams
* Project teams building new applications
* Developers of business-critical applications

This allows you to:

* Thoroughly onboard initial users
* Gather feedback to refine processes
* Identify issues before the broader rollout
* Build success stories to promote Snyk

Typically, within a large enterprise, importing everything using a repository integration for visibility and working through the rollout with a small pilot team allows you to identify the best processes and ways to implement Snyk within your environment.

### 2. Gain visibility with Git repository integration

Next, set up Snyk integrations across your Git repositories to gain broad visibility into your security posture.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To reduce noise, turn off notifications before import if you have onboarded all your users.
{% endhint %}

Key advantages of using this process are:

* Widespread scanning across your codebase
* Automatic scanning triggered on code changes
* Convenient way to gain coverage

### 3. Prioritize key applications

Have your pilot team focus on securing priority applications using targeted Snyk CLI scans.

Key advantages of using this process are:

* Enhanced visibility into critical apps
* Fine-tuned CLI testing for precision
* Removing repo noise for a focused view

### 4. Expand access

With priorities addressed and processes refined, start expanding access more broadly across teams.

This phased approach allows thoughtful onboarding while rapidly gaining visibility and control.

### 5. Turn on gating

After the first month, gradually turn on gating measures.

* Implement Pull Request/Merge Request Checks using criteria such as `severity` and `is fixable`.
* Fail builds based on criteria such as `High` or `Critical`, `CVSS`, `Mature Exploit` for Open Source, and other criteria using the [Snyk Filter](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-filter) plugin.

It is recommended to start with a few applications, especially during the pilot team phase, work through the processes, and then roll out more widely.

## Exception handling

Ensure there is an exception process in place and users are aware of it. For example:

* If a pull request/merge request is failed by Snyk, let the users know who ithe Snyk admin is who can override it.
* Similarly, if Snyk fails in CI/CD, let users know who can create an ignore rule, or authorize the build to progress, or configure CI/CD to run without the Snyk `test` or set it to `monitor` only.


# Phase 2: Configure account

After you finish [Phase 1: Discovery and planning](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning), the next step is configuration.

The following sections suggest initial settings to incorporate in your first Organization or to use in a template Organization that you can copy as you build out your environment.

As part of this configuration, you will want to do the following:

* [Configure SSO](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/configure-sso)
* [Configure Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template), including [setting up integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/configure-integrations)
* [Configure license and security policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/apply-security-and-license-policies)
* [Configure Snyk integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/configure-asset-management-with-snyk-essentials) and [policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/set-up-snyk-apprisk-policies).


# Configure SSO

Configuring SSO may be done while onboarding Projects, creating Organization structure, or even while configuring integrations. Disable notifications for the Organizations if your intent is to add users prior to onboarding your Projects into Snyk.

Setting up [Single Sign On with Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk) gives your users a consistent way of logging in to your application while increasing your ability to control who has access to your Organizations.

In most cases, Snyk recommends using the [Self-Serve Single Sign-On option](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/configure-self-serve-single-sign-on-sso) that allows you to configure a SAML connection to your identity provider. This allows you to configure the email domains that are valid, and also the default permissions that new users will have in your Organizations.

## How to get assistance

Depending on your license with Snyk, you may not see the SSO option on your Group Settings page. If it is not displayed, [submit a request to Support](https://support.snyk.io) to enable it. This option lets you configure SSO with SAML, but if you want to use a different SSO configuration option, for example, OIDC, [submit a request to Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io), and a member of the Snyk support team will assist.

## Assistance with SSO Custom Mapping

Using this option requires paid professional services and cannot be completed using the Self-Serve SSO option. [Contact the Snyk support team](https://support.snyk.io) or your Snyk account team to purchase the required services.

## How to provision users through the API

The [Provision user endpoints in the Snyk API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-management-with-the-api/provision-users-to-organizations-using-the-api) allow you to grant Organization-level access and permissions to users before they log in to the Snyk platform.

API provisioning also allows you to limit Organization access and assign custom member roles. This allows you to control:

* Which role is assigned to each user
* Which Organizations each user should have access to


# Set visibility and configure an Organization template

Whether you want to create a single Organization or build a template to create multiple Organizations, there are some initial settings you should configure.

{% hint style="info" %}
For importing Projects, see the [Import Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/import-projects) and [Rollout](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-5-initial-rollout-to-team) discussions
{% endhint %}

## Create your Organization structure using a template

When you create a new Organization, you can select an existing Organization to use as the model for settings and integrations. To streamline creating your Organizations, Snyk recommends configuring a template Organization before creating your full Organization structure.

This template-based approach will save you considerable time because you will aovid manually configuring each integration for each Organization.

There is no specific template functionality in Snyk. The recommended process is to create an Organization called **Template and** then fully configure this Organization. Afterwards, when you create more Organizations, you can use the option to clone settings from an existing Organization with **Template** as the existing Organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Creating a template using the API**\
Templating functionality is also available if you are creating your Organizations using the API, whether you are using the [snyk-api-import](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import) tool to mirror an Organization from an existing source, such as GitHub Organizations, or using the endpoint [Create a new organization](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1#org) and providing a `sourceOrgId`.
{% endhint %}

## Configure template Organization settings

In your template Organization, configure a range of settings that you can choose to copy when creating your full Organization structure:

* All relevant integrations, for example, GitHub Enterprise, Docker Hub.\
  Note: If you have on-premise source code management tools, you must configure and run [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker) to enable the integration.
* Integration settings, for example, configuring whether you want Snyk to run tests on PRs.
  * The default settings for a new Git repository integration include Snyk running tests on newly raised PRs and the option to automatically raise PRs when new vulnerabilities are found. Snyk recommends disabling these settings initially and turning them on when you are ready to introduce these features in the [Prevention Stage](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-6-rolling-out-the-prevention-stage).
  * The following [Integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/configure-integrations) section discusses integrations you may want to add to your templates before copying them.
* Product settings, for example, enabling Snyk Code.
  * By default, Snyk Code is disabled for new Organizations.
  * If you want to enable SAST scanning of repositories imported through a Git repository integration, ensure you use the toggle to enable Snyk Code before importing your Projects.
  * If you use Snyk Code and **forget to enable it before importing your Project, you must enable Snyk Code and reimport your code** from Git. See [Enabling Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/enable-snyk-code).
* Notification settings (email notifications)
  * Snyk suggests that you initially disable all Group and Organization email notifications so users do not receive a large number of notifications while Projects are imported.
  * To do this, disable Notifications at the Group level for new organizations, and at the Organization level for all existing Organizations.

The following table shows what is copied from the template Organization to the new Organizations you create using the web interface or API\\

<table><thead><tr><th width="466">All integrations and their settings WILL be copied</th><th>The following WILL NOT be copied</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Source control integrations</td><td>Snyk Service accounts</td></tr><tr><td>Container registry integrations</td><td>Members</td></tr><tr><td>Container orchestrators integrations (Kubernetes)</td><td>Projects</td></tr><tr><td>PaaS and Serverless integrations</td><td>Notification preferences</td></tr><tr><td>Notificiation integrations (Slack and Jira)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Policies</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ignore settings</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Language settings</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Infrastructure as code (IaC) settings</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Snyk Code settings</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Duplicate the template Organization

After the Organization is created and configured, use it as a template when creating new Organizations, to build out the remaining structure.


# Configure notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Manage notifications](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/manage-notifications) for more details.
{% endhint %}

Snyk sends different types of alerts to teams based on Group and Organization settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommends disabling notifications for the Group and the first Organization by default, before you create additional Organizations and start scanning applications.
{% endhint %}

## Setting default Organization notifications

If you want alerts to be sent by default for Projects imported into the Organization, you can have Snyk send notifications for either vulnerabilities or license issues or for both. You can also limit the notifications to only High and Critical severity issues.

The following video demonstrates how to set notification defaults for Organizations:

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/o41yfkfu34>" %}
Organization notification video
{% endembed %}

## Setting default individual notifications

Encourage individuals to set up their own notification preferences, if they want to customize how they receive alerts for specific Projects.

The following video demonstrates how to set notification defaults for individual users:

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/x1750wshlg>" %}
Personal notification video
{% endembed %}


# Enable Snyk Code

When you create a new Organization, Snyk Code (SAST) scanning is disabled by default. Snyk recommends enabling Snyk Code before you import your first Projects to Snyk. If Snyk Code is enabled after a Project is imported, Snyk will not detect Snyk Code files.

1. Select the **Settings > Snyk Code** option.
2. Click the toggle to enable Snyk Code, and then click **Save changes.**

You can use the API endpoint [Enable/Disable the Snyk Code settings for an org](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/reference/sastsettings#orgs-org_id-settings-sast) to perform this operation at scale for a large number of organizations.


# Configure integrations

## Configure your SDLC Integration Points (IDE, Git repo, CI/CD, Container Registry)

{% hint style="info" %}
For information about importing Projects, see [Import Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/import-projects) and [Rollout](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-5-initial-rollout-to-team).
{% endhint %}

When you create your Organizations, you must decide where to add Snyk in your Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Snyk recommends that you first gain visibility for your vulnerabilities, with features related to gating disabled initially.

The first step is to import your Projects using one of the available methods, and then after you have full visibility for any existing issues and vulnerabilities, you can start to gradually introduce gating methods to prevent new issues from being added to your codebase.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notification settings (email notifications)**

* Snyk suggests that you initially disable all email notifications so that users do not receive a large number of notifications while Projects are being imported.
* You would disable this at the Group level for new Organizations and at the Organization level for all existing Organizations.
  {% endhint %}

## Integration tools

The most common tools to integrate Snyk into your SDLC to gain visibility are described here.

### Git repository

Snyk can integrate with multiple Git repositories to help you track, monitor, and fix the issues and vulnerabilities in your code.

If you have on-premise Git repositories, you must configure and run [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker) to enable the integration.

When importing a repository, Snyk will scan and monitor the default branch for vulnerabilities.

Monitoring takes the form of

* daily scanning of a specified branch, even when you are not working on it,
* Pull Request and Merge Checks

Source control scanning of your Git repositories is suitable for the majority of supported languages, but note that if you use a private package manager, such as Artifactory, this must be integrated with Snyk to scan your private packages.

You can import Projects through a Git repository integration manually through the browser, or you can use the API, either with the [snyk-api-import](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import) tool to import repositories in bulk, or the endpoint [Import Targets](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/reference/import-projects-v1#org-orgid-integrations-integrationid-import) to import specific repositories, which can be inserted into a pipeline.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Snyk Enterprise customers, it is strongly suggested to use the **GitHub Enterprise integration card** on the Snyk Integrations page. You do not need to be a GitHub Enterprise customer to use this option; however, using this option allows a Personal Access Token (PAT) to be used, whereas OAuth, provided through the GitHub Integration card, provides an inconsistent experience in terms of access in the interface.
{% endhint %}

If you import your Project from a Git repository, you can also configure Snyk [PR Checks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks) and auto-fix PRs. These can prevent new security issues from entering your codebase by automatically scanning code changes in real-time whenever you submit a PR in your Git repository.

This allows scanning and visibility earlier in the software development lifecycle by checking all submitted PRs for security issues.

{% hint style="info" %}
To disable gating initially, use the daily monitoring that is automatically configured when a Project is onboarded in Snyk, and disable PR/MR Checks in the configuration.

* Automatic fixes Snyk can provide
  * Automatic fix PRs
  * Automatic dependency upgrade PRs
  * Snyk vulnerability patches
* Pull request status checks are available for
  * Open Source security and licenses
  * Code analysis
    {% endhint %}

Similarly, you may want to disable fix and upgrade PR features.

### CI/CD (Build Pipelines)

Keep your applications secure by preventing deployment of vulnerable applications or components (registries), by adding Snyk in the build as a step of the pipeline.

The CLI offers

* Optimum accuracy for a number of specific package managers, such as Scala, Gradle, and GO
* Support for private packages without the need to configure an additional integration, given that your build environment will have access to your private packages.
* Visibility to components that are pushed to production by either breaking builds and reporting to Snyk or only by reporting to Snyk.

There are a number of [CI/CD integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations) that you can use, or you can use the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli) as part of your pipeline to have more flexibility in the tests you are running.

In the initial phase, Snyk recommends using the `monitor` feature to import information into Snyk so you can see any discovered issues, unless you are already importing your repos using a source control integration to achieve this. Later, when you want to start gating and blocking new vulnerabilities from being added, you can introduce `test` features, initially failing builds on critical issues, and then gradually adapting the fail criteria over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
For `snyk iac test --report`, finding issues will result in the build possibly stopping with a non-zero response code.\
\
If you want to passively test this, including the `--report` option requires either setting the build step to always continue or an alternative like concatenating logic equating to "or true", (for example `snyk iac test --report || true`). The exact syntax will depend on the ecosystem the CLI is running in.
{% endhint %}

Tools like [`snyk-filter`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-filter) for advanced filtering and [`snyk-delta`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-delta) for highlighting new issues are quite popular for configuring pipelines.

Demonstrations of various pipeline integrations can be found on [Snyk-Labs](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples)


# Create Organizations

You can use the [API-import tool](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import) and [create organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import/creating-organizations-in-snyk) accordingly.

See the [Snyk Account Structure](https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/groups-and-organizations/) lesson and the [Manage Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations/create-and-delete-organizations) documentation for how to create Organizations manually.


# Configure Asset management

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* You are a Group Administrator for the Group, or you are assigned a Group level role with permissions to View Group and Edit Essentials.
* The Group associated with Snyk Essentials includes organizations that have onboarded Snyk application security products.
* You have the necessary permissions and authority to onboard cloud-based SCM tools (Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, and so on) to Snyk Essentials for repository asset discovery.

## Configure asset management and setup SCM integrations

Identify all inventory code-based assets and determine which assets have security controls in place.

## Access asset management

Verify you can access Inventory from the Snyk web UI.

* Access the **Inventory** menu from the Group level of your Snyk Group.
* Ensure you have Group Admin access.

## Setup integrations <a href="#setup-integrations" id="setup-integrations"></a>

Start building your asset inventory by setting up the necessary integrations.

{% hint style="info" %}
The scanned information is automatically imported within two hours after enabling all features. Note that for large onboardings, it is suggested to wait up to 24hours for all information to be processed.
{% endhint %}

Access and configure the integrations from the **Integrations** view. Select the **Add integration** option to see the list of all available integrations. See [Set up a Snyk integration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/discover-snyk/getting-started#set-up-a-snyk-integration).

The default display in the **Integrations** view includes the configured Snyk integrations. The status of each integration, **Connected** or **Not connected**, depends on the specific content imported into Snyk.

You can customize an existing integration or connect a new SCM integration.

After you select **Add an integration**, a list of the available integrations is displayed. For each integration, you can add one or multiple profiles.

### SCM integrations

Configure your SCM integrations in the **Integrations** page.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The integration interface is dedicated to asset management. It is available with Snyk Enterprise and is separate from the Organization integrations interface, which is used for security and license scanning.
{% endhint %}

When you set a token on the Group Level Integrations screen, it enhances security by providing a comprehensive view of access. This token allows broad access to all repositories, even those not permitted for individual developers, ensuring alignment between security and development teams.

The supported SCM integrations are:

* [GitHub](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/group-level-integrations/github-for-snyk-essentials)
* [GitLab](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/group-level-integrations/gitlab-for-snyk-essentials)
* [Azure DevOps (Azure Repos)](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/group-level-integrations/azure-devops-for-snyk-essentials)
* [BitBucket](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/group-level-integrations/bitbucket-for-snyk-essentials)

Navigate to the [Group-level integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/group-level-integrations) page for more details about the supported SCM integrations.

### Brokered SCM integration <a href="#brokered-scm-integration" id="brokered-scm-integration"></a>

When setting up a Snyk Broker, there are some questions you need to ask regarding either standing up a new broker or updating an existing [Snyk broker connection](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker):

* Are you hitting any API Rate Limit issues?
* Do you need to update the SCM token to a user that has access to all relevant SCM repositories?
* Do you have more than 1000 repos?

If you answered Yes to any of the above questions, then you need to deploy a new Snyk Broker to accommodate the Snyk Essentials SCM connection.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommends creating a new Organization in Snyk specifically for the Snyk Essentials Broker.
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/using-snyk-essentials-with-snyk-broker) page for more details about installing and configuring Snyk Essentials using Snyk Broker.

### Application context for SCM Integrations

The application context refers to the information surrounding a particular application, which includes the assets that form the application and how these assets are related. Understanding this context is essential for assessing the impact and risk of security issues, as it provides a comprehensive view of the application's structure and its components. This understanding is crucial for effectively evaluating and managing application security risks.

Access the [Application context for SCM Integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/application-context-for-scm-integrations) docs for more details about how to use this feature.

## Features

The Snyk Essentials functionality is split across several menu options from the Group level.

* The Asset Dashboard report
* [Inventory](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-assets/manage-assets)
* [Policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies)
* [Integrations for SCM](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/group-level-integrations)
* [Issues](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing)

#### Inventory view

The Inventory feature is structured in four sections, each focused on a specific area:

* **Overview:** Provides quick insights into the discovered repositories.
* **All Assets**: All the discovered assets, grouped by their type.
* **Asset Hierarchy**: Asset Hierarchy layout shows assets in a hierarchical structure. The list of assets is sorted by issue counts, and, where applicable, the package assets are listed underneath the repositories where they are located. Assets hierarchy is visible only when there are no filters applied. Navigate to the [Assets inventory components](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-assets/assets-inventory-components) page for a detailed overview of all options available in the Assets Hierarchy view and to the [Asset inventory filters](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-assets/assets-inventory-filters) page for more details about the filtering options and how to use them.
* **Teams**: SCM repository assets grouped by teams. Note that only SCM organizations with teams, and repositories assigned to a team, appear on this layout.
* **Technology**: SCM repository assets grouped by technology, as detected and tagged by Snyk Essentials.

If you are using asset management for the first time, Snyk recommends you first use the Coverage filter to determine where you have Snyk implemented. Then, you can use the Coverage Gap filter to identify the assets that do not meet the coverage requirements set in a **Set coverage control** policy.

You can use the Coverage Gap filter to:

* Find any asset that does not comply with the Set coverage control policy requirements:

  <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-a732596ba9a68d61ca63c89d7c2e24587cd31268%2Fimage.png?alt=media" alt="Use the Coverage gap filter to Find any asset that is out of policy"><figcaption><p>Coverage gap - Use case 1</p></figcaption></figure>
* Find any assets that do not meet the coverage requirements for Snyk Open Source or Snyk Code, or both of them simultaneously:

  <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-f3e7907e8ab70dc3eb1bbed2fb184a10d45bf7d3%2Fimage%20(144).png?alt=media" alt="Use the Coverage gap filter to Find any asset that is out of policy for Snyk Open Source OR Snyk Code"><figcaption><p>Coverage gap - Use case 2</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Tags <a href="#hardbreak-tags" id="hardbreak-tags"></a>

Use tags to categorize the assets. You can use tags in multiple ways:

* Automatic tags: asset management automatically tags repository assets with information about the used technologies (Python, Terraform, and so on) in the repository and repository latest updates. You can also use policies to tag repository and package assets. GitHub and GitLab topics can also be pulled from the repository and applied as Asset tags.

{% hint style="info" %}
BitBucket cannot automatically detect the language used in the source code from the repositories. You can only see the language tags that have been manually added for BitBucket. For more information, see the official documentation provided by BitBucket.
{% endhint %}

* User-defined tags: set up custom tags through policies to categorize your assets beyond the system-generated tags. See the [Create policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/create-policies) page for more details.

#### Asset Dashboard Report

The [Asset Dashboard](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/reporting/available-snyk-reports#asset-dashboard) provides a comprehensive overview of your application and security controls. It displays essential data such as the status and trends of open issues, control coverage, and repository metadata.


# Apply security and license policies

Policies define how Snyk behaves when identifying issues. Policies give you a quick and automated way to identify, prioritize, and triage issues. This saves valuable development time and allows developers to take more responsibility and ownership for security, reducing the “noise” level.

See [Policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies) for more details.

## Security policies

Group administrators can define security policies, thus providing an automated way to identify certain issues or types of issues, and apply actions like changing the severity or ignoring the issue based on your conditions.

* Configure policies to increase priority or decrease it as needed.
* Create ignores where needed

See [Security policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/security-policies) for more details.

## License policies

Group administrators can set license policies to define Snyk behavior for treating license issues. For example, you can allow or disallow packages with certain license types, to avoid using packages containing incompatible licenses.

By default, Snyk determines the severity of licenses in the following way:

* High severity - licenses that definitely present issues for commercial software.
* Medium severity - licenses that have clauses that may be of concern and should be reviewed.

Configure policies to match your requirements.

See [Snyk License Compliance Management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/scan-open-source-libraries-and-licenses/snyk-license-compliance-management) for more details.

## Asset policies

Policies can be created using the Policy Editor to:

* Notify user(s) using Slack or email when a condition is met
* create a Jira ticket
* Set classification using policy
* Set tags using policy
* Specify coverage policies, for example, scan not performed within a specified number of days
* For more information, navigate to the [Assets policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies) page.


# Phase 3: Gain visibility

When the [Account configuration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account) phase is complete, you can import your repositories to scan your applications.

When importing your repositories, Snyk scans the contents to find all supported files and to create these in Snyk as Projects, for example, open-source manifest files, code files, IaC configuration files, and so on. See [Import Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/import-projects).

You may optionally add Project Tags or Attributes, which can be useful to filter and organize your Projects when creating collections, views, or reporting. See [Add Project tags and attributes](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-3-gain-visibility/add-project-tags-and-attributes).


# Set up Asset Policies

The [asset policies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies), which come with Snyk Essentials, help you automate the process of adding business context and receiving notifications. You can set up policies to automatically identify the coverage control gaps.

## Understand a policy

You need two components to create and understand a policy:

* **Filters**: helps you create asset groups based on defined criteria such as tags or asset name.
* **Actions**: set actions that can be performed on the filtered assets, such as setting asset classification or sending a Slack message or email.

{% hint style="info" %}
A newly created policy may take up to 3 hours to become visible and be applied.
{% endhint %}

## Create a policy

You can create a policy by navigating to the Policy view and using the **New policy** button in the top right corner. Name the policy and, optionally, describe it.

The policy builder editor focuses on two main areas:

* [Define the filters](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/create-policies#define-filters) - Set filter conditions on asset properties.
* [Set actions](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/create-policies#set-actions) - Define actions to be taken on filtered assets.

### Key filter types <a href="#key-filter-types" id="key-filter-types"></a>

When creating a new policy, you can choose from several available filters. Here is a selection of the most used ones:

* **Name:** Many companies have a naming convention for their repositories and other assets. Use the naming convention to check if asset names contain or match a certain string.
* **Asset Type:** you can apply policies only to certain asset types, such as repositories or software packages.
* **Class:** you can reduce a lot of noise on actions by only targeting a specific Class. For example, only take action on Class A assets, as these are business-critical assets.
* **Tags:** You can use either out-of-the-box system tags or custom tags that Snyk has defined.

Here are the steps for creating a policy:

1. Navigate to the Policy view and click the **New policy** button in the top right corner.
2. Provide a name and, optionally, a description of your policy, and click **Next**.
3. Define the filters of your policy and click **Apply**.
4. Set actions for your policy. Click the + icon to add an action. You can trigger an action based on the assets you have filtered or create a logic node to combine it with another filter node.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-45f1c45c46515977ecf2c9e605dd6fca648d0f90%2Fimage%20(145).png?alt=media" alt="Create policy - multiple nodes"><figcaption><p>Create policy - Multiple nodes</p></figcaption></figure>
5. When you add another filter node and select the + icon next to it, you can flow into existing logic nodes.
6. Trigger an action based on the assets you have filtered.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-950d11195311e2e3bc2621ed4299030e17539dfc%2Fimage.png?alt=media" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create policy - Set action</p></figcaption></figure>

### Policy freshness

All policies are automatically run in a maximum of 3 hours after creation, then every 3 hours. You can manually run a policy by clicking Run to apply the policy to your assets. Changes are applied automatically to your assets by implementing the actions you set on the policy.

### Use cases for policies

Familiarize yourself with the asset policies by going through these use cases:

* [Coverage control](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/coverage-control-policy) policy - identify and set coverage policies to allow your team to define where certain security controls need to be in place.
* [Classification](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/classification-policy) policy - classify assets based on importance.
* [Tagging](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/tagging-policy) policy - sets a tag on the matched assets.
* [Notification](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/notification-policy) policy - get notifications about changes that take place on your assets.
* [Coverage and coverage gap](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/use-cases-for-policies/coverage-and-coverage-gap-policies) policies - use the Coverage filter to verify if an asset has ever been tested by the product and the Coverage gap filter to verify if the asset meets the coverage requirements set in a Set coverage control policy.


# Import Projects

Depending on the integrations you have configured and the language and package managers in your tech stack, you can import Projects into Snyk using the following:

* A source control integration with your Git repositories
* The Snyk CLI with CI/CD

The best import route varies based on the languages and package managers in your tech stack.

Here are some key points to determine the best starting point.

## Ways to get started with Snyk

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Getting started](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/discover-snyk/getting-started) section and [Start scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/start-scanning) for more details.
{% endhint %}

Snyk offers various integration methods to meet your needs, as described here.

### Git integration

You can connect your repositories for automatic scanning. See [Snyk SCM integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations) for more details.

For a small number of applications, typically under a hundred, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to **Settings** and then to **Integrations**, and connect to Git code repositories using a tile on the Integrations page.
2. In the settings for the integration:
   * Disable the automatic fixes and PR/Merge checks when first onboarding Projects
   * Enable after a steady state is reached and blocking is desired.
3. From the Projects listing, add Projects using the Web UI.
4. Monitor results in Git code repositories.

For hundreds or thousands of repositories, you can use the API endpoint [Import targets](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/reference/import-projects-v1#org-orgid-integrations-integrationid-import) to import your Projects. This takes advantage of an existing source control integration and can be used to automate processes.

The [API-import](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-snyk-api-import) tool uses the API to manage onboarding at scale for large enterprises and is the suggested tool to use at scale. You must mirror the source control structure when using the snyk-api-import tool.

### Snyk CLI

The [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli) allows granular scanning of individual Projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must formulate a command for each type of test to perform: open source, code, infrastructure as code, or container tests.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to use the CLI:

1. [Install the CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli) using one of the appropriate methods as part of the build script.
2. In the script, navigate to the Project folder.
3. Run the appropriate `snyk test` or `snyk monitor` commands with the appropriate options for the type of scan being run.\
   Where to implement testing in your scripts is generally flexible, but most commonly, testing is done prior to deployment. Use the `monitor` command alone for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container to report vulnerabilities passively. In using gating with the `test` command, the idea is to break the build if issues are found that meet particular criteria like `--severity-threshold` or any number of options in the CLI or snyk-filter plugin.\
   \
   In general, the `test` or `monitor` commands or both are typically run for open source after the dependencies are installed on the build system.\
   \
   A typical command might look like one of the following:
   * Code: `snyk code test --org=[org-id]`
   * Open source:
     * `snyk test --all-projects --org=[org-id]`
     * `snyk monitor --all-projects --org=[org-id]`
   * Refer to the documentation for [container](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-container) and [infrastructure as code](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac) scans for information about how to scan those types of Projects.
4. Review results either locally when running `snyk test`, or in the Web UI when using monitor or report functions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Demonstrations of various pipeline integrations can be found on [Snyk-Labs](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples)
{% endhint %}

## Snyk API

You can scan using the [Snyk API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/snyk-api). This enables large-scale automated scanning.

The process is:

1. Navigate to **Settings** and **Service Accounts** and generate an API token.
2. Call the Snyk API in pipelines.
3. Handle the results programmatically.
4. Change the code if needed.

Scanning using the API is useful to accomplish the following:

* Trigger scans through pipelines.
* Scale across your Project portfolio.
* Identify new issues in real-time.


# Add Project tags and attributes

After importing your Projects, you can add metadata using [Project attributes](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-attributes) or [Project tags](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-tags). This makes it easier to filter and report on specific subsets of your Organization.

For example, if you add both Project attributes including `frontend` and a tag of `Team:Unicorn` to all of your Projects that a specific Dev Team owns, you can easily generate a report of frontend critical vulnerabilities in production that team Unicorn owns.

Attributes and tags are also useful features that can be used to configure [Project collections and Project views](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-collections-groupings), making it easier for you to view Projects in a grouping that makes sense to you.


# Phase 4: Create a fix strategy

After you set up your integrations, create your Organizations, and import your Projects, view reports for visibility into the current vulnerability backlog for your business.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on how to use reports, see [Reporting](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/reporting) and [Available Snyk Reports](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/reporting/available-snyk-reports).
{% endhint %}

In most cases, when you look across all of your Organizations and vulnerabilities, there will be many issues, and it can be difficult to know where to start.

## Decide important focus areas

Before diving into specific vulnerabilities, consider your Organizations and repositories (Targets in Snyk) to identify any areas of specific importance. The discovery of business-critical applications you did in phase 1 can provide information that helps you prioritize during this phase. For example, if your Organizations match different products, you can initially focus on the one Organization (product) with the most users or where security matters most.

In that Organization, you can consider the repositories that make up the application's different parts. Areas that handle sensitive data, or are public-facing, may be more important to secure, so considering the repositories could be another way to narrow down your initial list of Projects to review.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have used **Attributes** or **Tags** to add metadata to your Projects, you can filter and reduce the number of Projects that you are considering based on these attributes and tags.
{% endhint %}

## Group work by development teams

After you have your reduced set of Projects to prioritize, you may want to split these between different development teams. For example, you may have one development team fixing issues with your open-source and first-party code, and a separate DevOps team responsible for containers and base image vulnerabilities.

## Fix based on prioritization methods

Filters are available to help prioritize what issues need to be fixed urgently. The following search criteria are most commonly used when building a prioritization plan and can be used iteratively or in combination as you analyze results.

* If you wish to filter based on Priority or Risk Score versus Severity:
  * Snyk uses a wide variety of information to assign a score to an issue. You could filter on 900+ for the first round, then 800+, then 700+, and so on to work through triaging by Priority Score. If you are using Risk Score, follow a similar process starting from the highest risk items and working through them. Alternatively, if you prefer to filter on your own metrics, or a combination of Score and other key metrics, then your process can be filtering individually on attributes.
  * Severity: start with **High** and **Critical**. It is common to filter by Critical severity; however, if you are using Snyk Code and Snyk Open Source:
    * Filtering by Critical and High ensures Snyk Code issues are not filtered out.
    * Alternatively, filtering on Critical severity for Snyk Open Source, then filtering on severity=high, product=Snyk Code for Snyk Code independently, ensures you identify the most severe issues for each scan type.
* If you wish to focus on Open Source during triage:
  * By choosing the Exploit Maturity filter, you implicitly filter only open-source results. [Exploit Maturity](https://snyk.io/blog/whats-so-wild-about-exploits-in-the-wild-and-how-can-we-prioritize-accordingly/) addresses issues that are **Mature** or have **Proof of Concept** and thus are more exploitable.
  * By choosing the Fixable filter, you can find issues where there is a fix available by upgrading a package. This makes fixing faster than without an upgrade.
  * You can choose CVSS Score for Open Source Vulnerabilities.
* When you filter by [Priority Score](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/priority-score), CVSS Score is included in the calculation. One strategy is to eliminate the vulnerabilities with a score of 900-1000, and then move to vulnerabilities with a score of 800-900, and so on.

When planning your fix strategy, decide which metrics will be used on a specific timeline. If you choose to fix by severity, for example, estimate the time it will take to resolve vulnerability per severity. It is recommended to be specific with your fix strategy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example fix strategy**

If there are fifty Critical severity issues, and one hundred High severity issues, you may plan on two weeks to fix critical vulnerabilities and then four weeks to fix high severity issues, based on the size of your team and workload.
{% endhint %}

## Fix by issue type

Alternatively, you can fix based on issue type. It is common to focus initially on specific issue types, for example, open-source vulnerabilities, as then you can more easily compare issues across different Projects.

Examples of processes follow for fixes led by different types of teams.

### Example: Developer-led priorities

Developer-led implementation, with instruction from executives to minimize license risk, follows this process:

1. Resolve all License issues identified by Snyk Open Source.
2. Address all fixable Critical or High vulnerabilities in Snyk Open Source.
3. Shift focus to Code Analysis Projects using Snyk Code, starting with High severity issues.
4. Scan the containers and IaC files being used to run applications and environments.

### **Example: DevSecOps-led priorities**

DevSecOps-led implementation, focusing on securing your custom images and environment, follows this process:

1. Scan and secure any custom base images that your development teams pull from.
2. Integrate with your container registry and scan the images you provide to your development teams.
   * Scan the image you have chosen and built after adding common internal tools and standardizing image parameters.
   * Ensure developers also scan their containers after adding their custom tools and packages, to ensure that the container remains secure before deployment. This scan will also detect application vulnerabilities.
3. After you have secured your containers, start actively scanning your IaC files and cloud environments for misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
4. Introduce Snyk to development teams to scan their open source and code to reduce application vulnerabilities.

## Targeted vulnerabilities campaigns

When you operationalize security testing in your development process, another option for your fix strategy is to have campaigns to eliminate vulnerability types, for example, SQL injection. Using CWE filters can be very helpful in reporting to identify and log issues.

## Update your timeline

After you have created your fix strategy, update the timeline for [Phase 7: Triages, ignores, and fixes](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-7-triages-ignores-and-fixes).


# Phase 5: Initial rollout to team

After the initial import of Projects and potentially triaging the initial results, you can invite your initial stakeholder groups, allowing them to explore Snyk features and add Snyk to their day-to-day processes.

Adding Snyk can include:

* Fixing issues and retesting.
* Including Snyk in development pipelines using CI/CD integrations and passive monitoring.
* Creating tickets and configuring additional integrations such as Jira.

As the team finalizes how Snyk would best fit into their processes, the wider team can be notified and start using Snyk at scale.


# Notifying the team

## Set email notifications

Snyk can automatically notify you when new issues are found in imported Projects. By default, email notifications are sent for any newly found vulnerabilities, but notifications can be customized, for example, to send messages only for new High and Critical severity issues.

Snyk sends you a **weekly update** summarizing your security status across all of your Organizations.

Also, Snyk generates **usage alert emails** that warn you when you are approaching usage limits if you rely on the limited capacity of monthly free tests in one of your Snyk products. These are also often disabled during the initial setup period.

## Configure notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk suggests that you initially disable all email notifications so that users do not receive many notifications while Projects are being imported. This means disabling at the Group level for new Organizations and at the Organization level for all existing Organizations.
{% endhint %}

There are several ways to control email notifications based on the audience and the following factors:

* **Group Settings**: Configure the default settings for new Organizations and get an overview of the current settings for each Organization.
* **Organization Settings**: Configure the default settings for new users in this Organization.
* **Personal Settings**: Users can manually change their individual settings to have precise control over what emails they receive for each Organization they have access to.

Users such as Administrators can opt-in to email notifications in their personal settings.

When you are ready to enable notifications more widely, you can see the overview for your Organizations and enable notifications in bulk on the **Group Settings** page.

To view demonstrations of choosing settings for Organization and individual notifications, see [Configure notifications](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/configure-notifications). See [Manage notifications](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/manage-notifications) for detailed steps.

## Announce Snyk to your teams

Introducing Snyk to your developers is the first step in building awareness of Snyk functions and how your developers can get the most out of Snyk. Typically, Snyk recommends disabling many of the potentially more intrusive features, for example, automatically raising PRs, until your teams are comfortable with Snyk use and results.

## Introduce Snyk to your developers

This is your chance to get developers excited about better ways to introduce security into their work. If Snyk can make their lives easier, they will be more likely to use the features and functions to their fullest.

You can use the [Announcement templates](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-5-initial-rollout-to-team/announcement-templates-for-initial-rollout) to communicate the Snyk rollout to the developers.


# Announcement templates for initial rollout

You can use these templates to communicate the Snyk rollout to the rest of the developers. Update the text in brackets with your own details, then send the message to the developers.

# Developer training from Snyk

Snyk has many resources to assist developers in learning security and the Snyk Platform

* [Snyk Learn Security Education](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/security-education/?type=security-education) teaches developers how to stay secure with interactive lessons exploring vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems.
* [Snyk Learn Product Training](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/product-training/?type=product-training) provides product training on the Snyk Platform. Learning paths are available for key stakeholder roles like Developers and Administrators.

## Snyk Learn Security Education

[Snyk Learn Security Education](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/security-education/?type=security-education) teaches developers how to stay secure with interactive lessons exploring vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems. The modules can be filtered by ecosystem and contain information and guidance on fixing common vulnerability types, such as **NoSQL injection attack** and **Server-side request forgery**.

These lessons are designed to improve your developers’ security knowledge in a broad context, rather than being focused specifically on Snyk products or the remediation advice provided by Snyk. This means they can serve as a great introduction to developer security for less experienced teams in this area.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommends introducing developers to this resource early on in the rollout process.
{% endhint %}

## Snyk Learn Product Training

[Snyk Learn Product Training](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/product-training/?type=product-training) provides training on the Snyk Platform. Learning paths are available for Developers, Administrators, and other key roles. In addition, individual lessons are searchable from the main interface.


# Engage development with IDE plugins

## Introduce Snyk IDE plugins to your developers

Encouraging your developers to install a [Snyk IDE plugin](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions) is a key step in improving developer adoption and achieving “shift left,” where developers are more empowered and responsible for fixing issues before they are committed to pull requests or added to builds.

Snyk IDE plugins help developers to find and fix security vulnerabilities and issues. This allows individual developers to pass security reviews, avoid costly fixes later in development, and reduce time to develop and deliver secure code.

The webinar [Workflows for Developers using Snyk in the IDE and CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzUJS6S6H48) covers IDE usage in more detail, including a demo using an IDE plugin to review an issue.

## Implementation tips

Companies just getting started with security should start with the visibility and prevention stages to give clear direction on what issues must be fixed. As developers are fixing prioritized issues or starting new work, a natural opportunity arises to introduce an IDE plugin to validate fixes and proactively test to eliminate potential friction introduced by the security gates. This is where AppSec programs often move from reactive to proactive approaches.

Companies with a mature AppSec program may give developers earlier access to Snyk IDE plugins as they are already familiar with security concepts. So rollout is less about resolving a backlog, and more about prevention of new issues and validation of fixes.

## Available plugins

The following Snyk plugins and extensions are available:

* [Eclipse plugin](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/eclipse-plugin)
* [JetBrains plugins](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/jetbrains-plugin)
* [Visual Studio extension](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/visual-studio-extension)
* [Visual Studio Code extension](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/visual-studio-code-extension)

The training session [Introduction to using Snyk in an IDE](https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/snyk-in-an-ide/) provides further guidance.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your Snyk application is hosted on the Snyk EU or AU data center, then you must specify this in your IDE plugin settings with the [URL relevant to your region](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#ides-urls).\
See [Regional hosting and data residency](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency) for more details.
{% endhint %}


# Phase 6: Rolling out the prevention stage

After you gain visibility for your business-wide security issues, you can start to implement a prevention and gating system to stop new vulnerabilities from being added to your applications.

## Common prevention methods

The two functions that allow you to ‘prevent new issues are:

* Snyk tests on [Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR) Checks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-pull-or-merge-requests), available for Open Source, with Snyk Code PR checks.
* Adding `snyk test` to your CI/CD pipelines; you may have already implemented `snyk monitor` to import your Projects as part of the pipeline. In addition, open source, code, infrastructure as code, and container vulnerabilities can all be gated.

Regardless of which function you use, Snyk suggests that you communicate these changes clearly to your developers before implementing any form of gating.

## Tips on prevention

### Block the differences

If you are not already blocking vulnerabilities, start by blocking the differences.

This eases developers into the process, as they take responsibility only for vulnerabilities directly related to their changes.

* [Run PR Checks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks), which include the option to block new issues.
* [Snyk Delta](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-delta) can assist with differences in results at the CLI level.

### Communicate exception processes

It is important to ensure the teams know the exception processes and how to address exceptions if a PR is blocked or a build fails.

For example:

* Let the team know who has the authority to override a PR check if a pass is mandatory.
* If a build fails, determine whether the issue can be ignored and the test rerun. Who can run it? Or can a script be run allowing that step to pass? Who can make that determination?


# Enable and configure Snyk on PRs

## Use PR Checks to introduce gating

[Snyk Pull Request(PR) or Merge Request (MR) Checks](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-pull-or-merge-requests) allow you to prevent new security issues from entering your codebase by automatically scanning code changes when you submit a pull request (PR). PR Checks are available for open-source vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and your own code issues.

If you import Projects through a source control integration, then Snyk Open Source PR Checks is a good place to start introducing gating.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that you announce the changes prior to rolling them out. See [Announcement Templates](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-6-rolling-out-the-prevention-stage/announcement-templates-for-prevention) for examples of how to message your developers.
{% endhint %}

## Implement PR Checks

You can use fail conditions to help you gradually introduce PR Checks to avoid friction with your development teams.

Fail conditions allow you to control whether the test will fail if the PR itself adds a dependency with issues, the most common circumstance, or if the repository as a whole has issues.

The criteria for what constitutes a failed test can also be customized. By default, the test does not filter based on severity or fixability, which can mean that PR tests will regularly fail. You can customize the criteria to fail the test:

* Fail only for High or Critical severity issues; function available for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Code
* Fail only when the issues found have a fix available; function available for Snyk Open Source

When you first enable PR Checks, Snyk suggests ticking both of these boxes so that a test would fail if a High or Critical and fixable issue is found. In this case, you would want to encourage to developer to fix the issue before proceeding.

These PR tests are optional by default, meaning that even if the test fails, the developer may be able to continue and merge the PR. Controlling whether a PR test is optional or blocking is configured within your source control management platform, such as GitHub’s branch protection rules.

## Use PR Checks for a phased rollout

It is common to have a phased rollout of Snyk features. Using PR checks as an example:

* You may initially run Snyk tests and set them through your source control settings as optional checks. The results are displayed, but the developer is not blocked from merging the PR.
* Over time, as developers adapt to seeing these results and begin addressing the critical issues proactively, you can choose to start blocking PRs from being merged if there are any new High or Critical severity issues, or in the case of Snyk Open Source, if a fix is available.

This phased rollout helps to decrease friction between your security and development teams.

## Additional information

The webinar [Dev-First Prevention Strategies Using PR Checks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x33EJW_d_E) covers PR checks in more detail and includes an example of how you can gradually introduce this feature.


# Add and configure Snyk in your CI/CD pipeline

Using Snyk as a gatekeeper in your build pipeline prevents the introduction of new vulnerabilities. based on the fail criteria you set.

After your teams understand the vulnerabilities in their applications and develop a process for fixing them early in the development cycle, you can configure Snyk to fail your builds if vulnerabilities are detected, to prevent introducing vulnerabilities into your applications.

## No import requirement

A benefit of adding tests to your pipeline is that you do not need to import the repository to Snyk using source control integration, which is required for Snyk PR Checks. Adding tests to your pipeline can also be used as an additional gate, even if you are testing PRs, to further decrease the chance of new vulnerabilities entering your production builds.

## Pipeline options

When adding Snyk to a build pipeline, you have these common options:

* Using the specific [pipeline integration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations) for your tool.
* Using the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli) and running the specific commands directly.

Each option has benefits; using an existing pipeline integration may be faster and easier to configure, but using the Snyk CLI will give you a greater range of options and flexibility in your fail criteria.

## Pipeline test filters

When you run a test in your pipeline, you can use filters to determine what would result in a test's passing or failing. The most common of these is severity threshold, where you can specify to fail a build only if there are High or Critical severity vulnerabilities.

## CLI supporting tools

When you use the Snyk CLI in your pipeline, you can use a range of supporting [CLI Tools](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools) that provide additional functionality, including:

* [snyk-delta,](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-delta) which can be used to compare two sets of results and identify new vulnerabilities, similar to how the PR Checks feature tests for new vulnerabilities only
* [snyk-filter](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-filter), which can be used for more complex fail criteria, such as `fail if more than three High severity vulnerabilities are found`.

## Additional information

[CI/CD Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QS9gRQ0WVU) is a webinar that covers CI/CD checks in more detail and includes an example of how you can gradually introduce this feature.


# Custom base images

If you build custom base images and store them in a registry for your development teams to select from, Snyk recommends that you introduce Snyk container tests as part of this workflow.

The team responsible for creating the custom base images can use container tests to select the most secure base images and identify layer-based fixes. This ensures that the base images selected by your development teams start with a secure base.

As development teams build their custom tools and packages into these images, they can run additional container tests to ensure their changes are secure before being pushed to production use.

For more information, see [Use Custom Base Image Recommendations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/use-snyk-container/use-custom-base-image-recommendations).


# Infrastructure as Code

For Snyk IaC, you may choose to integrate with [Terraform Cloud](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/terraform-cloud-integration-for-snyk-iac-using-run-tasks/how-to-use-the-terraform-cloud-integration-for-iac) to run `snyk iac test` as part of a run workflow, in addition to scanning Terraform and YAML files that are included as part of your source control repositories.

See [Snyk CLI for IaC](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac) for instructions on how to implement Snyk by IaC type in the Snyk CLI.


# Announcement templates for prevention

This page provides example email and Slack message templates that you can use to introduce prevention tools to your teams.

## Introduce prevention features to your developers

It is important that your development teams understand what changes are being made that may affect their day-to-day work. Ensure they understand how the prevention tests work, to help avoid surprises from possible issues that could affect their deadlines.

{% hint style="info" %}
These examples are written based on the Snyk tests on the PR Checks feature, with the configuration set to fail only on High or Critical severity issues. If you are adding Snyk tests to your CI/CD pipelines, ensure that you tweak the messages.
{% endhint %}

Use the following template to communicate the Snyk rollout to the rest of the developers. Update the text in brackets with your details, and then send the message to the developers.

# Phase 7: Triages, ignores, and fixes

## Tips for deciding on prioritization

After you implement a strategy to prevent new issues from entering your repositories, whether blocking builds or running in a non-blocking, advisory mode, the next step is to prioritize and start fixing issues in your backlog.

* In [Phase 4: Create a Fix strategy](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-4-create-a-fix-strategy), you created a plan for prioritizing your Projects and issues. To implement this, you can schedule regular meetings with development team leads to assist them with this process.
* In the [Snyk Tools](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools) section, there is a tool called [**j**ira-tickets-for-new-vulns](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/tool-jira-tickets-for-new-vulns)**,** which can be scheduled to run on a regular basis to automatically create Jira tickets for vulnerabilities that meet your specified criteria. Whether this process is automated or not, creating tickets for your developers to review can be a great way to help make issues identified by Snyk more visible.
* If you use Jira Cloud, you can download and install the [Snyk Security in Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1230482/snyk-security-in-jira-cloud) plugin from the Atlassian marketplace. This allows you to view information on your Snyk Vulnerabilities directly in Jira, and use Jira Automation to create new tickets when new vulnerabilities are identified.

## Use the ignore feature

### When should you ignore an issue?

When deciding your priority for fixing issues, you may see specific packages or vulnerabilities that you do not currently want to fix. This could be for a range of reasons, such as:

* The fix introduces breaking changes, and you do not have time to fix them.
* This vulnerability does not apply to you for an environmental or contextual reason.

In each case, you can use the ignore feature to stop these issues from appearing each time you run a test.

### Implement the ignore feature

{% hint style="info" %}
Confirm an ignore with a Group Admin or Organization Admin. They may need to complete this step themselves.
{% endhint %}

When adding an ignore:

* Ensure you add a detailed reason, so the ignore reason is clear to others who see this issue.
* Set an expiration date for the ignore, rather than having a permanent ignore. This is essential, as even if the issue may not be fixable or relevant today, it should be reviewed regularly, monthly or quarterly, to see if it is possible to implement a fix.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is common to use the General Settings to limit access for users to permission to ignore an issue and to require a reason.
{% endhint %}

By default, the **Organization Collaborator** role has permission to ignore issues, but this can be controlled for each Organization on the settings page, that is, restricted to **Organization admins** only.

See [Ignore issues](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/ignore-issues) for more details.

## Review Snyk reports to track the adoption of Snyk across your teams

There are a number of different reports in Snyk to help you get an overview of your issues and vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Reporting](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/manage-risk/reporting).

* On the **Issues Summary** report, the **Risk Breakdown** section displays open, new, and resolved issues across different Organizations. Tracking the amount of activity in each Organization can help you identify which teams are adopting the tool most actively.
* Individual Organization administrators can also view reports focused on their Organization as a way to help identify which vulnerabilities are most common across their repositories, and also to track issues resolved in different Projects.


# Enterprise setup

Enterprise configuration focuses on helping understand, plan, and roll out your Enterprise Snyk solution. This includes:

* [Auto-provisioning guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide)
* [Authenticate for third-party tools](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/authentication-for-third-party-tools)
* [Set up SSO](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk)
* [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker)
* [Service accounts](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/service-accounts)

These pages provide instructions on how to authenticate and connect while using the Snyk Enterprise plan.

The [Enterprise implementation guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide) focuses on open-source and code analysis. Updates for container and infrastructure as code are planned.

This page looks at how you can get several members of your team involved in trying Snyk to get feedback and buy-in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have been using Snyk on the Free or Team Plan and are looking for guidance on upgrading to the Enterprise plan, see the [Enterprise implementation guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide).
{% endhint %}

Snyk has a number of tools and processes that help secure your entire software development lifecycle. With Snyk, you can scan while you are coding or monitor code when you are not working on it. Snyk can also provide visibility into issues across your Projects with a Git repository integration or integrate into your CI/CD through plugins, the CLI, or curated containers.

For users who are evaluating Snyk or planning an enterprise deployment, and for most programming languages, Snyk recommends integrating with a Git repository to get started.

{% hint style="info" %}
The tool that best serves your tech stack, environment, and workflow depends on your individual circumstances. See [Supported languages and frameworks ](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/supported-languages/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks)for the guide specific to your language for more details.
{% endhint %}

To learn more about choosing the best integration points within the software development lifecycle for you and for your team, at their current level of security maturity, see [Integrating Snyk at your company](https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/integrate-snyk-at-your-company/).

The rest of this page explains how to connect a Git repository to Snyk and how to show results from scanning Snyk Projects that are in that repository. The focus is on helping you understand how Snyk works before you start the process of implementing Snyk with your team or teams.

Snyk provides limited free tests per month for each type of scan, Snyk Open Source, Code, Container, or IaC. For unlimited tests, ensure you have a paid plan for the type of testing you need to do, and that the setting for that type has been enabled.
{% endhint %}

## Create or log in to your Snyk account

You must have a Snyk account to use Snyk functionality, even within your local environment. Create a free account to try out Snyk for a Project. If your enterprise is already using Snyk, you may be able to log in using single sign-on to be provisioned with a Snyk account.

## **Enable Snyk Code**

When you create a new Organization in Snyk, Snyk Code (SAST) scanning is disabled by default. Snyk recommends enabling the Snyk Code product before you import your first Projects into Snyk.

1. Select the **Settings** > **Snyk Code** option.
2. Click the toggle to enable Snyk Code; then click **Save changes**.

## **Add a Snyk Project**

Add a Snyk Project to connect a Git repository integration. This video demonstrates the process.

## **Configure initial Snyk integration settings**

After your Git repository is connected (see [See Git repository integrations (SCMs)](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations) for details), you have automated processes available to automatically check pull requests for vulnerabilities, automatically generate pull requests, and automatically generate dependency upgrade pull requests. Snyk recommends you disable these options initially.

The settings for each Snyk Project are inherited from the Snyk Organization integration settings. Follow these steps to ensure these settings are disabled: Default Snyk test for pull requests, Automatic fix pull requests, Automatic dependency upgrade pull requests, and Automatic updates to Dockerfile base images. You can go back and enable these settings when your teams are ready to implement these options.

1. Select the **Integrations** page from the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select the settings cog icon for your Git repository integration.
3. In the **Default Snyk test for pull requests** section, ensure the following are disabled:
   1. **Open Source Security & Licenses** (default checks when PRs are opened)
   2. **Automatic fix pull requests**: both **New vulnerabilities** and **Known vulnerabilities (backlog)**
   3. **Automatically update Dockerfile base images**
   4. **Automatic dependency upgrade pull requests**

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk recommends defining standards for these options as well as notification defaults before you add more than a few Projects. When your teams are ready for a broader implementation, Snyk recommends defining standards for these options according to your security maturity. For more information, see [Configure integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/phase-2-configure-account/set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/configure-integrations).
{% endhint %}

## **Review the Snyk scan result**

For Open Source Projects, Snyk provides visibility into dependency and license component issues. Some package managers also provide a link to open a pull request to fix a specific issue, as demonstrated in this video.

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/z0lcfht0na>" %}
Fixing issues video
{% endembed %}

Snyk also provides information about potential security and quality issues in your proprietary code, and provides recommendations and some remediation examples, as demonstrated in this video.

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/p32o09thet>" %}
Review code issues video
{% endembed %}

If Snyk identifies a Dockerfile in the repository, Snyk provides information about the base image, including detected vulnerabilities. Snyk also provides the option to open a pull request to replace the base image with one that is more secure, as demonstrated in this video.

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/3s7h3r9o8h>" %}

{% endembed %}

## Scan with the Snyk CLI

Some package managers rely on context from the local environment. With these package managers, scanning in the local environment or as part of the CI/CD pipeline gives the most accurate results.

To start using the Snyk CLI or a CI/CD plugin, [install the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli). After you have installed it, you must [authenticate your machine to associate the CLI with your Snyk account](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/authenticate-to-use-the-cli), as demonstrated in this video.

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/ava7rrg7al>" %}
Authenticate CLI video
{% endembed %}

A scan with [Snyk test](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-open-source) provides information about open-source package issues, including fix advice, as demonstrated in this video.

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/b8vrvtmnbu>" %}
Snyk test video
{% endembed %}

A scan with [`snyk code test` ](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code)runs a Static Code Analysis test on the code in that Project, and returns the list of detected vulnerability issues, general information about the test, and a summary of the test findings.

A scan with [`snyk container test`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-container) returns a list of vulnerabilities in the container image, along with recommendations for upgrading the base image to one that is more secure.

A scan with [`snyk iac test`](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac) returns advice on how to resolve discovered issues in your Infrastructure as code files.

## Next steps in implementing the Snyk Enterprise plan

* If you want developers to try Snyk in their local environment using the IDE or CLI, review [Snyk API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/snyk-api) and [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/snyk-cli).
* To get specific recommendations for your tech stack, visit the guide specific to your language.
* When you are ready to plan a Snyk rollout to more teams, review the [Enterprise implementation guide](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide) for more information.
* See the [Developer launch package](https://assets.ctfassets.net/4un77bcsnjzw/2YfaqJNMsogGNJM6BBQz4p/8f5ca77b9c40a1bbe14cc9fb0aa05462/Snyk-developer-launch-package.pdf) for additional strategies, communication templates, and checklists for rolling Snyk out to a wider audience.


# Auto-provisioning guide

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Auto-provisioning is available only for customers starting a Pilot or Enterprise plan.
{% endhint %}

Provisioning is the first interaction you have with Snyk before getting access. You provide answers to the following questions about how you will be using the platform:

* What is the name of your business?
* Where do you want your data to be hosted?
* What is the authentication method your users will access Snyk with?
* Do you already have a Snyk account you want to use (a previously completed Pilot) or do you want to start from scratch?

This guide covers the following aspects of automated provisioning:

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisite-the-welcome-to-snyk-email)
2. [New account sign-up](#sign-up-start-from-scratch)
3. [Existing account sign-up](#logging-in-provision-using-an-existing-user-account)
4. [Error types and solutions](#error-types-and-solutions)

## Prerequisite: the "Welcome to Snyk" email

You should receive an email in your inbox containing links to start provisioning. Search for "Welcome to Snyk" as a subject, sent from <no-reply@snyk.io>.

If you have not received this email, look into your spam folder or reach out to your account executive.

This email contains two link&#x73;**:**

1. **Log in and activate your existing account** - To be used if you already have an account and wish to apply your plan to it.
2. **Create and activate a new account** - To be used if you're entirely new to Snyk or want to start from scratch with a different user.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once provisioning is complete, these links will become invalid and you will see an "Access denied" error page.

If you have not completed provisioning but still see this error, make sure someone else in your organization has not already completed the flow themselves, in case the welcome email has more recipients.
{% endhint %}

## Sign up - start from scratch

Clicking the sign-up link in your welcome email will take you to the sign-up page in the provisioning app.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The provisioning app is only accessible through a unique link, all other access is disabled and will show an error page.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-6d7cff11d8648ee6dd917ba5d3349131d1d24b26%2FScreenshot%202025-01-29%20at%2013.39.40.png?alt=media" alt="Sign up page on provision.snyk.io"><figcaption><p>Sign up page on provision.snyk.io</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 1: Enter the company name

The company name you enter here will be used to create the [Tenant](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/tenant), the top-level instance you'll see in the Snyk Platform. It is a required field and has 60-character limit.

Provisioning will also create a [Group](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/groups) and a default [Organization](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations) using the same name.

### Step 2: Choose where to host the account

<div align="center" data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-4d0bce4352869c757db7d1df3b4dc6c734bf9c92%2FScreenshot%202025-01-29%20at%2016.54.30.png?alt=media" alt="Available hosting regions" width="375"><figcaption><p>Available hosting regions</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Snyk offers [regional hosting](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency) to comply with regional data protection laws and improve service performance. This ensures data residency requirements are met and reduces data latency.

Provisioning is enabled for these [three regions](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#available-snyk-regions). Each of these regions is running at least one instance of the Snyk Platform:

* :flag\_us: **United States**: SNYK-US-01, SNYK-US-02
* :flag\_eu: **Europe**: SNYK-EU-01
* :flag\_au: **Australia**: SNYK-AU-01

In the case of [multiple instances](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#regional-multi-and-single-tenant-hosting) being available in a chosen region (United States), Snyk reserves the right to chose the specific instance where your account will be created. For more information see [Regional Hosting and data residency](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Automated provisioning is only possible for multi-tenant environments. For single-tenant availability (Snyk Private Cloud), reach out to your account team in advance of provisioning.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Select an authentication method

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-05d60c85b64568666338f030776e6c571bf761e4%2FScreenshot%202025-01-29%20at%2017.23.59.png?alt=media" alt="Available authentication methods" width="363"><figcaption><p>Available authentication methods</p></figcaption></figure>

The available authentication methods are either Single sign-on (SSO) or Third-party authentication.

1. **Single Sign-On** - use your company's existing identity management system, see [Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication to Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk) for more details.
2. **Third-party authentication** - Snyk supports a list of third-party identity providers, see [Authentication for third-party tools](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/authentication-for-third-party-tools) for more details. This method is only available for the United States region.

#### Which authentication methods are available for each region?

| Region                   | Single Sign-On       | Third-party providers      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| :flag\_us: United States | :heavy\_check\_mark: | :heavy\_check\_mark:       |
| :flag\_eu: Europe        | :heavy\_check\_mark: | :heavy\_multiplication\_x: |
| :flag\_au: Australia     | :heavy\_check\_mark: | :heavy\_multiplication\_x: |

Snyk recommends selecting SSO since it is best supported across all environments. Selecting this option will then prompt you to enter a valid, work-issued email address, used to create an initial Snyk Admin user. No extra configuration for SSO is required at this point.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-96a36e5cbde46a25d999d1848342971e2a87acd7%2FScreenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2011.58.02.png?alt=media" alt="Email address input" width="375"><figcaption><p>Email address input</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 4: Confirm details and start provisioning

As a final step, you must confirm the details entered are correct.

* If you have selected SSO as the authentication method, clicking "Sign up" will then show a loading page while Snyk does the background work.
* If you have selected Third-party authentication, clicking "Continue to sign up options" will redirect you to the Snyk Login page where you can choose your identity provider (Github, Google, and so on.). Once you have completed signing up you will be redirected back to the provisioning application where the loading page will indicate in-progress background work.

Snyk advises you to not close the page, otherwise you risk not seeing the process complete successfully.

### Step 5: Access the Snyk platform

If you have selected SSO as the authentication method, once plan activation is done, you will see a success message and a verification button. Snyk also sends an email to indicate a successful provisioning containing the same login verification link. This link does not expire and it can be used for multiple authentications if needed.\
\
Once clicked, a login code will be sent to the email address previously entered. This is known as a Passwordless Login. Enter the code where prompted and you are ready to start using Snyk!

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-6a329d13860f15c053dc49b2ed6aec558cf0a065%2FScreenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2014.14.27.png?alt=media" alt="Successful provisioning for SSO" width="375"><figcaption><p>Successful provisioning for SSO</p></figcaption></figure>

If you have selected **Third-party authentication**, once plan activation is done you are all set! You can click "Continue to your account" and start using the platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your plan might not have all the features enabled if your contract's start date is in the future. You will gain full access to all features when the start date is met.
{% endhint %}

## Logging in - provision using an existing user account

Clicking the sign-up link in your welcome email will take you to the log in page in the provisioning app.

### Step 1: Logging in

If you have a user account connected through a third-party provider, you will need to use SNYK-US-01

You can find the links for all the regions in the [Login and Web UI URLs section](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-data-and-governance/regional-hosting-and-data-residency#login-and-web-ui-urls).

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-530acfc47a0009a3980dd5b16fe4b2b53e1bdd77%2FScreenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2015.11.52.png?alt=media" alt="Log in page on provision.snyk.io"><figcaption><p>Log in page on provision.snyk.io</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Select an existing Tenant or start fresh

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-2de0495cc88aba673322ca293133a14faffda367%2FScreenshot%202025-01-30%20at%2015.20.27.png?alt=media" alt="Linking to an existing Tenant or creating a new one" width="375"><figcaption><p>Linking to an existing Tenant or creating a new one</p></figcaption></figure>

If you already have a Snyk User, you can choose how you activate your Enterprise plan or Pilot after logging in:

* Linking the plan to an existing [Tenant](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/tenant).\
  If your user is a member of multiple Tenants, you have the option to choose between them. Click the card of the Tenant you wish to select and then click "Confirm and activate".
* Starting fresh with a new [Tenant](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/tenant) linked to your user.\
  Click "Create new Tenant account" and enter the company name. It's the same field as [#step-1-enter-the-company-name](#step-1-enter-the-company-name "mention") of signing up. You will be asked to confirm the name you entered before starting the provisioning process.

### **Step 3: Access the Snyk platform**

This step is the same as [#step-5-access-the-snyk-platform](#step-5-access-the-snyk-platform "mention") when signing up. Once the process is done you can "Continue to your account" and begin using Snyk.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your plan might not have all the features enabled if your contract's start date is in the future. You will gain full access to all features when the start date is met.
{% endhint %}

## Error types and solutions

### Validation errors

When creating a new Tenant or User Snyk checks for duplicates and surfaces any issues.

* **The business name provided is already in use.** - Use a different name or reach out to your account executive if you want to link your plan to that existing Tenant but you are not a member of it.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-b47acf90e24c546d545af57468c1126a0413f74a%2FScreenshot%202025-02-04%20at%2017.18.14.png?alt=media" alt="Business name already in use error" width="375"><figcaption><p>Business name already in use error</p></figcaption></figure>

* **An account with this email already exists.** - In this scenario you can use a different work email address or you can login ([#logging-in-provision-using-an-existing-user-account](#logging-in-provision-using-an-existing-user-account "mention")), then create the new Tenant.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-1e6b391c2548378f27139752b4aae455d65c7227%2FScreenshot%202025-02-04%20at%2017.18.48.png?alt=media" alt="User with the same email address already exists error" width="375"><figcaption><p>User with the same email address already exists error</p></figcaption></figure>

### Plan Activation errors

Snyk is doing its best to ensure that you never see this screen, but in case you do, save the **reference ID** and send it to your account executive or reach out to support with the reference ID and the steps taken.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-733f9dbc765394475c27af3f802b78230a491522%2FScreenshot%202025-02-04%20at%2017.03.37.png?alt=media" alt="Plan activation error" width="375"><figcaption><p>Plan activation error</p></figcaption></figure>


# Authentication for third-party tools

When you work with Snyk from within any third-party tool, Snyk requires authentication in order to initiate its processes.

Snyk offers API tokens to enable integrations with third-party developer tools. You can authenticate through your personal account using your personal token or through a [service account](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/service-accounts) using the token associated with that account. When you authenticate through a service account, you do not use any personal token.

{% hint style="info" %}
For authentication purposes, the third-party identity providers do not require access to your repositories, only your email address.
{% endhint %}

## Supported identity providers

You can use one of the following identity providers for authentication with Snyk::

* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* Google
* Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
* Docker ID
* Single Sign-On (SSO): available with Enterprise plans.\
  See [Setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk).

For additional instructions, see the integrations pages for [Git repositories (SCMs)](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/developer-tools/scm-integrations/organization-level-integrations).

{% hint style="info" %}
Logging in with a different provider from the one you registered with when you first created your Snyk account will create a separate new Snyk account.
{% endhint %}

## **How to authenticate for a third-party tool using your personal token**

1. Visit [your Snyk account](https://app.snyk.io/account).
2. Navigate to **General Account Settings** and copy your token.
3. In the token field, click to show and then select and copy your API token.
4. In the third-party interface, configure your integration by pasting your Snyk token when prompted.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-e99a1d116aa121b1c43c60dfc20e6e585ce5e069%2Faccount-settings-general-auth-token.png?alt=media" alt="API token screen; revoke; regenerate; click to show"><figcaption><p>API token screen; revoke; regenerate; click to show</p></figcaption></figure>


# Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication to Snyk

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
SSO is available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
{% endhint %}

## Overview of SSO

You can take advantage of your company's existing identity management system and have employees sign in to Snyk using their corporate identity. This makes provisioning Snyk to users easier. It also allows for deeper integration for Group and Organization membership, role-based access, and more.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-88525c4909f9db745dbd6a1fe3863e4429f681f3%2Flogin-with-sso.png?alt=media" alt="&#x22;&#x22;"><figcaption><p>Log in to Snyk with SSO</p></figcaption></figure>

Snyk can integrate with any SAML-based and OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based SSO, as well as ADFS. You can also use your Enterprise Identity Provider for SSO, including [Entra ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (formerly Azure AD) and [Google G Suite](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/configuring-g-suite-as-an-identity-provider). Read more about SAML in [the Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/saml).

Training is available at [SSO, authentication and user provisioning](https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/sso-authentication-provisioning/).

## User authentication and provisioning for SSO

With SSO configured, users are provisioned with a new Snyk account when they first sign on through SSO, even if they previously created their own account.

The sign-on process includes these steps:

1. When users select SSO from Snyk.io to log in, they are redirected to and authenticated by the identity provider you requested.
2. The identity provider communicates this authentication to Snyk servers, sending relevant data to Snyk to create each user.
3. Snyk checks the directory for that user.
4. If the user is already configured, Snyk enables the appropriate access. For a new user, Snyk adds the user to the directory and then redirects the user to Snyk.io with the appropriate access.


# Choose a provisioning option

{% hint style="warning" %}
Contact your Snyk account team or Snyk Support to turn on custom mapping once you have completed the setup steps.
{% endhint %}

Determine how new users in your company will get access to Snyk:

* [Open to all](#open-to-all)
* [Invitation required](#invitation-required)
* [Custom mapping](#custom-mapping)

## Open to all

With the Open option, all users have automatic access to Snyk by using SSO to log in. They will have access to all Organizations in your selected Group. Their accounts will all be provisioned with the same role, with two options:

* The **Org** **administrator** role allows all new users to manage other Org admins and collaborators, view Group reports, and work with Organizations within the Group as well as perform non-administrative tasks in the Organization.
* The **Org** **collaborator** role can perform non-administrative tasks in the Organization.

Let Snyk Support know whether new users will have the administrator role or the collaborator role for the Organization. The selected role applies for all users. For details, see [Pre-defined roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles).

## Invitation required

With the invitation required or Group Member option, admins can invite users or users can request access to an Organization.

There are two ways to invite users to Organizations. Invite members (see [Manage users in Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations/manage-users-in-organizations)) or automate the process using the Snyk [API Invite users endpoint](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/reference/organizations-v1#org-orgid-invite).

If users who have not been invited use SSO to log in, they will gain access to Snyk, but they will not see any Projects until an admin invites them or manually adds them to the applicable Organizations. You can provide a list of Organizations with the appropriate contact person so that new users can [request access](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/organizations/requests-for-access-to-an-organization).

## Custom mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
Custom Mapping is available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
{% endhint %}

You can provision user accounts with customized rules using the [Custom Mapping Option](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping).

You can configure SSO differently for each of your different Groups. You can also map users to a specific Organization and role assignment based on information from the identity provider.


# Set up Snyk Single Sign-On (SSO)

Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) to allow your developers and teams easy access to Snyk through your existing SSO provider.

The information you need to establish trust between Snyk and the identity provider depends on which type of SSO you are using.

Ensure you have at least one Group and Organization to indicate where new users will be assigned. For details, see [Manage Groups and Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations).

{% hint style="info" %}
After you gather the needed information identified in the following sections, create a support ticket to request SSO setup.

Alternatively, Group Admins can configure Snyk Single Sign-On. See [Self-Serve Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/configure-self-serve-single-sign-on-sso) for the steps.
{% endhint %}

## Overview of SSO

The process of establishing trust between your identity provider (IdP) and Snyk requires a few steps coordinated between your SSO administrator and Snyk Support.

* In your identity provider platform, enter details about the Snyk environment and user attributes.
* Provide Snyk with details from your IdP.
* Set up a user for testing and send Snyk the username and password for that user.
* Use the link provided by Snyk to generate a payload.
* After Snyk finalizes the connection, confirm the login process is working correctly.

Users are provisioned to Snyk when they log in. If an invitation is required, users may only see a list of your Organizations until the admin adds them to the appropriate Organizations.

After SSO is configured both from Snyk and your company's network, a trust relationship is established with Snyk, Auth0 (on behalf of Snyk), and your network. Any sensitive data is encrypted and stored in Auth0 only for the purposes of enabling user logins.

Each type of SSO connection requires different details for establishing trust between your identity provider and Snyk. The following sections explain those details. The details are also included in the worksheets in the Resources section at the end of this article.

## Set up SAML for SSO

To establish trust with Snyk, add an Entity ID, an Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, and a Signing certificate in your identity provider.

* The **Entity ID** is the URL that uniquely identifies Snyk as a SAML entity or service provider. The **d**efault Entity ID must be checked manually as no default is set for this.
* The **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS)** is the endpoint on the Snyk network that listens for requests from your identity provider to enable communication between users on your network and Snyk. This URL is sometimes called a Reply URL.
* The **Signing certificate** is the Snyk certificate, stored on your server that is needed to maintain the trust relationship. It contains the necessary encryption keys for authentication.

Use these details to set up the connection with your Identity provider (IdP):

| Entity ID (SNYK-US-01 and SNYK-US-02)           | urn:auth0:snyk:saml-{group-slug}                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entity ID (SNYK-EU-01)                          | urn:auth0:snyk-mt-eu-prod-1:saml-{group-slug}                                        |
| Entity ID (SNYK-AU-01)                          | urn:auth0:snyk-mt-au-prod-1:saml-{group-slug}                                        |
| ACS URL (SNYK-US-01 and SNYK-US-02)             | <https://snyk.auth0.com/login/callback?connection=saml->{group-slug}                 |
| ACS URL (SNYK-EU-01)                            | <https://snyk-mt-eu-prod-1.eu.auth0.com/login/callback?connection=saml->{group-slug} |
| ACS URL (SNYK-AU-01)                            | <https://snyk-mt-au-prod-1.au.auth0.com/login/callback?connection=saml>-{group-slug} |
| Signing certificate (SNYK-US-01 and SNYK-US-02) | <https://snyk.auth0.com/pem>                                                         |
| Signing certificate (SNYK-EU-01)                | <https://snyk-mt-eu-prod-1.eu.auth0.com/pem?cert=connection>                         |
| Signing certificate (SNYK-AU-01)                | <https://snyk-mt-au-prod-1.au.auth0.com/pem?cert=connection)>                        |

{% hint style="info" %}
Replace {group-slug} with the name of your Snyk Group. If your Group name includes spaces, replace them with dashes. For example, if your Group name is `Your Company Group`, then the {group-slug} value is your-company-group.
{% endhint %}

To map information from your Identity provider to Snyk, name your user attributes as follows, using the same capitalization and spelling:

| email    | The user email address                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| name     | The name of the person to be authenticated      |
| username | The person’s username for the identity provider |

If your user attributes do not match, note that the Snyk configuration for your SSO will take more time.

## SAML information to provide to Snyk

Obtain the following information from your identity provider. Provide this information to Snyk to establish trust on the service-provider side.

## Set up OpenID Connect (OIDC) for SSO

{% hint style="info" %}
The IdP (or issuer URL) must be publicly reachable. If these cannot be made public then SAML should be used rather than OIDC
{% endhint %}

When using OIDC for the connection between your Identity provider and Snyk, add the Callback/Redirect URIs and OAuth Grant Type in your identity provider to establish trust with Snyk.

| Information                                        | Description                                             |

## Set up Entra ID as SSO (via App Registration/OIDC)

When using Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for the connection between your Identity provider and Snyk, you must add the Redirect URIs in your Identity provider to establish trust with Snyk.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use your Entra ID name when authenticating rather than the SCM user account name, or a connection error can occur.
{% endhint %}

| Information                               | Description                                             |

## Set up ADFS as SSO

When using Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) for the connection between your Identity provider and Snyk, add the Realm Identifier, a Callback URL, and a Signing certificate in your Identity provider to establish trust with Snyk. For more information, see [Connecting Auth0 to an ADFS server (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICW6sGP9ht8).

| Realm Identifier (SNYK-US-01 and SNYK-US-02) | urn:auth0:snyk                                                                                       |

## ADFS information to provide to Snyk

Obtain the following information from your Identity provider. Provide this information to Snyk in order to establish trust on the service-provider side: ADFS URL or Federation Metadata XML file

For Enterprise plans, Snyk can map new users to a specific Organization and role when they first sign in using SSO. This option requires additional configuration, including specific naming conventions for organizations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Work with your Snyk account team to prepare for implementing this SSO option.
{% endhint %}

## Complete SSO connection

After you set up the connection with your Identity provider and provide the necessary details to Snyk Support, Snyk sends you a link to generate a payload.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ignore any error message you see after clicking this link the first time, as Snyk uses the generated payload to complete the configuration.
{% endhint %}

When Snyk finishes the configuration, the support agent asks you to navigate to the login page in incognito mode to prevent cookies from interfering with the login process.

Use <https://app.snyk.io/login/sso> (or the regional equivalent) for logging into your production environment.

To complete your login:

1. Enter your email address.
2. Select **Continue to provider**.
3. Log in with your identity provider as you would for other applications.
4. Let Snyk Support know which user to promote as the Group administrator.

## Resources for SSO setup

# Configure Self-Serve Single Sign-On (SSO)

Group Admins on a Snyk Enterprise plan who use SAML for SSO can configure Snyk Single Sign-on themselves. Ensure you have at least one Group and Organization where you can assign new users. See [Manage Groups and Organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations).

{% hint style="info" %}
To enable the self-serve SSO option, contact your Snyk account team or [Snyk support](https://support.snyk.io).\
\
This option does not accommodate [custom role mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping). To set up custom role mapping with SSO for your Snyk Group, contact your Snyk account team.
{% endhint %}

The following video demonstrates the process and steps for setting up single sign-on when using SAML.

{% embed url="<https://thoughtindustries-1.wistia.com/medias/dyg9opxlv8>" %}

## Use SAML for SSO: process overview

The process of establishing trust between your identity provider (IdP) and Snyk requires that the Group Admin do the following:

1. Configure your identity provider (IdP) by using the details about the Snyk environment displayed on-screen and user attributes.
2. Enter SAML attributes from your identity provider(IdP) on the Group SSO Settings page.
3. Configure Snyk SSO settings, choosing how you want your members to log in.
4. Verify SSO login to confirm the login process is working correctly.

{% hint style="info" %}
After SSO is configured both from Snyk and your company's network, a trust relationship is established with Snyk, Auth0 (on behalf of Snyk), and your network. Any sensitive data is encrypted and stored in Auth0 only for the purposes of enabling user logins.

Although not all the examples following this page cover verifying the Snyk signature, it is recommended that you improve the trust relationship and ensure integrity even further. Follow your respective IdP's documentation to add SP signature verification where possible.
{% endhint %}

## **User login**

Users are [provisioned ](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/choose-a-provisioning-option)to Snyk when they log in. If the new user role selected is Group Member, the new user sees only a list of your Organizations until the admin adds them to the appropriate Organizations.

## High-level configuration steps

### **Configuring the IdP**

1. In the Snyk web UI, navigate to **Group** > **Settings.**
2. Select **SSO** and copy the needed information in step 1, namely **Entity ID**, **ACS URL,** and the Snyk **signing certificate URL**.
3. Enter these details in the IdP where appropriate and upload the Snyk signing certificate after downloading it locally in case the IdP does not accept only the certificate URL.
4. Before moving back to the Snyk UI, copy the IdP provided sign in URL and copy or download the IdP-provided **X509 signing certificate** details.

### **Configuring Snyk**

1. In Step 2 of the SSO settings page in the Snyk web UI, enter the details collected from the IdP by providing the sign in URL, sign out URL if available and desired, the IdP signing certificate and domains and subdomains that will be served over the SSO connection.
2. In case the connection requires HTTP-Redirect protocol binding, change that option from the default HTTP-POST.
3. Finally, verify if an IdP-initiated workflow should be enabled and then select **Create Connection** or **Save changes** if you are modifying an existing connectio&#x6E;**.**

### **Setting up user provisioning**

1. To make sure users are assigned the correct role when logging in for the first time, choose either **Group member**, **Org Collaborator** or **Org Admin**. Refer to [choosing a provisioning option](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/choose-a-provisioning-option) for details on the options in this step.
2. In the section **Profile Attributes**, the fields are auto-populated but verify that **Email**, **Name** and **Username**, if known, exactly match the corresponding keys in the SAML payload raw JSON sent by the IdP to Snyk. Select **Save Changes** and move to the final step where you verify the setup.

### **Testing and verifying the configuration**

1. Provided all details have been entered correctly, the direct URL from the top of **Step 3** in the Snyk web UI can now be used to verify the configuration works as intended by logging in as a user in the directory of the IdP.
2. When all stored details are verified to be accurate (name, e-mail, permissions), Snyk generally recommends existing users that previously were logged in through Social login methods be removed from the Snyk platform. This can be accomplished under the Group menu **Members.**

If you wish to add signature verification of the incoming Snyk request:

1. Download the **Signing certificate** at step 1 of the Snyk SSO settings.
2. Use the following openssl command to convert it to .cer-format `openssl x509 -outform DER -in snyk.pem -out snyk.cer`
3. At the bottom of the **SAML Certificates** settings of your SSO app in Active Directory, click **Edit** next to **Verification certificates.**
4. Check **Require verification certificates** and upload the certificate from the output of the above openssl command and click **Save**.

# Custom mapping

Custom mapping allows you to dynamically assign users to your Snyk Groups and Organizations based on data provided by your Identity Provider (IdP), in order to implement a scaled user provisioning and access model.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Contact your Snyk account team or Snyk Support to turn on custom mapping once you have completed the setup steps.
{% endhint %}

To understand more about roles and permissions within Snyk, see [Pre-defined roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles). See also [user role management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management).

## Requirements for custom mapping

* Complete the SSO information worksheet for the appropriate IdP (identity provider) found in [Resources for SSO setup](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/set-up-snyk-single-sign-on-sso#resources-for-sso-setup).
* Properly configure the custom attributes in your IdP to populate the `roles` array mapping. See [Roles array mapping with Snyk](#roles-array-mapping-with-snyk).

## Custom mapping options

Snyk offers an updated custom mapping option explained on this page, with increased flexibility, including the ability to grant users Group-level and Tenant-level custom roles, in addition to pre-defined roles.

The Snyk [Legacy custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/legacy-custom-mapping) option is still supported.

## Roles array mapping with Snyk

In the IdP, you must first pass a custom mapping called `roles` as a string array. [Examples](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/examples-setting-up-custom-mapping-for-idps) of how to set this up for different IdPs are provided.

Refer to your identity provider documentation for further information on how to configure custom mappings.

## Custom mapping assertions

This section documents the role assertions that Snyk expects in order to map correctly to Snyk roles within Snyk Tenants, Groups, and Organizations.

### Role assertion format

Role assertions should be provided to Snyk in the following format:

`snyk:{scope}:{target}:{role}`

Where:

* `snyk` is a fixed prefix for role mapping. **Required**.
* `scope` can be one of `org`, `group`, or `tenant`. **Required**; if a role mapping does not contain a valid scope, it will be ignored.
* `target` can be a slug of an `org`, `group`, or `tenant` where the role will be granted. See [slugs](#slugs) for more information.
  * **Optional**; may be an asterisk `*` or empty string `::`to apply as a [wildcard](#wildcards) for all resources within the defined `scope` that are associated with the SSO connection.
  * **Optional**; an asterisk ( `*`) or an empty string can be used to apply to all resources **t**hat are associated with the SSO connection.
* `role` is the normalized name of the required role. **Required**; if no role is present, the role mapping is ignored. See [Role normalized name](#role-normalized-name) to find this information.
  * If the role is a custom role, that is, a role created in the Group Member Roles admin panel that can be of either `Org` or `Group` type, then it must have a `custom:` prefix. See the [example role assertions](#example-role-assertions).
  * Built-in roles do not have the `custom:` prefix, so values like `org_admin`, `org_collaborator`, `group_viewer` will refer to the Snyk pre-defined roles, which are shown with a padlock symbol in the Member Roles page.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Users must only have one role mapped per Organization, Group or Tenant. Mapping multiple roles except when using wildcards is not supported and can lead to unexpected behavior.
{% endhint %}

### Default role assignments

All users with any memberships within a Tenant must have a Tenant membership. If a user has a membership of an Organization, they must also have a Group Membership.

If only an Organization-level role assertion is provided for a given user, for example, then the user will automatically be assigned the **Tenant Member** and **Group Member** roles. These automatic assignments can be overridden by providing role assertions at the Group or Tenant level.

Snyk recommends providing explicit Tenant level and Group level role assertions where needed, to ensure that users have the correct role on login.

{% hint style="info" %}
An SSO connection may only be associated with one Tenant, and all users with any memberships within a tenant must also have a Tenant Membership.

Therefore, it may be easier to assign Tenant-level roles by using the wildcard syntax (see example below), since the SSO is only linked to the one Tenant.
{% endhint %}

### Example role assertions

* `snyk:group:*:group_admin` Assigns the user the Group admin role for all groups associated with the SSO connection.
* `snyk:group::custom:sysadmin` Assigns the user the custom Group-level role `Sys Admin` for all groups associated with the SSO connection.
  * Note that `::` here indicates an empty string for the target, and so is treated as a wildcard in the preceding example.
  * Note that this Group-level custom role must be created manually before it can be assigned.
* `snyk:org:my-default-org:org_admin` Assigns the user the **Organization Admin** Organization-level role for the Organization `my-default-org`.
* `snyk:tenant::tenant_admin` Assigns the user the **Tenant Admin** Tenant-level role for the Tenant associated with the SSO connection.

### Example role assertions array

An example of a set of role assertions for a user follows:

<pre><code><strong>{
</strong><strong>    "roles": [
</strong>        "snyk:group:*:group_viewer",
        "snyk:org:development:org_admin",
        "snyk:org:test-org-N58YhztauHcaMiNfvi5fbL:custom:developer_readonly",
    ]
}
</code></pre>

{% hint style="info" %}
The system also supports comma-separated lists of roles instead of an array.

```
{
  "roles": "snyk:group:*:group_viewer, snyk:org:development:org_admin, 
snyk:org:test-org-N58YhztauHcaMiNfvi5fbL:custom:developer_readonly"
}
```

{% endhint %}

These assertions will assign the user:

* The pre-defined Group-level role **Group Viewer** for all groups in the SSO. See [pre-defined roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles) for the permission this grants
* The pre-defined Organization-level role **Organization Admin** for the Organization with the name **Development**.
* The custom Organization-level role **Developer ReadOnly** for the Organization with the name **Test Org**, which has the slug `test-org-N58YhztauHcaMiNfvi5fbL`.

## Wildcards

Custom mapping introduces wildcards, which allow one assertion to assign a user the same role in all Organizations or Groups.

Assertions using wildcards take a lower priority than assertions with a specific target. This means that it is possible, for example, to assign a user a default role for all Organizations, and specific roles in others:

```
roles: [
        "snyk:org:*:custom:developer_readonly",
        "snyk:org:development:org_admin",
    ]
```

These role assertions will:

* Grant the user the pre-defined Organization-level role **Organization Admin** in the **Development** Organization.
* Grant the user the custom Organization-level role **Developer ReadOnly** on all other organizations within the SSO connection.
* Grant the user the pre-defined Group-level role **Group Member** on all groups in the SSO connection. For more details, see the note that follows.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any user that is granted a role in an Organization within the SSO without an explicit Group-level role in the role assertion, will also be implicitly assigned the **Group Member** Group-level role for that Group. This is the pre-defined Group-level role with the fewest permissions and ensures that the user becomes a member of the Group.
{% endhint %}

## Slugs

For a valid role assertion, the Organization or Group slug may be required, where a wildcard is not used. The slug is the canonical name for the Organization or Group within Snyk.

To find an Organization slug, navigate to the **Settings** page for the Organization, and under **General** settings, the Organization slug value is visible. This can then be copied and used in role assertions in custom mapping.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-12fb2c613b73cb9b4654950d21873d841c0bf059%2Forganization-settings-general-slugs.png?alt=media" alt="Organization general settings page, showing the Organization slug"><figcaption><p>Organization general settings page, showing the Organization slug</p></figcaption></figure>

To find the slug of a Group, navigate to the Group Settings, and find the Group slug under General Settings, which you can copy.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-b96ba36e865e64be08006ad4d78babe725abcfcb%2Fimage%20(153).png?alt=media" alt="Group general settings page, showing the Group slug"><figcaption><p>Group general settings page, showing the Group slug</p></figcaption></figure>

## Role normalized name

To find the normalized name of a role for use in custom mapping, first confirm that the role exists for the Snyk Group by navigating to it in the Group settings: **Group Settings** > **Member Roles** > {**Role**}.

This will open the role details page that shows which permissions are enabled for the role and also shows the normalized name. Copy this normalized name and use it in custom mapping.

For more details on roles, and specifically, custom roles, see [user role management](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management).

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-c84c04de07c9b4dc39e2fb43ce3795c2c7a18f27%2Fimage%20(154).png?alt=media" alt="Role details page for Organization Admin role"><figcaption><p>Role details page for Organization Admin role</p></figcaption></figure>

## Pre-defined role slugs

Snyk has a set of [pre-defined roles](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/pre-defined-roles). Their corresponding normalized names are listed below.

| Role Type    | Role Name        | Role Slug          |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Organization | Org Admin        | `org_admin`        |
| Organization | Org Collaborator | `org_collaborator` |
| Group        | Group Admin      | `group_admin`      |
| Group        | Group Viewer     | `group_viewer`     |
| Group        | Group Member     | `group_member`     |
| Tenant       | Tenant Admin     | `tenant_admin`     |
| Tenant       | Tenant Viewer    | `tenant_viewer`    |
| Tenant       | Tenant Member    | `tenant_member`    |


# Legacy custom mapping

To configure this option, send the `roles` array within the SAML attributes or OIDC claims to adhere to **one** of the following patterns:

snyk-groupadmin

* This role mapping assigns users with the Group Admin role.
* **groupadmin** configures all users with this role as a Group Admin all Group(s) that the user is assigned to, which grants Organization Admin permissions to all Organizations that fall under the Group(s).

snyk-groupviewer

* This role mapping assigns users with the Group Viewer role and grants read-only access to the Group, reports, and all Organizations associated with the Group.

snyk-{groupID}

* This role mapping assigns users with the Org Collaborator roles for all Organizations underneath the specified Group(s).
* **groupID** is the ID string for a group in Snyk. This can be found in the snyk URL at the Group level: `https://app.snyk.io/group/<Group ID>` or **Group dropdown -> Settings -> General -> Group ID**.

snyk-{orgslug}-{role}

* This role mapping assigns users with the specified role of Collaborator or Admin or Custom Role for the Snyk Organization specified in `orgslug`.
* `orgslug` is the unique identifier of the Organization name in Snyk.
  * How to find the `orgslug`: `https://app.snyk.io/org/{orgslug}` OR by using the endpoint [List all organizations in a group](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-api/reference/groups-v1#group-groupid-orgs).
  * **Note**: The `orgslug` is the name of the Organization in most cases; however, there may be exceptions.
  * Note: `orgslug` can be a value of up to 60 characters.
* **role**:
  * If you are using standard roles, `{role}` should be either `collaborator` or `admin`**.**
  * Custom Role can also be used for `{role}` and should use the normalized name. See [Roles in custom SSO](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/user-role-management#use-roles-in-custom-sso) for more details.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users must only have one role mapped per Organization. Mapping multiple roles for an Organization is not supported and can lead to unexpected behavior.
{% endhint %}

### Tenant-level role assertions

{% hint style="info" %}
With the introduction of Tenants, Snyk has added new possible role assertions at a Tenant level, enabling customers to assign Tenant-level roles.
{% endhint %}

The following role mappings assign users a tenant role.

Only one Tenant-Level assertion may be provided for each user. If no Tenant-level assertion is provided, the user will be granted the **Tenant Member** role if they do not already have a Tenant-level membership.

snyk-tenantadmin

* This role mapping grants the user the **Tenant Admin** role.

snyk-tenantviewer

* This role mapping grants the user the **Tenant Viewer** role.

snyk-tenantmember

* This role mapping grants the user the **Tenant Viewer** role.

## Roles array mapping format

To assign users with Group Admin role, use the following format:

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-groupadmin"
    ]
}
```

To assign users with Group Viewer roles, use the following format:

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-groupviewer"
    ]
}
```

To assign users with Org Collaborator roles, use the following format:

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-{groupID}"
    ]
}
```

To assign users as Org Admin or Org Collaborator, use the following format for the roles array.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can assign different roles on a per-org basis. The following example assigns a user as Org Admin in the `orgslug` Org but a Collaborator in the `orgslug2` Org.
{% endhint %}

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-{orgslug}-admin",
        "snyk-{orgslug2}-collaborator"
    ]
}
```

To assign users a custom role, use the following format for the roles array. You can assign different roles on a per-Org basis and can use a combination of standard and custom roles for different Orgs.

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-{orgslug}-admin",
        "snyk-{orgslug2}-collaborator",
        "snyk-{orgslug3}-developer_readonly"
    ]
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The system also supports comma-separated lists of roles instead of an array.

```
{
  "roles": "snyk-{orgslug}-admin,snyk-{orgslug2}-collaborator"
}
```

{% endhint %}

## Example roles array mapping

The following example shows how to assign roles to Snyk users under the mapping convention.

* The customer is named ABC and has one Group called ABC.
* The customer has three Organizations within Snyk: Application-SecurityScanner1, Partner-Plugins, and Application-Payments.
* The customer has four teams: Business Development, Engineering, Security, and Product. Each has different needs:
  * The Business Development team needs access to the ABC group and only the Partner-Plugins Organization as Org Admin.
  * Engineering needs access to the ABC Group, the Application-SecurityScanner1 Organization as Org Admin, Partner-Plugins Organization as Org Admin, and Application-Payments as Org Collaborator.
  * Security needs access to the ABC group as Group Admin and all three organizations as Org Admin.
  * The Product team needs access to the ABC group and all three organizations as Org Collaborator,

For the Business Development Team, Snyk uses the snyk-{orgslug}-{role} mapping:

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-partner-plugins-admin"
    ]
}
```

For the Engineering Team, Snyk uses the snyk-{orgslug}-{role} mapping:

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-application-securityscanner1-admin",
        "snyk-partner-plugins-admin",
        "snyk-application-payments-collaborator"
    ]
}
```

For the Security Team, Snyk uses the snyk-groupadmin mapping:

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-groupadmin"
    ]
}
```

For the Product Team, Snyk uses the snyk-{groupID} mapping, where the value of groupID must be inserted;

```
{
    "roles": [
        "snyk-{groupID}"
    ]
}
```

# Example: setting up custom mapping for Okta

The following shows two different options for custom mapping of Okta roles, using [Legacy custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/legacy-custom-mapping).

{% hint style="info" %}
For both of these options to work, the Snyk SSO application must be assigned at the group level, not the user level.
{% endhint %}

## Option 1: Assign Custom Mapping with Groups

In this configuration:

* Okta groups are mapped to Snyk Organizations.
* Okta groups are mapped to Snyk Organization membership roles.
* The user role in Snyk is pre-set in each Okta group for all members of that group.

The steps follow.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The Snyk SSO application must be assigned at the group level, not the user level.

When you look at a user's Application assignment it should look similar to the image that follows, with set by **Snyk-Roles group** following **Add Another** grayed out.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-677797fed727c422485033b4e996b5e20e3fd3f4%2Fsnyk-roles.png?alt=media" alt="Roles set on group level"><figcaption><p>Roles set on group level</p></figcaption></figure>

### Create a single app attribute containing both the Snyk Organization name and role

1. On the main page of Okta, select **Directory** > **Profile Editor** > **your Snyk SSO app**.
2. Select **+Add Attribute**.
3. In the corresponding fields, add the following details for this Attribute:\
   **Data type**: string array\
   **Display name**: Snyk Orgs\
   **Variable name:** snyk\_orgs\
   **Group Priority**: Combine values across groups
4. Select **Save.**

### Assign the attribute to the relevant Okta groups

1. On the main page of Okta select **Directory** > **Groups**.
2. Select a **Group**, navigate to the **Applications** tab, click **Assign** **application** if not already assigned, and choose your Snyk SSO app,. Then click on the pencil next to the displayed Snyk SSO app.
3. In the **Edit App Assignment** dialog, add the Snyk Organization slug, and the Organization role name associated with your Okta group (no spaces or capital letters), following the syntax explained in [custom mapping ](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping)(or see [legacy custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/legacy-custom-mapping) if you are using that option).
4. Repeat the preceding steps for all your applicable Okta groups to assign the org name and role combination to each user within each configured group.

### Construct a value expression that creates a roles array to be sent to Snyk

1. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click on the **Snyk app** you configured.
2. Select **General Tab** > **Edit SAML Settings** and click **next** to go to the **Configure SAML** step.
3. Add an **Attribute Statement** named “roles” of an unspecified type.
4. Select **Attribute Statements** and set **roles** as the **Name** field with **Name format** **Unspecified** and the **Value** in the following expression:

   `Arrays.flatten(appuser.snyk_orgs)`
5. Reach out to your Snyk point of contact so they can complete the configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your Snyk representative lets you know that `Arrays.flatten(appuser.snyk_orgs)` is sent to Snyk, instead of the actual roles value(s), you must verify that the App is assigned at the Group level and not the user level. If both user and Group have been assigned, the individual assignment will take precedence, and the roles assignment will not work. Remove the individual assignment if this is the case.
{% endhint %}

## Option 2: Assign custom mapping with user roles

The following describes Custom Mapping with user roles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
These instructions show how to map roles using the [legacy custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/legacy-custom-mapping) option. To use Custom mapping, [option 1](#option-1-assign-custom-mapping-with-groups) is recommended.\
Reach out to your Snyk point of contact if you have any questions
{% endhint %}

* Okta groups are mapped to Snyk Organizations.
* User profiles are tied to each user, not the Okta group.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The Snyk SSO application must be assigned at the group level, not the user level.

When you look at a user's Application assignment it should look similar to the image that follows, with set by **Snyk-Roles group** following **Add Another** grayed out.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-86894487fbfea0eaa91c87a9e5404786724ea263%2Fimage%20(155).png?alt=media" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Create an app attribute that contains the names of your relevant Snyk Organizations

When your Snyk Groups and users have been set up, follow these steps:

1. On the main page of Okta select **Directory** > **Profile Editor** > **your Snyk SSO app**.
2. Select **+Add Attribute**.
3. In the corresponding fields, add the following details for the first Attribute:\
   **Data type**: string array\
   **Display name**: Snyk Orgs\
   **Variable name**: snyk\_orgs\
   **Group Priority**: Combine values across groups
4. select **Save and Add Another**.

### Create a second app attribute that contains roles

1. In the corresponding fields, add the following details for the second Attribute:\
   **Data type**: String\
   **Display name**: Snyk User Role\
   **Variable name**: user\_role\
   **Enum**: Check **Define enumerated list of values**\
   **Attribute members Collaborator:** collaborator or collab\
   **Attribute members Admin**: administrator or admin\
   **Attribute members GroupAdmin**: groupadmin\
   **Attribute required**: Yes\
   **Scope**: User personal
2. Select **Save**.

### Assign the first attribute to your Okta groups

1. On the main page of Okta select **Directory > Groups**.
2. Select a **Group**, navigate to the **Applications** tab, click **Assign** **application i**f not already assigned, and choose your Snyk SSO app. Then click on the pencil next to the displayed Snyk app.
3. In **Edit App Assignment** dialog, add the Snyk Organization name to associate with your Okta group (no spaces or capital letter(s)).
4. Repeat the preceding steps to assign the Snyk app to all your applicable Okta groups, modifying the Snyk Organization name as needed.

### Assign the second attribute to your users

1. On the main page of Okta select **Directory** > **People.**
2. Select a **User,** navigate to the **Applications** tab, and click on the pencil next to the application.
3. Select the right user type in group (user role): **Collaborator**, **Admin**, or **Group Admin**.

### Construct a value expression that concatenates these two attributes into string values in a roles array to be sent to Snyk

1. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click on the **Snyk app** you configured.
2. Select **General Tab** > **SAML Settings** > **Edit** and click **next** to go to the Configure SAML step.
3. Select **Attribute Statements** and add an attribute named **roles** with **Name format** **Unspecified** and the **Value** in the following expression:\
   `appuser.user_role == "groupadmin" ? "snyk-groupadmin" : Arrays.flatten(String.replace(String.replace(String.append("snyk-",String.append(Arrays.toCsvString(appuser.snyk_orgs),"-"+appuser.user_role)),",",",snyk-"),",","-"+appuser.user_role+","))`
4. Click **Next** > **Finish.**
5. Reach out to your Snyk point of contact so they can complete the configuration. This process may take four to five days.

The following explains the roles expression:

* If the role is `groupadmin`, the expression ignores everything else and passes `snyk-groupadmin`.
* If the role is not `groupadmin`, then for each Snyk Org name listed across all Groups, the expression automatically concatenates the prefix “`snyk-`” with the Snyk Org name and appends `user_role` at the end of each Organization name. An example result follows.

Example roles are:`[ "snyk-groupadmin", "snyk-org1-admin", "snyk-org2-admin" ]`


# Example: setting up custom mapping for Entra ID

The following information shows how to configure the custom mapping of roles for Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Entra ID Enterprise Application example](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/configure-self-serve-single-sign-on-sso/azure-ad-enterprise-application-setup) for guidance setting up the initial Enterprise application.

Any step on the Snyk side in setting up the Enterprise application must be performed by your Snyk contact, as self-serve SSO does not accommodate custom mapping.
{% endhint %}

The following are the prerequisites for configuring app roles:

* Snyk support must configure your Snyk SSO as Microsoft Entra ID (WAAD or SAML).
* If you select SAML, there is a requirement to add a custom claim; the step to do that is in these instructions.
* You must have an existing Azure Enterprise application and app registration connected to that SSO configuration.

The **steps** in **configuring App role**s follow.

1. In your App registration menu, select the name of your Enterprise Application.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-58d29e9cf6505cb1792fea1712d4416235935180%2Fimage%20(113).png?alt=media&#x26;token=6f9c572d-7fff-4d1c-ae47-3a987af3bc46" alt="App registration, select name of Enterprise Application"><figcaption><p>App registration, select name of Enterprise Application</p></figcaption></figure>
2. Select **App roles**, then **Create app role**.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ba6014b19f4a4c5065134672b52a797e426f70f5%2Fimage%20(1)%20(1)%20(2)%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=e760628f-f775-44a5-a691-4e6a9cab8cfa" alt="Select App roles, Create app role"><figcaption><p>Select App roles, Create app role</p></figcaption></figure>
3. Create an app role with details as needed.\
   Select the **Allowed member types**: **Users/Groups**, **Applications**, or **Both**.\

Ensure you add the claim correctly. If you do not add it or you do it incorrectly, for example, by adding a typo, it can lead to a full mapping failure, which can lock users out of their accounts.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-6b137e9ada079d1d40386fa66514c214480a59cb%2FScreenshot%202023-03-10%20at%202.55.05%20PM.png?alt=media" alt="Custom claim"><figcaption><p>Custom claim</p></figcaption></figure>

When you have completed these steps, reach out to your Snyk point of contact to have the configuration completed.


# Example: setting up custom mapping for Ping Identity

This page explains how to configure the custom mapping of roles for Ping Identity using [Legacy custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/legacy-custom-mapping).

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide assumes your Ping Identity application is configured and functional.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Any step on the Snyk side in setting up the Enterprise application must be performed by your Snyk contact, as self-serve SSO does not accommodate custom mapping.
{% endhint %}

1. In your application configuration, select **Attribute mappings** and click the pencil to edit the attributes.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-be84ee0fb4db350b687ddfc7d56c77e527fb08cc%2F6%20(4).png?alt=media" alt="Edit mapping attributes"><figcaption><p>Edit mapping attributes</p></figcaption></figure>
2. Select **+Add** and enter the following attribute, then save the change,\
   **roles**: `Group Names`\\

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-86fb4d7c1ae68c0ecd61b01e11cc82934279286f%2FScreenshot%202023-09-05%20at%2012.02.30%20PM.png?alt=media" alt="Add roles array"><figcaption><p>Add roles array</p></figcaption></figure>
3. In the left menu, select **Identities/Groups** and add the Snyk Groups needed following the syntax explained on the [Cusom Mapping Option](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping) page.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-f77c9915cd118185d054dff06c95e9af522fd890%2F12.png?alt=media" alt="Adding an example Group"><figcaption><p>Adding an example Group</p></figcaption></figure>
4. If you so not select a **Population** at the bottom of the previous screen, ensure that you assign the Group to the user(s) who should be part of the role assignment in Snyk. If you select a **Population**, all users in that population will inherit the permissions of the assigned Snyk role.
5. To finalize the process, reach out to your Snyk contact to validate that the SAML payload contains the role array and to enable the custom mapping feature.


# Example: setting up custom mapping for Google Workspace

The following shows how to use [custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping) to map roles for a Google Workspace custom SAML connection.

For additional details and guidance, see the [Google documentation, Manage Custom User Fields](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-schemas).

To use the API, either log in to your Google Workspace admin area and from there execute the commands that follow , or for flexibility and automation, use the API with your preferred API client or script. To generate API credentials, refer to the Google documentation, [Create access credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials).

## Add a user schema

Use the [schema endpoint](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/schemas/insert) to add a schema that can be tied to the users. An example schema follows. This schema makes it possible to expose the desired custom role mapping in the SAML payload for the user.

```json
{
   "fields":
   [
     {
       "fieldName": "roles",
       "fieldType": "STRING",
       "readAccessType": "ADMINS_AND_SELF",
       "multiValued": true,
       "displayName": "roles"
     }
   ],
   "schemaName": "Snyk-SSO"
 }
```

## Modify user profiles

Attach the desired roles to the user profile with the user [API endpoint](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users/patch). An example payload follows for reference.

```json
{
 "customSchemas": {
   "Snyk-SSO": {
     "roles": [
       {
         "value": "snyk:org:org1:org_admin"
       },
       {
         "value": "snyk:org:org2:org_admin"
       }
     ]
   }
 }
}
```

## Modify SAML attributes

To expose these roles in the SAML payload, you must modify the attributes in the SAML attribute mapping:

1. Log in to your Google Workspace Admin area and go to **Apps** and then **Web and mobile apps** and open your application.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-bec4d0b8c1d257eef6d8f40441c03b9e5fe073f2%2Fx1.png?alt=media" alt="Open Google SAML app"><figcaption><p>Open Google SAML app</p></figcaption></figure>
2. Click on **SAML attribute mapping** and then **ADD MAPPING**.
3. Click **Select field** and scroll to the bottom until you find **Snyk-SSO - roles** and select it.
4. In the **App attributes** value field, enter **roles** and click **Save**.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-20884547962e40277587ed19fbdfa0b416d8e4c0%2Fx2.png?alt=media" alt="Adding custom mapping app attribute"><figcaption><p>Adding custom mapping app attribute</p></figcaption></figure>

After this, log in as a user and have your Snyk contact validate the SAML payload and finalize the setup in the Snyk backend.


# Example: setting up custom mapping for an Okta OIDC app

Follow these steps configure an integration for OIDC Okta.

## Create an Okta OIDC app

1. In Okta, select **Applications** > **Applications** > **Create App Integration** then choose **OICD OpenID Connect** and **Web Application.**

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-107ba139a459856075d6e6b578b3aba0153fa992%2F1.png?alt=media" alt="Create a new app integration in Okta"><figcaption><p>Create a new app integration in Okta</p></figcaption></figure>
2. In the next step add an **App integration name** for your OIDC application, check the **Implicit** **Grant Type** and add the **Sign-in redirect URI** relevant to your [Snyk platform deployment](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/set-up-snyk-single-sign-on-sso). Remove the placeholder **Sign-out redirect URI** and choose your assignment access control before clicking **Save.**

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ec3d770ddff530908096001f2410a9dae6f93b16%2F2%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=5a8dc6cc-7d03-4cd8-8bfa-05035ed40759" alt="Provide details for new web app integration"><figcaption><p>Provide details for new web app integration</p></figcaption></figure>
3. On the application page that opens after saving, copy the details identified in [OIDC information to provide to Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/set-up-snyk-single-sign-on-sso#oidc-information-to-provide-to-snyk) and provide to your Snyk contact:
   * Client ID
   * If you are not using the Implicit Grant type, the client secret
4. Also, share with Snyk the Issuer URL/domain. This is typically the URL you find in your browser address bar without "-admin", for example, <https://customer.example.okta.com>. It can also be found under the **Sign-On** tab of your application by editing the **OpenID Connect ID Token** from **Dynamic** Issuer to **Okta URL**.

If you wish to set up custom mapping, move on to the next section of this guide.

## Add custom mapping

[Custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping) for an OIDC application in Okta is easily managed through custom attributes on the Group level.

### Create a custom app user attribute to contain both the Snyk Organization name and role

1. In Okta, select your newly created OIDC application user profile under **Directory** > **Profile editor.**
2. Select **+Add Attribute.**

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-1afe1ec02f568024263dd26e8677924fbe204921%2F3.png?alt=media&#x26;token=359113f0-cf22-4ec0-ad5c-44214b533367" alt="Okta profile editor"><figcaption><p>Okta profile editor</p></figcaption></figure>
3. In the corresponding fields, add the following details for this Attribute and click **Save**:\
   **Data type**: string array\
   **Display name**: Snyk roles\
   **Variable name:** roles\
   **Group Priority**: Combine values across groups

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-77ebb69ead31aa192f7f1b6ccf9b4f67b4355063%2F4.png?alt=media" alt="Attribute details"><figcaption><p>Attribute details</p></figcaption></figure>

### Assign the attribute to the relevant Okta groups

1. On the main page of Okta select **Directory** > **Groups**.
2. Select a **Group**, navigate to the **Applications** tab, click **Assign** **application** if not already assigned, and choose your Snyk OIDC app,. Then click on the pencil next to the displayed Snyk OIDC app.

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-5f70a0fb03862c01c183859e855e026e405112c3%2F5%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=1c7c9c83-6cbe-45f6-8919-f49ed01e969c" alt="Group selected for modicification"><figcaption><p>Group selected for modicification</p></figcaption></figure>
3. In the **Edit App Assignment** dialog, add the Snyk org name + role associated with your Okta group (no spaces or capital letter(s)), following the syntax explained in [custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping) (or [legacy custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping/legacy-custom-mapping) if using the legacy mapping option). Example, `snyk:org:*:org_admin`.\\

   <figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-ec30eca1881fae6c14cc89fa022d1eec4e05cd94%2Fimage%20(160).png?alt=media" alt="Adding Snyk roles"><figcaption><p>Adding Snyk roles</p></figcaption></figure>
4. Repeat the preceding steps for all your applicable Okta groups to assign the org name and role combination to each user within each configured group.


# Example: setting up custom mapping for OneLogin

This example shows how to configure user roles after you have [configured OneLogin SSO for Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/set-up-snyk-single-sign-on-sso).

OneLogin has the concept of groups and roles. However, OneLogin does not support the assignment of multiple groups to a user.

Therefore, roles will be assigned to users directly instead of indirectly through groups.

1. In OneLogin, go to the **Users** and then to the **Roles** section and create the roles following the naming convention outlined for [custom mapping](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/custom-mapping). Each role should have the Snyk SAML app enabled as the role app.\
   Assign the users to their roles as needed.

<figure><img src="https://2533899886-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MdwVZ6HOZriajCf5nXH%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-8c660bfa4dbd1b4808111bfab2a46d1893713e2d%2Fimage%20(156).png?alt=media" alt="OneLogin Roles section"><figcaption><p>OneLogin Roles section</p></figcaption></figure>

2. To transfer the user roles in the SAML assertion to Snyk, go to **Applications**, select the Snyk SAML app, and select the **Parameters** section on the left.\\

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zseB83vGEsQBiQ2_Rc6zOgkKHkv_KN6S-uLHbZc9k_US_aEzFX1AJUJkEgJpucRtdWYgx0mpUhpHiAhCVTsp3xj2o8hVEB0ArnuMmAVYQ9mw44zULICe57XRZDYxkKHpvpnk6o-TXrqYQHN3MuYMyjA" alt="OneLogin Applications Parameters"><figcaption><p>OneLogin Applications Parameters</p></figcaption></figure>

3. Create a **new parameter** named **roles**, with both checkboxes **Include in SAML assertion** and **Multi-value parameter** checked. **Save.**\\
4. On the next screen, select **User Roles** as the **default value** and **Semicolon Delimited Output (Multi-value output).**\
   Ensure that the checkbox **Include in SAML assertion** is checked. **Save**.\\

# Identity Provider (IdP) migration

When migrating from a legacy IdP to a new IdP, you must submit new IdP metadata information to Snyk.

To migrate identity providers:

1. Download the correct Worksheet from the [SSO resources](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-user-docs/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/set-up-snyk-single-sign-on-sso#resources).
2. Fill out Worksheet with the IdP metadata information.
3. Submit the Worksheet; [contact Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io) to raise a Support ticket.

To prevent new users from being created within Snyk, you must maintain your SAML protocol and use both the same Entity ID and ACS URL. If you are changing SAML protocols, [contact Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io).

After you have done this, the Support team will contact you and confirm the updated metadata has granted access through the new IdP.
