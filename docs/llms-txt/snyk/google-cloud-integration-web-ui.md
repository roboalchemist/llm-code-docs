# Google Cloud integration: Web UI

The steps follow to onboard a Google Cloud Project to Snyk via the Web UI:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/google-cloud-integration/google-cloud-integration-web-ui/step-1-download-service-account-iac-template-web-ui) to give Snyk permissions to scan your Project.
2. [Create a Google service account](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/google-cloud-integration/google-cloud-integration-web-ui/step-2-create-the-google-service-account-web-ui) using the template you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Cloud Environment.](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platform-integrations/google-cloud-integration/google-cloud-integration-web-ui/step-3-create-and-scan-a-cloud-environment-for-google-web-ui)

When you have completed the steps, you wlll be able to do the following:

* View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See [Manage cloud issues](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/getting-started-with-cloud-scans/manage-cloud-issues).
* Prioritize your vulnerabilities with cloud context.
