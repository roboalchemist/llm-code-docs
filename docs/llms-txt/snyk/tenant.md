# Tenant

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

The Tenant functionality is available with Enterprise plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
{% endhint %}

A Tenant is the top level of the Snyk hierarchy. It encompasses all your Groups and Organizations and all their corresponding Snyk work items. The Tenant is helpful in organizing access and reporting on the platform when you are a large Enterprise with multiple Groups.

At the Tenant level, you can manage access to features that work across your entire Snyk estate, such as [Snyk Analytics](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/analytics) and Members, which allows you to manage users.

Tenant-level roles include **Tenant Admin**, **Tenant Viewer**, and **Tenant Member**. For more information, see [Pre-defined roles](https://docs.snyk.io/user-roles/pre-defined-roles#role-types).

## Tenant-level options

You can [manage users of a Tenant](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/tenant/manage-users-in-a-tenant) through the **Members** page on the Tenant level.
