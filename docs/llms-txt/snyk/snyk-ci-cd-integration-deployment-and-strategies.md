# Snyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies

When you decide to use a Snyk CI/CD Integration, you typically adopt the integration in specific stages and choose a deployment method. See [CI/CD adoption and deployment](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/ci-cd-adoption-and-deployment).

Then, [set up](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/ci-cd-setup) the CI/CD Integration.

You will be using `snyk test` and `snyk monitor` in the CI/CD integration. [See Snyk test and snyk monitor in CI/CD integration](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/snyk-test-and-snyk-monitor-in-ci-cd-integration).

Review the CI/CD strategies for the code you are scanning:

Troubleshooting information and a list of resources are provided; see [CI/CD troubleshooting and resources](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/ci-cd-troubleshooting-and-resources).
