Events now fire **synchronously**

In the JavaScript package `loro-crdt@1.8.0`, we changed event emission from **âafter a microtaskâ** to **synchronous** dispatch. This makes event handling simpler and less errorâprone.

### Why we changed it

Historically, the JS binding emitted events **after a microtask**. The reason was to avoid Rust borrow/aliasing issues: if an event triggered inside `doc.commit()` reâentered the same `doc`, Rust could panic because `commit()` holds a borrow and reusing the object would violate borrowing rules. Deferring events to a microtask avoided that reâentrancy. (Background: Loroâs JS API exposes subscriptions via `doc.subscribe(...)`; the docs note that events used to arrive after a microtask. ([Loro][1]))

However, this deferral made app logic fragile. There was a window between the mutation and the event callback. Example: the app receives the event from CRDT âdelete the 3rd character of `Hi!`â, but during the microtask gap the app state changed `Hi!` â `Hi`. When the deferred event arrives, applying a âdelete index 2â delta can be wrong. In practice, users had to maintain an awkward invariant: **donât mutate the app state during that microtask** if you consume delta updates.

### Whatâs new in 1.8.0

Events are now **dispatched synchronously**âthat is, your listeners run **before** the topâlevel JS call (e.g., `doc.commit()`) returns. To keep this safe with Rustâs borrowing:

- We keep a **global queue** of âpending (listener, event)â pairs.
- JS wrappers decorate APIs that can borrow the Rust doc (e.g., `commit`, import/export, checkout).
- The wrapper calls into WASM/Rust, **returns from the borrow**, then **flushes the queue** and clears it.
- Because callbacks run **outside** the borrowed region, listeners can freely call `doc` APIs without triggering borrow violations.

### What this means for your app

- **Simpler state updates.** No more microtask gap; event ordering matches your mutation order.
- **Fewer footguns with deltas.** You no longer need to uphold âdonât touch the doc during the microtaskâ when applying deltaâstyle updates.
- **Listeners can still safely use `doc`.**

We are very excited to announce the release of Loro v1.0, a major milestone.

It has a stable encoding format, faster document import and export speed, better version control capabilities, and a shallow snapshot. For more information, please check [the blog](https://loro.dev/blog/v1.0).

The following are the specific API changes:

## New

- `getPendingTxnLength():number`: Get the number of operations in the pending transaction.
- `travelChangeAncestors(ids: ID[], callback: (meta: ChangeMeta)->bool)`: Iterate over all changes including the input id in order, and stop iterating if the callback returns false.

### LoroText

- `updateByLine(text: string)`: Update the current text based on the provided text line by line like git.

### LoroList

- New Subscription for event.
- In Loro 1.0, `doc.version()` `doc.frontiers()` `doc.oplogVersion()` and `doc.oplogFrontiers()` even if ops has not been committed, it indicates the latest version of all operations.
- rename `Loro` to `LoroDoc`.

### LoroTree

- `nodes()`: deleted nodes will be included now, you can use `isDeleted()` to filter.
- `toJSON()`: Now use the hierarchical approach to express the tree structure.

## Deprecation

### LoroDoc

- `exportFrom(version)` and `exportSnapshot()` are deprecated, use `export(mode: ExportMode)` instead.

## New

### 1. New Hooks

`doc.subscribePreCommit(listener)` - Modify commit options before processing:

This hook is particularly useful because doc.commit() is often invoked implicitly in various methods such as doc.import, doc.export, doc.checkout, and doc.exportJsonUpdates. Without this hook, users attempting to add custom messages to each commit might miss these implicit commit triggers.

```ts
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId(0);
doc.subscribePreCommit((e) => {
  e.modifier.setMessage("test").setTimestamp(Date.now());
});
doc.getList("list").insert(0, 100);
doc.commit();
expect(doc.getChangeAt({ peer: "0", counter: 0 }).message).toBe("test");
```

Advanced Example - Creating a Merkle DAG:

```ts no_run
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId(0);
doc.subscribePreCommit((e) => {
  const changes = doc.exportJsonInIdSpan(e.changeMeta);
  expect(changes).toHaveLength(1);
  const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");
  const change = {
    ...changes[0],
    deps: changes[0].deps.map((d) => {
      const depChange = doc.getChangeAt(idStrToId(d));
      return depChange.message;
    }),
  };
  hash.update(JSON.stringify(change));
  const sha256Hash = hash.digest("hex");
  e.modifier.setMessage(sha256Hash);
});

doc.getList("list").insert(0, 100);
doc.commit();

expect(doc.getChangeAt({ peer: "0", counter: 0 }).message).toBe(
  "2af99cf93869173984bcf6b1ce5412610b0413d027a5511a8f720a02a4432853",
);
```

`doc.subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer(listener)` - Triggers on first peer interaction:

This hook provides an ideal point to associate peer information (such as author identity) with the document.

```ts
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId(0);
doc.subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer((e) => {
  doc.getMap("users").set(e.peer, "user-" + e.peer);
});
doc.getList("list").insert(0, 100);
doc.commit();
expect(doc.getMap("users").get("0")).toBe("user-0");
```

### 2. EphemeralStore

EphemeralStore is a better alternative to Awareness for ephemeral states:

Awareness is commonly used as a state-based CRDT for handling ephemeral states in real-time collaboration scenarios, such as cursor positions and application component highlights. As application complexity grows, Awareness may be set in multiple places, from cursor positions to user presence. However, the current version of Awareness doesn't support partial state updates, which means even minor mouse movements require synchronizing the entire Awareness state.

```ts no_run
awareness.setLocalState({
  ...awareness.getLocalState(),
  x: 167,
});
```
Since Awareness is primarily used in real-time collaboration scenarios where consistency requirements are relatively low, we can make it more flexible. We've introduced EphemeralStore as an alternative to Awareness. Think of it as a simple key-value store that uses timestamp-based last-write-wins for conflict resolution. You can choose the appropriate granularity for your key-value pairs based on your application's needs, and only modified key-value pairs are synchronized.


```ts
import {
    EphemeralStore,
    EphemeralListener,
    EphemeralStoreEvent,
} from "loro-crdt";

const store = new EphemeralStore();
// Set ephemeral data
store.set("user-alice", {
    anchor: 10,
    focus: 20,
    user: "Alice"
});

// Encode only the data for `loro-prosemirror`
const encoded = store.encode("user-alice")
const newStore = new EphemeralStore();
newStore.subscribe((e: EphemeralStoreEvent) => {
    // Listen to changes from `local`, `remote`, or `timeout` events
});

newStore.apply(encoded);
console.log(newStore.get("user-alice"))
// {
//     anchor: 10,
//     focus: 20,
//     user: "Alice"
// }
```

## Fix

- Fixed text styling at end "\n" character
- Added JSON support for current transaction operations
- For environments that support multi-threading such as Rust and Swift, LoroDoc can now be directly and safely
  shared and accessed in parallel across multiple threads without triggering the previous WouldBlock panic.

date: 2025/08/29

Snapshot import speed is now 2x.

This is implemented by skipping the scan when importing a snapshot, which avoids running the decompression during the import process (but we need to ensure the parent-child link is still accessible in Arena). It also skips the checksum check in the import_all method on MemKV because we already check the checksum in the header of the snapshot/update.

## v1.0.0 vs v1.6.0

You can find the benchmark [here](https://github.com/loro-dev/latch-bench/tree/cmp-loro-160).

# FILE: pages/docs/advanced/cid.mdx

# Container ID

A Container ID is a unique identifier that comes in two forms:

- Root Container: Composed of a type and root name
- Normal Container: Created through user operations, composed of an ID and type

**Rust `ContainerID`**

```rust
pub enum ContainerID {
    Root {
        name: InternalString,
        container_type: ContainerType,
    },
    Normal {
        peer: PeerID,
        counter: Counter,
        container_type: ContainerType,
    },
}
```

**TypeScript `ContainerID`**

```ts twoslash
import type { ContainerType, PeerID } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
export type ContainerID =
  | `cid:root-${string}:${ContainerType}`
  | `cid:${number}@${PeerID}:${ContainerType}`;
```

1. **Root Containers**
   - Created implicitly when accessing a root container for the first time
     (e.g., calling `doc.getText("text")`). No operation is generated in the
     history.
   - Uniquely identified by a string name and container type

2. **Normal Containers**
   - Created explicitly through operations like `insertContainer` or
     `createNode`
   - Generated automatically when applying operations that create child
     containers
   - Contains the Operation ID of its creation within its Container ID

## Container States and IDs

The ContainerID is not a random UUID but is deterministically generated based on the container's context. To understand how ContainerIDs work, it's important to first understand container states.

> For a comprehensive guide on containers, including attached vs detached states, see [Container Concepts](/docs/concepts/container).

Key points about ContainerID generation:
- **Root containers**: Derive their ID from their name (e.g., "text" in `doc.getText("text")`)
- **Normal containers**: Derive their ID from the operation (OpID) that created them
- **Detached containers**: Have a default placeholder ID until they're inserted into a document

## Container Overwrites

When initializing child containers in parallel, overwrites can occur instead of
automatic merging. For example:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const a: string = "hello";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("map");

// Parallel initialization of child containers
const docB = doc.fork();
const textA = doc.getMap("map").setContainer("text", new LoroText());
textA.insert(0, "A");
const textB = docB.getMap("map").setContainer("text", new LoroText());
textB.insert(0, "B");

doc.import(docB.export({ mode: "update" }));
// Result: Either { "meta": { "text": "A" } } or { "meta": { "text": "B" } }
```

This behavior poses a significant risk of data loss if the editing history is
not preserved. Even when the complete history is available and allows for data
recovery, the recovery process can be complex.

<aside>
By default, Loro and Automerge preserve the whole editing history in a directed
acyclic graph like Git.
</aside>

When a container holds substantial data or serves as the primary storage for
document content, overwriting it can lead to the unintended hiding/loss of
critical information. For this reason, it is essential to implement careful and
systematic container initialization practices to prevent such issues.

### Best Practices

1. When containers might be initialized concurrently, prefer initializing them
   at the root level rather than as nested containers

2. When using map containers:
   - If possible, initialize all child containers during the map container's
     initialization
   - Avoid concurrent creation of child containers with the same key in the map
     container to prevent overwrites

The overwrite behavior occurs because parallel creation of child containers
results in different container IDs, preventing automatic merging of their
contents.

# Batch Import

## Performance Differences and Their Causes

When importing multiple updates into a document, using `doc.importBatch(updates)` is significantly faster than importing updates individually. This performance difference stems from how data merging is handled in each approach.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").update("Hello");
const update1 = doc.export({ mode: "update" });
const version = doc.version();
doc.getText("text").update("Hello World");
const update2 = doc.export({ mode: "update", from: version });

const newDoc1 = new LoroDoc();
newDoc1.importBatch([update1, update2]); // faster

const newDoc2 = new LoroDoc();
for (const update of [update1, update2]) { // slower
  newDoc2.import(update);
}
```

### Key Advantages of Import Batch

#### 1. Single Diff Calculation

The most significant advantage is that import batch performs only one diff calculation. In contrast, each individual import follows these steps:

- Merge remote updates into local history
- Calculate document state changes from the current version to the merged version
- Apply the diff to the current document state

This diff calculation has fixed overhead costs that accumulate with each import. But `doc.importBatch(...)` only performs one diff calculation, which is faster than multiple individual diff calculations.

#### 2. Reduced Communication Overhead

Import batch also results in more concise events. Each individual import generates a new event, but `doc.importBatch(...)` generates only a single event that contains all the changes.


# FILE: pages/docs/advanced/timestamp.mdx

# Storing Timestamps

You can enable timestamp recording through `setRecordTimestamp`, allowing Unix timestamps to be logged in each `Change`. Consequently, these timestamps will be preserved in exported `Updates` or `Snapshots`.

Enabling this feature affects the merge behavior of `Changes`, as `Changes` with too long a time gap cannot share the same timestamp. In such cases, you can adjust the mergeable duration range using `setChangeMergeInterval`, with a default setting of 1,000,000, equating to a 1000s threshold for merging `Changes`.

> Each insertion or deletion by the user generates an `op`, and multiple consecutive `op`s can merge into a larger `Change`. `Change`s log a `Timestamp`, but each `Change` can only associate with one `Timestamp`. Hence, if the time gap is too wide, merging `Changes` becomes impractical. However, treating each Change as new based on slight timestamp differences (e.g., key presses milliseconds apart) introduces significant additional overhead for each Change. Therefore, users can customize the `change merge interval` according to their needs.

Note that these settings do not persist in exported `Updates` or `Snapshots`. Thus, if custom configurations are required, they must be reapplied upon each initialization of `LoroDoc`. Without timestamp recording enabled, the `Timestamp` defaults to the current maximum known `Timestamp`.

# Undo

We provide an `UndoManager` that helps you manage the undo/redo stack and can be
used during concurrent editing. It also supports cursor position transformation.
In the case of concurrent editing, you will want the undo/redo to be **local**,
meaning it should only undo/redo local operations without affecting other
collaborators' edits.

### Why Local Undo/Redo?

If undo/redo is global, it often does not meet expectations. Consider the
following scenario:

- **User A and User B are collaborating**: They are likely editing different
  parts of the document.
- **User A performs an undo**: If this undoes User B's operations, User A might
  see no changes and think the undo failed, as User B might be editing content
  outside of User A's view.
- **User B's perspective**: User B would find their recent edits deleted without
  knowing how it happened.

## Usage

To create an `UndoManager`, you can specify:

- Which local operations are not recorded.
- The merge range for undo operations.
- The stack depth.

```ts twoslash
import { UndoManager, LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {
    maxUndoSteps: 100, // default 100
    mergeInterval: 1000, // default 1000ms
    excludeOriginPrefixes: ["sys:"], // default []
    onPush: (isUndo, range, event) => {
        return { value: null, cursors: [] };
    },
    onPop: (isUndo, value, counterRange) => {
        return;
    },
});
```

## Limitations

It can only track a single peer. When the peer ID of the document changes, it will
clear the undo stack and the redo stack and track the new peer ID.

## Restoring Selections

When utilizing undo/redo functionalities, it is important for our application to
restore the selection to its position prior to the operation that is being
undone or redone. This task is particularly challenging in a collaborative
setting where remote operations can alter the cursor's position (for instance,
if the cursor needs to revert to the 5th position, but remote operations have
added new characters before this position).

<details>
<summary>Challenges</summary>

- **Local undo/redo**: Local undo and redo delete and recreate elements. If we
  use CRDT-based stable positions, they might lock on to the deleted elements,
  while the user's expectation is for the cursor to return to the newly created
  elements after redo.
- **Example**:
  ```
  A fox jumped
  ```
  - Select "fox" and delete it.
  - Undo.
  - After undo, the three characters "fox" should be recreated, and the cursor
    should select these three characters. However, if we use stable positions,
    it would lock onto the initially deleted characters, and after undo, the
    absolute positions obtained would be `start = 2` and `end = 2`.

</details>

### Solution

We support storing [`cursors`](/docs/tutorial/cursor) for each undo/redo action
within the `UndoManager`. The `UndoManager` will adjust the stored cursors to
reflect changes from remote edits or other undo/redo operations, ensuring they
match the current state of the document.

They need be handled by the `onPush` and `onPop` callbacks.

On `onPush`, you can return a list of `Cursor`s that you want to store. On
`onPop`, you can retrieve the stored cursors and use them to restore the
selection.

Typically, you may need to store selections in an undo/redo item in the
following cases:

- When a new local change is applied, we need to record a new undo item.
  Therefore, we must store the selection **before** the operation to be undone.
  - **Purpose**: Storing the selection **before** is crucial because we may lose
    the selection after applying the operation. If the user selects text and
    deletes it, after undo, the `onPop` can retrieve the state of the selected
    deleted content.
- **First undo operation**: Store the current document's selection for the
  corresponding redo item.
  - **Purpose**: After redo, it can return to the initial selection state.

Internally, we also automatically handle the storage and reset of cursors in the
undo/redo loop state.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager, Cursor } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
let cursors: Cursor[] = [];
let poppedCursors: Cursor[] = [];
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {
  mergeInterval: 0,
  onPop: (isUndo, value, counterRange) => {
    poppedCursors = value.cursors;
  },
  onPush: () => {
    return { value: null, cursors: cursors };
  },
});

doc.getText("text").insert(0, "hello world");
doc.commit();
cursors = [
  doc.getText("text").getCursor(0)!,
  doc.getText("text").getCursor(5)!,
];
// delete "hello ", the cursors should be transformed
doc.getText("text").delete(0, 6);
doc.commit();
expect(poppedCursors.length).toBe(0);
undo.undo();
expect(poppedCursors.length).toBe(2);
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  text: "hello world",
});
// expect the cursors to be transformed back
expect(doc.getCursorPos(poppedCursors[0]).offset).toBe(0);
expect(doc.getCursorPos(poppedCursors[1]).offset).toBe(5);
```

<details>
<summary>Implementation</summary>

[The implementation of undo/redo](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/pull/361)
follows a model similar to ProseMirror/Quill, which are based on OT (Operational
Transformation) algorithms (so we also implement basic OT primitives
internally).

When implementing undo/redo operations, we need to ensure the following
properties:

- Do not undo remote inserts.
- Redo after undo should return to the original state.
- If there is no concurrent editing, undo should return to the previous
  version's state.

Therefore, we have also added some relevant checks in our internal fuzzing tests
to ensure correctness.

## Understanding the Undo/Redo Stack

The UndoManager maintains two stacks:

1. **Undo Stack**: Contains operations that can be undone
2. **Redo Stack**: Contains operations that were undone and can be redone

### How the Callbacks Work

The `onPush` and `onPop` callbacks are triggered when these stacks change:

- **onPush(isUndo, range, event)**: Called when a new item is pushed to either stack
  - `isUndo: boolean`: `true` for the undo stack, `false` for the redo stack
  - `range: (number, number)`: The operations' counter range that associated with the undo/redo action
  - Returns: An object that can include `value` (any data you want to store) and `cursors` (cursor positions)

- **onPop(isUndo, value)**: Called when an item is popped from either stack
  - `isUndo`: `true` for the undo stack, `false` for the redo stack
  - `value`: The value you returned from `onPush` when this item was created

### Understanding Action Merging

The `mergeInterval` option in the UndoManager controls how closely spaced operations are grouped:

```ts twoslash no_run
import { UndoManager, LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
declare const doc: LoroDoc;
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {
  mergeInterval: 1000, // 1000ms = 1 second (default)
});
```

**How mergeInterval works:**

- Operations occurring within the specified time interval (in milliseconds) will be merged into a single undo action
- Even though these operations are merged, `onPush` events will still be triggered for each individual operation
- When undoing, all merged operations will be undone as a single unit
- A lower value results in more granular undo steps; a higher value creates fewer, more comprehensive undo steps
- Set to `0` to disable merging entirely (every operation becomes a separate undo step)

### Stack Operations Flow

1. When a local transaction is committed, a new undo item is pushed to the undo stack (triggers `onPush` with `isUndo=true`)
2. When `.undo()` is called:
   - An item is popped from the undo stack (triggers `onPop` with `isUndo=true`)
   - A corresponding item is pushed to the redo stack (triggers `onPush` with `isUndo=false`)
3. When `.redo()` is called:
   - An item is popped from the redo stack (triggers `onPop` with `isUndo=false`)
   - A corresponding item is pushed to the undo stack (triggers `onPush` with `isUndo=true`)

### Manual Grouping with `groupStart` and `groupEnd`

Sometimes you need tighter control over how undo units are formed than `mergeInterval` alone can provide. The `UndoManager.groupStart()` and `UndoManager.groupEnd()` methods let you explicitly wrap a sequence of commits so they become a single undo step.

- Call `groupStart()` before you begin a batch of related edits. Any commits that happen before the matching `groupEnd()` will undo together.
- Calling `groupStart()` while another group is active throws an error and leaves the original group in place, which helps catch accidental nesting.
- Remote updates can influence grouping: a conflicting import may force the current group to end early, while non-conflicting imports are merged without breaking the group. Always finish with `groupEnd()`âif the group already auto-closed, the call becomes a no-op.

```ts twoslash no_run
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {});

undoManager.groupStart();

text.update("hello", undefined);
doc.commit();
text.update("hello world", undefined);
doc.commit();

undoManager.groupEnd();

undoManager.undo(); // Reverts both commits in one step
```

### Example: Text Editing with Undo/Redo

Consider a simple text editor that uses Loro for collaboration. Let's walk through what happens during typical editing operations:

```ts twoslash no_run
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
// Create document and undo manager
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const textField = doc.getText("textField");

// Set up undo manager with callbacks to track changes
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {
  // Store cursor positions and any other state you need
  onPush: (isUndo, range) => {
    if (isUndo) {
      console.log("Action recorded for undo");
    } else {
      console.log("Action recorded for redo");
    }
    // Return whatever data you want associated with this action
    return {
      value: { affectedRange: range },
      cursors: [/* your cursor positions */]
    };
  },

  onPop: (isUndo, storedData) => {
    // Access the data you stored during onPush
    const { value, cursors } = storedData;

    if (isUndo) {
      console.log("Retrieving data for undo");
    } else {
      console.log("Retrieving data for redo");
    }

    // Use the stored cursors to restore selection
    // applyStoredCursors(cursors);
  },

  mergeInterval: 0,
});

// User types "Hello"
textField.insert(0, "Hello");
doc.commit();
// â onPush triggered (isUndo=true) - Adds to undo stack

// User types " World"
textField.insert(5, " World");
doc.commit();
// â onPush triggered (isUndo=true) - Adds to undo stack

// User clicks Undo button
undoManager.undo();
// â onPop triggered (isUndo=true) - Removes " World" from document
// â onPush triggered (isUndo=false) - Adds to redo stack

// Document now contains only "Hello"

// User clicks Redo button
undoManager.redo();
// â onPop triggered (isUndo=false) - Retrieves " World" operation
// â onPush triggered (isUndo=true) - Adds back to undo stack

// Document now contains "Hello World" again
```

When the user clicks Undo, two things happen:
1. The last action is popped from the undo stack (removing " World")
2. That action is pushed to the redo stack so it can be redone later

This approach ensures that local changes can be undone without affecting other users' edits, making it ideal for collaborative editing.

### Cursor Efficiency

The built-in cursor solution is optimized for performance and handles collaborative scenarios efficiently, including situations where peers may
change the document concurrently during undo/redo operations. For complex editors like rich text editors, the cursor implementation provides the
best balance of performance and correctness.

# Loro's Versioning Deep Dive: DAG, Frontiers, and Version Vectors

In centralized environments, we can use linear version numbers to represent a
version, such as incrementing a number each time or using timestamps. However,
CRDTs can be used in decentralized environments, and their version
representation is different.

In Loro, you can express a document's version through a
[Version Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector) or Frontiers.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
doc.version();        // State Version vector
doc.oplogVersion();   // OpLog Version vector
doc.frontiers();      // State Frontiers
doc.oplogFrontiers(); // OpLog Frontiers
```

In most cases, you might only need the Version Vector, which can be used for
data synchronization and version comparison.

Frontiers are more space-efficient than Version Vectors but come with more
limitations.

The following sections detail these two different ways of version description.

## Background Knowledge

Loro belongs to Operation-Based CRDTs. Two Loro documents are consistent if they
have the same set of activated Operations. Version is a compact way to describe
which ops belong to this set.

Each operation has a unique ID, known as OpId. For example, each user's deletion
or insertion of characters will have a corresponding unique OpId (don't worry
about the overhead here; we've compressed them in memory and Encoding). OpId
consists of PeerId and Counter.

> ð¡ Note: To simplify, the specific type descriptions below may not be accurate
> (e.g., the type of peer), but this does not affect the understanding of the
> content.

```ts
interface OpId {
  // Simplified here
  // PeerId is actually close to uuid type, Loro uses u64
  peerId: number;
  counter: number;
}
```

PeerId represents the unique identifier of the device operating the document,
and Counter is a number that starts from 0 and increments on that device.

## Version Vector

A Version Vector is a vector that describes how many Operations starting from 0
need to be included for each Peer.

```ts
// In TypeScript
type VersionVector = { [peerId in number]: number };
```

For example, for the following version vector A,

```tsx
const A = {
  0: 2,
  1: 3,
};
```

It includes:

- All operations where PeerId == 0 && Counter < 2
- Or PeerId == 1 && Counter < 3

This expression allows us to easily compare two versions and get the operations
they are missing from each other. For example, in the following case, suppose we
know that the document on the server has reached version B, and the device has
version A. To let the user's device get the Operations it is missing,

```tsx
const A = {
  0: 2,
  1: 3,
};

const B = {
  0: 5,
  1: 3,
  2: 9,
};
```

We can easily calculate the Operations the device is missing:

- All Ops where PeerId == 0 && 2 â¤ Counter < 5
- Or PeerId == 2 && Counter < 9

Version Vectors help us identify a version and allow us to quickly calculate the
differences between two versions (quickly calculating the set of Ops missing in
two documents to be synchronized). For example, currently in Loro, you can use
the following method to synchronize two documents, where they only import the
Ops missing from each other:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const a = new LoroDoc();
const b = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
// doc.version() returns the version vector of the doc
a.import(b.export({ mode: "update", from: a.version() }));
b.import(a.export({ mode: "update", from: b.version() }));
```

## Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) History

In Loro, we record an operation history similar to Git's Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG). We represent DAG by recording Dependencies links on each Op. Like
document states, when the Op set is the same, the DAG is consistent across all
endpoints.

![DAG Illustration](./images/version-3.png)

When a new Op is added, its Dependencies link points to the current Operations
that are not being pointed to.

> ð¡ Note: The order of Ops is a partial order relationship. An Op may be
> before, after, or parallel to another Op. The structure of the DAG allows us
> to compactly express this partial order.

DAG history information helps us design some special CRDT algorithms and
facilitates time-travel implementation. Moreover, when automatic merges don't
meet expectations, DAG allows users a better chance to manually resolve
potential conflicts.

> ð¡ We use Counter@PeerId for a more compact description of OpId.

Below is an example of how a DAG is formed:

![DAG Formation Example](./images/version-0.png)

## Frontiers

Version Vectors increase in size with the number of Peers. Most CRDTs Lib, to
prevent PeerId conflicts, use a random new PeerId each time a document is
opened, which increases the overhead of Version Vectors.

> ð If PeerId repeats, there's a high probability of duplicate OpId,
> potentially leading to inconsistent CRDT documents. Automerge has solved this
> problem, ensuring document consistency even with duplicate OpId, but at the
> cost of higher sync complexity.

Based on DAG information, we have a more compact way to describe versions: given
one or multiple OpIds, include all with a Causal Order less than or equal to
them. We call this method Frontiers.

```ts twoslash
import { OpId } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
type Frontiers = OpId[];
```

> ð¡ We use Counter@PeerId for a more compact description of OpId.

![Frontiers Illustration](./images/version-1.png)

`Frontiers = [3@0]` in the above DAG includes 6 operations:

- PeerId == 0 && Counter < 4
- PeerId == 1 && Counter < 2

It is equivalent to the Version Vector:

```tsx
{
    0: 4,
    1: 2,
}
```

Frontiers can also specify multiple parallel operations:

![Parallel Operations Example](./images/version-2.png)

In this example, `Frontiers = [1@1, 1@2]`, corresponding Version Vector is:

```tsx
{
    0: 1,
    1: 2,
    2: 2,
}
```

One great property of Frontiers as a version is that `Frontiers = [A]` actually
represents the document version right after operation A was executed. Thus,
combined with Loro's time machine capability, you can easily return to any
document version corresponding to a specific operation. Here is a complete
example:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId(0n);
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "H");
doc.commit();
const v = doc.frontiers();
text.insert(1, "i");
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  text: "Hi",
});

doc.checkout([{ peer: "0", counter: 0 }]);
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  text: "H",
});
```

You can convert between Version Vectors and Frontiers in Loro if the specified
version is included in the document's history:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
const f = doc.frontiers();
const vv = doc.frontiersToVV(f);
// vv equals to doc.version()
const frontiers = doc.vvToFrontiers(vv);
```

# List and Movable List

Loro supports two types of lists: `List` and `MovableList`. The `List` is a
standard list that supports Insert and Delete operations. In contrast, the
`MovableList` supports additional Set and Move operations.

Using a combination of insert and delete operations, one can simulate set and
move operations on a `List`. However, this approach fails in concurrent editing
scenarios. For example, if the same element is set or moved concurrently, the
simulation would result in the deletion of the original element and the
insertion of two new elements, which does not meet expectations.

The `MovableList` addresses these issues by ensuring that set and move
operations do not lead to such problems, though it incurs additional overheads.
Specifically, when performing only insertions/deletions, the `MovableList` is
approximately 80% slower in encode/decode and consumes about 50% more memory
compared to the `List`.

Both `List` and `MovableList` utilize the
[_Fugue_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) to achieve _maximal
non-interleaving_. Additionally, `MovableList` uses the algorithm from
[_Moving Elements in List CRDTs_](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/04/27/papoc-list-move.html)
to implement the move operation.

## Basic Usage

### List

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, Loro } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const docA = new LoroDoc();
docA.setPeerId("1");
const listA = docA.getList("list");
listA.push(0);
listA.push(1);
listA.push(2);
const bytes: Uint8Array = docA.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

const docB = Loro.fromSnapshot(bytes);
docB.setPeerId("2");
const listB = docB.getList("list");
{
  // Concurrently docA and docB update element at index 2
  // docA updates it to 8
  // docB updates it to 9
  // docA.toJSON() should return { list: [0, 1, 8] }
  // docB.toJSON() should return { list: [0, 1, 9] }
  listB.delete(2, 1);
  listB.insert(2, 9);
  expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 9] });
  listA.delete(2, 1);
  listA.insert(2, 8);
  expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 8] });
}

{
  // Merge docA and docB
  docA.import(docB.export({ mode: "update", from: docA.version() }));
  docB.import(docA.export({ mode: "update", from: docB.version() }));
}

expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 8, 9] });
expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 8, 9] });
```

### MovableList

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, Loro } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const docA = new LoroDoc();
docA.setPeerId("1");
const listA = docA.getMovableList("list");
listA.push(0);
listA.push(1);
listA.push(2);
const bytes: Uint8Array = docA.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

const docB = Loro.fromSnapshot(bytes);
docB.setPeerId("2");
const listB = docB.getMovableList("list");
{
  // Concurrently docA and docB update element at index 2
  // docA updates it to 8
  // docB updates it to 9
  // docA.toJSON() should return { list: [0, 1, 8] }
  // docB.toJSON() should return { list: [0, 1, 9] }
  listA.set(2, 8);
  expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 8] });
  listB.set(2, 9);
  expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 9] });
}

{
  // Merge docA and docB
  docA.import(docB.export({ mode: "update", from: docA.version() }));
  docB.import(docA.export({ mode: "update", from: docB.version() }));
}

// Converge to [0, 1, 9] because docB has larger peerId thus larger logical time
expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 9] });
expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [0, 1, 9] });

{
  // Concurrently docA and docB move element at index 0
  // docA moves it to 2
  // docB moves it to 1
  // docA.toJSON() should return { list: [1, 9, 0] }
  // docB.toJSON() should return { list: [1, 0, 9] }
  listA.move(0, 2);
  listB.move(0, 1);
  expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [1, 9, 0] });
  expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [1, 0, 9] });
}

{
  // Merge docA and docB
  docA.import(docB.export({ mode: "update", from: docA.version() }));
  docB.import(docA.export({ mode: "update", from: docB.version() }));
}

// Converge to [1, 0, 9] because docB has larger peerId thus larger logical time
expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [1, 0, 9] });
expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ list: [1, 0, 9] });
```

## Using Cursor on List

The Cursor on a List changes with the list's modifications. If new elements are
inserted in front of it, it moves to the right. If elements in front are
deleted, it moves to the left. If elements are inserted or deleted behind it, it
remains stationary.

If you use a List to represent paragraphs in an article, you can use a Cursor to
stably represent the selection range on the paragraph.

```ts twoslash
import {
  Cursor,
  LoroDoc,
  LoroList,
  LoroMovableList,
  LoroText,
} from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");
const list = doc.getList("list");
list.push("Hello");
list.push("World");
const cursor = list.getCursor(1)!;
console.log(cursor.pos()); // OUTPUT: { peer: "1", counter: 1 }

const encodedCursor: Uint8Array = cursor.encode();
const exported: Uint8Array = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

// Sending the exported snapshot and the encoded cursor to peer 2
// Peer 2 will decode the cursor and get the position of the cursor in the list
// Peer 2 will then insert "Hello" at the beginning of the list

const docB = new LoroDoc();
docB.setPeerId("2");
const listB = docB.getList("list");
docB.import(exported);
listB.insert(0, "Foo");
console.log(docB.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { list: ["Foo", "Hello", "World"] }
const cursorB = Cursor.decode(encodedCursor);
{
  // The cursor position is shifted to the right by 1
  const pos = docB.getCursorPos(cursorB);
  console.log(pos.offset); // OUTPUT: 2
}
listB.insert(1, "Bar");
console.log(docB.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { list: ["Foo", "Bar", "Hello", "World"] }
{
  // The cursor position is shifted to the right by 1
  const pos = docB.getCursorPos(cursorB);
  console.log(pos.offset); // OUTPUT: 3
}
listB.delete(3, 1);
console.log(docB.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { list: ["Foo", "Bar", "Hello"] }
{
  // The position the cursor points to is now deleted,
  // but it should still get the position
  const pos = docB.getCursorPos(cursorB);
  console.log(pos.offset); // OUTPUT: 3

  // It will also offer an update on the cursor position.
  //
  // Because the old cursor position is deleted, `doc.getCursorPos()` will slow down over time.
  // Internally, it needs to traverse the related history to find the correct position for a deleted
  // cursor position.
  //
  // After refreshing the cursor, the performance of `doc.getCursorPos()` will improve.
  console.log(pos.update); // OUTPUT: { peer: "2", counter: 1 }
  const newCursor: Cursor = pos.update!;

  // The new cursor position is undefined because the cursor is at the end of the list
  console.log(newCursor.pos()); // OUTPUT: undefined
  // The side is 1 because the cursor is at the right end of the list
  console.log(newCursor.side()); // OUTPUT: 1

  const newPos = docB.getCursorPos(newCursor);
  // The offset doesn't change
  console.log(newPos.offset); // OUTPUT: 3
  // The update is undefined because the cursor no longer needs to be updated
  console.log(newPos.update); // OUTPUT: undefined
}
```

# Export Mode

> Loro 1.0 has stabilized the data format and will not have any breaking
> changes.

Loro introduces three encoding modes to meet the needs for different use cases:

- **Updates Encoding**: Encodes all or a specified range of operations, mainly
  used for delta updates of documents.
- **Snapshot Encoding**: Encodes the entire document, including both all the
  operations and the current document state.
- **Shallow Snapshot Encoding**: Loro 1.0 provides a new encoding format for
  discarding useless historical operations. It is a special snapshot that
  encodes the most recent historical operations, the starting state of the
  remaining history, and the latest state of the document.

Different encoding formats are provided through the unified `doc.export(mode)`,
and all binary encoding formats can be imported via `doc.import(bytes)`.

```ts no_run
export type ExportMode =
  | {
      mode: "update";
      from?: VersionVector;
    }
  | {
      mode: "updates-in-range";
      spans: {
        id: ID;
        len: number;
      }[];
    }
  | {
      mode: "snapshot";
    }
  | {
      mode: "shallow-snapshot";
      frontiers: Frontiers;
    };
```

## Updates Encoding

There are two modes for updates encoding. `update` å `updates-in-range`.

- `update` mode will encode all ops from the from version to the latest version
  of the document.
- `updates-in-range` mode will encode all ops within the specified version
  range.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.setPeerId(2);

doc2.getText("text").insert(0, "hello");
const bytes = doc2.export({ mode: "update", from: doc1.version() }); // Uint8Array
// const bytes = doc2.export({ mode: "updates-in-range", spans: [{id: { peer: 2, counter: 0 }, len: 1}] });
// These bytes can be stored in a database or transmitted over a network.
doc1.import(bytes);
console.log(doc1.toJSON()); // { text: "hello" }
```

Updates Encoding selectively encodes operations from a chosen initial version to
the most recent, enhancing support for real-time collaboration by focusing on
incremental changes rather than the entire document state.

## Snapshot Encoding

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();

doc2.getText("text").insert(0, "hello");
const bytes = doc2.export({ mode: "snapshot" }); // Uint8Array
// These bytes can be stored in a database or transmitted over a network.
doc1.import(bytes);
console.log(doc1.toJSON()); // { text: "hello" }
```

Snapshot Encoding comprehensively captures a document's current state and its
historical operations. This mode can quickly obtain the latest document state.

## Shallow Snapshot Encoding

Loro will save all editing history to resolve conflicts and history
backtracking. However, for most scenes, most of the older history is useless,
taking up too much extra memory and requires more storage space for saving.

Loro 1.0 provides a shallow snapshot encoding mode. You can specify the starting
historical version to be retained, and Loro will truncate all the history before
this version.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.setPeerId(2);

const text = doc2.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "hello");
const frontiers = doc2.frontiers();
text.insert(0, "w");
text.insert(0, "o");
text.insert(0, "r");
text.insert(0, "l");
text.insert(0, "d");
const bytes = doc2.export({ mode: "shallow-snapshot", frontiers }); // Uint8Array
// These bytes can be stored in a database or transmitted over a network.
doc1.import(bytes);
console.log(doc1.toJSON()); // { text: "hello" }
```

Note: When using shallow snapshots, you cannot import updates that are
concurrent to the snapshot's start version. For details, see
[shallow snapshot](/docs/advanced/shallow_snapshot).

## Loro's Snapshot File Format

To support lazy loading capabilities, we referenced common storage formats in
databases, introduced a simple LSM engine, and abstracted the encoding results
as simple key bytes and value bytes representations, preparing for future
integration with common key-value databases.

### Encoding Details

In Loro, multiple consecutive Ops of the same Container are merged into one
Change, i.e., one commit record. Each Change has additional metadata, such as
ID, Lamport, Timestamp, etc. In most scenarios, Changes are also consecutive,
and related metadata can be compressed to some extent. Therefore, we combine
multiple consecutive Changes into a ChangeBlock, which is the minimum unit for
encoding Op history. Detailed encoding content can be found in the
[documentation](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/blob/main/crates/loro-internal/src/oplog/change_store/block_encode.rs).

We use the first Change ID of the ChangeBlock as the query key, and the encoded
ChangeBlock as the value. This allows for quick querying of specified ID Changes
and their Ops without decoding all Changes.

The complete State is composed of the states of all Containers starting from the
Root Container. The key is the bytes representation of the ContainerID, and the
value is composed of each Container's metadata and the bytes encoded according
to its own semantic state expression.

These key-value pairs will be stored in our implemented simple LSM structure.

The final exported encoding will be divided into four parts: encoding header,
oplog bytes, latest state bytes, and shallow state bytes.

The Header consists of a 4-byte magic number, 16-byte checksum, and 2-byte
encode mode.

The oplog bytes, latest state bytes, and shallow state bytes are all exported
using the
[LSM encoding structure](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/blob/main/crates/kv-store/src/lib.rs).

# Counter

Loro's Counter will add up all the applied values, and supports integers and floating point numbers.

Here is how to use it:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const counter = doc.getCounter("counter");
counter.increment(1);
counter.increment(2);
counter.decrement(1);
expect(counter.value).toBe(2);
```

# Map

Loro's Map uses LWW (Last-Write-Wins) semantics. When concurrent edits conflict, it compares Lamport logic timestamps to determine the winner.

Here is how to use it:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const docA = new LoroDoc();
docA.setPeerId("0");
const docB = new LoroDoc();
docB.setPeerId("1");

const mapA = docA.getMap("map");
const mapB = docB.getMap("map");

mapA.set("a", 1);
const textB = mapB.setContainer("a", new LoroText());
textB.insert(0, "Hi");

console.log(docA.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { map: { a: 1 } }
console.log(docB.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { map: { a: "Hi" } }

docA.import(docB.export({ mode: "snapshot" }));
docB.import(docA.export({ mode: "snapshot" }));

// docB wins because it has the larger peerId, thus the larger logical timestamp
console.log(docA.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { map: { a: "Hi" } }
console.log(docB.toJSON()); // OUTPUT: { map: { a: "Hi" } }
```

> **Note**: When calling `map.set(key, value)` on a LoroMap, if `map.get(key)` already returns `value`, the operation will be a no-op (no operation recorded).

# Getting Started with LoroDoc

LoroDoc is the main entry point for almost all Loro functionality. It serves as a container manager and coordinator that provides:

1. **Container Management**: Create and manage different types of CRDT containers (Text, List, Map, Tree, MovableList)
2. **Version Control**: Track document history, checkout versions, and manage branches
3. **Event System**: Subscribe to changes at both document and container levels
4. **Import/Export**: Save and load documents/updates in various formats

## Basic Usage

First, let's create a new LoroDoc instance:

```ts twoslash
import {
  LoroDoc,
  LoroText,
  LoroList,
  LoroMap,
  LoroTree,
  LoroMovableList,
} from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
// Create a new document with a random peer ID
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// Or set a specific peer ID
doc.setPeerId("1");

// Create containers
const text = doc.getText("text");
const list = doc.getList("list");
const map = doc.getMap("map");
const tree = doc.getTree("tree");
const movableList = doc.getMovableList("tasks");
```

To model a document with the following format:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "Document Title",
    "createdBy": "Author"
  },
  "content": "Article",
  "comments": [
    {
      "user": "userId",
      "comment": "comment"
    }
  ]
}
```

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroMap } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const meta = doc.getMap("meta");
meta.set("title", "Document Title");
meta.set("createdBy", "Author");
doc.getText("content").insert(0, "Article");
const comments = doc.getList("comments");
const comment1 = comments.insertContainer(0, new LoroMap());
comment1.set("user", "userId");
comment1.set("comment", "comment");
```

## Supported Data Types (LoroValue)

Loro supports storing various data types in its containers. The `LoroValue` type represents all possible values that can be stored in a LoroDoc:

```ts
type LoroValue =
  | null             // Null values
  | boolean          // true or false
  | number           // Numeric values (both integer and floating point)
  | string           // Text values
  | Uint8Array       // Binary data
  | LoroValue[]      // Arrays (nested)
  | { [key: string]: LoroValue }  // Objects/Maps (nested)
```

### Examples of Storing Different Data Types

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("data");

// Primitive types
map.set("name", "Alice");                    // string
map.set("age", 30);                          // integer number
map.set("score", 95.5);                      // floating point number
map.set("isActive", true);                   // boolean
map.set("metadata", null);                   // null

// Binary data
const binaryData = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
map.set("bytes", binaryData);                // Uint8Array

// Nested objects (plain JavaScript objects)
map.set("profile", {
  email: "alice@example.com",
  settings: {
    theme: "dark",
    notifications: true
  }
});

// Arrays
map.set("tags", ["javascript", "typescript", "loro"]);

// Mixed nested structures
map.set("complex", {
  items: [1, 2, { nested: true }],
  binary: new Uint8Array([255, 128]),
  active: false
});
```

Note: When you need to store a CRDT container (like LoroText, LoroList, etc.) within another container, use `setContainer()` or `insertContainer()` methods instead of regular `set()` or `insert()`. This creates a proper sub-container relationship that maintains CRDT properties.

## Container Types

LoroDoc supports several container types:

1. **Text** - For rich text editing
2. **List** - For ordered collections
3. **Map** - For key-value pairs
4. **Tree** - For hierarchical data structures
5. **MovableList** - For lists with movable items

Let's look at how to use each type:

### Text Container

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello");
text.insert(5, " World!");
console.log(text.toString()); // "Hello World!"

// Rich text support
doc.configTextStyle({
  bold: { expand: "after" },
  link: { expand: "none" },
});
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 5 }, "bold", true);
```

### List Container

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const list = doc.getList("list");
list.insert(0, "first");
list.insert(1, "second");
console.log(list.toArray()); // ["first", "second"]

// Nested containers
const nestedText = list.insertContainer(2, new LoroText());
nestedText.insert(0, "nested text");
```

### Map Container

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("map");
map.set("name", "John");
map.set("age", 30);
console.log(map.get("name")); // "John"

// Nested containers
const userText = map.setContainer("bio", new LoroText());
userText.insert(0, "Software Engineer");
```

### Tree Container

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const tree = doc.getTree("tree");
const root = tree.createNode();
root.data.set("name", "Root");

const child1 = root.createNode();
child1.data.set("name", "Child 1");

const child2 = root.createNode();
child2.data.set("name", "Child 2");
```

### MovableList Container

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const movableList = doc.getMovableList("tasks");
movableList.insert(0, "Task 1");
movableList.insert(1, "Task 2");
movableList.move(0, 1); // Move Task 1 after Task 2
```

## Collaboration Features

LoroDoc can be used for real-time collaboration. Here's how to sync changes between peers:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
declare const otherDoc: LoroDoc;
// ---cut---
// First peer
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
doc1.setPeerId("1");
const text1 = doc1.getText("text");

// Second peer
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.setPeerId("2");
const text2 = doc2.getText("text");

// Set up two-way sync
doc1.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  doc2.import(updates);
});

doc2.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  doc1.import(updates);
});

// Now changes in doc1 will be reflected in doc2 and vice versa
text1.insert(0, "Hello");
doc1.commit();
await Promise.resolve(); // await for the event to be emitted
text2.insert(5, " World!");
doc2.commit();
```

## Undo/Redo Support

Loro provides built-in undo/redo functionality:

```ts twoslash
import { UndoManager, LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {
  maxUndoSteps: 100,
  mergeInterval: 1000,
});

const text = doc.getText("text");
// Make some changes
text.insert(0, "Hello");
doc.commit();

// Undo the changes
if (undoManager.canUndo()) {
  undoManager.undo();
}

// Redo the changes
if (undoManager.canRedo()) {
  undoManager.redo();
}
```

## Exporting and Importing

You can save and load the document state:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Export the document
const snapshot = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

// Create a new document from the snapshot
const newDoc = LoroDoc.fromSnapshot(snapshot);

const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
// Or import into an existing document
doc2.import(snapshot);
```

### Shallow Import/Export

Shallow import/export is a feature that allows you to create and share document snapshots without including the complete history. This is particularly useful for:

1. Reducing the size of exported data
2. Sharing the document with others without revealing the complete history
3. Speedup the import/export process

Here's how to use shallow export:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Export a shallow snapshot that only include the history since `doc.oplogFrontiers()`
// It works like `git clone --depth=1`, where the exported data only contain the most recent ops.
const shallowSnapshot = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.oplogFrontiers(),
});

// Check if a document is shallow
const isShallow = doc.isShallow();

// Get the version since which the history is available
const sinceVersion = doc.shallowSinceVV();
// Or get it in frontiers format
const sinceFrontiers = doc.shallowSinceFrontiers();
```

Note: A shallow document only contains history after a certain version point. Operations before the shallow start point are not included, but the document remains fully functional for collaboration.

### Redacting Sensitive Content

Loro allows you to redact specific segments of document history while preserving the rest. This is particularly useful when:

1. A user accidentally pastes sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) into the document
2. You need to remove just the sensitive part of the history while keeping older and newer edits intact
3. You want to share document history with sensitive segments sanitized

Here's how to use the redaction functionality:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, redactJsonUpdates } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");

// Create some content to be redacted
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Sensitive information");
doc.commit();

const map = doc.getMap("map");
map.set("password", "secret123");
map.set("public", "public information");
doc.commit();

// Export JSON updates
const jsonUpdates = doc.exportJsonUpdates();

// Define version range to redact (redact the text content)
const versionRange = {
  "1": [0, 21], // Redact the "Sensitive information"
};

// Apply redaction
const redactedJson = redactJsonUpdates(jsonUpdates, versionRange);

// Create a new document with redacted content
const redactedDoc = new LoroDoc();
redactedDoc.importJsonUpdates(redactedJson);

// The text content is now redacted with replacement characters
console.log(redactedDoc.getText("text").toString());
// Outputs: "ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"

// Map operations after the redacted range remain intact
console.log(redactedDoc.getMap("map").get("password")); // "secret123"
console.log(redactedDoc.getMap("map").get("public")); // "public information"
```

Redaction applies these rules to preserve document structure while removing sensitive content:

- Preserves delete and move operations
- Replaces text insertion content with Unicode replacement characters 'ï¿½'
- Substitutes list and map insert values with null
- Maintains structure of nested containers
- Replaces text mark values with null
- Preserves map keys and text annotation keys

Note that redaction doesn't remove the operations completely - it just replaces the sensitive content with placeholders. If you need to completely remove portions of history, see the section on shallow snapshots in the [Tips](./tips.md) section.

#### Important: Synchronization Considerations

Both redaction and shallow snapshots maintain future synchronization consistency, but your application is responsible for ensuring all peers get the sanitized version. Otherwise, old instances of the document with sensitive information will still exist on other peers.

## Event Subscription

Subscribe to changes in the document:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Document changed:", event);
});

const text = doc.getText("text");
// Container-specific subscription
text.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Text changed:", event);
});
```

### Event Emission

Events in LoroDoc are emitted only after a transaction is committed, and importantly, the events are emitted after a microtask. This means you need to await a microtask if you want to handle the events immediately after a commit.

1. Explicitly calling `doc.commit()`:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

// Subscribe to changes
doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Change event:", event);
});

text.insert(0, "Hello"); // No event emitted yet
doc.commit(); // Event will be emitted after a microtask

// If you need to wait for the event:
await Promise.resolve(); // Now the event has been emitted
```

2. Implicitly through certain operations:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
declare const someData: Uint8Array;
declare const someVersion: any;
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

// These operations trigger implicit commits:
doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" }); // Implicit commit
doc.import(someData); // Implicit commit
doc.checkout(someVersion); // Implicit commit
```

You can also specify additional information when committing:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.commit({
  origin: "user-edit", // Mark the event source
  message: "Add greeting", // Like a git commit message
  timestamp: Date.now(), // Custom timestamp
});
await Promise.resolve(); // Wait for event if needed
```

Note: Multiple operations before a `commit` are batched into a single event. This helps reduce event overhead and provides atomic changes. The event will still be emitted after a microtask, regardless of whether the commit was explicit or implicit.

## Version Control and History

LoroDoc provides powerful version control features that allow you to track and manage document history:

### Version Representation

Loro uses two ways to represent versions:

1. **Version Vector**: A map from peer ID to counter

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Get current version vector
const vv = doc.version();

// Get oplog version vector (latest known version)
const oplogVv = doc.oplogVersion();
```

2. **Frontiers**: A list of operation IDs that represent the latest operations from each peer. This is compacter than version vector. In most of the cases, it only has 1 element.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("0");
doc.getMap("map").set("text", "Hello");
// Get current frontiers
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();

// Get oplog frontiers (latest known version)
const oplogFrontiers = doc.oplogFrontiers(); // { "0": 0 }
```

### Checkout and Time Travel

You can navigate through document history using checkout:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Save current version
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
const text = doc.getText("text");

// Make some changes
text.insert(0, "Hello World!");

// Checkout to previous version
doc.checkout(frontiers);

// Return to latest version
doc.checkoutToLatest();
// or
doc.attach();
```

Note: After checkout, the document enters "detached" mode. In this mode:

- The document is not editable by default
- Import operations are recorded but not applied to the document state
- You need to call `attach()` or `checkoutToLatest()` to go back to the latest version and make it editable again

### Detached Mode

The document enters "detached" mode after a `checkout` operation or when explicitly calling `doc.detach()`. In detached mode, the document state is not synchronized with the latest version in the OpLog.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Check if document is in detached mode
console.log(doc.isDetached()); // false

// Explicitly detach the document
doc.detach();
console.log(doc.isDetached()); // true

// Return to attached mode
doc.attach();
console.log(doc.isDetached()); // false
```

By default, editing is disabled in detached mode. However, you can enable it:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Enable editing in detached mode
doc.setDetachedEditing(true);
console.log(doc.isDetachedEditingEnabled()); // true
```

#### Key Behaviors in Detached Mode

1. **Import Operations**
   - Operations imported via `doc.import()` are recorded in the OpLog
   - These operations are not applied to the document state until checkout

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const oldDoc = new LoroDoc();
oldDoc.getMap("map").set("name", "John");
const updates = oldDoc.export({ mode: "update" });
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// In detached mode
doc.import(updates); // Updates are stored but not applied
doc.checkoutToLatest(); // Now updates are applied
```

2. **Version Management**
   - Each checkout uses a different PeerID to prevent conflicts
   - The document maintains two version states:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Current state version
const stateVersion = doc.version();
// Latest known version in OpLog
const latestVersion = doc.oplogVersion();
```

3. **Forking**
   - You can create a new document at a specific version:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("0");
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
// Fork at current frontiers
const forkedDoc = doc.fork();
// Or fork at specific frontiers
const forkedAtVersion = doc.forkAt([{ peer: "0", counter: 1 }]);
console.log(forkedAtVersion.getText("text").toString()); // "He"
```

#### Common Use Cases

1. **Time Travel and History Review**

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
declare const text: any;
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Save current version
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();

// Make changes
text.insert(0, "New content");

// Review previous version
doc.checkout(frontiers);

// Return to latest version
doc.checkoutToLatest();
```

2. **Branching**

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Enable detached editing
doc.setDetachedEditing(true);

// Create a branch
const branch = doc.fork();

// Make changes in branch
const branchText = branch.getText("text");
branchText.insert(0, "Branch changes");
```

## Subscription and Sync

### Local Updates Subscription

Subscribe to local changes for syncing between peers:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
declare const otherDoc: LoroDoc;
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Subscribe to local updates
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  // Send updates to other peers
  otherDoc.import(updates);
});

// Later, unsubscribe when needed
unsubscribe();
```

### Document Events

Subscribe to all document changes. The event may be triggered by local operations, importing updates, or switching to another version.

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroEventBatch } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.subscribe((event: LoroEventBatch) => {
  console.log("Event triggered by:", event.by); // "local" | "import" | "checkout"
  console.log("Event origin:", event.origin);

  for (const e of event.events) {
    console.log("Target container:", e.target);
    console.log("Path:", e.path);
    console.log("Changes:", e.diff);
  }
});
```

### Container-specific Events

Subscribe to changes in specific containers:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroEventBatch } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.subscribe((event: LoroEventBatch) => {
  // Handle text-specific changes
  console.log("Text changed:", event);
});

const list = doc.getList("list");
list.subscribe((event: LoroEventBatch) => {
  // Handle list-specific changes
  console.log("List changed:", event);
});
```

## Advanced Features

### Cursor Support

Loro provides stable cursor position tracking that remains valid across concurrent edits:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "123");

// Get cursor at position with side (-1, 0, or 1)
const cursor = text.getCursor(0, 0);
if (cursor) {
  // Get current cursor position
  const pos = doc.getCursorPos(cursor);
  console.log(pos.offset); // Current position
  console.log(pos.side); // Cursor side

  // Cursor position updates automatically with concurrent edits
  text.insert(0, "abc");
  const newPos = doc.getCursorPos(cursor);
  console.log(newPos.offset); // Position updated
}
```

### Change Tracking

Track and analyze document changes:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, OpId } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
doc.commit();
// Get number of changes and operations
console.log(doc.changeCount()); // Number of changes
console.log(doc.opCount()); // Number of operations

const changes = doc.getAllChanges();
for (const [peer, peerChanges] of changes.entries()) {
  for (const change of peerChanges) {
    console.log("Change:", {
      peer: change.peer,
      counter: change.counter,
      lamport: change.lamport,
      timestamp: change.timestamp,
      message: change.message,
    });
  }
}

// Get specific change

const changeId = { peer: "1", counter: 0 } as OpId;
const change = doc.getChangeAt(changeId);

// Get operations in a change
const ops = doc.getOpsInChange(changeId);

doc.travelChangeAncestors([changeId], (change) => {
  console.log("Ancestor change:", change);
  return true; // continue traversal
});

// Get modified containers in a change
const modifiedContainers = doc.getChangedContainersIn(changeId, 1);
```

### Advanced Import/Export

Loro supports various import and export modes:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
// Export modes
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const previousVersion = doc.version();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const snapshot = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
const updates = doc.export({ mode: "update", from: previousVersion });
const shallowSnapshot = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.oplogFrontiers(),
});
const rangeUpdates = doc.export({
  mode: "updates-in-range",
  spans: [{ id: { peer: "1", counter: 0 }, len: 10 }],
});

// Import with status tracking
const status = doc.import(updates);
console.log("Successfully imported:", status.success);
console.log("Pending imports:", status.pending);

// Batch import
const status2 = doc.importBatch([snapshot, updates]);

// Import JSON updates
const jsonStatus = doc.importJsonUpdates({
  schema_version: 1,
  start_version: new Map([["1", 0]]),
  peers: ["1"],
  changes: [],
});
```

### Path and Value Access

Access document content through paths:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Get value or container by path
const value = doc.getByPath("map/key");
const container = doc.getByPath("list");

// Get path to a container
const path = doc.getPathToContainer("cid:root-list:List");

// JSONPath support
const results = doc.JSONPath("$.list[*]");

// Get shallow values (container IDs instead of resolved values)
const shallowDoc = doc.getShallowValue();
console.log(shallowDoc); // { list: 'cid:root-list:List', ... }

// Custom JSON serialization
const json = doc.toJsonWithReplacer((key, value) => {
  if (value instanceof LoroText) {
    return value.toDelta();
  }
  return value;
});
```

### Debug and Metadata

Access debug information and metadata:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { setDebug, LoroDoc, decodeImportBlobMeta } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Enable debug info
setDebug();
const blob = doc.export({ mode: "update" });
// Get import blob metadata
const metadata = decodeImportBlobMeta(blob, true);
console.log({
  startTimestamp: metadata.startTimestamp,
  endTimestamp: metadata.endTimestamp,
  mode: metadata.mode,
  changeNum: metadata.changeNum,
});
```

# Event Handling in Loro

Loro implements an event system to track changes in the document. This section
explains when events are emitted and how transactions work in Loro.

## Event Emission Points

Events in Loro are emitted whenever the internal document state changes. This
mechanism allows application-level derived states to automatically synchronize
with changes in the document state.

1. **Local Operations**: For local operations (like insertions or deletions on
   text), the operations are first placed in a pending state within an internal
   transaction.

2. **Transaction Commit**: When a transaction is committed, all pending
   operations collectively emit their corresponding events. This transaction
   commit occurs in two scenarios:
   - When `LoroDoc.commit()` is explicitly called
   - Automatically before an import or export operation

   Note that events are emitted asynchronously after a microtask. If you need to handle events immediately after a commit, you should await a microtask:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Event:", event);
});

const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello");
doc.commit();
// Event hasn't been emitted yet
await Promise.resolve();
// Now the event has been emitted
```

3. **Import**: When importing changes from a remote source using the `import()`
   method, respective events are emitted. This allows the local document to
   react to changes made by other peers.

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
declare const remoteChanges: Uint8Array;
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Event:", event);
});

doc.import(remoteChanges); // This will trigger events after a microtask
await Promise.resolve(); // Wait for events to be emitted
```

4. **Version Checkout**: When you switch document state to a different version
   using `doc.checkout(frontiers)`, Loro emits an event to reflect this change.
   Like other events, these are also emitted after a microtask.

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
doc.checkout(frontiers); // This will trigger events after a microtask
await Promise.resolve(); // Wait for events to be emitted
```

## Transaction Behavior

Transactions in Loro primarily serve to bundle related operations and emit their
events together as a cohesive unit. This is useful in several scenarios:

1. **Related Local Operations**: When performing multiple local operations that
   are logically connected, you may want them to:
   - Share the same commit message
   - Have the same timestamp
   - Move together during undo/redo operations

2. **Event Handling**: Applications often benefit from receiving related changes
   as a single batch rather than individual updates. Transactions facilitate
   this by:
   - Allowing you to set an origin identifier during commit
   - Including this origin value in the emitted events
   - Enabling better event filtering and processing based on the origin

<aside>
  Operations within a transaction are not immediately committed to the internal
  oplog. They are only committed when the transaction itself is committed.
  However, in order to make it easier to use and compare versions, uncommitted
  operations will also directly update the version.
</aside>

## Triggering a Commit

There are several ways to trigger a commit:

1. **Explicit Commit**: Directly calling the `commit()` method on the Loro
   document.

   ```ts twoslash
   import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
   // ---cut---
   const doc = new LoroDoc();
   const text = doc.getText("myText");
   text.insert(0, "Hello, Loro!");
   doc.commit(); // This commits pending operations and emits events
   ```

2. **Before Import/Export**: A commit is automatically triggered before
   executing an import operation.

   ```ts twoslash
   import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
   // ---cut---
   const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
   doc1.setPeerId(1);
   const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
   doc2.setPeerId(2);

   // Some ops on doc1 and doc2
   doc1.getText("text").insert(0, "Alice");
   doc2.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello, Loro!");
   console.log(doc1.version().toJSON()); // Map(0) {}
   console.log(doc2.version().toJSON()); // Map(0) {}
   const updates = doc1.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
   doc2.import(updates); // This first commits any pending operations in doc2
   console.log(doc2.version().toJSON()); // Map(2) { "1" => 5, "2" => 12 }
   console.log(doc1.version().toJSON()); // Map(2) { "1" => 5 }
   ```

## Transactions in Loro

It's important to note that Loro's concept of a transaction differs from
traditional database transactions:

- Loro transactions do not have ACID properties.
- They primarily serve as event wrappers.
- There is no rollback mechanism if an operation fails.

# Cursor

Cursor is an independently storable entity, meaning it can store content separately from the Loro document. It is used to stably represent positions within structures such as Text, List, or MovableList. Cursors can be utilized to represent collaborative cursor positions, highlight ranges, or comment ranges.

## Motivation

Using "index" to denote cursor positions can be unstable, as positions may shift with document edits. To reliably represent a position or range within a document, it is more effective to leverage the unique ID of each item/character in a List CRDT or Text CRDT.

## Updating Cursors

Loro optimizes State metadata by not storing the IDs of deleted elements. This approach, while efficient, complicates tracking cursor positions since they rely on these IDs for precise locations within the document. The solution recalculates position by replaying relevant history to update stable positions accurately. To minimize the performance impact of history replay, the system updates cursor info to reference only the IDs of currently present elements, thereby reducing the need for replay.

Each position has a "Side" information, indicating the actual cursor position is on the left, right, or directly in the center of the target ID.

Note: In JavaScript, the offset returned when querying a Stable Position is based on the UTF-16 index.

## Example

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const loro = new LoroDoc();
const list = loro.getList("list");
list.insert(0, "a");
const pos0 = list.getCursor(0);
list.insert(1, "b");
{
  const ans = loro.getCursorPos(pos0!);
  expect(ans.offset).toEqual(0);
  expect(ans.side).toEqual(0);
  expect(ans.update).toBeUndefined();
}
list.insert(0, "c");
{
  const ans = loro.getCursorPos(pos0!);
  expect(ans.offset).toEqual(1);
  expect(ans.side).toEqual(0);
  expect(ans.update).toBeUndefined();
}
list.delete(1, 1);
{
  const ans = loro.getCursorPos(pos0!);
  expect(ans.offset).toEqual(1);
  expect(ans.side).toEqual(-1);
  expect(ans.update).toBeDefined();
}
```

# Text

Loro supports both plain text and rich text. When rich text features (like mark
and unmark) are not used, the text container operates as plain text without any
rich text overhead, making it efficient for simple text operations.

LoroText offers excellent performance, particularly when handling large strings.
It significantly outperforms native JavaScript string operations due to its
internal B-tree structure. All basic operations like insert and delete have
O(log N) time complexity, making it highly efficient even when working with
documents containing several million characters.

> To learn how rich text CRDT in Loro works under the hood, please refer to our
> blog: [Introduction to Loro's Rich Text CRDT](/blog/loro-richtext).

LoroText also supports stable cursor and selection positions. Using the Cursor API (`text.getCursor`, `doc.getCursorPos`, `Side`), you can represent caret/selection endpoints that remain valid across concurrent editsâsimilar to Yjs's `RelativePosition`. See the [Cursor](/docs/tutorial/cursor) guide for details.

## Editor Bindings

Loro provides official bindings for popular editors to make it easier to integrate Loro's CRDT capabilities:

### ProseMirror Binding

The [loro-prosemirror](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-prosemirror) package provides seamless integration between Loro and ProseMirror, a powerful rich text editor framework. It includes:

- Document state synchronization with rich text support
- Cursor awareness and synchronization
- Undo/Redo support in collaborative editing

The ProseMirror binding can also be used with [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/), a popular rich text editor built on top of ProseMirror. This means you can easily add collaborative editing capabilities to your Tiptap-based applications.

```ts no_run
import {
  CursorAwareness,
  LoroCursorPlugin,
  LoroSyncPlugin,
  LoroUndoPlugin,
  undo,
  redo,
} from "loro-prosemirror";
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { EditorView } from "prosemirror-view";
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import { keymap } from "prosemirror-keymap";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const awareness = new CursorAwareness(doc.peerIdStr);
const plugins = [
  ...pmPlugins,
  LoroSyncPlugin({ doc }),
  LoroUndoPlugin({ doc }),
  keymap({
    "Mod-z": undo,
    "Mod-y": redo,
    "Mod-Shift-z": redo,
  }),
  LoroCursorPlugin(awareness, {}),
];
const editor = new EditorView(editorDom, {
  state: EditorState.create({ doc, plugins }),
});
```

### CodeMirror Binding

The [loro-codemirror](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-codemirror) package provides integration between Loro and CodeMirror 6, a versatile code editor. It supports:

- Document state synchronization
- Cursor awareness
- Undo/Redo functionality

```ts no_run
import { EditorState } from "@codemirror/state";
import { EditorView } from "@codemirror/view";
import { LoroExtensions } from "loro-codemirror";
import { Awareness, LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const awareness = new Awareness(doc.peerIdStr);
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {});

new EditorView({
  state: EditorState.create({
    extensions: [
      // ... other extensions
      LoroExtensions(
        doc,
        {
          awareness: awareness,
          user: { name: "Bob", colorClassName: "user1" },
        },
        undoManager,
      ),
    ],
  }),
  parent: document.querySelector("#editor")!,
});
```

## LoroText vs String

It's important to understand that LoroText is very different from using a regular string type. So the following code has different merge results:

Using `LoroText`:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("0");
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.setPeerId("1");
doc2.getText("text").insert(0, "World");
doc.import(doc2.export({ mode: "update" }));
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "HelloWorld"
```

Using `String`:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("0");
doc.getMap("map").set("text", "Hello");
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.setPeerId("1");
doc2.getMap("map").set("text", "World");
doc.import(doc2.export({ mode: "update" }));
console.log(doc.getMap("map").get("text")); // "World"
```

### Merge Semantics

Unlike LoroMap which uses Last-Write-Wins (LWW) semantics, LoroText is designed to preserve edits. Here's how they differ:

When user A and user B make concurrent edits to the same text:

- LoroText will merge both users' edits in sequence, preserving both changes
- LoroMap will use LWW semantics, keeping only one user's changes

### When to Use String in LoroMap

There are specific scenarios where using a string in LoroMap (with LWW semantics) might be more appropriate than using LoroText:

- **URLs**: When dealing with hyperlinks, automatic merging could result in invalid URLs. In this case, it's better to use LoroMap's LWW semantics to ensure the URL remains valid.
- **Hash String**: When handling hash string, LWW semantics are more appropriate to maintain data accuracy and consistency.

## Rich Text Config

To use rich text in Loro, you need to specify the expanding behaviors for each
format first. When we insert new text at the format boundaries, they define
whether the inserted text should inherit the format.

There are four kinds of expansion behaviors:

- `after`(default): when inserting text right after the given range, the mark
  will be expanded to include the inserted text
- `before`: when inserting text right before the given range, the mark will be
  expanded to include the inserted text
- `none`: the mark will not be expanded to include the inserted text at the
  boundaries
- `both`: when inserting text either right before or right after the given
  range, the mark will be expanded to include the inserted text

### Example

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, Delta } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.configTextStyle({
  bold: { expand: "after" },
  link: { expand: "before" },
});
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello World!");
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 5 }, "bold", true);
expect(text.toDelta()).toStrictEqual([
  {
    insert: "Hello",
    attributes: {
      bold: true,
    },
  },
  {
    insert: " World!",
  },
] as Delta<string>[]);

// " Test" will inherit the bold style because `bold` is configured to expand forward
text.insert(5, " Test");
expect(text.toDelta()).toStrictEqual([
  {
    insert: "Hello Test",
    attributes: {
      bold: true,
    },
  },
  {
    insert: " World!",
  },
] as Delta<string>[]);
```

## Methods

### `insert(pos: number, s: string)`

Insert text at the given pos.

### `delete(pos: number, len: number)`

Delete text at the given range.

### `slice(start: number, end: number): string`

Get a string slice.

### `toString(): string`

Get the plain text value.

### `charAt(pos: number): char`

Get the character at the given position.

### `splice(pos: number, len: number, text: string): string`

Delete and return the string at the given range and insert a string at the same
position.

### `length: number`

Get the length of text

### `getCursor(pos: number, side?: Side): Cursor | undefined`

Create a stable position handle for the given logical index. This is equivalent in purpose to Yjs's `RelativePosition` and is designed to stay valid across concurrent inserts/deletes.

- A cursor can represent a caret or one end of a selection. Store two cursors (anchor/head) to represent a selection.
- Use `doc.getCursorPos(cursor)` to resolve the current absolute offset and side. It may also return an updated cursor you should persist to minimize future replays.
- Offsets for Text are UTF-16 indices for the WASM binding.
- `side` controls whether the cursor sits to the left (-1), center (0), or right (1) of the target ID at boundaries. It affects how the cursor behaves when text is inserted at its position.

See the dedicated guide: [Cursor](/docs/tutorial/cursor).

Example (caret):

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "123");

// Create a stable cursor at the beginning
const cur = text.getCursor(0, 0);
{
  const pos = doc.getCursorPos(cur!);
  expect(pos.offset).toBe(0);
}

// Insert before the cursor. The cursor now moves forward
text.insert(0, "1");
{
  const pos = doc.getCursorPos(cur!);
  expect(pos.offset).toBe(1);
}
```

Example (selection via two cursors):

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.update("Hello World");

// Anchor at index 0 (left side), head at index 5 (right side)
const anchor = text.getCursor(0, -1)!;
const head = text.getCursor(5, 1)!;

// Resolve to absolute positions when needed
const a = doc.getCursorPos(anchor);
const h = doc.getCursorPos(head);
// selection = [a.offset, h.offset)
```

Persisting and restoring a cursor:

```ts twoslash
import { Cursor, LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.update("Hi");
const cur = text.getCursor(1, 0)!;

// Serialize and share
const bytes = cur.encode();

// Later on another peer
const restored = Cursor.decode(bytes);
const pos = doc.getCursorPos(restored);
```

### `toJSON(): string`

Returns the plain text content as a string. This method:
- Returns only the text content without any formatting marks
- Is not affected by any rich text attributes (bold, italic, links, etc.)
- Is equivalent to `toString()` for text containers

If you need rich text information including formatting, use `toDelta()` instead.

### `toDelta(): Delta<string>[]`

Get the rich text value with all formatting information. It's in
[Quill's Delta format](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/).

Unlike `toJSON()` which returns plain text, `toDelta()` preserves all rich text attributes like bold, italic, links, and custom marks.

Example comparing `toJSON()` vs `toDelta()`:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.configTextStyle({ bold: { expand: "after" } });
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello World!");
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 5 }, "bold", true);

// toJSON returns plain string without marks
console.log(text.toJSON()); // "Hello World!"

// toDelta returns rich text with formatting
console.log(text.toDelta());
// [
//   { insert: "Hello", attributes: { bold: true } },
//   { insert: " World!" }
// ]
```

### `mark(range: {start: number, end: number}, key: string, value: any): void`

Mark the given range with a key-value pair.

### `unmark(range: {start: number, end: number}, key: string): void`

Remove key-value pairs in the given range with the given key.

### `update(text: string)`

Update the current text based on the provided text.

### `applyDelta(delta: Delta<string>[]): void`

Change the state of this text by delta.

If a delta item is `insert`, it should include all the attributes of the
inserted text. Loro's rich text CRDT may make the inserted text inherit some
styles when you use the `insert` method directly. However, when you use
`applyDelta` if some attributes are inherited from CRDT but not included in the
delta, they will be removed.

Another special property of `applyDelta` is if you format an attribute for
ranges out of the text length, Loro will insert new lines to fill the gap first.
It's useful when you build the binding between Loro and rich text editors like
Quill, which might assume there is always a newline at the end of the text
implicitly.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
doc.configTextStyle({ bold: { expand: "after" } });

text.insert(0, "Hello World!");
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 5 }, "bold", true);
const delta = text.toDelta();
const text2 = doc.getText("text2");
text2.applyDelta(delta);
expect(text2.toDelta()).toStrictEqual(delta);
```

### `subscribe(f: (event: Listener)): number`

This method returns a number that can be used to remove the subscription.

The text event is in `Delta<string>[]` format. It can be used to bind the rich
text editor. It has the same type as the arg of `applyDelta`, so the following
example works:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, TextDiff } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
(async () => {
  const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
  doc1.configTextStyle({
    link: { expand: "none" },
    bold: { expand: "after" },
  });
  const text1 = doc1.getText("text");
  const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
  doc2.configTextStyle({
    link: { expand: "none" },
    bold: { expand: "after" },
  });
  const text2 = doc2.getText("text");
  text1.subscribe((e) => {
    for (const event of e.events) {
      const d = event.diff as TextDiff;
      text2.applyDelta(d.diff);
    }
  });
  text1.insert(0, "foo");
  text1.mark({ start: 0, end: 3 }, "link", true);
  doc1.commit();
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1));
  expect(text2.toDelta()).toStrictEqual(text1.toDelta());
  text1.insert(3, "baz");
  doc1.commit();
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1));
  expect(text2.toDelta()).toStrictEqual([
    { insert: "foo", attributes: { link: true } },
    { insert: "baz" },
  ]);
  expect(text2.toDelta()).toStrictEqual(text1.toDelta());
  text1.mark({ start: 2, end: 5 }, "bold", true);
  doc1.commit();
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1));
  expect(text2.toDelta()).toStrictEqual(text1.toDelta());
})();
```

# Ephemeral Store

In real-time collaborative scenarios, Presence information is just as important as maintaining document consistency across peers through CRDTs. This includes information such as the current collaborator's username, mouse pointer position, or selected objects. We need a mechanism that doesn't persist in the CRDT Document but remains ephemeral, allowing collaborators to perceive each other's presence for better coordination and to avoid conflicts when multiple users edit the same object. This is why we've introduced the Ephemeral Store.

![](/images/ephemeral.png)

Since Ephemeral information is primarily used for real-time collaboration, we've chosen a simple yet effective approach. The Ephemeral Store is a timestamp-based, last-write-wins key-value store. Each entry maintains its own timestamp of the last update, enabling the system to send only the updated entry content rather than the complete current state.

## Example

```ts twoslash
import { EphemeralStore, EphemeralStoreEvent } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";

const store = new EphemeralStore();
// Set ephemeral data
store.set("loro-prosemirror", {
  anchor: { pos: 0 },
  focus: { pos: 5 },
  user: "Alice",
});
store.set("online-users", ["Alice", "Bob"]);

expect(store.get("online-users")).toEqual(["Alice", "Bob"]);
// Encode only the data for `loro-prosemirror`
const encoded = store.encode("loro-prosemirror");

store.subscribe((e: EphemeralStoreEvent) => {
  // Listen to changes from `local`, `remote`, or `timeout` events
});
```

## API

- `constructor(timeout)`:
  Creates a new EphemeralStore instance with an optional timeout parameter (default: 30000ms). The timeout determines how long ephemeral data remains valid before being automatically removed.

- `set(key, value)`:
  Sets a value for the specified key in the ephemeral store. If the key already exists, its value will be updated.

- `get(key)`:
  Retrieves the current value for the specified key, or returns `undefined` if the key doesn't exist.

- `delete(key)`:
  Removes the specified key and its associated value from the ephemeral store.

- `getAllStates()`:
  Returns all current key-value pairs in the ephemeral store.

- `keys()`:
  Returns an array of all keys currently in the ephemeral store.

- `encode(key)`:
  Encodes the value associated with the specified key into a binary format that can be transmitted to other peers.

- `encodeAll()`:
  Encodes all key-value pairs in the ephemeral store into a binary format.

- `apply(bytes)`:
  Applies encoded ephemeral data received from other peers to the local ephemeral store.

- `subscribe((event: EphemeralStoreEvent)=>void)`:
  Registers a listener function that will be called whenever the ephemeral store is updated, either from local changes, remote changes, or timeout events.

  ```ts
  interface EphemeralStoreEvent {
    // The source of the event: local changes, imported from remote, or timeout expiration
    by: "local" | "import" | "timeout";
    // Array of keys that were newly added
    added: string[];
    // Array of keys that had their values updated
    updated: string[];
    // Array of keys that were removed
    removed: string[];
  }
  ```

- `subscribeLocalUpdates((bytes: Uint8Array) => void)`:
  Registers a listener that will be called only for local updates to the ephemeral store.

  ```ts
  // you need maintain the Subscription to avoid gc
  const _sub1 = ephemeral1.subscribeLocalUpdates((update) => {
    ephemeral2.apply(update);
  });

  const _sub2 = ephemeral2.subscribeLocalUpdates((update) => {
    ephemeral1.apply(update);
  });
  ```


# FILE: pages/docs/tutorial/sync.mdx

## Sync

Two documents with concurrent edits can be synchronized by just two message
exchanges.

Below is an example of synchronization between two documents:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const docA = new LoroDoc();
const docB = new LoroDoc();
const listA: LoroList = docA.getList("list");
listA.insert(0, "A");
listA.insert(1, "B");
listA.insert(2, "C");
// B import the ops from A
const data: Uint8Array = docA.export({ mode: "update" });
// The data can be sent to B through the network
docB.import(data);
expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["A", "B", "C"],
});

const listB: LoroList = docB.getList("list");
listB.delete(1, 1);

// `doc.export({mode: "update", from: version})` can encode all the ops from the version to the latest version
// `version` is the version vector of another document
const missingOps = docB.export({
  mode: "update",
  from: docA.oplogVersion(),
});
docA.import(missingOps);

expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["A", "C"],
});
expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual(docB.toJSON());
```

## Real-time Collaboration

Due to CRDT properties, document consistency is guaranteed when peers receive the same updates, regardless of order or duplicates.

### Sync Strategies

1. **First Sync** (Initial synchronization between peers):
   - New peers can exchange their [Version Vectors](/docs/tutorial/version) to determine missing updates
   - Use `doc.export({ mode: "update", from: versionVector })` to get updates since the peer's last known state.
     You may as well send the whole history by `doc.export({ mode: "update" })` as shown in the example above.
   - Example shows basic first sync scenario

2. **Realtime Sync** (Continuous updates):
   - Subscribe to local updates
   - Broadcast updates directly to all other peers
   - No need for version comparison after initial sync
   - As long as updates reach all peers, consistency is maintained

### Example

Here's how two peers can establish realtime sync when one comes online with offline changes:

1. Both peers exchange their version information
2. Each peer shares their missing updates:
   - `doc2` gets updates it's missing from `doc1`
   - `doc1` gets updates it's missing from `doc2`
3. Both peers establish realtime sync to stay connected

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
doc1.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
// Peer2 joins the network
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
// ... doc2 may import its local snapshot

// 1. Exchange version information
const peer2Version = doc2.oplogVersion();
const peer1Version = doc1.oplogVersion();

// 2. Request missing updates from existing peers
const missingOps = doc1.export({
  mode: "update",
  from: peer2Version,
});
doc2.import(missingOps);
const missingOps2 = doc2.export({
  mode: "update",
  from: peer1Version,
});
doc1.import(missingOps2);

// 3. Establish realtime sync
doc2.subscribeLocalUpdates((update) => {
  // websocket.send(update);
});
doc1.subscribeLocalUpdates((update) => {
  // websocket.send(update);
});

// Now both peers are in sync and can collaborate
```

## Understanding the `import()` Return Value

The `import()` method in Loro's JavaScript/WASM binding returns an object that provides feedback on the import operation. This object, let's call it `ImportStatusJS`, has the following structure:

```ts no_run twoslash
interface ImportStatusJS {
  success: PeerVersionRange;
  pending?: PeerVersionRange; // Optional: only present if there are pending operations
}

interface PeerVersionRange {
  [peerId: string]: {
    start: number; // Start counter (inclusive)
    end: number; // End counter (exclusive)
  };
}
```

### Fields Explained:

1. **`success`** (Object, `PeerVersionRange`)
   - **Description**: This field is always present and details the ranges of operations (changes) that were successfully imported and applied to the Loro document.
   - **Structure**: It's an object where:
     - Each **key** is a `string` representing a `PeerID` (the unique identifier of a collaborator or a source of changes).
     - Each **value** is an object `{ start: number, end: number }` defining a continuous range of operation counters for that specific peer.
       - `start`: The starting counter of the successfully imported range (inclusive).
       - `end`: The ending counter of the successfully imported range (exclusive). This means operations from `start` up to, but not including, `end` were processed.
   - **Purpose**: Helps understand which parts of the provided update data have been integrated into the local document's state.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     // Assuming importResult is the return value of doc.import(bytes)
     console.log(importResult.success);
     // Example output:
     // {
     //   "clientA_peerId": { "start": 0, "end": 50 },
     //   "server_peerId": { "start": 120, "end": 150 }
     // }
     // This means operations from clientA (counters 0-49) and
     // operations from server (counters 120-149) were successfully imported.
     ```

2. **`pending`** (Object, `PeerVersionRange`, optional)
   - **Description**: This field is only present if some operations from the imported data could not be applied because they depend on other operations that Loro has not seen yet (i.e., their causal dependencies are missing). It details these "pending" operation ranges.
   - **Structure**: Identical to the `success` field. An object mapping `PeerID` strings to `{ start: number, end: number }` counter ranges.
   - **Purpose**: Informs the application that certain changes are known but are "on hold" awaiting their prerequisites. To apply these pending changes, the missing prerequisite operations must be imported first. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency in collaborative scenarios.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     // Assuming importResult is the return value of doc.import(bytes)
     if (importResult.pending) {
       console.log(importResult.pending);
       // Example output:
       // {
       //   "clientA_peerId": { "start": 50, "end": 60 },
       //   "clientB_peerId": { "start": 10, "end": 25 }
       // }
       // This means operations from clientA (counters 50-59) and
       // operations from clientB (counters 10-24) are pending due to missing dependencies.
     }
     ```

### How to Use This Information:

- Check the `success` field to confirm which updates were applied.
- If the `pending` field exists and is not empty, it signals that further updates (dependencies) are required to fully integrate all known changes. Your application might need to fetch or request these missing updates from other peers or a central server.

# How to Use Time Travel in Loro

In Loro, you can call `doc.checkout(frontiers)` to jump to the version specified
by the
frontiers([Learn more about frontiers](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive#frontiers)).

Note that using `doc.checkout(frontiers)` to jump to a specific version places
the document in a detached state, preventing further edits. To learn more, see
[_Attached/Detached Status_](/docs/advanced/doc_state_and_oplog#attacheddetached-status).
To continue editing, reattach the document to the latest version using
`doc.attach()`. This design is temporary and will be phased out once we have a
more refined version control API in place.

## Read-only Time Travel

Below we demonstrate how to implement simple, read-only time-travel. You could,
for example, combine this with a slider in a UI to allow users to view the document
over time.

### Enable Timestamps

Before this example will work, it is important that the edits made to the document
have had [timestamp storage](/docs/advanced/timestamp) enabled:

```ts no_run
doc.setRecordTimestamp(true);
```

This makes sure that all changes to the document will have a timestamp added to it.
We will use this timestamp to sort changes so that the ordering will match user
intuition.

### Implementing Time Travel

The first step is to load our document. Here we assume that you have a snapshot from your database
or API.

```ts no_run
// Get the snapshot for your doc from your database / API
let snapshot = fetchSnapshot();

// Import into a new document
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.import(snapshot);
```

Next we must collect and sort the timestamps for every change in the document. We want uesrs to be
able to drag a slider to select a timestamp out of this list.

```ts no_run
// Collect all changes from the document
const changes = doc.getAllChanges();

// Get the timestamps for all changes
const timestamps = Array.from(
  new Set(
    [...changes.values()]
      .flat() // Flatten changes from all peers into one list
      .map((x) => x.timestamp) // Get the timestamp from each peer
      .filter((x) => !!x),
  ),
);

// Sort the timestamps
timestamps.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

Next we need to make a helper function that will return a list of
[Frontiers](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive#frontiers) for any timestamp.

For each peer that has edited a document, there is a list of changes by that peer. Each change has a
`counter`, and a `length`. That `counter` is like an always incrementing version number for the
changes made by that peer.

A change's `counter` is the starting point of the change, and the `length` indicates how much the
change incremented the counter before the end of the change.

The frontiers are the list of counters that we want to checkout from each peer. Since we are going
for a timeline view, we want to get the highest counter that we know happned before our timestamp
for each peer.

Here we make a helper function to do that.

```ts
const getFrontiersForTimestamp = (
  changes: Map<string, Change[]>,
  ts: number,
): { peer: string; counter: number }[] => {
  const frontiers = [] as { peer: string; counter: number }[];

  // Record the highest counter for each peer where it's change is not later than
  // our target timestamp.
  changes.forEach((changes, peer) => {
    let counter = -1;
    for (const change of changes) {
      if (change.timestamp <= ts) {
        counter = Math.max(counter, change.counter + change.length - 1);
      }
    }
    if (counter > -1) {
      frontiers.push({ counter, peer });
    }
  });
  return frontiers;
};
```

Finally, all we can get the index from our slider, get the timestamp from our list, and then
checkout the calculated frontiers.

```ts no_run
let sliderIdx = 3;
const timestamp = timestamps[sliderIdx - 1];
const frontiers = getFrontiersForTimestamp(changes, timestamp);

doc.checkout(frontiers);
```

# Composing CRDTs

In Loro, you can build complex data structures using basic CRDTs such as List, MovableList, Map and Tree. These containers can include sub-containers, which in turn can contain more sub-containers, allowing for the composition of intricate data structures.

It's important to note that documents in Loro must adhere to a tree structure. This means that while a parent can have multiple children, each child is restricted to only one parent. Therefore, the document forms a tree rather than a graph (like a DAG).

By leveraging these fundamental CRDTs, you can effectively model the states and the updates of documents that conform to the JSON schema.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("map");
let callTimes = 0;
// Events from a child are propagated to all ancestor nodes.
map.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log(event);
  callTimes++;
});

// Create a sub container for map
// { map: { list: [] } }
const list = map.setContainer("list", new LoroList());
list.push(0);
list.push(1);

// Create a sub container for list
// { map: { list: [0, 1, LoroText] } }
const text = list.insertContainer(2, new LoroText());
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ map: { list: [0, 1, ""] } });
{
  // Commit will trigger the event, because list is a sub container of map
  doc.commit();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1));
  expect(callTimes).toBe(1);
}

text.insert(0, "Hello, ");
text.insert(7, "World!");
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({ map: { list: [0, 1, "Hello, World!"] } });
{
  // Commit will trigger the event, because text is a descendant of map
  doc.commit();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1));
  expect(callTimes).toBe(2);
}
```


# FILE: pages/docs/tutorial/tips.mdx

# Tips and Tricks

##### `LoroDoc` will be initialized with a new random PeerID each time

<details>
<summary>What if I need to set the initial state?</summary>

If your document requires an initial state, you should not edit the document to achieve this state right
after creating it with new LoroDoc(). This approach can cause problems - each time someone opens the document,
new operations with different PeerIDs would be added just to set up the initial state.

The better approach is to initialize your document by loading the same Snapshot. This ensures all users start
from an identical baseline without generating unnecessary operations.

</details>

---

##### Be careful when using `doc.setPeerId(newId)`

When using `setPeerId`, you must avoid having two parallel peers use the same PeerId. This can cause serious consistency problems in your application.

<details>
<summary>Why</summary>

It's because Loro determines whether an operation has already been included by checking its operation ID. Since operation IDs are composed of `PeerId + Counter`, duplicate PeerIds can easily lead to duplicate operation IDs. During synchronization, Loro might incorrectly assume certain operations have already been processed, resulting in document inconsistency across peers.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to reuse PeerIds safely</summary>

Be careful when reusing PeerIds (this optimization is often unnecessary). You should not assign a fixed PeerId to a user, as one user might use multiple devices. Similarly, you shouldn't assign a fixed PeerId to a device, because even on a single browser, multiple tabs might open the same document simultaneously.

If you must reuse PeerIds, you need to carefully manage your local PeerId cache with proper locking mechanisms. This would allow only one tab to "take" a specific PeerId, while other tabs use random IDs. The PeerId should be returned to the cache when no longer in use.

</details>

---

##### Root containers don't need operations to be initialized

Root Containers are created implicitly in Loro. This means that when you call `doc.getText("text")`, no new operations appear in the LoroDoc history, and there are no operations that need to be synchronized with other peers.

This behavior contrasts with non-root containers. For example, when you execute `doc.getMap("meta").setContainer("text", new LoroText())`, it generates an operation to insert the LoroText container into the map.

---

##### When initializing child containers of LoroMap in parallel, overwrites can occur instead of automatic merging.

<details>
<summary>Why this happens</summary>

This happens because parallel creation of child containers results in different container IDs, preventing automatic merging of their contents. When a container holds substantial data or serves as the primary storage for document content, overwriting it can lead to unintended hiding or loss of critical information.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("map");

// Parallel initialization of child containers
const docB = doc.fork();
const textA = doc.getMap("map").setContainer("text", new LoroText());
textA.insert(0, "A");
const textB = docB.getMap("map").setContainer("text", new LoroText());
textB.insert(0, "B");

doc.import(docB.export({ mode: "update" }));
// Result: Either { "meta": { "text": "A" } } or { "meta": { "text": "B" } }
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Best practices for container initialization</summary>

1. When using map containers:
   - If possible, initialize all child containers during the map container's initialization
   - Avoid concurrent creation of child containers with the same key in the map container to prevent overwrites
2. If it's impossible to initialize all child containers when the map container is initialized, prefer initializing them at the root level rather than as nested containers.
    - You can use `doc.getMap("user." + userId)` instead of `doc.getMap("user").getOrCreateContainer(userId, new LoroMap())` to avoid this problem.
</details>

---

##### Use redaction to safely share document history

There are times when users might accidentally paste sensitive information (like API keys, passwords, or personal data) into a collaborative document. When this happens, you need a way to remove just that sensitive content from the document history without compromising the rest of the document's integrity.

<details>
<summary>How to safely redact sensitive content</summary>

Loro provides a `redactJsonUpdates` function that allows you to selectively redact operations within specific version ranges.

For example, if a user accidentally pastes a password or API key into a document:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, redactJsonUpdates } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");

// Create some content to be redacted
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Sensitive information");
doc.commit();

const map = doc.getMap("map");
map.set("password", "secret123");
map.set("public", "public information");
doc.commit();

// Export JSON updates
const jsonUpdates = doc.exportJsonUpdates();

// Define version range to redact (redact the text content)
const versionRange = {
  "1": [0, 21], // Redact the "Sensitive information"
};

// Apply redaction
const redactedJson = redactJsonUpdates(jsonUpdates, versionRange);

// Create a new document with redacted content
const redactedDoc = new LoroDoc();
redactedDoc.importJsonUpdates(redactedJson);

// The text content is now redacted with replacement characters
console.log(redactedDoc.getText("text").toString());
// Outputs: "ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"

// You can also redact specific map entries
const versionRange2 = {
  "1": [21, 22], // Redact the "secret123" password
};

const redactedJson2 = redactJsonUpdates(jsonUpdates, versionRange2);
const redactedDoc2 = new LoroDoc();
redactedDoc2.importJsonUpdates(redactedJson2);

console.log(redactedDoc2.getMap("map").get("password")); // null
console.log(redactedDoc2.getMap("map").get("public")); // "public information"
```

This approach is safer than manually editing document content because:

1. It maintains document structure and CRDT consistency
2. It keeps key metadata like operation IDs and dependencies intact
3. It allows concurrent editing to continue working after redaction
4. It selectively redacts only specific operations, not the entire document

The redaction process follows these rules:

- Preserves delete, tree move, and list move operations
- Replaces text insertion content with Unicode replacement characters 'ï¿½'
- Substitutes list and map insert values with null
- Maintains structure of child containers
- Replaces text mark values with null
- Preserves map keys and text annotation keys

**Important**: Your application needs to ensure that all peers receive the redacted version, otherwise the original document with sensitive information will still exist on other peers.

##### Use shallow snapshots to completely remove old history

When you need to completely remove ALL history older than a certain version point, shallow snapshots provide the solution.

<details>
<summary>How to remove old history with shallow snapshots</summary>

Shallow snapshots create a new document that preserves the current state but completely eliminates all history before a specified point, similar to Git's shallow clone functionality.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");

// Old history - will be completely removed
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "This document has a long history with many edits");
doc.commit();
text.insert(0, "Including some potentially sensitive information. ");
doc.commit();

// More recent history - will be preserved
text.delete(11, 55); // Remove the middle part
text.insert(11, "with sanitized history");
doc.commit();

// Create a sanitized version that removes ALL history before current point
const sanitizedSnapshot = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.oplogFrontiers(),
});

// Create a new document from the sanitized snapshot
const sanitizedDoc = new LoroDoc();
sanitizedDoc.import(sanitizedSnapshot);

// The document has the final state
console.log(sanitizedDoc.getText("text").toString());
// Outputs: "Including with sanitized history"

// But ALL history before the snapshot point is completely removed
console.log(sanitizedDoc.isShallow()); // true
console.log(sanitizedDoc.shallowSinceFrontiers()); // Shows the starting point
```

This approach is useful for:

1. Completely removing all old history that might contain various sensitive information
2. Significantly reducing document size by eliminating unnecessary history
3. Creating clean document instances after certain milestones
4. Ensuring old operations cannot be recovered or examined

Compared to redaction:

- Shallow snapshots completely remove all operations before a version point
- Redaction selectively replaces just specific content with placeholders

**Important**: While both methods maintain future synchronization consistency, your application must distribute the sanitized document to all peers. Otherwise, the original document with sensitive information will still exist on other clients.

**When to use each approach**:

- Use **redaction** when you need to sanitize specific operations (like an accidental password paste) while preserving older history
- Use **shallow snapshots** when you want to completely eliminate all history before a certain point

##### You can store mappings between LoroDoc's peerIds and user IDs in the document itself

Use `doc.subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer(listener)` to associate peer information with user identities when a peer first interacts with the document.

<details>
<summary>How to track peer-to-user mappings</summary>

This functionality is essential for building user-centric features in collaborative applications. You often need bidirectional mapping between user IDs and peer IDs:

- **Finding all edits by a user**: When you need to retrieve all document edits made by a specific user ID, you must first find all peer IDs associated with that user
- **Showing edit attribution**: When displaying which user edited a piece of text, you need to map from the peer ID (stored in the operation) back to the user ID for display

This hook provides an ideal point to associate peer information (such as author identity) with the document. The listener is triggered on the first commit from each peer, allowing you to store user metadata within the document itself.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId(0);
doc.subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer((e) => {
  doc.getMap("users").set(e.peer, "user-" + e.peer);
});
doc.getList("list").insert(0, 100);
doc.commit();
await Promise.resolve();
expect(doc.getMap("users").get("0")).toBe("user-0");
```

This approach allows you to:

1. Automatically track which peers have contributed to the document
2. Store user metadata (names, emails, etc.) alongside the document
3. Build features like author attribution, presence indicators, or edit history

The mapping is stored within the document, so it automatically synchronizes across all peers and persists with the document's state.

# Tree

When it comes to utilizing hierarchical data structures and even performing operations across different levels of data, tree structures are of paramount importance. Loro implements the concept of a movable tree CRDT, based on the algorithm created by Kleppmann et al. in **_[A highly-available move operation for replicated trees](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/10/07/crdt-tree-move-operation.html)_**.

In addition to this, Loro further employs **Fractional Index** (an algorithm used in distributed systems to maintain the order of sequences) to sort each child node, ensuring that sibling nodes maintain an orderly sequence. As a result, Loro can provide APIs such as `moveAfter()` and `moveBefore()`. This is particularly useful when a custom-ordered hierarchical view is required.

## Node Data

Loro associates a [Map](https://www.loro.dev/docs/tutorial/map) with each tree node, serving as a data container for the node, allowing you to nest any data structure supported by Loro.

> Note: The associated Map Container is considered a child of the Tree Container within the Loro documentation hierarchy.

You can get the associated map by `.data` of the `LoroTreeNode` so you can invoke `set` or `setContainer` on the map to add some data or sub-containers to the tree node. For example:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroTree, LoroTreeNode, LoroMap, LoroList } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
let doc = new LoroDoc();
let tree: LoroTree = doc.getTree("tree");
let node: LoroTreeNode = tree.createNode();
node.data.set("key", "value");
node.data.setContainer("list", new LoroList());
```

## Ordered Tree Nodes

In certain scenarios such as graphic design or file systems, where sibling nodes may also require a sequential relationship, we have introduced `Fractional Index` in Loro to support this capability. You can read more about `Fractional Index` in the [Figma blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences). In simple terms, `Fractional Index` assigns a sortable value to each object, and if a new insertion occurs between two objects, the `Fractional Index` of the new object will be between the left and right values. The rust-based `Fractional Index` [implementation of Drifting-in-Space](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/fractional_index) has good design and minimal document size growth in most cases. We forked it and made a simple extension for use in Loro.

Whenever a new tree node is created or a node is moved to a new position, Loro will generate a `Fractional Index` for the node based on its position to sort among sibling nodes. In collaborative environments, conflicts with `Fractional Indexes` can arise, such as different nodes having the same `Fractional Index` or the situation where the calculation of a new node's position results in the same `Fractional Index` on both sides. We will discuss the corresponding conflict resolution methods in detail in [the blog post](https://www.loro.dev/blog/movable-tree).

You should call `enable_fractional_index(jitter: number)` to enable `Fractional Index`.

> Note: Fractional Index has an interleaving issue, but we believe this is acceptable for tree structures.

## Events

There are three types of events in the tree structure: `Create`, `Move`, and `Delete`, as follows:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { TreeID } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
export type TreeDiffItem =
  | {
      target: TreeID;
      action: "create";
      parent: TreeID | undefined;
      index: number;
      fractionalIndex: string;
    }
  | {
      target: TreeID;
      action: "delete";
      oldParent: TreeID | undefined;
      oldIndex: number;
    }
  | {
      target: TreeID;
      action: "move";
      parent: TreeID | undefined;
      index: number;
      fractionalIndex: string;
      oldParent: TreeID | undefined;
      oldIndex: number;
    };
```

Here, `index` and `fractionalIndex` represent the node's index and the hex string representation of the `Fractional Index`, respectively. Loro will emit events in the order of causality. The deletion event signifies that the target node, along with the entire subtree rooted at the target node, has been deleted. Deletion events for the child nodes are not emitted.

### Events of node's data

Since the data of the tree nodes is represented using `MapContainer`, each `MapContainer` associated with a tree node is a child of the `TreeContainer` in the document. If you modify the data of a tree node, you will receive an event from the `MapContainer`. However, the event path contains a element of `TreeID` to indicate which node's data has been altered.

## Retrieving All Nodes

There are multiple ways to retrieve all nodes from a `LoroTree`:

1. `nodes()`: Retrieves all `LoroTreeNode` instances from the current `LoroTree`, but this function does not guarantee the order of the nodes.
2. `roots()`: Retrieves all root nodes from the current `LoroTree`, with the root nodes being ordered. Subsequently, the `children()` method of `LoroTreeNode` can be used to perform a hierarchical traversal.
3. `toArray()`: Retrieves all node information in a hierarchical traversal order, where each node's data structure is as follows:

   ```ts no_run twoslash
   import { TreeID, LoroMap } from "loro-crdt";
   // ---cut---
   {
     id: TreeID;
     parent: TreeID | undefined;
     index: number;
     fractionalIndex: string;
     meta: LoroMap;
   }
   ```

4. `toJSON()`: The JSON representation of `toArray()`, where each node's `meta` is also recursively parsed into JSON format.

## Basic Usage

### Example

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroTree, LoroTreeNode, LoroMap } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
let doc = new LoroDoc();
let tree: LoroTree = doc.getTree("tree");
let root: LoroTreeNode = tree.createNode();
// By default, append to the end of the parent node's children list
let node = root.createNode();
// Specify the child's position
let node2 = root.createNode(0);
// Move the node to become a child of another node
node.move(node2);
// Specify the child's position within the new parent
node.move(node2, 0);
// Move the node to become the root node
node.move();
// Move the node to be positioned after another node
node.moveAfter(node2);
// Move the node to be positioned before another node
node.moveBefore(node2);
// Retrieve the index of the node within its parent's children
let index = node.index();
// Get the fractional index of the node
let fractionalIndex = node.fractionalIndex();
// Access the associated data map container
let nodeData: LoroMap = node.data;
```

## Best Practices for Persisting Loro Documents

The simplest approach is to use full snapshots for both import and export
operations. Here's how it works:

1. Import the entire snapshot when loading the document.
2. Export a complete snapshot when saving changes.
3. Implement a debounce or throttle mechanism to trigger snapshot saves after a
   certain number of edits.

This method simplifies initial application development but has a drawback: user
edits are not immediately saved. Let's explore how to quickly save each user
edit while minimizing resource consumption.

### Balancing Quick Saves and Resource Efficiency

To achieve both quick saves and resource efficiency:

- Use [`Snapshot Encoding`](./encoding#snapshot-encoding) to periodically store the entire document.
- Use [`Updates Encoding`](./encoding#updates-encoding) to export delta updates frequently (e.g., after each
  keystroke or with debounce/throttle). Store these binary data in fast-write
  storage like user disks or a key-value database. This ensures quick saves with
  low resource cost.
- When loading a document, import the snapshot and all related updates to get
  the latest version.
- After importing, export a new snapshot to replace the old one and remove
  imported updates for faster future loading.
- If your `LoroDoc` has grown large and older history can be safely recycled,
  use `Shallow Snapshot Encoding` to reduce snapshot size. You can archive the
  history before the shallow snapshot's start version in cold storage.

For collaboration, the binary data generated by snapshot/updates can be
transmitted through any medium, such as WebRTC, WebSocket, or HTTP.

The strong eventual consistency in CRDTs ensures that peers with identical sets
of operations will converge to the same document state, obviating concerns about
the order, duplication, or timing of operation delivery.


# FILE: pages/docs/tutorial/version.mdx

# Version

In centralized environments, we can use linear version numbers to represent a version, such as incrementing a number each time or using timestamps. However, CRDTs can be used in decentralized environments, and their version representation is different.

In Loro, you can express a document's version through a [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector) or [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers).

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.version(); // State Version vector
doc.oplogVersion(); // OpLog Version vector
doc.frontiers(); // State Frontiers
doc.oplogFrontiers(); // OpLog Frontiers
```

In most cases, you might only need the Version Vector, which can be used for data synchronization and version comparison.

# Getting Started

You can use Loro in your application by using:

- [`loro-crdt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loro-crdt) NPM package
- [`loro`](https://crates.io/crates/loro) Rust crate
- [`loro-swift`](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-swift) Swift package
- [`loro-py`](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-py) Python package
- [`loro-cs`](https://github.com/sensslen/loro-cs) Community-maintained C# package
- You can also find a list of examples in
  [Loro examples in Deno](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-examples-deno).

You can use [Loro Inspector](/docs/advanced/inspector) to debug and visualize the state and history of Loro documents.

The following guide will use `loro-crdt` js package as the example.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/loro-basic-test?file=test%2Floro-sync.test.ts)

## Install

```bash
npm install loro-crdt

# Or
pnpm install loro-crdt

# Or
yarn add loro-crdt
```

If you're using `Vite`, you should add the following to your vite.config.ts:

```ts no-run
import wasm from "vite-plugin-wasm";
import topLevelAwait from "vite-plugin-top-level-await";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [...otherConfigures, wasm(), topLevelAwait()],
});
```

<details>
<summary>â ï¸ DOMContentLoaded Timing Issue with Vite</summary>

When using Loro with Vite, be aware of module loading timing issues with DOM events:

**Problem:** The following code will cause nothing to load on the screen:

```ts no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const doc = new LoroDoc();
  // Your code here...
});
```

**Reason:** This occurs because Vite loads ES modules asynchronously, and the WASM module initialization within `loro-crdt` also happens asynchronously. When you import at the top level but execute code inside `DOMContentLoaded`, the WASM module may not be fully initialized when the event fires, causing the application to fail silently.

**Solutions:**

1. **Remove the event listener** (recommended for most cases):

   ```ts no_run twoslash
   import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

   const doc = new LoroDoc();
   // Your code here...
   ```

2. **Use dynamic import inside the event listener**:
   ```ts no_run twoslash
   document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => {
     const { LoroDoc } = await import("loro-crdt");
     const doc = new LoroDoc();
     // Your code here...
   });
   ```

The dynamic import ensures the module and its WASM dependencies are fully loaded before use.

</details>

If you're using `Next.js`, you should add the following to your next.config.js:

```js no-run
module.exports = {
  webpack: function (config) {
    config.experiments = {
      layers: true,
      asyncWebAssembly: true,
    };
    return config;
  },
};
```

You can also use Loro directly in the browser via ESM imports. Here's a minimal
example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>ESM Module Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="module">
      import init, {
        LoroDoc,
      } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/loro-crdt@1.0.9/web/index.js";

      init().then(() => {
        const doc = new LoroDoc();
        const text = doc.getText("text");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Introduction

It is well-known that syncing data/building realtime collaborative apps is
challenging, especially when devices can be offline or part of a peer-to-peer
network. Loro simplifies this process for you.

After you model your app state by Loro, syncing is simple:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const docA = new LoroDoc();
const docB = new LoroDoc();

//...operations on docA and docB

// Assume docA and docB are two Loro documents in two different devices
const bytesA = docA.export({ mode: "update" });
// send bytes to docB by any method
docB.import(bytesA);
// docB is now updated with all the changes from docA

const bytesB = docB.export({ mode: "update" });
// send bytes to docA by any method
docA.import(bytesB);
// docA and docB are now in sync, they have the same state
```

Saving your app state is also straightforward:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
const bytes = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
// Bytes can be saved to local storage, database, or sent over the network
```

Loading your app state:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const bytes = new Uint8Array();
// ---cut---
const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
newDoc.import(bytes);
```

Loro also makes it easy for you to time travel the history and add version
control to your app. [Learn more about time travel](/docs/tutorial/time_travel).

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const version = doc.frontiers();
// ---cut---
doc.checkout(version); // Checkout the doc to the given version
```

Loro is compatible with the JSON schema. If you can model your app state with
JSON, you probably can sync your app with Loro. Because we need to adhere to the
JSON schema, using a number as a key in a Map is not permitted, and cyclic links
should be avoided.

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
doc.toJSON(); // Get the JSON representation of the doc
```

## Entry Point: LoroDoc

LoroDoc is the entry point for using Loro. You must create a Doc to use Map,
List, Text, and other types and to complete data synchronization.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text: LoroText = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello world!");
console.log(doc.toJSON()); // { "text": "Hello world!" }
```

## Container

We refer to CRDT types such as `List`, `Map`, `Tree`, `MovableList`, and `Text`
as `Container`s.

Here are their basic operations:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList, LoroMap, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const list: LoroList = doc.getList("list");
list.insert(0, "A");
list.insert(1, "B");
list.insert(2, "C");

const map: LoroMap = doc.getMap("map");
// map can only has string key
map.set("key", "value");
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["A", "B", "C"],
  map: { key: "value" },
});

// delete 2 element at index 0
list.delete(0, 2);
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["C"],
  map: { key: "value" },
});

// Insert a text container to the list
const text = list.insertContainer(0, new LoroText());
text.insert(0, "Hello");
text.insert(0, "Hi! ");

expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["Hi! Hello", "C"],
  map: { key: "value" },
});

// Insert a list container to the map
const list2 = map.setContainer("test", new LoroList());
list2.insert(0, 1);
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["Hi! Hello", "C"],
  map: { key: "value", test: [1] },
});
```

## Save and Load

Loro is a pure library and does not handle network protocols or storage mechanisms. It is your responsibility to manage the storage and transmission of the binary data exported by Loro.

To save the document, use `doc.export({mode: "snapshot"})` to get its binary
form. To open it again, use `doc.import(data)` to load this binary data.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList, LoroMap, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
const data = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
newDoc.import(data);
expect(newDoc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  text: "Hello world!",
});
```

Exporting the entire document on each keypress is inefficient. Instead, use
`doc.export({mode: "update", from: VersionVector})` to obtain binary data for
operations since the last export.

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList, LoroMap, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
const data = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
let lastSavedVersion = doc.version();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "â¨");
const update0 = doc.export({ mode: "update", from: lastSavedVersion });
lastSavedVersion = doc.version();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "ð¶âð«ï¸");
const update1 = doc.export({ mode: "update", from: lastSavedVersion });

{
  /**
   * You can import the snapshot and the updates to get the latest version of the document.
   */

  // import the snapshot
  const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
  newDoc.import(data);
  expect(newDoc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
    text: "Hello world!",
  });

  // import update0
  newDoc.import(update0);
  expect(newDoc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
    text: "â¨Hello world!",
  });

  // import update1
  newDoc.import(update1);
  expect(newDoc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
    text: "ð¶âð«ï¸â¨Hello world!",
  });
}

{
  /**
   * You may also import them in a batch
   */
  const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
  newDoc.importUpdateBatch([update1, update0, data]);
  expect(newDoc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
    text: "ð¶âð«ï¸â¨Hello world!",
  });
}
```

If updates accumulate, exporting a new snapshot can quicken import times and
decrease the overall size of the exported data.

You can store the binary data exported from Loro wherever you prefer.

## Sync

Two documents with concurrent edits can be synchronized by just two message
exchanges.

Below is an example of synchronization between two documents:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList, LoroMap, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const docA = new LoroDoc();
const docB = new LoroDoc();
const listA: LoroList = docA.getList("list");
listA.insert(0, "A");
listA.insert(1, "B");
listA.insert(2, "C");
// B import the ops from A
const data: Uint8Array = docA.export({ mode: "update" });
// The data can be sent to B through the network
docB.import(data);
expect(docB.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["A", "B", "C"],
});

const listB: LoroList = docB.getList("list");
listB.delete(1, 1);

// `doc.export({mode: "update", from: version})` can encode all the ops from the version to the latest version
// `version` is the version vector of another document
const missingOps = docB.export({
  mode: "update",
  from: docA.oplogVersion(),
});
docA.import(missingOps);

expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  list: ["A", "C"],
});
expect(docA.toJSON()).toStrictEqual(docB.toJSON());
```

## Event

You can subscribe to the event from `Container`s.

`LoroText` and `LoroList` can receive updates in
[Quill Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/) format.

The events will be emitted after a transaction is committed. A transaction is
committed when:

- `doc.commit()` is called.
- `doc.export(mode)` is called.
- `doc.import(data)` is called.
- `doc.checkout(version)` is called.

Below is an example of rich text event:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroList, LoroMap, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
// The code is from https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-examples-deno
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello world!");
doc.commit();
let ran = false;
text.subscribe((e) => {
  for (const event of e.events) {
    if (event.diff.type === "text") {
      expect(event.diff.diff).toStrictEqual([
        {
          retain: 5,
          attributes: { bold: true },
        },
      ]);
      ran = true;
    }
  }
});
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 5 }, "bold", true);
doc.commit();
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1));
expect(ran).toBeTruthy();
```

The types of events are defined as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { Path, Diff, Frontiers, ContainerID } from "loro-crdt";

export interface LoroEventBatch {
  /**
   * How the event is triggered.
   *
   * - `local`: The event is triggered by a local transaction.
   * - `import`: The event is triggered by an import operation.
   * - `checkout`: The event is triggered by a checkout operation.
   */
  by: "local" | "import" | "checkout";
  origin?: string;
  /**
   * The container ID of the current event receiver.
   * It's undefined if the subscriber is on the root document.
   */
  currentTarget?: ContainerID;
  events: LoroEvent[];
  from: Frontiers;
  to: Frontiers;
}

/**
 * The concrete event of Loro.
 */
export interface LoroEvent {
  /**
   * The container ID of the event's target.
   */
  target: ContainerID;
  diff: Diff;
  /**
   * The absolute path of the event's emitter, which can be an index of a list container or a key of a map container.
   */
  path: Path;
}
```

## Introduction to Loro

It is well-known that syncing data/building realtime collaborative apps is
challenging, especially when devices can be offline or part of a peer-to-peer
network. Loro simplifies this process for you.

We want to provide better DevTools to make building
[local-first apps](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) easy and
enjoyable.

Loro uses [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)](/docs/concepts/crdt) to
resolve parallel edits. By utilizing Loro's data types, your applications can be
made collaborative and keep the editing history with low overhead.

After you model your app state by Loro, syncing is simple:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const docA = new LoroDoc();
const docB = new LoroDoc();
docA.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
docB.getText("text").insert(0, "Hi!");
// Assume docA and docB are two Loro documents in two different devices
const bytesA = docA.export({ mode: "update" });
// send bytes to docB by any method
docB.import(bytesA);
// docB is now updated with all the changes from docA

const bytesB = docB.export({ mode: "update" });
// send bytes to docA by any method
docA.import(bytesB);
// docA and docB are now in sync, they have the same state
```

Saving your app state is also straightforward:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
const bytes = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
// Bytes can be saved to local storage, database, or sent over the network
```

Loading your app state:

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const bytes = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]);
// ---cut---
const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
newDoc.import(bytes);
```

Loro also makes it easy for you to time travel the history and add version
control to your app. [Learn more about time travel](/docs/tutorial/time_travel).

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const version = doc.frontiers();
// ---cut---
doc.checkout(version); // Checkout the doc to the given version
```

Loro is compatible with the JSON schema. If you can model your app state with
JSON, you probably can sync your app with Loro. Because we need to adhere to the
JSON schema, using a number as a key in a Map is not permitted, and cyclic links
should be avoided.

```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
doc.toJSON(); // Get the JSON representation of the doc
```

## Is Loro Right for You?

### â Use Loro when you need:

- Real-time collaboration on documents
- Automatic conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Offline editing with later synchronization
- Complete edit history and time travel
- P2P synchronization capabilities

### â ï¸ Consider alternatives when:

- Your application requires strong consistency
- Your data isn't JSON-like (e.g., large binary/media streaming)
- Simple clientâserver sync is sufficient (e.g., basic WebSockets)
- Your application is sensitive to bundle size (Loro WASM binary ~970KB gzipped)

description: "Understanding cursor and stable position systems in Loro for maintaining accurate positions across concurrent edits"

# Cursor and Stable Positions

## Quick Reference

**Cursors** maintain stable positions across concurrent edits by anchoring to operation IDs instead of indices. Essential for collaborative editing features like collaborative cursors and persistent annotations.

## How It Works

Cursors anchor to operation IDs and ContainerIDs, not indices:

```
Text:    H e l l o   W o r l d
Op IDs:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B
Cursor:  References ID 5 (after 'o')

After concurrent insert at start:
Text:    N e w   H e l l o   W o r l d
Op IDs:  C D E F 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B
Cursor:  Still references ID 5 - position automatically adjusted
```

## Side Parameter

- **`Side.Before` (-1)**: Stay before the target
- **`Side.Middle` (0)**: On the target (default)
- **`Side.After` (1)**: Stay after the target

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "ABC");

const cursor = text.getCursor(1, -1); // Before 'B'
text.insert(1, "X"); // Insert at cursor
// Result: "AXBC", cursor still before 'B'
const pos = doc.getCursorPos(cursor!);
console.log(pos); // { offset: 2, side: Side.Before }
```

## Common Use Cases

### Text Selections
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello World");

// Selection range
const start = text.getCursor(0, -1);  // Anchor
const end = text.getCursor(5, 1);     // Head
```

### List Positions
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const list = doc.getList("items");
list.insert(0, ["a", "b", "c"]);

const cursor = list.getCursor(0, 1); // After "a"
list.insert(0, "new"); // Cursor adjusts automatically
```

# When Not to Use CRDTs

CRDTs shine for collaborative editing and offline-friendly applications.
But they are not a universal replacement for coordination, transactions,
or authorization. Use this guide to recognize when CRDTs are a poor fit and what to use instead.

## Quick Reference

CRDTs merge; they do not reject. This clashes with requirements that demand global agreement at the time of the action:
- **Hard invariants**: Must never be violated (e.g., balance â¥ 0)
- **Exclusive ownership**: Only one winner per slot/resource

## Why CRDTs fall short here

- Merging is monotonic: remote edits cannot be ârolled backâ on arrival
- No locks or transactions across replicas
- Check-then-set across peers needs coordination, not just convergence

## Common problem scenarios

### 1) Exclusive resource management

Multiple users book the same room/time concurrently.

```ts no_run
// With a CRDT-only model both intents exist after merge
// The app must pick a winner out-of-band
book("A101@2pm", { by: "A" })
book("A101@2pm", { by: "B" })
// After sync: both entries are present â invariant violated without coordination
```

Use instead:
- Transactional authority (central server or database)
- Distributed consensus (Raft/Paxos) for ownership
- Hybrid: CRDT for UI drafts, authoritative booking via server

### 2) Financial transactions

Two withdrawals race on a $100 account.

```ts no_run
// Each client applies its own withdrawal locally
withdraw(60) // A
withdraw(60) // B
// After merge, naive addition overdrafts without an authority
```

Use instead:
- ACID transactions on an authoritative store
- Command validation with a single writer per account
- Event-sourced ledger with server-side checks

### Other cases to avoid CRDT-as-the-only-source

- Uniqueness constraints (usernames, slugs, one primary per group)
- Authorization decisions that must be enforced at write time
- Global invariants (referential integrity, cross-document totals)

## When CRDTs work well

CRDTs excel when merged results are meaningful and temporary inconsistency is acceptable:

- â Collaborative text, lists, maps, rich presence
- â Comments, reactions, drafts, annotations
- â Offline edits where convergence is enough



# FILE: pages/docs/concepts/import_status.mdx

# Import Status

## Quick Reference

**Import status** tells you what operations were applied and what's pending due to missing dependencies. Essential for handling out-of-order updates in distributed systems.

## Status Structure

```ts twoslash
interface ImportStatus {
  success: PeerVersionRange;  // What was applied
  pending?: PeerVersionRange; // What needs dependencies
}

interface PeerVersionRange {
  [peerId: `${number}`]: {
    start: number; // Inclusive
    end: number;   // Exclusive (e.g., 0-50 = ops 0-49)
  };
}
```


## Pending Operations

Operations become pending when they depend on missing operations (causal dependencies).

### Common Scenario: Out-of-Order Delivery

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// Peer A creates ops 0-4, then 5-10
const peerA = new LoroDoc();
peerA.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const update1 = peerA.export({ mode: "update" });

peerA.getText("text").insert(5, " World");
const update2 = peerA.export({ mode: "update", from: peerA.version() });

// If update2 arrives first:
const status = doc.import(update2);
console.log(status.pending); // Ops 10-19 pending, need 0-9

// Import missing dependencies:
doc.import(update1); // Both updates now applied
```

## Handling Pending Operations

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, VersionVector } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
async function handleImport(
  doc: LoroDoc,
  update: Uint8Array,
  fetchMissing: (from: VersionVector) => Promise<Uint8Array>
) {
  const status = doc.import(update);

  if (status.pending) {
    const missing = await fetchMissing(doc.version());
    doc.import(missing);
  }
}
```


## Best Practices

### Always Check Status

```ts twoslash no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const update = new Uint8Array();
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const status = doc.import(update);
if (status.pending) {
  console.warn("Operations pending:", status.pending);
  // Fetch missing updates
}
```

### Use Batch Import
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const updates: Uint8Array[] = [
  //...
];
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const batchStatus = doc.importBatch(updates);
// Single status check for all updates
```

keywords: "frontiers, version, compact representation, DAG, CRDT"
description: "Understanding Frontiers in Loro - a compact way to represent document versions"
---

# Frontiers

Frontiers are a compact way to represent document versions in Loro by identifying the "frontier" operations - the most recent operations that aren't followed by any other operations.

## What are Frontiers?

Think of Frontiers as **bookmarks in your document's history**. Instead of listing every change made by every collaborator (like Version Vectors do), Frontiers only point to the boundary operations that implicitly include all their ancestors through causal relationships.

## Basic Usage

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("content");
text.insert(0, "Hello World");

// Get current frontiers (usually 1-2 elements)
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
console.log(frontiers); // [{ peer: "...", counter: 0 }]

// Use frontiers for checkpoints
const checkpoint = doc.frontiers();
text.insert(5, " Beautiful");

// Restore to checkpoint
doc.checkout(checkpoint);
console.log(text.toString()); // Back to "Hello World"
```

## When to Use Frontiers

Frontiers are ideal for:

1. **Creating checkpoints** - Mark specific points in document history
2. **Time travel** - Navigate to exact operation points efficiently
3. **Storage optimization** - Remain compact even with many collaborators (usually 1-2 elements vs N entries in Version Vector)
4. **Recording milestones** - Save important document states

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Frontiers | Version Vectors |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Size** | 1-2 elements typically | Grows with peer count |
| **Use Case** | Checkpoints, time travel | Synchronization, diffing |
| **Storage** | Very compact | Larger with many peers |
| **Unknown ops** | Cannot determine included ops | Can determine all included ops |

## Practical Example

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("content");
const checkpoints = new Map();

// Save checkpoint with frontiers
text.insert(0, "Draft version");
checkpoints.set("draft", doc.frontiers());

// Make changes
text.delete(0, 5);
text.insert(0, "Final");
checkpoints.set("final", doc.frontiers());

// Restore to any checkpoint
doc.checkout(checkpoints.get("draft"));
console.log(text.toString()); // "Draft version"
```

## Important Limitation

Frontiers have a key limitation when dealing with unknown operations:
- When you have a Frontier pointing to operations you don't know about, you cannot determine the complete set of operation IDs included in that version
- Version Vectors don't have this limitation - they explicitly list all peers and their operation counts, so you always know exactly which operations are included

**Example**:
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

// If you receive a frontier [{ peer: "unknown-peer", counter: 42 }]
// Without having the operations from "unknown-peer":
// - Frontiers: Cannot tell which specific operations are included
// - Version Vector: Would show { "unknown-peer": 43 }, clearly indicating ops 0-42

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
// Frontiers are compact but require operation history for full information
```

This limitation is why Frontiers are best for scenarios where you have access to the operation history (like checkpoints in a local document), while Version Vectors are preferred for synchronization between peers who may not share complete history.

## Conversion with Version Vectors

Loro allows seamless conversion between representations:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
const vv = doc.frontiersToVV(frontiers);        // Convert to Version Vector
const backToFrontiers = doc.vvToFrontiers(vv);  // Convert back
```

description: "Comprehensive guide to Event Graph Walker (Eg-Walker), a revolutionary CRDT algorithm that enables simpler metadata and better performance in Loro"

# Event Graph Walker (Eg-Walker)

Event Graph Walker (Eg-Walker) is a revolutionary CRDT algorithm that fundamentally changes how collaborative editing systems handle concurrent operations. Instead of storing complex CRDT metadata, Eg-Walker enables the use of simple indices by efficiently replaying relevant history when needed.

> **Important Note**: Loro is not a strict implementation of Event Graph Walker. Rather, Loro is heavily inspired by Eg-Walker's design philosophy and incorporates its key insights to achieve similar properties - particularly the ability to use simple indices instead of complex CRDT metadata, and the efficient replay mechanism for handling concurrent operations.

## The Problem: Complex CRDT Metadata

Traditional CRDTs require extensive metadata to maintain consistency across distributed systems:

- **RGA algorithm**: Requires operation ID and Lamport timestamp of the left neighbor
- **Yjs/Fugue**: Needs operation IDs of both left and right neighbors
- **Storage overhead**: Each operation carries significant metadata for position tracking
- **Tombstone accumulation**: Deleted content must be retained indefinitely

This metadata complexity leads to:
- Increased storage requirements
- Slower performance as documents grow
- Complex garbage collection challenges
- Higher network bandwidth usage

## The Innovation: Simple Indices with Smart Replay

Eg-Walker introduces a paradigm shift: **record simple indices, replay when needed**.

import { ReactPlayer } from "../../../components/video";

<ReactPlayer
  url="/static/REG.mp4"
  width={512}
  style={{maxWidth: "calc(100vw - 40px)"}}
  height={512}
  muted={true}
  loop={true}
  controls={true}
  playing={true}
/>

### Core Concept

Instead of storing complex position descriptors, Eg-Walker:
1. Records operations with **simple indices** at the time of execution
2. Maintains a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the edit history
3. **Replays relevant portions** of history when merging concurrent changes
4. Reconstructs the exact CRDT state only when needed

## How It Works

### The Event Graph

In collaborative editing, parallel edits naturally form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), similar to Git's history:

```
    A --- B --- C     (User 1)
   /             \
Root              Merge
   \             /
    D --- E --- F     (User 2)
```

Each node represents an operation, and edges represent causal dependencies.

### The Algorithm

#### 1. **Local Operations: Direct and Fast**

When a user makes a local edit:
- Record the operation with its **current index position**
- No complex metadata calculation needed
- Immediate application to the document

Example:
```javascript no_run
// Traditional CRDT (e.g., RGA)
insert({
  char: 'a',
  leftId: 'op-123',
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  siteId: 'user-1'
})

// With Eg-Walker
insert({
  char: 'a',
  index: 5  // Simple index!
})
```

#### 2. **Merging Remote Operations: Smart Replay**

When receiving remote operations:

1. **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** between local and remote versions
2. **Replay operations** from the LCA to both versions
3. **Construct temporary CRDT state** to calculate effects
4. **Apply the merged result**

The key insight: You only replay the **divergent portion** of history, not the entire document.

#### 3. **Index Transformation**

Consider this scenario:
- You highlight text from index 10 to 20
- Concurrently, someone inserts 5 characters at index 3
- Your highlight should shift to indices 15 to 25

Eg-Walker handles this by:
1. Identifying concurrent operations through the event graph
2. Replaying operations in causal order
3. Transforming indices based on the replay sequence

## Performance Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Storage**

| Aspect | Traditional CRDT | Eg-Walker |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Tombstone storage | Permanent | Can be garbage collected |
| Document growth | Linear with all operations | Linear with active operations |

### 2. **Faster Local Updates**

- **No metadata computation**: Direct index-based operations
- **No tombstone traversal**: Clean document state
- **Predictable performance**: O(1) or O(logN) for most local operations

### 3. **Efficient Synchronization**

- **Minimal replay**: Only divergent history portions
- **Bounded computation**: Proportional to concurrent edits, not document size
- **Smart caching**: Reuse computed states when possible

## Implementation in Loro

While Loro is not a pure Eg-Walker implementation, it draws heavily from Eg-Walker's innovations to achieve similar benefits. Loro implements Fugue (a modern CRDT algorithm) with Eg-Walker-inspired optimizations:

- **Fugue's correctness guarantees** for text editing
- **Eg-Walker-inspired efficiency** in storage and computation
- **Simple index-based operations** at the API level
- **Smart replay mechanisms** for merging concurrent changes

This hybrid approach provides:
```javascript no_run
// Simple API with powerful internals
const doc = new Loro();
const text = doc.getText("content");

// Just use indices - Eg-Walker handles the complexity
text.insert(5, "Hello");
text.delete(2, 3);

// Efficient merging happens automatically
doc.import(remoteUpdate);
```

## Garbage Collection Revolution

One of Eg-Walker's most significant advantages is **safe garbage collection**:

### Traditional CRDTs
- Must keep all tombstones forever
- Document size grows unbounded
- Complex protocols for coordinated cleanup

### With Eg-Walker
- Operations synchronized across all endpoints can be **safely removed**
- No new operations will be concurrent with fully-synchronized ones
- Document size remains proportional to **active content**

## Research Foundation

Eg-Walker is based on rigorous academic research:

> [Collaborative Text Editing with Eg-walker: Better, Faster, Smaller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14252)
> By: Joseph Gentle, Martin Kleppmann

The algorithm has been proven to:
- Maintain strong eventual consistency
- Preserve all CRDT correctness properties
- Significantly reduce computational and storage overhead

keywords: "attached, detached, state, container, document, version control"
description: "Understanding attached and detached states in Loro - two different but related concepts"
---

# Attached vs Detached States

## Quick Reference

Loro uses "attached/detached" in two distinct contexts:

1. **Document States** - Version synchronization (latest vs historical)
2. **Container States** - Document membership (belongs to doc vs standalone)

â ï¸ These are independent concepts - a container can be attached to a detached document.

## Document States

### Attached (Default)
- Synchronized with latest OpLog version
- Normal editing mode
- All operations applied immediately

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
console.log(doc.isDetached()); // false - normal state
```

### Detached (Time Travel)
- Viewing historical version
- Editing disabled by default
- OpLog has newer operations not shown

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "v1");
const v1 = doc.frontiers();
doc.getText("text").insert(2, " -> v2");

// Time travel to v1
doc.checkout(v1);
console.log(doc.isDetached()); // true
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "v1"
```


## Container States

### Detached (Standalone)
- Created with constructors (`new LoroMap()`)
- Not part of any document
- No valid ContainerID
- Used as templates

```ts twoslash
import { LoroMap } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const map = new LoroMap();
console.log(map.isAttached()); // false
```

### Attached (Document Member)
- Part of document hierarchy
- Has ContainerID
- Changes tracked in document

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("data"); // Attached

// Adding detached container returns attached version
const detached = new LoroText();
const attached = map.setContainer("text", detached);
console.log(detached.isAttached()); // false - original unchanged
console.log(attached.isAttached()); // true - new attached copy
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Document Attached/Detached | Container Attached/Detached |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Version control | Document membership |
| **When** | Time travel, branching | Adding to document |
| **Independence** | N/A | Independent from doc state |
| **Editing** | Restricted when detached | Always allowed |

## Common Use Cases

### Time Travel
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const v1 = doc.frontiers();
// ... more edits ...
doc.checkout(v1); // View old version
doc.attach(); // Return to latest
```

### Container Templates
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroMap } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const template = new LoroMap();
template.set("type", "task");

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const list = doc.getList("tasks");
// Reuse template multiple times
list.insertContainer(0, template);
list.insertContainer(1, template);
```

# What are CRDTs

CRDT (conflict-free replicated data type) is a data structure that can be
replicated across multiple computers in a network, where replicas can be updated
independently and in parallel, without the need for coordination between
replicas, and with a guarantee that no conflicts will occur.

CRDT is often used in collaborative software, such as scenarios where multiple
users need to work together to edit/read a shared document, database, or state.
It can be used in database software, text editing software, chat software, etc.

# What problems does CRDT solve?

For example, a scenario where multiple users edit the same document online at
the same time.

This scenario requires that each user sees the same content, even after
concurrent edits by different users (e.g. two users changing the title at the
same time), which is known as **consistency**. (To be precise, CRDT satisfies
the eventual consistency, see below for more details)

Users can use CRDT even when they are offline. They can be back on sync with
others the network is restored. It also supports collaboratively editing with
other users via P2P. It is known as **partitioning fault tolerance**. This
allows CRDT to support **decentralized** applications very well: synchronization
can be done even without a centralized server.

# The Emergence of CRDTs

The formal concept of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) was first
introduced in Marc Shapiro's 2011 paper,
[Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types](https://inria.hal.science/hal-00932836/file/CRDTs_SSS-2011.pdf).
However, it can be argued that the groundwork for CRDTs was laid earlier, in the
2006 study [Woot](https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1180875.1180916): An Algorithm for
Collaborative Real-time Editing. The primary motivation behind developing CRDTs
was to address the challenges associated with designing conflict resolution
mechanisms for eventual consistency. Prior to the introduction of CRDTs,
literature on the subject offered limited guidance, and ad hoc solutions were
often prone to errors. Consequently, Shapiro's paper presented a simple,
theoretically sound approach to achieving eventual consistency through the use
of CRDTs.

(PS: Marc Shapiro actually wrote a paper
[Designing a commutative replicated data type](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00177693v2/document)
in 2007. In 2011, he reworded commutative into conflict-free in 2011, expanding
the definition of commutative to include state-based CRDT)

According to [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem), it is
impossible for a distributed computing system to perfectly satisfy the following
three points at the same time.

- _Consistency_: each read receives the result of the most recent write or
  reports an error; it behaves as if it is accessing the same piece of data
- _Availability_: every request gets a non-error response - but there is no
  guarantee that the data fetched is up-to-date
- _Partition tolerance_: the ability of a distributed system to continue
  functioning properly even when communication between its different components
  is lost or delayed, resulting in a partition or network failure.

If the system cannot achieve data consistency within the time limit, it means
that partitioning has occurred and a choice must be made between C and A for the
current operation, so "perfect consistency" is in conflict with "perfect
availability".

CRDTs do not provide "perfect consistency", but
Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC). This
means that site A may not immediately reflect the state changes from site B, but
when A and B synchronize their messages they both regain consistency and do not
need to resolve potential conflicts (CRDT mathematically prevents conflicts from
occurring). _Strong Eventual Consistency_ does not conflict with _Availability_
and _Partition Tolerance_. CRDTs provide a good CAP tradeoff.

![CPA](./crdt-images/a4858e2a50bc1a2d79722060156e89b0cac5815cf25e8c67e409aa0926280cef.png)
_CRDT satisfies A + P + Eventual Consistency; a good tradeoff under CAP_

(PS: In 2012, Eric Brewer, author of the CAP theorem, wrote an article
[CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/),
explaining that the description of the "two out of three CAP features" is
actually misleading, and that the CAP actually prohibits perfect availability
and consistency in a very small part of the design space, i.e., in the presence
of partitions; in fact, the design of the tradeoff between C and A is very
flexible. A good example is CRDT.)

# A simple CRDT case

We can use a few simple examples to get a general idea of how CRDTs achieve
**Strong Eventual Consistency**.

> **Grow-only Counter**

How can we count the number of times something happens in a distributed system
without locking?

<Image src="/crdt-G-Counter.gif" alt="G-Counter" width="400" height="400" />

- Let each copy increments only its own counter => no locking synchronization &
  no conflicts
- Each copy keeps the count values of all other copies at the same time
- Number of occurrences = sum of count values of all copies
- Since each copy only updates its own count and does not conflict with other
  counters, this type satisfies consistency after message synchronization

> **Grow-only Set**

<Image src="/crdt-G-Set.gif" alt="G-Set" width="400" height="400" />

- The elements in a Grow-only Set can only be increased and not decreased
- To merge two such states, you only need to do a merge set
- This type satisfies consistency after message synchronization because there
  are no conflicting operations since the elements only grow and do not
  decrease.

Both of these methods are CRDTs, and they both satisfy the following properties

- They can both be updated independently and concurrently, without coordination
  (locking) between replicas
- There is no possibility of conflict between multiple updates
- Final consistency can always be guaranteed

# Introduction to the Principle

There are two types of CRDTs: Op-based CRDTs and State-based CRDTs. This article
focuses on the concept of Op-based CRDTs.

Op-based CRDTs operate on the principle that if two users perform identical
sequences of operations, the final state of the document should also be
identical. To achieve this, each user saves all the operations performed on the
data (Operations) and synchronizes these Operations with other users to ensure a
consistent final state. A critical challenge in this approach is ensuring the
order of Operations remains consistent, especially when parallel modification
operations occur. To address this, Op-based CRDTs require that all possible
parallel Operations be commutative, satisfying the final consistency
requirement.

# Comparison of CRDT and OT

Both CRDT and [Operation Transformation(OT)][ot] can be used in online
collaborative applications, with the following differences

# FILE: pages/docs/concepts/container.mdx

# Container

Containers are the fundamental building blocks in Loro for organizing and structuring collaborative data. They provide typed data structures that automatically merge when concurrent edits occur.

## Container Types

Loro provides several container types, each optimized for different use cases:

- **LoroMap**: Key-value pairs with Last-Write-Wins semantics
- **LoroList**: Ordered sequences that merge concurrent insertions
- **LoroText**: Text with character-level merging and rich text support
- **LoroTree**: Hierarchical tree structures with move operations
- **LoroMovableList**: Lists with reordering capabilities
- **LoroCounter**: Numerical values with increment/decrement operations

## Container States: Attached vs Detached

Containers in Loro exist in two distinct states that affect their behavior and identity.

### Detached Containers

A container is **detached** when created directly using constructors:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroMap, LoroText, LoroList } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
// These containers are all detached
const map = new LoroMap();
const text = new LoroText();
const list = new LoroList();
```

Characteristics of detached containers:
- Not yet part of any document
- Have a default placeholder ContainerID
- Can be used as templates or temporary data structures
- Will get a proper ContainerID when inserted into a document

### Attached Containers

A container becomes **attached** when it's part of a document hierarchy:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroMap, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// Root containers are immediately attached
const rootMap = doc.getMap("myMap");
const rootText = doc.getText("myText");

// Child containers: the returned value is attached
const detachedChild = new LoroText();
const attachedChild = rootMap.setContainer("child", detachedChild);
// Note: detachedChild remains detached
// attachedChild is the attached version with proper ContainerID
```

Characteristics of attached containers:
- Belong to a specific document
- Have a proper ContainerID that uniquely identifies them
- Changes are tracked in the document's history
- Can be synchronized across peers

## Container IDs

Every attached container has a unique ContainerID that identifies it within the distributed system. The ID generation depends on the container type:

- **Root containers**: ID derived from their name (e.g., "myMap" in `doc.getMap("myMap")`)
- **Child containers**: ID based on the operation that created them (OpID)

This deterministic ID generation ensures that:
- The same container can be identified across all peers
- Container IDs are not random but contextually determined
- A detached container cannot have its final ID until insertion

## Working with Containers

### Creating Root Containers

Root containers are created through the document API and are immediately attached:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// These methods create or get root containers
const map = doc.getMap("settings");
const text = doc.getText("content");
const list = doc.getList("items");
const tree = doc.getTree("hierarchy");
```

### Nesting Containers

Containers can be nested to create complex data structures:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroMap, LoroList, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const rootMap = doc.getMap("root");

// Method 1: Using setContainer (returns attached container)
const childText = rootMap.setContainer("description", new LoroText());

// Method 2: Using insertContainer for lists
const list = doc.getList("items");
const childMap = list.insertContainer(0, new LoroMap());
```

## Container Overwrites

When initializing child containers in parallel, overwrites can occur instead of
automatic merging. For example:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc, LoroText } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const a: string = "hello";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("map");

// Parallel initialization of child containers
const docB = doc.fork();
const textA = doc.getMap("map").setContainer("text", new LoroText());
textA.insert(0, "A");
const textB = docB.getMap("map").setContainer("text", new LoroText());
textB.insert(0, "B");

doc.import(docB.export({ mode: "update" }));
// Result: Either { "meta": { "text": "A" } } or { "meta": { "text": "B" } }
```

This behavior poses a significant risk of data loss if the editing history is
not preserved. Even when the complete history is available and allows for data
recovery, the recovery process can be complex.

<aside>
By default, Loro and Automerge preserve the whole editing history in a directed
acyclic graph like Git.
</aside>

When a container holds substantial data or serves as the primary storage for
document content, overwriting it can lead to the unintended hiding/loss of
critical information. For this reason, it is essential to implement careful and
systematic container initialization practices to prevent such issues.

### Best Practices

1. When containers might be initialized concurrently, prefer initializing them
   at the root level rather than as nested containers

2. When using map containers:
   - If possible, initialize all child containers during the map container's
     initialization
   - Avoid concurrent creation of child containers with the same key in the map
     container to prevent overwrites

The overwrite behavior occurs because parallel creation of child containers
results in different container IDs, preventing automatic merging of their
contents.

# FILE: pages/docs/concepts/shallow_snapshots.mdx

# Shallow Snapshots

## Quick Reference

**Shallow snapshots** are like Git's shallow clone - maintain current state while removing old history. Essential for privacy compliance, storage optimization, and performance.


## Basic Usage

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ... extensive editing history ...

// Regular snapshot - full history
const full = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

// Shallow snapshot - trimmed history
const shallow = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.frontiers(),
});

// Typically 70-90% smaller
console.log(`Size reduction: ${100 - (shallow.length / full.length * 100)}%`);
```

## Content Redaction

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("content");

// Sensitive data added
text.insert(0, "SSN: 123-45-6789. ");
text.insert(18, "Public info.");

// Redact sensitive part
text.delete(0, 18);

// Create clean snapshot
const redacted = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.frontiers(),
});
// Sensitive data permanently removed from history
```

## Synchronization Limitations

â ï¸ **Important**: Peers can only sync if they have versions after the shallow snapshot point.


## Common Patterns

### Archive and Trim
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
async function archiveAndTrim(doc: LoroDoc) {
  // 1. Archive full history
  const full = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
  await saveToArchive(full);

  // 2. Create shallow for active use
  const shallow = doc.export({
    mode: "shallow-snapshot",
    frontiers: doc.frontiers(),
  });

  return shallow;
}

async function saveToArchive(data: Uint8Array) {
  // Save to cold storage
}
```

### Privacy-Aware Design
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
class PrivacyDoc {
  constructor(private doc: LoroDoc) {}

  async redactSensitive() {
    // Delete sensitive content
    this.doc.getText("private").delete(0, this.doc.getText("private").length);

    // Create clean snapshot
    return this.doc.export({
      mode: "shallow-snapshot",
      frontiers: this.doc.frontiers(),
    });
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Coordinate before trimming**: Ensure all peers synchronized
- **Archive before deletion**: Keep full history backup if needed

description: "Understanding Loro's architectural separation of OpLog and DocState for efficient CRDT operations and version control"
---

# OpLog and DocState

## Quick Reference

- **OpLog** = Sequence of events/operations that compose the document history
- **DocState** = Current materialized state of the document

This separation enables time travel, efficient sync, and flexible storage strategies.

## Key Concepts

**OpLog (Operation Log)**
- Append-only sequence of operations
- Causal relationships and metadata

**DocState (Document State)**
- Current materialized view of the document
- Actual data structures and values
- What your app reads and displays

## Benefits

- **Memory efficiency**: Load OpLog without state (relay servers)
- **Time travel**: Navigate history without losing the log
- **Fast startup**: Load state via snapshots, fetch history later
- **Flexible storage**: Store separately for optimization

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// Edit updates both
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
console.log(doc.oplogVersion());  // Latest known version
console.log(doc.version());       // The version of the current state of the document
// If the document is attached, they are the same.
```

## Time Travel & Detachment

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "v1");
const v1 = doc.frontiers();

doc.getText("text").insert(2, " -> v2");

// Checkout old version - DocState diverges from OpLog
doc.checkout(v1);
console.log(doc.version());       // v1 state
console.log(doc.oplogVersion());  // Still has v2
console.log(doc.isDetached());    // true

// Return to latest
doc.attach();
```

**Detached state**: DocState shows old version while OpLog has all operations. Editing disabled by default.


## Export Strategies

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ---cut---
// Update: OpLog only (sync)
const update = doc.export({ mode: "update" });

// Snapshot: OpLog + DocState (persistence)
const snapshot = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

// Shallow: Minimal OpLog + DocState (fast startup)
const shallow = doc.export({ mode: "shallow-snapshot", frontiers: doc.frontiers() });
```

## Common Patterns

### Relay Server (OpLog Only)
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
class RelayServer {
  private doc: LoroDoc;
  constructor() {
    this.doc = new LoroDoc();
    this.doc.detach(); // Never materialize state
  }

  handleUpdate(update: Uint8Array) {
    this.doc.import(update);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Export modes**: Updates for sync, snapshots for persistence, shallow for startup
- **Optimize by use case**:
  - Editors: Both in memory
  - Relays: OpLog only

# FILE: pages/docs/concepts/operations_changes.mdx

# Operations and Changes

## Quick Reference

**Operations** are atomic edits. **Changes** are logical groups of operations with metadata. Understanding these helps optimize sync and performance.

## Key Concepts

### Operations
- Atomic units of change (insert a single Unicode character, delete a single character, insert an new entry to a map, etc.)
- Automatically merged internally for efficiency
- Each has unique ID: `(peerId, counter)`

### Changes
- Groups of consecutive operations
- Include metadata (timestamp, dependencies, peer ID)
- Created by `commit()` or auto-commit

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

text.insert(0, "Hello");     // Operation
text.insert(5, " World");    // Operation
doc.commit();                // Groups into one Change
```

## Automatic Merging

Consecutive operations from same peer merge into one Change:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

text.insert(0, "abc");
doc.commit();  // Change #1

text.insert(3, "def");
doc.commit();  // Merges with #1 (same peer, consecutive)
```

## When New Changes Are Created

1. **Cross-peer dependencies**: After importing remote operations
2. **Time separation**: When timestamps enabled and > the merge interval (default 1000s) between commits
3. **Different commit messages**:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "v1");
doc.commit(); // Change #1

// Import from another peer
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.getText("text").insert(0, "v1");
const remote = doc2.export({ mode: "update" });
doc.import(remote);

// Next commit creates new Change (dependency on remote)
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "v2");
doc.commit(); // Change #2
```


## Impact on Sync & Storage

- **History**: Changes track logical units of work
- **Sync**: Dependencies ensure causal ordering
- **Storage**: Auto-merging reduces metadata overhead

# PeerID Management

## Quick Reference

**Peer IDs** are unique identifiers for each editing session in Loro's distributed system. They ensure operation uniqueness without coordination between peers.

## Key Concepts

- **Peer ID**: A 64-bit unique identifier for each client/session
- **Operation ID**: Combination of `(peerId, counter)` that uniquely identifies each operation
- **Counter**: Monotonically increasing number starting at 0 for each peer

```ts
interface OpId {
  peerId: `${number}`;  // Unique peer identifier. It's string because 64bit integers are not supported in JS.
  counter: number;      // Monotonically increasing counter
}
```

## Peer ID Assignment

### Automatic (Default)

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc(); // Gets a random peer ID
// Safe, no coordination needed
```

**Note**: New peer ID generated for each `LoroDoc` instance, even when loading same document.

### Manual

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("123123123");  // You can only set 64 bit integers as peer IDs
```

â ï¸ **Warning**: Manual assignment requires careful conflict avoidance.

## Counter System

Each peer maintains a monotonic counter starting at 0:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");
const text = doc.getText("text");

text.insert(0, "H");    // Operation ("1", 0)
text.insert(1, "i!");    // Operation ("1", 1) and Operation ("1", 2) are created
console.log(doc.version()); // { "1": 2 }
```

**Properties**: Monotonic, continuous, per-peer, persistent.

## Common Pitfalls

â **Never**:
- Use user IDs as peer IDs, because an user can have multiple devices
- Use fixed IDs
- Reuse IDs without proper management

# How to Choose the Right CRDT Types

Choosing the right CRDT type means understanding their potential behavior in concurrent editing situations and judging whether such behavior is acceptable for your application.

For text, you can choose to represent it directly as a Value on a Map (where the Value can be a string type), or you can choose to use a Text CRDT. For the former, each operation completely overwrites the previous one, so if A and B make concurrent modifications, only one of their edits will remain in the end. For the latter, the CRDT will retain all concurrent insertions by both people, and concurrent deletions are combined to complete the deletion. For most text box edits, you might prefer the latter. But for something like editing a link, you might want to use the former.

For Lists, concurrently removing the same element and inserting a single element creates a new element, differentiating from the semantics of Set on a Map (we may consider providing a list set method in the future). For representing coordinates, it's better to use a Map rather than a List. If you represent coordinates as [x, y], and the A client updates the y coordinate by deleting the y element and reinserting a new y_a, and the B client also deletes y and inserts y_b, then after merging, the array will become [x, y_a, y_b], which does not conform to the user's schema. Using a Map can prevent this problem.

# Version Vector

Version Vectors are a fundamental concept in distributed systems that track the complete state of all peers by recording how many operations each peer has contributed.

## What is a Version Vector?

A Version Vector is a map from peer IDs to operation counters, explicitly listing every peer and their operation count. It provides a complete picture of which operations are included in a version.

**Example**: `{ "peer-A": 5, "peer-B": 3 }` means this version includes operations 0-4 from peer A and operations 0-2 from peer B.

## Key Characteristics

- **Complete information**: Explicitly lists all peers and their operation counts
- **Grows with peer count**: Size increases as more peers join
- **No dependency on history**: Can determine included operations without accessing the operation log
- **Enables version comparison**: Can easily check if one version includes another

## Basic Usage

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");
const text = doc.getText("content");
text.insert(0, "Hello");

// Get version vector
const vv = doc.version();
console.log(vv.toJSON()); // Map { "1" => 1 }
```

## When to Use Version Vectors

Version Vectors are ideal for:

1. **Synchronization protocols** - Determine what updates to send between peers
2. **Network communication** - Self-contained version information
3. **Distributed systems** - Track state across multiple nodes

## Comparison with Frontiers

| Aspect | Version Vectors | Frontiers |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Size** | O(number of peers) | O(1-2) typically |
| **Information** | Complete peer states | Boundary operations only |
| **Use Case** | Synchronization | Checkpoints |
| **History Required** | No | Yes, for full information |

## Conversion with Frontiers

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const vv = doc.version();
const frontiers = doc.vvToFrontiers(vv);     // Convert to Frontiers
const backToVV = doc.frontiersToVV(frontiers); // Convert back
```

# FILE: pages/docs/concepts/transaction_model.mdx

# Transaction Model

## Quick Reference

**Loro transactions are NOT database ACID transactions.** They are operation bundling mechanisms for event emission.

## Key Concepts

- **Purpose**: Bundle related operations and control event emission
- **No rollback**: Failed operations don't undo previous ones
- **Event batching**: Single event for all operations in transaction
- **History grouping**: Operations stay together for undo/redo

## Basic Usage

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// Without transaction - multiple events
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello");
doc.commit(); // Event emitted
text.insert(5, " World");
doc.commit(); // Another event
```

## How Transactions Work

### Pending Operations
Local operations are **pending** by default and won't emit events until committed:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

// Operation is pending, no event emitted yet
text.insert(0, "Hello");

// Explicit commit triggers event emission
doc.commit();
```

### Implicit Commits
Certain operations trigger implicit commits automatically:

```ts twoslash no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const update = new Uint8Array();
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

text.insert(0, "Hello"); // Pending operation

// These operations trigger implicit commit:
doc.import(update); // Implicit commit before import
// or
doc.checkout(doc.frontiers()); // Implicit commit before checkout
// or
doc.export({ mode: "update" }); // Implicit commit before export
```

### Transaction Guarantees

- All operations share the same timestamp (if enabled)
- Operations grouped in a single Change
- One event emitted after transaction completes
- Operations committed together at transaction end
- Before committing, the local edits are not synced to other peers

## Overview

Loro is a powerful Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) library that enables real-time collaboration. If CRDTs are new to you, start with [What are CRDTs](/docs/concepts/crdt) for a gentle intro. This API reference provides comprehensive documentation for all classes, methods, and types available in the JavaScript/TypeScript binding.

Note: Under the hood, Loro combines a Fugue-based CRDT core with Eg-walker-inspired techniques that use simple index operations and replay only the divergent history when merging. This yields fast local edits, efficient merges, and low overhead without permanent tombstones. See the primer [Event Graph Walker (Eg-walker)](/docs/advanced/event_graph_walker) and performance notes in the v1.0 blog (import/export speedups, shallow snapshots): https://loro.dev/blog/v1.0

## Pitfalls & Best Practices

**Peer ID Management**

- **Never share PeerIDs** between concurrent sessions (tabs/devices) - causes document divergence
- Use random PeerIDs (default) unless you have strict single-ownership locking
- Don't assign fixed PeerIDs to users or devices

**UTF-16 Text Encoding**

- All text operations use UTF-16 indices by default in JS API
- Slicing in the middle of multi-unit codepoints corrupts them
- Use `insertUtf8()`/`deleteUtf8()` for UTF-8 systems

**Container Creation**

- Concurrent child container creation inside the same LoroMap at same key causes overwrites
- Initialize all child containers for a LoroMap upfront when possible
- Operations on the root containers will not override each other

**Events & Transactions**

- Events emit asynchronously after a microtask in JS API
- Import/export/checkout trigger automatic commits
- Loro transactions are NOT ACID - no rollback/isolation

**Version Control**

- After `checkout()`, document enters read-only "detached" mode, unless `setDetachedEditing(true)` is called
- [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers) can't determine complete operation sets without history

**Data Structure Choice**

- Use strings in Map for URLs/IDs (LWW), LoroText for collaborative editing

## Common Tasks & Examples

**Getting Started**

- **Create a document**: [`new LoroDoc()`](#LoroDoc.constructor) - Initialize a new collaborative document
- **Add containers**: [`getText`](#LoroDoc.getText), [`getList`](#LoroDoc.getList), [`getMap`](#LoroDoc.getMap), [`getTree`](#LoroDoc.getTree)
- **Listen to changes**: [`subscribe`](#LoroDoc.subscribe) - React to document modifications
- **Export/Import state**: [`export`](#LoroDoc.export) and [`import`](#LoroDoc.import) - Save and load documents

**Real-time Collaboration**

- **Sync between peers**: [`export`](#LoroDoc.export) with `mode: "update"` + [`import`](#LoroDoc.import)/[`importBatch`](#LoroDoc.importBatch) - Exchange incremental updates
- **Stream updates**: [`subscribeLocalUpdates`](#LoroDoc.subscribeLocalUpdates) - Send changes over WebSocket/WebRTC
- **Set unique peer ID**: [`setPeerId`](#LoroDoc.setPeerId) - Ensure each client has a unique identifier
- **Handle conflicts**: Automatic - All Loro data types are CRDTs that merge concurrent edits

**Rich Text Editing**

- **Create rich text**: [`getText`](#LoroDoc.getText) - Initialize a collaborative text container
- **Edit text**: [`insert`](#LoroText.insert), [`delete`](#LoroText.delete), [`applyDelta`](#LoroText.applyDelta)
- **Apply formatting**: [`mark`](#LoroText.mark) - Add bold, italic, links, custom styles
- **Track cursor positions**: [`getCursor`](#LoroText.getCursor) + [`getCursorPos`](#LoroDoc.getCursorPos) - Stable positions across edits
- **Configure styles**: [`configTextStyle`](#LoroDoc.configTextStyle) - Define expand behavior for marks

**Data Structures**

- **Ordered lists**: [`getList`](#LoroDoc.getList) - Arrays with [`push`](#LoroList.push), [`insert`](#LoroList.insert), [`delete`](#LoroList.delete)
- **Key-value maps**: [`getMap`](#LoroDoc.getMap) - Objects with [`set`](#LoroMap.set), [`get`](#LoroMap.get), [`delete`](#LoroMap.delete)
- **Hierarchical trees**: [`getTree`](#LoroDoc.getTree) - File systems, nested comments with [`createNode`](#LoroTree.createNode), [`move`](#LoroTree.move)
- **Reorderable lists**: [`getMovableList`](#LoroDoc.getMovableList) - Drag-and-drop with [`move`](#LoroMovableList.move), [`set`](#LoroMovableList.set)
- **Counters**: [`getCounter`](#LoroDoc.getCounter) - Distributed counters with [`increment`](#LoroCounter.increment)

**Ephemeral State & Presence**

- **User presence**: [`EphemeralStore`](#ephemeralstore) - Share cursor positions, selections, user status (not persisted)
- **Cursor syncing**: Use [`EphemeralStore.set`](#EphemeralStore.set) with cursor data from [`getCursor`](#LoroText.getCursor)
- **Live indicators**: Track who's online, typing indicators, mouse positions
- **Important**: EphemeralStore is a separate CRDT without history - perfect for temporary state that shouldn't persist

**Version Control & History**

- **Undo/redo**: [`UndoManager`](#undomanager) - Local undo of user's own edits
- **Time travel**: [`checkout`](#LoroDoc.checkout) to any [`frontiers`](#LoroDoc.frontiers) - Debug or review history
- **Version tracking**: [`version`](#LoroDoc.version), [`frontiers`](#LoroDoc.frontiers), [`versionVector`](#LoroDoc.versionVector)
- **Fork documents**: [`fork`](#LoroDoc.fork) or [`forkAt`](#LoroDoc.forkAt) - Create branches for experimentation
- **Merge branches**: [`import`](#LoroDoc.import) - Combine changes from forked documents

**Performance & Storage**

- **Incremental updates**: [`export`](#LoroDoc.export) from specific [`version`](#LoroDoc.version) - Send only changes
- **Compact history**: [`export`](#LoroDoc.export) with `mode: "snapshot"` - Full state with compressed history
- **Shallow snapshots**: [`export`](#LoroDoc.export) with `mode: "shallow-snapshot"` - State without partial history (see [Shallow Snapshots](/docs/concepts/shallow_snapshots))

## Basic Usage

```typescript twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello World");

// Subscribe to changes
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Document changed:", event);
});

// Export updates for synchronization
const updates = doc.export({ mode: "update" });
```

## LoroDoc

The `LoroDoc` class manages containers, sync, versions, and events.

**Constructor**

```typescript no_run
new LoroDoc()
```

Creates a new Loro document with a randomly generated peer ID.

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
```

**Static Methods**

<Method id="LoroDoc.fromSnapshot">
```typescript no_run
static fromSnapshot(snapshot: Uint8Array): LoroDoc
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Creates a new LoroDoc from a snapshot. This is useful for loading a document from a previously exported snapshot.

**Parameters:**
- `snapshot` - Binary snapshot data

**Returns:** A new LoroDoc instance

**Example:**
```ts no_run twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

// Assume we have a snapshot from a previous export
const prevDoc = new LoroDoc();
prevDoc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const snapshot: Uint8Array = prevDoc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

const doc = LoroDoc.fromSnapshot(snapshot);
```
</Indent>

**Properties**

<Method id="LoroDoc.peerId">
```typescript no_run
readonly peerId: bigint
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the peer ID of the current writer as a bigint.

**See Also:** [PeerID Management](/docs/concepts/peerid_management)

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const id = doc.peerId;
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.peerIdStr">
```typescript no_run
readonly peerIdStr: `${number}`
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the peer ID as a decimal string.

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const idStr = doc.peerIdStr;
```
</Indent>

### Configuration Methods

<Method id="LoroDoc.setPeerId">
```typescript no_run
setPeerId(peer: number | bigint | `${number}`): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Sets the peer ID for this document. It must be a number, a BigInt, or a decimal string that fits into an unsigned 64-bit integer.
See [PeerID Management](/docs/concepts/peerid_management) for why uniqueness matters in distributed systems.

**Parameters:**
- `peer` - Peer ID as number, bigint, or decimal string

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("42");
```

**â ï¸ Critical Pitfall:** Never let two parallel peers (e.g., multiple tabs/devices) share the same PeerID â it creates duplicate op IDs and causes document divergence. Common mistakes:
- Don't assign a fixed PeerId to a user (users have multiple devices)
- Don't assign a fixed PeerId to a device (multiple tabs can open the same document)
- If you must reuse PeerIDs, enforce single ownership with strict locking mechanisms
- Best practice: Use random IDs (default behavior) unless you have a strong reason not to

See [PeerID reuse](/docs/tutorial/tips) for safe reuse patterns.
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.setRecordTimestamp">
```typescript no_run
setRecordTimestamp(auto_record: boolean): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Configures whether to automatically record timestamps for changes. Timestamps use Unix time (seconds since epoch). Learn more about storing timestamps and typical use cases in [Storing Timestamps](/docs/advanced/timestamp).

**Parameters:**
- `auto_record` - Whether to automatically record timestamps

**â ï¸ Important:** This setting doesn't persist in exported Updates or Snapshots. You must reapply this configuration each time you initialize a document.

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setRecordTimestamp(true);
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.setChangeMergeInterval">
```typescript no_run
setChangeMergeInterval(interval: number): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Sets the interval in milliseconds for merging continuous local changes into a single change record. In Loro, multiple low-level operations are grouped into higher-level Changes for readability and syncing. See [Operations and Changes](/docs/concepts/operations_changes).

**Parameters:**
- `interval` - Merge interval in milliseconds

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setChangeMergeInterval(1000); // Merge changes within 1 second
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.configTextStyle">
```typescript no_run
configTextStyle(styles: StyleConfig): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Configures the behavior of text styles (marks) in rich text containers. Marks can expand when edits happen at their edges (before/after/both/none). For a primer on rich text and marks in Loro, see [Text](/docs/tutorial/text).

**Parameters:**
- `styles` - Configuration object mapping style names to their config

**StyleConfig Type:**
```typescript no_run
type StyleConfig = Record<string, {
  expand?: "after" | "before" | "both" | "none"
}>
```

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.configTextStyle({
  bold: { expand: "after" },
  italic: { expand: "none" },
  link: { expand: "none" }
});
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.configDefaultTextStyle">
```typescript no_run
configDefaultTextStyle(style?: { expand: "after" | "before" | "both" | "none" }): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Configures the default text style for the document when using LoroText. If undefined is provided, the default style is reset.

**Parameters:**
- `style` - Default style configuration (optional)

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.configDefaultTextStyle({ expand: "after" });
```
</Indent>

### Container Access Methods

**ð Note:** Creating root containers (e.g., `doc.getText("...")`) does not record operations; nested container creation (e.g., `map.setContainer(...)`) does.

**â ï¸ Pitfall:** Avoid concurrent creation of child containers with the same key in LoroMaps. Instead of:
```ts no_run
// Dangerous - can cause overwrites
doc.getMap("user").getOrCreateContainer(userId, new LoroMap())
```
Use:
```ts no_run
// Safe - unique root container per user
doc.getMap("user." + userId)
```

<Method id="LoroDoc.getText">
```typescript no_run
getText(name: string): LoroText
```
</Method>
<Indent>

Gets or creates a text container with the given name. New to LoroText and marks? See [Text](/docs/tutorial/text).

**Parameters:**
- `name` - The container name

**Returns:** A `LoroText` instance

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

text.insert(0, "Hello");
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getList">
```typescript no_run
getList(name: string): LoroList
```
</Method>
<Indent>

Gets or creates a list container with the given name. Unsure whether to use List or MovableList? See [List and Movable List](/docs/tutorial/list) and the type selection guide [Choosing CRDT Types](/docs/concepts/choose_crdt_type).

**Parameters:**
- `name` - The container name

**Returns:** A `LoroList` instance

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const list = doc.getList("items");
list.push("Item 1");
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getMap">
```typescript no_run
getMap(name: string): LoroMap
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets or creates a map container with the given name. See [Map](/docs/tutorial/map) for basics and patterns.

**Parameters:**
- `name` - The container name

**Returns:** A `LoroMap` instance

**Example:**
```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const map = doc.getMap("settings");
map.set("theme", "dark");
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getTree">
```typescript no_run
getTree(name: string): LoroTree
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets or creates a tree container with the given name. Learn about hierarchical editing and moves in [Tree](/docs/tutorial/tree).

**Parameters:**
- `name` - The container name

**Returns:** A `LoroTree` instance

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const tree = doc.getTree("fileSystem");
const root = tree.createNode();
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getCounter">
```typescript no_run
getCounter(name: string): LoroCounter
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets or creates a counter container with the given name. Counters are special CRDTs that sum concurrent increments; see [Counter](/docs/tutorial/counter).

**Parameters:**
- `name` - The container name

**Returns:** A `LoroCounter` instance

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const counter = doc.getCounter("likes");
counter.increment(1);
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getMovableList">
```typescript no_run
getMovableList(name: string): LoroMovableList
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets or creates a movable list container with the given name. MovableList is designed for reordering with concurrent moves. See [List and Movable List](/docs/tutorial/list) and [Choosing CRDT Types](/docs/concepts/choose_crdt_type).

**Parameters:**

const movableList = doc.getMovableList("tasks");
movableList.push("Task 1");
movableList.push("Task 2");
movableList.push("Task 3");
movableList.move(0, 2); // Move first item to third position
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getContainerById">
```typescript no_run
getContainerById(id: ContainerID): Container | undefined
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets a container by its unique ID. Container IDs (CID) uniquely reference containers across updates; see [Container ID](/docs/advanced/cid) and [Container](/docs/concepts/container).

**Parameters:**
- `id` - The container ID

**Returns:** The container instance or undefined if not found

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
const textId = text.id;
const sameText = doc.getContainerById(textId);
```
</Indent>

### Import/Export Methods

<Method id="LoroDoc.export">
```typescript no_run
export(mode?: ExportMode): Uint8Array
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Exports the document in various formats for synchronization or persistence. For a walkthrough of export modesâsnapshot, update, shallow-snapshot, and updates-in-rangeâsee [Export Mode](/docs/tutorial/encoding). Shallow snapshots remove history while keeping current state; see [Shallow Snapshots](/docs/concepts/shallow_snapshots). VersionVector and Frontiers are two ways to represent versions; see [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector) and [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers).

**Parameters:**
- `mode` - Export configuration (optional)

**ExportMode Options:**
```typescript no_run
type ExportMode =
  | { mode: "snapshot" }
  | { mode: "update", from?: VersionVector }
  | { mode: "shallow-snapshot", frontiers: Frontiers }
  | { mode: "updates-in-range", spans: { id: OpId; len: number }[] }
```

**Returns:** Encoded binary data

**â ï¸ Important Notes:**
- **Shallow snapshots**: Cannot import updates from before the shallow start point. Peers can only sync if they have versions after this point.
- **Auto-commit**: The document automatically commits pending operations before export.
- **Performance**: Export new snapshots periodically to reduce import times for new peers.

**Examples:**
```typescript no_run
import { LoroDoc, VersionVector } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
// ... make some changes to the document ...

// Export full snapshot
const snapshot = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });

// Export updates from a specific version
const lastSyncVersion = doc.version(); // Get current version
// ... make more changes ...
const updates = doc.export({
  mode: "update",
  from: lastSyncVersion
});

// Export shallow snapshot at current version
const shallowSnapshot = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.frontiers()
});
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.import">
```typescript no_run
import(data: Uint8Array): ImportStatus
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Imports updates or snapshots into the document. Returns an `ImportStatus` describing which peer ranges were applied or are pending. See [Sync](/docs/tutorial/sync) and [Import Status](/docs/concepts/import_status) for how Loro handles out-of-order and partial updates.

**Parameters:**
- `data` - Binary data or another LoroDoc to import from

**â ï¸ Important:** LoroDoc will automatically commits pending operations before import. If the doc is in detached mode, the imported operations are recorded into OpLog but not applied to DocState until you call `attach()`, see [Attached vs Detached States](/docs/concepts/attached_detached) adn [OpLog and DocState](/docs/concepts/oplog_docstate).

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Receive updates from another peer (e.g., via network)
const otherDoc = new LoroDoc();
otherDoc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const updates: Uint8Array = otherDoc.export({ mode: "update" });

// Import binary updates
const status = doc.import(updates);
console.log(status.success);
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.importBatch">
```typescript no_run
importBatch(data: Uint8Array[]): ImportStatus
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Efficiently imports multiple updates in a single batch operation. See [Batch Import](/docs/advanced/import_batch) for performance considerations and usage.

**Parameters:**
- `data` - Array of binary updates

**Example:**
```typescript no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
declare const update1: Uint8Array;
declare const update2: Uint8Array;
declare const update3: Uint8Array;

// Usage example:
const updates = [update1, update2, update3];
const status = doc.importBatch(updates);
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.exportJsonUpdates">
```typescript no_run
exportJsonUpdates(start?: VersionVector, end?: VersionVector, withPeerCompression?: boolean): JsonSchema
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Exports updates in JSON format for debugging or alternative storage. See [Export Mode](/docs/tutorial/encoding) for format details and trade-offs.

**Parameters:**
- `start` - Starting version (optional)
- `end` - Ending version (optional)

**Returns:** JSON representation of updates

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const jsonUpdates = doc.exportJsonUpdates();
console.log(JSON.stringify(jsonUpdates, null, 2));
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.importJsonUpdates">
```typescript no_run
importJsonUpdates(json: string | JsonSchema): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Imports updates from JSON format. Useful for debugging, migration, or custom storage layers; see [Export Mode](/docs/tutorial/encoding).

**Parameters:**
- `json` - JSON string or object containing updates

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const otherDoc = new LoroDoc();
otherDoc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const jsonStr = otherDoc.exportJsonUpdates();
doc.importJsonUpdates(jsonStr);
```
</Indent>

## Versioning

Work with the history DAG using frontiers (heads) and version vectors. Switch, branch, and merge versions safely without manual conflict resolution. See [Versioning Deep Dive](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive) and [Attached vs Detached States](/docs/concepts/attached_detached).

### Version Control Methods

<Method id="LoroDoc.checkout">
```typescript no_run
checkout(frontiers: Frontiers): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Checks out the document to a specific version, making it read-only at that point in history. This is the core of time travel; see [Time Travel](/docs/tutorial/time_travel) and [Version](/docs/tutorial/version).

**Parameters:**
- `frontiers` - Array of OpIds representing the target version

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
// Make some changes...
doc.checkout(frontiers); // Go back to previous version
```
</Indent>

<Indent>
**â ï¸ Important:** In Loro 1.0, `version()`/`frontiers()` include pending (uncommitted) local operations.

**ð Note:** After `checkout()`, the document enters "detached" mode and becomes read-only by default. Use `attach()` or `checkoutToLatest()` to return to editing mode. See [Version Deep Dive](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive) and [Attached vs Detached States](/docs/concepts/attached_detached).
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.checkoutToLatest">
```typescript no_run
checkoutToLatest(): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Returns the document to the latest version after a checkout. Related concepts: [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers) and [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector).

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.checkoutToLatest();
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.attach">
```typescript no_run
attach(): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Attaches the document to track latest changes after being detached. See [Attached vs Detached States](/docs/concepts/attached_detached) for how Loro separates current state from history.

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.attach();
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.detach">
```typescript no_run
detach(): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Detaches the document from tracking latest changes, freezing it at current version. See [Attached vs Detached States](/docs/concepts/attached_detached).

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.detach();
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.fork">
```typescript no_run
fork(): LoroDoc
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Creates a new document that is a fork of the current one with a new peer ID. Forking is useful for branching workflows; see [Version](/docs/tutorial/version).

**Returns:** A new LoroDoc instance

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const forkedDoc = doc.fork();
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.forkAt">
```typescript no_run
forkAt(frontiers: Frontiers): LoroDoc
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Creates a fork at a specific version in history. Learn more about versions, DAG history, and heads in [Version Deep Dive](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive).

**Parameters:**
- `frontiers` - The version to fork from

**Returns:** A new LoroDoc instance

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
const forkedDoc = doc.forkAt(frontiers);
```
</Indent>

## Events & Transactions

React to changes and group local operations into transactions. Events are delivered asynchronously after a microtask. See [Event Handling](/docs/tutorial/event) and [Transaction Model](/docs/concepts/transaction_model).

### Subscription Methods

<Method id="LoroDoc.subscribe">
```typescript no_run
subscribe(listener: (event: LoroEventBatch) => void): () => void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Subscribes to all document changes. See [Event Handling](/docs/tutorial/event) for the event model and best practices.

**Parameters:**
- `listener` - Callback function that receives change events

**Returns:** Unsubscribe function

**Event Structure:**
```typescript no_run
interface LoroEventBatch {
  by: "local" | "import" | "checkout"
  origin?: string
  currentTarget?: ContainerID
  events: LoroEvent[]
  from: Frontiers
  to: Frontiers
}
```

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe((event) => {
  console.log("Change type:", event.by);
  event.events.forEach(e => {
    console.log("Container changed:", e.target);
    console.log("Diff:", e.diff);
  });
});

// Later: unsubscribe();
```

**â ï¸ Important:** Events are emitted asynchronously after a microtask.
```ts no_run
doc.commit();
await Promise.resolve();
// Now events have been emitted
```

**ð Note:** Multiple operations before a commit are batched into a single event. See [Event Handling](/docs/tutorial/event).
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.subscribeLocalUpdates">
```typescript no_run
subscribeLocalUpdates(f: (bytes: Uint8Array) => void): () => void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Subscribes only to local changes, useful for syncing with remote peers. This is typically wired to your transport layer; see [Sync](/docs/tutorial/sync).

**Parameters:**
- `f` - Callback that receives binary updates

**Returns:** Unsubscribe function

**Example:**
```ts no_run threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
declare const websocket: { send: (data: Uint8Array) => void };

// Usage example:
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  // Send updates to remote peers
  websocket.send(updates);
});
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer">
```typescript no_run
subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer(f: (e: { peer: PeerID }) => void): () => void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Subscribes to the first commit from each peer, useful for tracking peer metadata.

**Parameters:**
- `f` - Callback that receives peer information

**Returns:** Unsubscribe function

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.subscribeFirstCommitFromPeer(({ peer }) => {
  // Store peer metadata
  doc.getMap("peers").set(peer, {
    joinedAt: Date.now(),
    name: `User ${peer}`
  });
});
```
</Indent>



### Transaction Methods

<Method id="LoroDoc.commit">
```typescript no_run
commit(options?: { origin?: string, message?: string, timestamp?: number }): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Commits pending changes as a single transaction. A transaction groups operations into a Change; see [Operations and Changes](/docs/concepts/operations_changes).

**â ï¸ Critical Distinction:** Loro transactions are NOT ACID database transactions:
- No rollback capability
- No isolation guarantees
- Purpose: Bundle local operations for event batching and history grouping
- Many operations (import/export/checkout) trigger implicit commits

See [Transaction Model](/docs/concepts/transaction_model).

**Parameters:**
- `options` - Optional commit configuration
  - `message` - Commit message (persisted in the document like a git commit message, visible to all peers after sync)
  - `origin` - Origin identifier (local only - used for marking local events, remote peers won't see this)
  - `timestamp` - Unix timestamp in seconds (see [Storing Timestamps](/docs/advanced/timestamp))

**Important distinction:**
- `message` is persisted in the document's history and will be synchronized to all peers, similar to git commit messages
- `origin` is only used locally for filtering events (e.g., excluding certain origins from undo) and is NOT synchronized to remote peers

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.commit({
  message: "Updated document title", // Persisted & synced to all peers
  origin: "user-action",             // Local only, for event filtering
  timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
});
```
</Indent>

### Query Methods

<Method id="LoroDoc.toJSON">
```typescript no_run
toJSON(): Value
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Converts the entire document to a JSON-compatible value. If you prefer a structure where sub-containers are referenced by ID (for privacy or streaming), use getShallowValue(); see [Shallow Snapshots](/docs/concepts/shallow_snapshots).

**Returns:** JSON representation of the document

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const json = doc.toJSON();
console.log(JSON.stringify(json, null, 2));
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getShallowValue">
```typescript no_run
getShallowValue(): Record<string, ContainerID>
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets a shallow representation where sub-containers are represented by their IDs. This is helpful when you want to share structure without history; see [Shallow Snapshots](/docs/concepts/shallow_snapshots).

**Returns:** Shallow JSON value

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const shallow = doc.getShallowValue();
// Sub-containers appear as: "cid:..."
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getDeepValueWithID">
```typescript no_run
getDeepValueWithID(): any
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the deep value of the document with container IDs preserved. This is useful when you need to traverse the document structure while maintaining references to container IDs.

**Returns:** Document value with container IDs

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const deepValue = doc.getDeepValueWithID();
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.version">
```typescript no_run
version(): VersionVector
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the current version vector of the document. Version vectors track how much data from each peer youâve seen; see [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector).

**Returns:** Map from PeerID to counter

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const vv = doc.version();
console.log(vv.toJSON());
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.frontiers">
```typescript no_run
frontiers(): Frontiers
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the current frontiers (heads) of the document. Frontiers are a compact representation of a version; see [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers) for when to use them instead of version vectors.

**ð Note:** Frontiers are a compact version representation.

**â ï¸ Limitation:** When you have a Frontier pointing to operations you don't know about, you cannot determine the complete set of operation IDs included in that version. Version Vectors don't have this limitation but are more verbose. See [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers) for trade-offs.

**Returns:** Array of OpIds

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
// Can be used for checkouts or shallow snapshots
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.diff">
```typescript no_run
diff(from: Frontiers, to: Frontiers, for_json?: boolean): [ContainerID, Diff | JsonDiff][]
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Calculates differences between two versions. Understanding how Loro computes diffs benefits from the history DAG model; see [Version Deep Dive](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive).

**Parameters:**
- `from` - Starting frontiers
- `to` - Ending frontiers
- `for_json` - If true, returns JsonDiff format (default: true)

**Returns:** Array of container IDs and their diffs

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const fromFrontiers = doc.frontiers();
// Make changes...
const toFrontiers = doc.frontiers();

const diffs = doc.diff(fromFrontiers, toFrontiers);
diffs.forEach(([containerId, diff]) => {
  console.log(`Container ${containerId} changed:`, diff);
});
```
</Indent>

### Pre-Commit Hook

<Method id="LoroDoc.subscribePreCommit">
```typescript no_run
subscribePreCommit(f: (e: { changeMeta: Change, origin: string, modifier: ChangeModifier }) => void): () => void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Subscribe to the pre-commit event. You can modify the message and timestamp of the next change. This hook runs right before a Change is recorded; see [Transaction Model](/docs/concepts/transaction_model) and [Operations and Changes](/docs/concepts/operations_changes).

Pitfall: `commit()` can be triggered implicitly by `import`, `export`, and `checkout`. Use this hook to attach metadata even for those implicit commits.

```typescript no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribePreCommit(({ modifier }) => {
  modifier
    .setMessage("Tagged by pre-commit")
    .setTimestamp(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000));
});
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
doc.commit();
unsubscribe();
```
</Indent>

### Cursor Utilities

<Method id="LoroDoc.getCursorPos">
```typescript no_run
getCursorPos(cursor: Cursor): { update?: Cursor, offset: number, side: Side }
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Resolve a stable `Cursor` to an absolute position. Cursors remain valid across concurrent edits; see [Cursor and Stable Positions](/docs/concepts/cursor_stable_positions) and [Cursor tutorial](/docs/tutorial/cursor). The side controls affinity when the cursor sits at an insertion boundary.

```typescript no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "abc");

// Get cursor at position 1
const c0 = text.getCursor(1);
const pos = doc.getCursorPos(c0!);
console.log(pos.offset); // 1
```
</Indent>

### Pending Operations

<Method id="LoroDoc.getUncommittedOpsAsJson">
```typescript no_run
getUncommittedOpsAsJson(): JsonSchema | undefined
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Get pending operations from the current transaction in JSON format. Useful for debugging what will be included in the next Change; see [Transaction Model](/docs/concepts/transaction_model).

```typescript no_run
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");

text.insert(0, "Hello");
const pending = doc.getUncommittedOpsAsJson();
doc.commit();
const none = doc.getUncommittedOpsAsJson(); // undefined after commit
```
</Indent>

### Change Graph & History

const snapshot = a.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
let printed: any;
b.subscribe((e) => {
  const spans = b.findIdSpansBetween(e.from, e.to);
  const changes = b.exportJsonInIdSpan(spans.forward[0]);
  printed = changes;
});
b.import(snapshot);
```
</Indent>

<Method id="LoroDoc.getChangedContainersIn">

## Container Types

Common CRDT containers for modeling JSON-like structures. See [Choosing CRDT Types](/docs/concepts/choose_crdt_type) and [Composing CRDTs](/docs/tutorial/composition) for when to use each and how to nest them.

### LoroText

A rich text container supporting collaborative text editing with formatting. Supports overlapping marks (bold, italic, links) and
stable cursors. The merge semantics avoid interleaving artifacts under concurrency (Fugue + Eg-walker ideas); you use simple index
APIs and Loro handles index transformation.
See [Text](/docs/tutorial/text), [Eg-walker](/docs/advanced/event_graph_walker), and the rich text blog: https://loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext

**â ï¸ Critical: UTF-16 String Encoding**

LoroText uses **UTF-16** encoding, matching JavaScript's native string encoding:
- All standard methods (`insert()`, `delete()`, `mark()`, `slice()`, `charAt()`) use UTF-16 code unit indices
- `length` returns UTF-16 code units (same as JavaScript `string.length`)
- Use `insertUtf8()` and `deleteUtf8()` for UTF-8 byte-based operations when integrating with UTF-8 systems

**â ï¸ Common Pitfalls:**
1. **Index Misalignment**: UTF-16 indices differ from visual character count
2. **Performance**: Cursor queries on deleted positions require history traversal - in that case, it will return a refreshed Cursor object that does not point to the deleted text

**Example with emoji:**
```typescript no_run
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello ð World");
console.log(text.length);        // 13 (emoji counts as 2)
console.log(text.toString()[6]); // â ï¸ Invalid - splits the emoji
text.delete(6, 2);               // â Correct - deletes entire emoji
text.delete(6, 1);               // â Wrong - corrupts the emoji

// Safe iteration
text.iter((char) => {
  console.log(char); // Each character handled correctly
  return true;
});
```

**ð Text vs String in Maps:**
- Use `LoroText` for collaborative text editing where all concurrent edits must be preserved
- Use regular strings in `LoroMap` for atomic values (URLs, IDs, hashes) where Last-Write-Wins is preferred
- Example: URLs should be strings in maps, not LoroText. Otherwise, the automatically merged result may be an invalid URL


<Method id="LoroText.insert">

readonly id: ContainerID
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the unique container ID.

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();

```typescript no_run
readonly length: number
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Gets the length of the text in UTF-16 code units (same as JavaScript's `string.length`).

**â ï¸ Important:** Emoji and other characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane count as 2 UTF-16 units. This affects all index-based operations:
```typescript no_run
text.insert(0, "ð¨âð©âð§âð¦"); // Family emoji
console.log(text.length); // 11 (not 1!) - complex emoji with ZWJ sequences
```

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello");
console.log(text.length); // 5

text.insert(5, " ð");
console.log(text.length); // 8 (space + emoji which counts as 2)
```
</Indent>

### LoroList

An ordered list container for collaborative arrays. Uses index-based APIs; under concurrency, Loro transforms indices
by replaying only the necessary portion of history (Eg-walker-inspired). See [List and Movable List](/docs/tutorial/list),
[Choosing CRDT Types](/docs/concepts/choose_crdt_type), and [Eg-walker](/docs/advanced/event_graph_walker).

**â ï¸ Important: List vs Map for Coordinates**
```typescript no_run
// â WRONG - Don't use List for coordinates
const coord = doc.getList("coord");
coord.push(10); // x
coord.push(20); // y
// Concurrent updates can create [10, 20a, 20b] instead of [10, 20]

// â CORRECT - Use Map for coordinates
const coord = doc.getMap("coord");
coord.set("x", 10);
coord.set("y", 20);
// Concurrent updates properly merge to {x: 10, y: 20}

### LoroMovableList

A list optimized for move operations. Designed for frequent reordering (drag-and-drop) with good behavior under
concurrent moves (concurrent moves resolve to one final position). See [List and Movable List](/docs/tutorial/list).

**ð MovableList vs List:**
- **Use MovableList** for: Drag-and-drop UIs, sortable lists, kanban boards
- **Use List** for: scenarios where the list items don't need to be moved
- **Key difference**: MovableList handles concurrent moves better (no duplicates) and supports set operations, List is more efficient in general.

```typescript no_run
move(from: number, to: number): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Moves an element from one position to another.

```
</Indent>

## Synchronization

Import/export updates over any transport and choose the right encoding for speed and size. See [Sync Tutorial](/docs/tutorial/sync) and [Encoding & Export Modes](/docs/tutorial/encoding).

- **Import order**: Loro handles out-of-order updates automatically
- **Auto-commit**: Import and export operations trigger automatic commits

### Import/Export Patterns

#### Basic Synchronization

```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

// Peer A: Export updates
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
doc1.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello");
const updates = doc1.export({ mode: "update" });

// Peer B: Import updates
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.import(updates);
// now doc2.getText("text").toString() === "Hello"
```

#### Continuous Sync

```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc1 = new LoroDoc();
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();

// Usage example:
// Set up bidirectional sync
doc1.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  doc2.import(updates);
});

doc2.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  doc1.import(updates);
});
```

Performance tips:
- Prefer `mode: "update"` with a `VersionVector` to sync incrementally.
- Use `mode: "shallow-snapshot"` when you only need current state; it strips history for faster import/load.
- Loroâs LSM-based encoding and Eg-walker-inspired merge keep import/export fast, even for large histories.
  See [Encoding](/docs/tutorial/encoding) and v1.0 performance notes: https://loro.dev/blog/v1.0

#### Network Sync with WebSocket

```ts no_run threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

// Assume we have:
declare const ws: {
  send: (data: Uint8Array) => void;
  on: (event: string, handler: (data: any) => void) => void;
};

// Client side
const doc = new LoroDoc();

// Send local updates to server
doc.subscribeLocalUpdates((updates) => {
  ws.send(updates);
});

// Receive updates from server
ws.on('message', (data) => {
  doc.import(new Uint8Array(data));
});
```

### Shallow Snapshots

Shallow snapshots allow for efficient storage by garbage collecting deleted operations.

```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Create shallow snapshot
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
const shallowSnapshot = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: frontiers
});

// Import shallow snapshot
const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
newDoc.import(shallowSnapshot);
```

---

## Version Control

### Time Travel

Navigate through document history:

```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Save current version
const v1 = doc.frontiers();

// Make changes
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "New text");

// Save new version
const v2 = doc.frontiers();

// Travel back
doc.checkout(v1);
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // Original text

// Travel forward
doc.checkout(v2);
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // New text

// Return to latest
doc.checkoutToLatest();
```

### Forking

Create document branches:

```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
// Fork at current state
const fork1 = doc.fork();
fork1.getText("text").insert(0, "Fork 1 changes");

// Fork at specific version
const historicalVersion = doc.frontiers();
const fork2 = doc.forkAt(historicalVersion);
fork2.getText("text").insert(0, "Fork 2 changes");

// Original document remains unchanged
```

### Version Vectors

Track document versions:

```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const vv = doc.version();
console.log(`Document has ${vv.length()} peers`);
```

---

## Events & Subscriptions

### Event Structure

```typescript no_run
interface LoroEventBatch {
  by: "local" | "import" | "checkout"
  origin?: string
  currentTarget?: ContainerID
  events: LoroEvent[]
  from: Frontiers
  to: Frontiers

interface LoroEvent {
  target: ContainerID
  diff: Diff
  path: Path

  for (const event of e.events) {
    if (event.diff.type === "text") {
      event.diff.diff.forEach(delta => {
        if (delta.insert) {
          console.log(`Inserted: "${delta.insert}"`);
        }
        if (delta.delete) {

## Undo/Redo

Local undo operates on your own changes without breaking collaboration. See [Undo/Redo](/docs/advanced/undo) for design details and caveats.

### UndoManager

Provides local undo/redo functionality.

**â ï¸ Important Notes:**
- **Local-only**: UndoManager only undoes the local user's operations, not remote operations
- **Origin filtering**: Use `excludeOriginPrefixes` to exclude certain operations (e.g., sync operations) from undo
- **Cursor restoration**: Use `onPush`/`onPop` callbacks to save and restore cursor positions

<Method id="UndoManager.constructor">
```typescript no_run
constructor(doc: LoroDoc, config: UndoConfig)
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Creates a new UndoManager instance.

  - `excludeOriginPrefixes?` - Array of origin prefixes to exclude from undo
  - `onPush?` - Callback when adding to undo stack
  - `onPop?` - Callback when undoing/redoing

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {
  mergeInterval: 1000,

Check if undo is available.

**Returns:** True if can undo

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});

// Usage example:
if (undo.canUndo()) {
  undo.undo();
}
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.canRedo">
```typescript no_run
canRedo(): boolean
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Check if redo is available.

**Returns:** True if can redo

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});

// Usage example:
if (undo.canRedo()) {
  undo.redo();
}
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.peer">
```typescript no_run
peer(): PeerID
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Get the peer ID of the undo manager.

**Returns:** The peer ID

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});

// Usage example:
const peerId = undo.peer();
console.log(peerId); // e.g., "123456"
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.setMaxUndoSteps">
```typescript no_run
setMaxUndoSteps(steps: number): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Set the maximum number of undo steps.

**Parameters:**
- `steps` - Maximum number of undo steps

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});

// Usage example:
undo.setMaxUndoSteps(50);
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.setMergeInterval">
```typescript no_run
setMergeInterval(interval: number): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Set the merge interval for grouping operations.

**Parameters:**
- `interval` - Merge interval in milliseconds

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});

// Usage example:
undo.setMergeInterval(2000); // 2 seconds
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.groupStart">
```typescript no_run
groupStart(): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Begin a manual grouping of subsequent commits into a single undo step.

**Behavior:**
- Wrap consecutive `doc.commit()` calls so they undo together
- Calling `groupStart` again before `groupEnd` throws and leaves the current group unchanged
- Conflicting remote imports may automatically end the group and split the undo item

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});
const text = doc.getText("text");

undo.groupStart();

text.update("hello", undefined);
doc.commit();

text.update("hello world", undefined);
doc.commit();

undo.groupEnd();

undo.undo();

console.log(text.toString()); // ""
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.groupEnd">
```typescript no_run
groupEnd(): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>
Close the active manual group and enqueue the grouped operations as a single undo item.

**Behavior:**
- Must be paired with a prior `groupStart`
- Safe to call after the group was auto-closed by a conflicting remote import (becomes a no-op)
- Non-conflicting remote updates from other peers remain outside the undo item but do not break the group

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});
const text = doc.getText("text");

undo.groupStart();

text.update("hello", undefined);
doc.commit();
text.update("hello world", undefined);
doc.commit();

const snapshot = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
const doc2 = new LoroDoc();
doc2.import(snapshot);
doc2.getText("text2").update("hello world world", undefined); // touches a different container
doc2.commit();
const update = doc2.export({ mode: "update" });

doc.import(update); // remote, non-conflicting change

text.update("hello world world world", undefined);
doc.commit();

undo.groupEnd();

undo.undo();

console.log(text.toString()); // ""
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.addExcludeOriginPrefix">
```typescript no_run
addExcludeOriginPrefix(prefix: string): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>

**Parameters:**
- `prefix` - Origin prefix to exclude

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {});

// Usage example:
undo.addExcludeOriginPrefix("sync-");
undo.addExcludeOriginPrefix("import-");
```
</Indent>

<Method id="UndoManager.clear">
```typescript no_run
clear(): void
```
</Method>
<Indent>

**Example:**
```ts threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";

undo.clear();
```
</Indent>

### Custom Undo Handlers

Handle cursor restoration and side effects:

```typescript no_run threeslash
import { LoroDoc, UndoManager } from "loro-crdt";
const doc = new LoroDoc();
declare function saveCursorPositions(): any;
declare function restoreCursorPositions(cursors: any): void;

// Usage example:
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {
  onPush: (isUndo, counterRange, event) => {
    // Save cursor positions when adding to undo stack
    const cursors = saveCursorPositions();
    return {
      value: doc.toJSON(),
      cursors: cursors
    };
  },

  onPop: (isUndo, { value, cursors }, counterRange) => {
    // Restore cursor positions when undoing
    restoreCursorPositions(cursors);
  }
});
```

## Types & Interfaces

Reference for core types used across the API. For conceptual background, see [Containers](/docs/concepts/container), [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector), [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers), and the [Versioning Deep Dive](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive).

### Core Types

```typescript no_run
// Peer identifier
type PeerID = `${number}`

// Container identifier
type ContainerID =
  | `cid:root-${string}:${ContainerType}`
  | `cid:${number}@${PeerID}:${ContainerType}`

// Tree node identifier
type TreeID = `${number}@${PeerID}`

// Operation identifier
type OpId = {
  peer: PeerID
  counter: number
}

// Container types
type ContainerType = "Text" | "Map" | "List" | "Tree" | "MovableList" | "Counter"

// Value types
type Value =
  | ContainerID
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | null
  | { [key: string]: Value }
  | Uint8Array
  | Value[]
  | undefined
```

### Version Types
Loro uses two complementary version representations: Version Vectors (per-peer counters) and Frontiers (a compact set of heads). See [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector) and [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers). For the full DAG model, see [Version Deep Dive](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive).

```typescript no_run
// Version vector class
class VersionVector {
  constructor(value: Map<PeerID, number> | Uint8Array | VersionVector | undefined | null)
  static parseJSON(version: Map<PeerID, number>): VersionVector
  toJSON(): Map<PeerID, number>
  encode(): Uint8Array
  static decode(bytes: Uint8Array): VersionVector
  get(peer_id: number | bigint | `${number}`): number | undefined
  compare(other: VersionVector): number | undefined
  setEnd(id: { peer: PeerID, counter: number }): void
  setLast(id: { peer: PeerID, counter: number }): void
  remove(peer: PeerID): void
  length(): number
}

// Frontiers represent a specific version
type Frontiers = OpId[]

// ID span for range queries
type IdSpan = {
  peer: PeerID
  counter: number
  length: number
}
```

### Change Types

```typescript no_run
// Change metadata
interface Change {
  peer: PeerID
  counter: number
  lamport: number
  length: number
  timestamp: number  // Unix timestamp in seconds
  deps: OpId[]
  message: string | undefined
}

// Change modifier for pre-commit hooks
interface ChangeModifier {
  setMessage(message: string): this
  setTimestamp(timestamp: number): this
}
```

### Cursor Types
Stable cursors survive concurrent edits and resolve to absolute positions on demand. See [Cursor and Stable Positions](/docs/concepts/cursor_stable_positions) and [Cursor tutorial](/docs/tutorial/cursor).

```typescript no_run
// Stable position in containers
class Cursor {
  containerId(): ContainerID
  pos(): OpId | undefined
  side(): Side  // -1 | 0 | 1
  encode(): Uint8Array
  static decode(data: Uint8Array): Cursor
}

// Cursor side affinity
type Side = -1 | 0 | 1
```

### Delta Type
Delta is a popular rich-text operation format (e.g., Quill). LoroText can export/import Delta; see [Text](/docs/tutorial/text).

```typescript no_run
// Rich text delta operations
type Delta<T> =
  | {
      insert: T
      attributes?: { [key in string]: {} }
      retain?: undefined
      delete?: undefined
    }
  | {
      delete: number
      attributes?: undefined
      retain?: undefined
      insert?: undefined
    }
  | {
      retain: number
      attributes?: { [key in string]: {} }
      delete?: undefined
      insert?: undefined
    }
```

## EphemeralStore

Manages ephemeral state like cursor positions and user presence. See [Ephemeral Store](/docs/tutorial/ephemeral) for concepts and usage patterns. Each entry uses timestamp-based LWW (Last-Write-Wins) for conflict resolution.

**â ï¸ Important:**
- EphemeralStore is a separate CRDT without history - history/operations are NOT persisted
- Perfect for temporary state: cursor positions, selections, typing indicators
- Each peer's state auto-expires after the timeout period
- Uses Last-Write-Wins

# Document Size

In this benchmark, we use the Automerge paper dataset.

Source: https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index

The dataset consists of:

- 182,315 single-character insertion operations
- 77,463 single-character deletion operations
- A total of 259,778 operations
- 104,852 characters in the final document

The first line of settings in the table below indicates configurations without
`gc` and `compress`.

| Settings             | loro-snapshot | loro-update | diamond-type | yrs    | automerge |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ | --------- |
| Default (no options) | 273561        | 251352      | 281042       | 226973 | 292742    |
| gc                   | x             | x           | 203564       | 159921 | x         |
| compress             | 132459        | 105724      | 150723       | 91777  | 129062    |
| gc & compress        | x             | x           | 106242       | 71033  | x         |

> The `x` in the table above signifies that the corresponding setting is not supported.

Loro also supports a shallow snapshot encoding format with gc capabilities by truncating the history. For details, see [the doc](/docs/tutorial/encoding).
If truncated from the latest version, the result will be:

| Settings | loro-shallow-snapshot |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Default  | 63352                 |
| compress | 54517                 |

# Native Benchmarks

[This native benchmark](https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/crdt-bench-native) is based on
the Rust implementation of each crate.

- Conducted on a M2 Max CPU, dated 2024-10-18.
- The tasks with names starting with `automerge` use the automerge paper
  dataset.
- In this benchmark, compression is disabled for both automerge and loro.
- Diamond-type doesn't support the list type yet.

# JS/WASM Benchmarks

> The primary role of these benchmarks should be to serve as indicators of the absence of performance pitfalls rather than as measures of which project is superior. This is because different projects consistently make different trade-offs. It is inaccurate to claim that Project A is superior to Project B simply because A performs better in certain benchmarks, while Project B may excel in other areas by a significant margin.

The benchmark can be reproduced using the [crdt-benchmarks](https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/crdt-benchmarks) repo.

- The benchmarks were performed on MacBook Pro M1 2020 with 16GB RAM
- loro-old is the version of loro on 2023-11-10, it's compiled from
  [this commit](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/tree/c1613ee680c6a4757e55fcda76e4f5f627daeb56).
  Loro has undergone numerous changes since then, particularly in terms of
  [encoding schema](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/pull/219), shifting from a
  performance-focused version to one that prioritizes compatibility. Because we
  want Loro to have good backward and forward compatibility after reaching
  version 1.0, we have adopted a more easily extensible encoding method. It is
  slower than the encoding method used in the `loro-old` version, but it better
  ensures our ability to iterate quickly after reaching version 1.0 without
  introducing breaking changes.
- There is a more exchaustive benchmark at the bottom that only runs benchmarks
  on Yjs.
- Automerge can perform the `B4` benchmark in about 1 second (see `time`) if all
  changes are applied within a single `change` transaction. However, our
  benchmarks test individual edits that generate individual update events as
  this more closely simulates actual user behavior.
- Note that `parseTime` is significantly higher with `automerge` and `loro` when
  the initial document is not empty (e.g. when syncing content from a remote
  server).
- Loro and Automerge can store a complete DAG of editing history for each
keystroke, but Yjs requires additional storage for a Version Vector + Delete
Set for each version saved, which incurs significant extra overhead beyond the
document size reported.
<details>
<summary>Benchmark setup</summary>

#### B1: No conflicts

Simulate two clients. One client modifies a text object and sends update
messages to the other client. We measure the time to perform the task (`time`),
the amount of data exchanged (`avgUpdateSize`), the size of the encoded document
after the task is performed (`docSize`), the time to parse the encoded document
(`parseTime`), and the memory used to hold the decoded document (`memUsed`).

#### B2: Two users producing conflicts

Simulate two clients. Both start with a synced text object containing 100
characters. Both clients modify the text object in a single transaction and then
send their changes to the other client. We measure the time to sync concurrent
changes into a single client (`time`), the size of the update messages
(`updateSize`), the size of the encoded document after the task is performed
(`docSize`), the time to parse the encoded document (`parseTime`), and the
memory used to hold the decoded document (`memUsed`).

#### B3: Many conflicts

Simulate `âN` concurrent actions. We measure the time to perform the task and
sync all clients (`time`), the size of the update messages (`updateSize`), the
size of the encoded document after the task is performed (`docSize`), the time
to parse the encoded document (`parseTime`), and the memory used to hold the
decoded document (`memUsed`). The logarithm of `N` was chosen because `âN`
concurrent actions may result in up to `âN^2 - 1` conflicts (apply action 1: 0
conflict; apply action2: 1 conflict, apply action 2: 2 conflicts, ..).

#### B4: Real-world editing dataset

Replay a real-world editing dataset. This dataset contains the
character-by-character editing trace of a large-ish text document, the LaTeX
source of this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960

Source: https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index

- 182,315 single-character insertion operations
- 77,463 single-character deletion operations
- 259,778 operations totally
- 104,852 characters in the final document

We simulate one client replaying all changes and storing each update. We measure
the time to replay the changes and the size of all update messages
(`updateSize`), the size of the encoded document after the task is performed
(`docSize`), the time to encode the document (`encodeTime`), the time to parse
the encoded document (`parseTime`), and the memory used to hold the decoded
document in memory (`memUsed`).

##### [B4 x 100] Real-world editing dataset 100 times

Replay the [B4] dataset one hundred times. The final document has a size of over
10 million characters. As comparison, the book "Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice
and Fire" is only 1.6 million characters long (including whitespace).

- 18,231,500 single-character insertion operations
- 7,746,300 single-character deletion operations
- 25,977,800 operations totally
- 10,485,200 characters in the final document

This article introduces the implementation difficulties and challenges of Movable Tree CRDTs when collaboration, and how Loro implements it and sorts child nodes. The algorithm has high performance and can be used in production.

## Background

In distributed systems and collaborative software, managing hierarchical relationships is difficult and complex. Challenges arise in resolving conflicts and meeting user expectations when working with the data structure that models movement by combining deletion and insertion. For instance, if a node is concurrently moved to different parents in replicas, it may lead to the unintended creation of duplicate nodes with the same content. Because the node is deleted twice and created under two parents.

Currently, many software solutions offer different levels of support and functionality for managing hierarchical data structures in distributed environments. The key variation among these solutions lies in their approaches to handling potential conflicts.

### Conflicts in Movable Trees

A movable tree has 3 primary operations: creation, deletion, and movement. Consider a scenario where two peers independently execute various operations on their respective replicas of the same movable tree. Synchronizing these operations can lead to potential conflicts, such as:

- The same node was deleted and moved
- The same node was moved under different nodes
- Different nodes were moved, resulting in a cycle
- The ancestor node is deleted while the descendant node is moved

#### Deletion and Movement of the Same Node

![Deletion and Movement of the Same Node](./movable-tree/move-delete-dark.png)

This situation is relatively easy to resolve. It can be addressed by applying one of the operations while ignoring the other based on the timestamp in the distributed system or the application's specific requirements. Either approach yields an acceptable outcome.

#### Moving the Same Node Under Different Parents

![Moving the Same Node Under Different Parents](./movable-tree/move-same-node-dark.png)

Merging concurrent movement operations of the same node is slightly more complex. Different approaches can be adopted depending on the application:

- Delete the node and create copies of nodes under different parent nodes. Subsequent operations then treat these nodes independently. This approach is acceptable when node uniqueness is not critical.
- Allow the node have two edges pointing to different parents. However, this approach breaks the fundamental tree structure and is generally not considered acceptable.
- Sort all operations, then apply them one by one. The order can be determined by timestamps in a distributed system. Providing the system maintains a consistent operation sequence, it ensures uniform results across all peers.

#### Movement of Different Nodes Resulting in a Cycle

![cycle](./movable-tree/cycle-dark.png)

Concurrent movement operations that cause cycles make the conflict resolution of movable trees complex. Matthew Weidner listed several solutions to resolve cycles in his [blog](https://mattweidner.com/2023/09/26/crdt-survey-2.html#forests-and-trees).

> 1. Error. Some desktop file sync apps do this in practice ([Martin Kleppmann et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3118603) give an example).
> 2. Render the cycle nodes (and their descendants) in a special âtime-outâ zone. They will stay there until some user manually fixes the cycle.
> 3. Use a server to process move ops. When the server receives an op, if it would create a cycle in the serverâs own state, the server rejects it and tells users to do likewise. This isÂ [what Figma does](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/#syncing-trees-of-objects). Users can still process move ops optimistically, but they are tentative until confirmed by the server. (Optimistic updates can cause temporary cycles for users; in that case, Figma uses strategy (2): it hides the cycle nodes.)
> 4. Similar, but use aÂ [topological sort](https://mattweidner.com/2023/09/26/crdt-survey-2.html#topological-sort)Â (below) instead of a serverâs receipt order. When processing ops in the sort order, if an op would create a cycle, skip itÂ [(Martin Kleppmann et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3118603).
> 5. For forests: Within each cycle, letÂ `B.parent = A`Â be the edge whoseÂ `set`Â operation has the largest LWW timestamp. At render time, âhideâ that edge, instead renderingÂ `B.parent = "none"`, but donât change the actual CRDT state. This hides one of the concurrent edges that created the cycle.
>    â¢ To prevent future surprises, usersâ apps should follow the rule: before performing any operation that would create or destroy a cycle involving a hidden edge, first âaffirmâ that hidden edge, by performing an op that setsÂ `B.parent = "none"`.
> 6. For trees: Similar, except instead of renderingÂ `B.parent = "none"`, render the previous parent forÂ `B`Â - as if the bad operation never happened. More generally, you might have to backtrack several operations. BothÂ [Hall et al. (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3209280.3229110)Â andÂ [Nair et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04828)Â describe strategies along these lines.

#### Ancestor Node Deletion and Descendant Node Movement

![Ancestor Node Deletion and Descendant Node Movement](./movable-tree/move_chlid_delete_parent_dark.png)

The most easily overlooked scenario is moving descendant nodes when deleting an ancestor node. If all descendant nodes of the ancestor are deleted directly, users may easily misunderstand that their data has been lost.

### How Popular Applications Handle Conflicts

Dropbox is a file data synchronization software. Initially, Dropbox treated file movement as a two-step process: deletion from the original location followed by creation at a new location. However, this method risked data loss, especially if a power outage or system crash occurred between the delete and create operations.

Today, when multiple people move the same file concurrently and attempt to save their changes, Dropbox detects a conflict. In this scenario, it typically saves one version of the original file and creates a new ["conflicted copy"](https://help.dropbox.com/organize/conflicted-copy) for the changes made by one of the users.

Figma is a real-time collaborative prototyping tool. They consider tree structures as the most complex part of the collaborative system, as detailed in their [blog post about multiplayer technology](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/#syncing-trees-of-objects). To maintain consistency, each element in Figma has a "parent" attribute. The centralized server plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of these structures. It monitors updates from various users and checks if any operation would result in a cycle. If a potential cycle is detected, the server rejects the operation.

However, due to network delays and similar issues, there can be instances where updates from users temporarily create a cycle before the server has the chance to reject them. Figma acknowledges that this situation is uncommon. Their [solution](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/#syncing-trees-of-objects) is straightforward yet effective: they temporarily preserve this state and hide the elements involved in the cycle. This approach lasts until the server formally rejects the operation, ensuring both the stability of the system and a seamless user experience.

## Movable Tree CRDTs

The applications mentioned above use movable trees and resolve conflicts based on centralized solutions. Another alternative approach to collaborative tree structures is using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). While initial CRDT-based algorithms were challenging to implement and incurred significant storage overhead as noted in prior research, such as [Abstract unordered and
ordered trees CRDT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1784.pdf) or [File system on CRDT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5990.pdf), but continual optimization and improvement have made several CRDT-based tree synchronization algorithms suitable for certain production environments. This article highlights two innovative CRDT-based approaches for movable trees. The first is presented by Martin Kleppmann et al. in their work **_[A highly-available move operation for replicated trees](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/10/07/crdt-tree-move-operation.html)_** and the second by Evan Wallace in his **_[CRDT: Mutable Tree Hierarchy](https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy/)_**.

### A highly-available move operation for replicated trees

This paper unifies the three operations used in trees (creating, deleting, and moving nodes) into a move operation. The move operation is defined as a four-tuple `Move t p m c`, where `t` is the operation's unique and ordered timestamp such as [`Lamport timestamp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp), `p` is the parent node ID, `m` is the metadata associated with the node, and `c` is the child node ID.

If all nodes of the tree do not contain `c`, this is a **creation** operation that creates a child node `c` under parent node `p`. Otherwise, it is a **move** operation that moves `c` from its original parent to the new parent `p`. Additionally, node deletion is elegantly handled by introducing a designated `TRASH` node; moving a node to `TRASH` implies its deletion, with all descendants of `TRASH` considered deleted. But they remain in memory to prevent concurrent editing from moving them to other nodes. In order to handle the previously mentioned situation of deleting ancestor nodes and moving descendant nodes concurrently.

In the three potential conflicts mentioned earlier, since deletion is also defined as a move operation, **deleting and moving the same node** is transformed into two move operations, leaving only two remaining problems:

- **Moving the same node under different parents**
- **Moving different nodes, creating a cycle**

Logical timestamps are added so that all operations can be linearly ordered, thus the first conflict can be avoided as they can be expressed as two operations in sequence rather than concurrently for the same node. Therefore, in modeling a Tree using only move operations, the only exceptional case in concurrent editing would be creating a cycle, and operations causing a cycle are termed **unsafe operations**.

This algorithm sorts all move operations according to their timestamps. It can then sequentially apply each operation. Before applying, the algorithm detects cycles to determine whether an operation is safe. If the operation creates a cycle, we ignore the unsafe operation to ensure the correct structure of the tree.


Based on the above approach, the consistency problem of movable trees becomes the following two questions:

1. How to introduce global order to operations
2. How to apply a remote operation that should be inserted in the middle of an existing sorted sequence of operations

#### Globally Ordered Logical Timestamps

[Lamport Timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp) can determine the causal order of events in a distributed system. Here's how they work: each peer starts with a counter initialized to `0`. When a local event occurs, the counter is increased by `1`, and this value becomes the event's Lamport Timestamp. When peer `A` sends a message to peer `B`, `A` attaches its Lamport Timestamp to the message. Upon receiving the message, peer `B` compares its current logical clock value with the timestamp in the message and updates its logical clock to the larger value.

To globally sort events, we first look at the Lamport Timestamps: smaller numbers mean earlier events. If two events have the same timestamp, we use the unique ID of the peer serves as a tiebreaker.


#### Apply a Remote Operation

An op's safety depends on the tree's state when applied, avoiding cycles. Insertion requires evaluating the state formed by all preceding ops. For remote updates, we may need to:

1. Undo recent ops
2. Insert the new op
3. Reapply undone ops

This ensures proper integration of new ops into the existing sequence.

##### Undo Recent Ops

Since we've modeled all operations on the tree as move operations, undoing a move operation involves either moving the node back to its old parent or undoing the operation that created this node. To enable quick undoing, we cache and record the **old parent** of the node before applying each move operation.

##### Apply the Remote Op

Upon encountering an unsafe operation, disregarding its effects prevents the creation of a cycle. Nevertheless, it's essential to record the operation, as the safety of an operation is determined **dynamically**. For instance, if we receive and sort an update that deletes another node causing the cycle prior to this operation, the operation that was initially unsafe becomes safe. Additionally, we need to mark this unsafe operation as ineffective, since during undo operations, it's necessary to query the **old parent** node, which is the target parent of the last effective operation in the sequence targeting this node.

##### Reapply Undone Ops

Cycles only occur when receiving updates from other peers, so the undo-do-redo process is also needed at this time. When receiving a new op:

```jsx
function apply(newOp)
      // Compare the ID of the new operation with existing operations
      if largerThanExistingOpId(newOp.id, oplog)
          // If the new operation's ID is greater, apply it directly
          oplog.applyOp(newOp)
      else
          // If the new operation's ID is not the greatest, undo operations until it can be applied
          undoneOps = oplog.undoUtilCanBeApplied(newOp)
          oplog.applyOp(newOp)
          // After applying the new operation, redo the undone operations to maintain sequence order
          oplog.redoOps(undoneOps)
```

- If the new operation depends on an op that has not been encountered locally, indicating that some inter-version updates are still missing, it is necessary to temporarily cache the new op and wait to apply it until the missing updates are received.
- Compare the new operation with all existing operations. If the `opId` of the new operation is greater than that of all existing operations, it can be directly applied. If the new operation is safe, record the parent node of the target node as the old parent node, then apply the move operation to change the current state. If it is not safe, mark this operation as ineffective and ignore the operation's impact.
- If the new opId is sorted in the middle of the existing sequence, it is necessary to pop the operations that are sorted later from the sequence one by one, and undo the impact of this operation, which means moving back to the child of the old parent node, until the new operation can be applied. After applying the new operation, reapply the undone nodes in sequence order, ensuring that all operations are applied in order.

The following animated GIF demonstrates the process executed by `Peer1`:

1. Received `Peer0` creating node `A` with the `root` node as its parent.
2. Received `Peer0` creating node `B` with `A` as its parent.
3. Created node `C` with `A` as its parent and synchronized it with `Peer0`.
4. Moved `C` to have `B` as its parent.
5. Received `Peer0`'s moving `B` to have `C` as its parent.

The queue at the top right of the animation represents the order of local operations and newly received updates. The interpretation of each element in each `Block` is as follows:

<div style={{ filter: "invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)" }}>
  ![](./movable-tree/explain.png)
</div>

A particular part of this process to note is the two operations with `lamport timestamps` of `0:3` and `1:3`. Initially, the `1:3` operation moving `C` to `B` was created and applied locally, followed by receiving `Peer0`'s `0:3` operation moving `B` to `C`. In `lamport timestamp` order, `0:3` is less than `1:3` but greater than `1:2` (with peer as the tiebreaker when counters are equal). To apply the new op, the `1:3` operation is undone first, moving `C` back to its old parent `A`, then `0:3` moving `B` to `C` is applied. After that, `1:3` is redone, attempting to move `C` to `B` again (the old parent remains `A`, omitted in the animation). However, a cycle is detected during this attempt, preventing the operation from taking effect, and the state of the tree remains unchanged. This completes an `undo-do-redo` process.

### CRDT: Mutable Tree Hierarchy

Evan Wallace has developed an innovative algorithm that enables each node to track all its historical parent nodes, attaching a counter to each recorded parent. The count value of a new parent node is 1 higher than that of all the node's historical parents, indicating the update sequence of the node's parents. The parent with the highest count is considered the current parent node.

During synchronization, this parent node information is also synced. If a cycle occurs, a heuristic algorithm reattaches the nodes causing the cycle back to the nearest historical parent node that won't cause a cycle and is connected to the root node, thus updating the parent node record. This process is repeated until all nodes causing cycles are reattached to the tree, achieving all replica synchronization of the tree structure. The demo in [Evan's blog](https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy/) clearly illustrates this process.

As Evan summarized at the end of the article, this algorithm does not require the expensive `undo-do-redo` process. However, each time a remote move is received, the algorithm needs to determine if all nodes are connected to the root node and reattach the nodes causing cycles back to the tree, which can perform poorly when there are too many nodes.

I established a [benchmark](https://github.com/Leeeon233/movable-tree-crdt) to compare the performance of the movable tree algorithms.

## Movable Tree CRDTs implementation in Loro

Loro implements the algorithm proposed by Martin Kleppmann et al., **_[A highly-available move operation for replicated trees](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/10/07/crdt-tree-move-operation.html)_**. On one hand, this algorithm has high performance in most real world scenarios. On the other hand, the core `undo-do-redo` process of the algorithm is highly similar to how Eg-walker (Event Graph Walker) applies remote updates in Loro. Introduction about **Eg-walker** can be found in our previous [blog](https://www.loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext#brief-introduction-to-replayable-event-graph).

Movable tree has been introduced in detail, but there is still another problem of tree structure that has not been solved. For movable tree, in some real use cases, we still need the capability to sort child nodes. This is necessary for outline notes or layer management in graphic design softwares. Users need to adjust node order and sync it to other collaborators or devices.

We integrated the `Fractional Index` algorithm into Loro and combined it with the movable tree, making the child nodes of the movable tree sortable.

There are many introductions to `Fractional Index` on the web, You can read more about `Fractional Index` in the [Figma blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences) or [Evan blog](https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-fractional-indexing/). In simple terms, `Fractional Index` assigns a sortable value to each object, and if a new insertion occurs between two objects, the `Fractional Index` of the new object will be between the left and right values. What we want to speak about more here is how to deal with potential conflicts brought by `Fractional Index` in CRDTs systems.

### Potential Conflicts in Child Node Sorting

As our applications are in a distributive condition, when multiple peers insert new nodes in the same position, the same `Fractional Index` would be assigned to these differing content but same position nodes. When updates from the remote are applied to local, conflicts arise as the same `Fractional Index` is encountered.

In Loro, we retain these identical `Fractional Index` and use `PeerID` (unique ID of every Peer) as the tie-breaker for the relative order judgment of the same `Fractional Index`.

![](./movable-tree/FI-and-PeerID-dark.png)

Although this solved the sorting problem among the same `Fractional Index` nodes from different peers, it impacted the generation of new `Fractional Index` as we cannot generate a new `Fractional Index` between two same ones. We use two methods to solve this problem:

1. The first method, as stated in Evan's blog, we could add a certain amount of jitter to each generated `Fractional Index`, (for the ease of explanation, all examples below take decimal fraction as the `Fractional Index`) for example, when generating a new `Fractional Index` between 0 and 1, it should have been 0.5, but through random jitters, it could be `0.52712`, `0.58312`, `0.52834`, etc., thus significantly reducing the chance of same `Fractional Index` appearing.
2. If the situation arises where the same `Fractional Index` is present on both sides, we can handle this problem by resetting these `Fractional Index`. For example, if we need to insert a new node between `0.7@A` and `0.7@B` (which indicates `Fractional Index` @ `PeerID`), instead of generating a new `Fractional Index` between 0.7 and 0.7, we could assign two new `Fractional Index` respectively for the new node and the `0.7@B` node between 0.7 and 1, which could be understood as an extra move operations.

![](./movable-tree/same-FI-dark.png)

### Implementation and Encoding Size

Introducing `Fractional Index` brings the advantage of node sequence. What about encoding size?

Loro uses [drifting-in-space](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/fractional_index) `Fractional Index` implementation based on `Vec<u8>`, which is base 256. In other words, you need to continuously insert 128 values forward or backward from the default value to increase the byte size of the `Fractional Index` by 1. The worst storage overhead case, such as inserting new values alternately each time. For example, the initial sequence is `ab`, insert `c` between `a` and `b`, then insert `d` between `c` and `b`, then `e` between `c` and `d`, like:

```js no_run
ab    // [128] [129, 128]
acb   // [128] [129, 127, 128] [129, 128]
acdb  // [128] [129, 127, 128] [129, 127, 129, 128] [129, 128]
acedb // [128] [129, 127, 128] [129, 127, 129, 127, 128] [129, 127, 129, 128] [129, 128]
```
a new operation would cause an additional byte to be needed. But such a situation is very rare.

Considering that potential conflicts wouldn't appear frequently in most applications, Loro simply extended the implementation, the original implementation produced new `Fractional Index` in `Vec<u8>` by only increasing or decreasing 1 in certain index to achieve relative sorting. The simple jitter solution was added, by appending random bytes in length of jitter value to `Fractional Index`. To enable jitter in js, you can use `doc.setFractionalIndexJitter(number)` with a positive value. But this will increase the encoding size slightly, but each `Fractional Index` only adds `jitter` bytes. If you want to generate `Fractional Index` at the same position with 99% probability without conflict, the relationship between `jitter` settings and the maximum number of concurrent edits `n` will be:

When there are numerous `Fractional Indexes`, there will be many common prefixes after being sorted, when Loro encodes these `Fractional Indexes`, prefix optimization would be implemented. Each `Fractional Index` only saves the amount of same prefix bits and remaining bytes with the previous one, which further downsizes the overall encoding size.

### Related work

Other than using Fractional Index, there are other movable list CRDT that can make sibling nodes of the tree in order. One of these algorithms is Martin Kleppmann's [Moving Elements in List CRDTs](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/04/27/papoc-list-move.html), which has been used in Loro's [Movable List](https://www.loro.dev/docs/tutorial/list).


In comparison, the implementation of `Fractional Index` solution is simpler, and no stable position representation is provided for child nodes when modeling nodes in a tree, otherwise, the overall tree structure would be too complex. However, the `Fractional Index` has the problem of [interleaving](https://vlcn.io/blog/fractional-indexing#interleaving), but this is acceptable when some only need relative order and do not require strict sequential semantics, such as figma layer items, multi-level bookmarks, etc.

## Benchmark

We conducted performance benchmarks on the Movable Tree implementation by Loro, including scenarios of random node movement, switching to historical versions, and performance under extreme conditions with significantly deep tree structures. The results indicate that it is capable of supporting real-time collaboration and enabling seamless historical version checkouts.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Loro, LoroTree, LoroTreeNode, LoroMap } from "loro-crdt";

let doc = new Loro();
let tree: LoroTree = doc.getTree("tree");
let root: LoroTreeNode = tree.createNode();
// By default, append to the end of the parent node's children list
let node = root.createNode();
// Specify the child's position
let node2 = root.createNode(0);
// Move `node2` to be the last child of `node`
node2.move(node);
// Move `node` to be the first child of `node2`
node.move(node2, 0);
// Move the node to become the root node
node.move();
// Move the node to be positioned after another node
node.moveAfter(node2);
// Move the node to be positioned before another node
node.moveBefore(node2);
// Retrieve the index of the node within its parent's children
let index = node.index();
// Get the `Fractional Index` of the node
let fractionalIndex = node.fractionalIndex();
// Access the associated data map container
let nodeData: LoroMap = node.data;
```

### Demo

We developed a simulated Todo app with data synchronization among multiple peers using Loro, including the use of `Movable Tree` to represent subtask relationships, `Map` to represent various attributes of tasks, and `Text` to represent task titles, etc. In addition to basic creation, moving, modification, and deletion, we also implemented version switching based on Loro. You can drag the scrollbar to switch between all the historical versions that have been operated on.

## Summary

This article discusses why implementing Movable Tree CRDTs is difficult, and presents two innovative algorithms for movable trees.

For implementation, Loro has integrated **_[A highly-available move operation for replicated trees](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/10/07/crdt-tree-move-operation.html)_** to implement the hierarchical movement of the Tree, and integrated the `Fractional Index` implementation by [drifting-in-space](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/fractional_index) to achieve the movement between child nodes. This can meet the needs of various application scenarios.

Loro is a [Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)](https://crdt.tech/)
library that developers can use to implement real-time collaboration and version
control in their applications. You can use Loro to create
[local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/). Loro 1.0 has
a stable data format, excellent performance, and rich features. You can use it
in Rust, JS (via WASM), and Swift.

<details>
<summary>What is CRDT? What is it used for?</summary>

Distributed states are now ubiquitous in multi-user collaborative applications
and applications that need multi-device synchronization. You need to ensure
consistency across devices. CRDTs provide a decentralized way to automatically
solve this problem.

> CRDTs automatically resolve conflicts and ensure the consistency of the data.
> Some CRDT algorithms provide extra properties for merge results, which should align with user expectations as much as possible.

CRDT provides a decentralized way to solve this problem. The decentralization here not only means that it can synchronize through P2P methods, but it also means:

- It allows applications to naturally support offline editing
- It allows users to store and implement two-way synchronization of data in
  multiple different locations
- It makes it easier for the backend to implement horizontal scaling
- It can easily support end-to-end encryption

CRDTs were once considered unable to be used in serious and complex scenarios,
such as rich text, but optimizations in recent years have greatly expanded its
application scenarios, making it a practical and easy-to-use technology.

Based on CRDT, we can create applications that
allow users to fully control data ownership. These applications can be like
Git-managed repositories, not relying on specific software service providers.
Users can switch between GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted Git servers, and the data
is always available locally. This is the vision of
[local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/).

<aside>
â **What's the difference between sync via CRDT and sync via Git?**

Git's protocol doesn't support real-time collaboration. When there are concurrent
edits, Git needs to resolve conflicts manually; while CRDT can support real-time
collaboration, can be extended to support rich text, and supports data with
JSON-like schemas.

</aside>

CRDTs often also provides a simpler and easier-to-use sync method,
because for Op-based CRDTs like Loro, as long as the sets of CRDT operations
received by two peers are consistent, the CRDT document states of these two
peers are consistent. You don't have to worry about idempotency, the order of
operation application, and network exception handling. For Loro's CRDT document,
just two rounds of data exchange can transmit the missing operations between two
documents to achieve final consistency:

> You can find all the code samples in this blog [here](https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/loro-blog-examples)

```jsx
import { LoroDoc, VersionVector } from "npm:loro-crdt@1.0.0-beta.3";

const docA = new LoroDoc();
const docB = new LoroDoc();
docA.setPeerId(0);
docA.setPeerId(1);

});

docB.import(bytesA);
docA.import(bytesB);

console.log(docA.getText("text").toString()); // Hello!Hi!
console.log(docB.getText("text").toString()); // Hello!Hi!
```

## Features of Loro 1.0

### High-performance CRDTs

High-performance, general-purpose CRDTs can significantly reduce data synchronization
complexity and are crucial for local-first development.

However, large CRDT documents may face challenges with loading speed and memory consumption,
especially when dealing with those with extensive editing histories.
Loro 1.0 addresses this challenge through a new storage format, achieving a 10x improvement in
loading speed. In [benchmarks using Loro with real-world editing data](#document-import-speed-benchmarks),
we've reduced the loading time for a document with millions of operations from 16ms to 1ms. When utilizing the
shallow snapshot format (discussed later), the time can be further reduced to 0.37ms.
As a result, Loro will not become a bottleneck for applications dealing with such large documents.
It expands the potential use cases for CRDTs, making them viable for a wider range of applications.

### Rich CRDT types

Loro now supports
[rich text CRDT](https://loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext),
which enhances the merge result of rich text (text with formatting and styling) to better align with user expectations.
Our text/list CRDT is based on the [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) algorithm.
It prevents interleaving issues when merging concurrent edits. For example,
it can avoid unintended merges like "1H2i3" when "123" and "Hi" are inserted concurrently.

We also support:

- Movable List: Supports set, insert, delete, and move operations. The algorithm ensures that after
  merging concurrent moves, each element occupies only one position.
- Map: Similar to a JavaScript object.
- [Movable Tree](https://loro.dev/blog/movable-tree): Used to model file directories, outliners, and
  other hierarchical structures that may need moving. It ensures no cyclic dependencies exist in the
  tree after merging concurrent move operations.

Loro also supports nesting between types, so you can model edits on JSON documents through them:

> You can find all the code samples in this blog [here](https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/loro-blog-examples)

```tsx
import {
  LoroDoc,
  LoroList,
  LoroMap,
  LoroText,
} from "npm:loro-crdt@1.0.0-beta.2";

// Create a JSON structure of
interface JsonStructure {
  users: LoroList<
    LoroMap<{
      name: string;
      age: number;
    }>
  >;
  notes: LoroList<LoroText>;
}

const doc = new LoroDoc<JsonStructure>();
const users = doc.getList("users");
const user = users.insertContainer(0, new LoroMap());
user.set("name", "Alice");
user.set("age", 20);
const notes = doc.getList("notes");
const firstNote = notes.insertContainer(0, new LoroText());
firstNote.insert(0, "Hello, world!");

// { users: [ { age: 20, name: "Alice" } ], notes: [ "Hello, world!" ] }
console.log(doc.toJSON());
```

### Version control

Like Git, Loro saves a complete directed acyclic graph (DAG) of edit history. In Loro, the DAG is used to represent the dependencies between edits, similar to how Git represents commit history.

Loro supports primitives that allow users to switch between different versions, fork new branches, edit on new branches, and merge branches.

Based on this operation primitive, applications can build various Git-like capabilities:

- You can merge multiple versions without needing to manually resolve conflicts
- You can rebase/squash updates from the current branch to the target branch (WIP)

```jsx
import { LoroDoc } from "npm:loro-crdt@1.0.0-beta.2";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("0");
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello, world!");
doc.checkout([{ peer: "0", counter: 1 }]);
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "He"
doc.checkout([{ peer: "0", counter: 5 }]);
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "Hello,"
doc.checkoutToLatest();
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "Hello, world!"

// Simulate a concurrent edit
doc.checkout([{ peer: "0", counter: 5 }]);
doc.setDetachedEditing(true);
doc.setPeerId("1");
doc.getText("text").insert(6, " Alice!");
// âââââââââââââââââ     âââââââââââââââââ
// â    Hello,     ââââ¬âââ     world!    â
// âââââââââââââââââ  â  âââââââââââââââââ
//                    â
//                    â  âââââââââââââââââ
//                    ââââ     Alice!    â
//                       âââââââââââââââââ
doc.checkoutToLatest();
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "Hello, world! Alice!"
```

You can also use `doc.fork()` to create a separate doc at the current version. It is independent of the current doc, and works like a fork:

```tsx
import { LoroDoc } from "npm:loro-crdt@1.0.0-beta.4";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("0");
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello, world!");
doc.checkout([{ peer: "0", counter: 5 }]);
const newDoc = doc.fork();
newDoc.setPeerId("1");
newDoc.getText("text").insert(6, " Alice!");
// âââââââââââââââââ     âââââââââââââââââ
// â    Hello,     ââââ¬âââ     world!    â
// âââââââââââââââââ  â  âââââââââââââââââ
//                    â
//                    â  âââââââââââââââââ
//                    ââââ     Alice!    â
//                       âââââââââââââââââ
doc.import(newDoc.export({ mode: "update" }));
doc.checkoutToLatest();
console.log(doc.getText("text").toString()); // "Hello, world! Alice!"
```

<aside>
**Current limitations of version control in Loro**

The application layer still needs a lot of code to provide users with more
complete version control capabilities, such as:

- Storing and synchronizing version tags and branches
- Presenting diff view
- Handling rebase and merge interactions
- ...

These problems are not suitable to be solved in the current Loro CRDTs Lib, as
too many assumptions about the schema and environment would make it difficult to
use in other scenarios, so we won't build these parts in. But they all can be
solved through additional libraries.

[Event Graph Walker (Eg-walker)](/docs/advanced/event_graph_walker) is a pioneering collaboration algorithm that combines the strengths of
Operational Transformation (OT) and CRDT, two widely used algorithms for real-time collaboration.

While OT is centralized and CRDT is decentralized, OT traditionally had an advantage
in terms of lower document overhead. CRDTs initially had higher overhead, but recent
optimizations have significantly reduced this gap, making CRDTs increasingly competitive.
Eg-walker leverages the best aspects of both approaches.

Not only have we use the idea of Eg-walker for Text and List CRDTs in Loro, but
Loro's overall architecture has also been greatly inspired by Eg-walker. As a
result, Loro closely resembles Eg-walker in terms of algorithmic properties.

<aside>
In terms of implementation details, Loro differs from the Eg-walker described
in the paper. So it might be controversial to say Loro implements Eg-walker.

For example, Loro supports types other than text, and in Loro we store the ID
of each character in the document state (but do not store tombstones), and so on.

But it implements the idea of Eg-walker that travels the graph to
construct temporary CRDTs for conflict resolution. And, like
Eg-walker, Loro doesn't need to keep the CRDT structures in memory to edit
a document.

</aside>

[The Eg-walker paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14252) was released in
September 2023. Prior to its official publication, Joseph Gentle shared an
initial version of the algorithm in the Diamond-Type repository. Excited by
the design, I implemented a similar algorithm in Loro two years ago. A brief
introduction to this algorithm can be found
[here](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/event_graph_walker).

The properties of Eg-walker includes:

- It itself conforms to the definition of CRDT, so it has the strong eventual
  consistency property of CRDT, thus can be used in distributed environments
- Fast local operation speed: compared to previous CRDTs, it processes
  operations extremely fast because it doesn't need to generate corresponding
  Operations based on CRDT data structures
- Fast merging of remote operations: The complexity of OT merging remote
  operations is O(n^2), while Eg-walker, like mainstream CRDTs, is O(nlogn),
  only reaching O(n^2) in extremely rare worst-case scenarios. This means that
  when the number of concurrent operations reaches 10,000, OT will start to show
  noticeable lag to users, while CRDTs can handle it easily. And in most
  real-world scenario benchmarks, it's faster than other CRDTs.
- Lower memory usage: Because it doesn't need to persistently store CRDT
  structures in memory, its memory usage is lower than general CRDTs
- Faster import speed: CRDT documents often take a long time to load because
  they need to parse the corresponding CRDT structures or operations to build the CRDT
  data structures. Without these structures, they cannot continue subsequent
  editing, resulting in long import times. Eg-walker, like OT algorithms, only
  needs the current document state and does not need to build these additional
  structures to allow users to start editing the document directly, thus
  achieving much faster import speed

<aside>
ð¡ **Differences between Loro and Eg-walker**

Although Loro is inspired by Eg-walker, overall, Loro's features differ
from those of Eg-walker as described in the paper. The following are the
specific differences:

- In terms of performance characteristics of local operations and importing
  updates, Loro and Eg-walker are similar.
- Loro supports multiple data types besides text, such as Map, List, Movable
  List, Tree, Counter, etc. Some CRDT types are not easily combined with
  Eg-walker directly, so we need to make additional adaptations and adjustments
  in Loro.
- Loro's document state has additional metadata, including the ID of each
  character. This metadata is used to support cursor synchronization and other
  features. The IDs on the text can provide a stable position information
  expression for functions like commenting.
- In the algorithm described in the Eg-walker paper, users A and B can
  initialize a CRDT document from the same plain text document and begin
  collaboration without any historical information. Moreover, the histories that
  formed these two plain text documents can be different. In Loro, however, it
  is necessary to ensure that the histories of the documents on which A and B
  collaborate are the same.
- Our text supports not only plain text but also rich text, which includes formatting
  attributes like bold, italic, and font styles. This makes our text data format different
  from plain text and cannot be described directly using plain text description methods.
- Loro's design supports not only real-time collaboration but also version
  control. Therefore, we have additional data structures and information for
  each op to make it faster to switch versions.

</aside>

In the past quarter, we have made significant architectural adjustments to allow
Loro to further leverage the advantages of the Eg-walker algorithm. Here are our
achievements

#### Shallow Snapshot

By default, Loro stores the complete editing history of the document like Git,
because
[the Eg-walker algorithm needs to load edits that are parallel to them and to the least common ancestor when merging remote edits](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/event_graph_walker).
Shallow Snapshot is like Git's Shallow Clone, which can remove old historical
operations that users don't need, greatly reducing document size and improving
document import and export speed. This allows you to cold store document history
that is too old and mainly use shallow doc for collaboration. Here's
an example usage:

```jsx
import { LoroDoc } from "npm:loro-crdt@1.0.0-beta.2";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
for (let i = 0; i < 10_000; i++) {
  doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello, world!");
}
const snapshotBytes = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
const shallowSnapshotBytes = doc.export({
  mode: "shallow-snapshot",
  frontiers: doc.frontiers(),
});

console.log(snapshotBytes.length); // 5421
console.log(shallowSnapshotBytes.length); // 869
```

For details on the implementation principle, see
[Shallow Snapshot](/docs/advanced/shallow_snapshot).

#### Optimized Document Format

Loro version 1.0 has achieved a 10x to 100x improvement in document import speed
compared to version 0.16, which already has a fast import speed.
It makes it possible to load a large text document with several million operations
in under a frame time.

This is because we introduced a new snapshot format.
When a LoroDoc is initialized through this snapshot format, we don't
parse the corresponding document state and historical information until the user
actually needs that information.

<aside>
ð¡ **Loro performs integrity checks before importing updates/snapshots**

We append a 4-byte xxhash32 checksum to each export to prevent data corruption.
While this doesn't protect against malicious tampering, it's fast and effective
at detecting issues caused by transmission errors or storage failures.

Our main motivation for including integrity checks is to avoid bugs caused by
data errors at a relatively low cost. Because Loro uses its own binary encoding
format, which is different from user-understandable document formats like JSON,
it would be extremely difficult to troubleshoot if data errors occur.

</aside>

In Loro 1.0's snapshot format, without compression algorithms, its document size
is twice that of the old version (and other mainstream CRDTs). This additional
size mainly comes from encoding historical operations + document state in the
1.0 snapshot format, without reusing stored data between the two, while in the
old version we used the order of historical operations to encode the current
state of the document (the old version's encoding learned from
[Automerge encoding's Value Column](https://automerge.org/automerge-binary-format-spec/#_value_column)).

Trading twice the document size for ten times the import speed is worthwhile
because import speed affects the performance of many aspects, and the import
speed of CRDT documents
[is often noticeable to users on large documents](https://loro.dev/docs/performance)
(> 16ms). It also leaves possibilities for more optimizations in the future.

<aside>
â **Does this affect the efficiency of data transmission?**

It depends on the scenario:

1. For real-time collaboration:
   - We don't need to continuously transmit the entire snapshot.
   - We only need document updates (operations that are missing from other peers).
   - The snapshot format mentioned above isn't used, so the transmission volume remains unchanged.

2. When a document needs to be loaded from remote:
   - If using the complete snapshot, it would be twice as large as before.
   - However, you have options:
     1. Use the shallow snapshot format.
     2. Export a complete set of updates for other peers, allowing them to calculate the latest document state.

3. For local storage:
   - Users are generally less sensitive to local storage costs.
   - The snapshot format can be used for local persistence without significant impact.

</aside>

Inspired by the design of Key-Value Databases, we have also divided the storage
of document state and history into blocks, with each block roughly 4KB in size,
so that when users really need a piece of history, we only need to decompress
and read this 4KB of content, without parsing the entire document. This has led
to a qualitative improvement in import speed, and because the serialization
format can better compress history and state, memory usage is also lower than
before.

The lazy loading optimization takes advantage of Eg-walker's property that "it
doesn't need to keep the complete CRDT data structure in memory at all times,
and only needs to access historical operations when parallel edits occur".

<details>
<summary>How we implemented lazy loading</summary>

In Loro 1.0, we implemented a simple [LSM (Log-structured merge-tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree) engine internally. LSM is a data structure often used to
implement Key-Value Databases, and Loro 1.0 is heavily inspired by its design.
Currently, Loro's storage implementation uses get, set, and range operations of
Key-Value Database as primitives. For example, Loro stores history as a series of
ChangeBlocks, with each ChangeBlock serialized to about 4KB. Each ChangeBlock
uses its first Op Id as the Key, and the serialized binary data of the
ChangeBlock as the Value, stored in the internal LSM engine.

In our simple LSM Engine implementation, each Block is compressed during
serialization, and decompression only occurs when the corresponding Value is
actually retrieved. This allows the import speed of the new data format to be up
to a hundred times faster than before, with even lower memory usage. So in Loro
1.0:

1. Data integrity is checked during import
2. Loro internally stores history (History/OpLog) and state (DocState) in
   blocks, loading the corresponding blocks as needed
3. The Eg-walker algorithm that Loro is based on allows documents to start
   editing without complete CRDTs meta information, thus easily working with
   lazy loading behavior

Why is lazy loading valuable? Because in many use cases, we don't need to fully
load the document's history and state:

- For example, when we receive a set of remote updates, but the Loro document
  data is still in the database, and we want to know the latest state of the
  document, we need to load the LoroDoc snapshot from the database, then import
  the remote update set, and then get the latest document state. At this point,
  most of the historical information won't be accessed.
- Sometimes in data synchronization scenarios, peer A needs to send historical
  data that peer B doesn't have. It needs to import the snapshot and then
  extract the historical information that B doesn't have. In this case, the
  document's state doesn't need to be parsed, and the unused part of the history
  doesn't need to be parsed either.
- Users don't need document history when initializing a document; only parsing
  the State is necessary at this point

  ![When merging remote operations, only the modified containers and some of the related historical operations need to be visited](./v1/merge-edit.png)

  When merging remote operations, only the modified containers and some of the
  related historical operations need to be visited

What happens during import and export in the new version? Let's take a common
scenario as an example:

In real-time collaboration sessions or local storage, we recommend developers
first store the operations from users, and then periodically perform compaction.
This compaction involves importing the old snapshot and all scattered updates
into the same LoroDoc, then exporting uniformly through the Snapshot format. In
the new version, this will involve the following:

- First, the old version of the snapshot is imported
- The received updates may contain parallel edits, so a part of the related
  parallel edit history from the old version needs to be loaded to construct the
  CRDT and complete the diff calculation
  - Loro internally loads and parses the data of the corresponding block to get
    the corresponding history; at this point, complete document parsing does not
    occur
- After the diff calculation is complete, it needs to be applied to the
  corresponding States
  - Loro will internally load and parse the corresponding state, and at this
    point, complete document parsing does not occur either
- Export
  - Unaffected history blocks or state blocks are exported as they are
  - Affected blocks will be serialized to overwrite the original block, then
    exported
  - During export, we use a method similar to SSTable internally for the final
    export

The only data that needs to be parsed in this entire process are:

- Meta information for each stored block
- Blocks that need to be read will be decompressed
- History Blocks / state Blocks that will be affected by Updates

<aside>
â Do we still need to load the entire document blob with these optimizations?

We still need to load the entire document blob into memory. However, our current architecture has implemented internal block-based loading and storage, making it easier for us to implement true block-based retrieval and saving from disk in the future. This could make Loro function more like a database. While theoretically feasible, we'll assess if there are practical scenarios that require this capability. For most documents, Loro's current performance is already quite sufficient.

#### Benchmarks

> All benchmarks results below were performed on a MacBook Pro M1 2020

Below is a comparison of Snapshot import and export speeds between Loro versions
1.0.0-beta.1 and 0.16.12. The benchmark is based on document editing history
from the real world. Thanks to [latch.bio](http://latch.bio) for sharing the
document data. The benchmark code is available [here](https://github.com/loro-dev/latch-bench).
The document contains 1,659,541 operations.

> In Loro, a Snapshot stores the document history along with its current state.
> The Shallow Snapshot format, similar to Git's Shallow Clone, can exclude
> history. In the benchmark below, the Shallow Snapshot has a depth=1 (only the
> most recent operation history is retained, other historical operations are
> removed)

| task                            | Old Snapshot Format on 0.16.12 | New Snapshot Format        | Shallow Snapshot Format |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Import                          | 17.3ms +- 0.0298ms             | 1.15ms +- 0.0101ms (15x)   | 375Âµs +- 8.47Âµs (47x)   |
| Import+GetAllValues             | 17.4ms +- 0.0437ms             | 1.19ms +- 0.0122ms (14.5x) | 375Âµs +- 1.60Âµs (46x)   |
| Import+GetAllValues+Edit        | 17.5ms +- 0.0263ms             | 1.21ms +- 0.0120ms (14.5x) | 375Âµs +- 1.40Âµs (46.5x) |
| Import+GetAllValues+Edit+Export | 32.4ms +- 0.0560ms             | 5.46ms +- 0.0772ms (6x)    | 844Âµs +- 5.12Âµs (38.5x) |

Here are the key points of this benchmark:

- The Shallow Snapshot has a depth of 1, meaning it only contains the document
  state and a single historical operation, which is why it's significantly
  faster
- _GetAllValue_ refers to calling `doc.get_deep_value()` (in JS, it's
  `doc.toJSON()` ). It loads the complete state of the document and
  obtains the corresponding JSON-like structure. This represents the time spent
  on CRDT parsing before a user loads a document.
- _Edit_ refers to making a local modification. As you can see, it has little
  impact on the time taken because Loro doesn't need to load the complete CRDT
  data structure for local operations.
- _Export_ refers to exporting the complete document data again. We expect to
  further reduce the time spent here in the future, as we can continue to reuse
  the encoding of unmodified Blocks from the import.

The following shows the performance on a document after applying the editing
history from the
[Automerge Paper](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index)
**100 times**. You can reproduce the results [here](https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/automerge-paper-bench).
The document contains:

- 18,231,500 single-character insertion operations
- 7,746,300 single-character deletion operations
- 25,977,800 operations totally
- 10,485,200 characters in the final document

| Snapshot Type    | Size (bytes) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Old snapshot     | 27,347,374   |
| New snapshot     | 23,433,380   |
| Shallow Snapshot | 4,388,215    |

- The New snapshot data is smaller because it performs additional simple
  compression on each Block during encoding internally

| task                       | Old Snapshot     | New Snapshot           | Shallow Snapshot       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Parse                      | 538ms +- 3.23ms  | 17.9ms +- 48.5Âµs (30x) | 14.4ms +- 114Âµs (37x)  |
| Parse+ToString             | 568ms +- 1.78ms  | 20.2ms +- 57.2Âµs (28x) | 16.8ms +- 81.4Âµs (34x) |
| Parse+ToString+Edit        | 561ms +- 940Âµs   | 119ms +- 180Âµs (4.5x)  | 113ms +- 185Âµs (5x)    |
| Parse+ToString+Edit+Export | 1460ms +- 22.9ms | 251ms +- 1.60ms (6x)   | 206ms +- 360Âµs (7x)    |

## Next Steps for Loro

<Caption>Importing Loro Git Repo into Loro Version Controller</Caption>

Loro's performance on a single document is now sufficient to cover the real-time
collaboration and version management needs of most documents. So our next step
will be to explore real-time collaboration and version control across a
collection of documents.

We believe that CRDTs can create a Git for Everyone and Everything:

- It's for Everyone because by leveraging the power of CRDTs, we can make version
  control much easier to reason about and use for the average person.
- It's (nearly) for Everything because Loro provides a rich set of data
  synchronization types. We're no longer limited to synchronizing plain text
  data, but can solve semantic automatic merging of JSON-like schema, which can meet
  most needs of creative tools and collaborative tools.

We've created a demo of the Loro version controller, which is based on our
sub-document implementation (implemented in the application layer) with Version information.
It can import the entire React repository (about 20,000 commits, thousands of
collaborators), and it supports real-time collaboration on such
repositories. However, how to better manage versions and seamlessly integrate with Git still needs to be explored.

<aside>
  When merging extensive concurrent edits, CRDTs can automatically merge
  changes, but the result may not always meet expectations. Fortunately, Loro
  stores the complete editing history. This allows us to offer Git-like manual
  conflict resolution at the application layer when needed.
</aside>

Loro CRDTs still have significant room for optimization in these scenarios.
Currently, the Loro CRDTs library doesn't involve network or disk I/O, which
enhances its ease of use but also constrains its capabilities and potential
optimizations.
For example, while we've implemented block-level storage, documents are still
imported and exported as whole units. Adding I/O capabilities to selectively
load/save blocks would enable significant performance optimizations.

## Conclusion

Loro 1.0 features great performance improvements, rich CRDT types, and advanced
version control features. Our optimized document format has yielded promising
results on the import speed and the memory usage.

Now that Loro CRDTs are stable, we are able to develop a better ecosystem.
We're excited to see it being applied in various scenarios.

**TL;DR.** Loro Mirror keeps a typed, immutable appâstate view in sync with a Loro CRDT document. Local `setState` edits become granular CRDT operations; incoming CRDT events update your state. You keep familiar React patterns and gain collaboration, offline edits, and history.

> CRDT: A Conflictâfree Replicated Data Type lets multiple peers edit concurrently and still converge without central coordination.
>
> **Localâfirst:** Data is usable offline and synced later; the device is the primary source of truth.

## Overview

**Loro** is a CRDT library for localâfirst apps. It supports rich containersâ`Text`, `Map`, `List`/`MovableList`, `MovableTree`âwith versioning, timeâtravel, and compact updates/snapshots.

Though CRDTs ensure CRDTs states converge, apps still need glue code to map between CRDT documents and UI state to ensure their consistency. It's not an easy task.

**Loro Mirror** addresses this boundary. You declare a schema once. Mirror maintains an immutable appâstate view and handles both directions:

- **Event â state.** Loro events update your state.
- **State â CRDT.** `setState` diffs become containerâlevel CRDT ops (insert / delete / move / text edits).

For an update, if **k** items change and each changed item affects **m** of its immediate fields, time complexity is **â O(kÂ·m)**. _(k = number of changed items; m = average number of changed immediate fields per changed item.)_ This is similar to Reactâs render complexity.

## Why this exists

Without Mirror, projects that uses Loro need to:

1. Map CRDTs states to UI states
2. Diff UI edits and translate them to CRDT operations
3. Subscribe to CRDT events and patch UI state

This code is repetitive and easy to get wrong. Mirror centralizes it behind a declarative schema.

---

## What Mirror provides

- **Declarative schema.** Describe UI state in terms of Loro containers; Mirror maintains an immutable view.
- **Typed and frameworkâagnostic.** Works in plain TypeScript, React (via `loro-mirror-react`) or any other UI framework that supports immutable states.
- **Fineâgrained diffs.** Generates ops such as item moves in `MovableList` and character deltas in `Text`.

---

## How to use

1. Define a schema that describes your app state
2. Create a `LoroDoc` and a Mirror store; provide `schema`
3. Update via `setState`. Subscribe for changes if needed.
4. Sync across peers using Loro updates; Mirror applies remote delta back to your app state automatically.

### Basic Example

```ts twoslash
/**
 * As an example, you can use `useState` from React to manage the state
 *
 * `const [appState, setAppState] = useState({});`
 */
function setAppState(state: any) {}
// ---cut---
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { schema, SyncDirection, Mirror } from "loro-mirror";

// 1) Declare state shape â a MovableList of todos with stable Container ID `$cid`
type TodoStatus = "todo" | "inProgress" | "done";
const appSchema = schema({
  todos: schema.LoroMovableList(
    schema.LoroMap({
      text: schema.String(),
      status: schema.String<TodoStatus>(),
    }),
    // $cid is the container ID of LoroMap assigned by Loro
    (t) => t.$cid,
  ),
});

// 2) Create a Loro document and a Mirror store
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const store = new Mirror({
  doc,
  schema: appSchema,
  // InitialState will not be written into LoroDoc
  initialState: { todos: [] },
});

// 3) Subscribe (optional) â know whether updates came from local or remote
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe((state, { direction, tags }) => {
  if (direction === SyncDirection.FROM_LORO) {
    console.log("Remote update", { state, tags });
  } else {
    console.log("Local update", { state, tags });
  }

  // You can use `state` to render directly, it's a new immutable object that shares
  // the unchanged fields with the old state
  setAppState(state);
});

// 4) Either draftâmutate or return a new state
// Draftâstyle (mutate a draft)
store.setState((s) => {
  s.todos.push({ text: "Draft add", status: "todo" });
});

// Immutable return (construct a new object)
store.setState((s) => ({
  ...s,
  todos: [...s.todos, { text: "Immutable add", status: "todo" }],
}));

// 5) Sync across peers with Loro updates (transportâagnostic)
// Example: two docs in memory â in real apps, send `bytes` over WS/HTTP/WebRTC
const other = new LoroDoc();
other.import(doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" }));

// Wire realtime sync (local updates â remote import)
const stop = doc.subscribeLocalUpdates((bytes) => {
  other.import(bytes);
});

// Any `store.setState(...)` on `doc` now appears in `other` as well
```

### React Example

```tsx twoslash
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { schema } from "loro-mirror";
import { useLoroStore } from "loro-mirror-react";

type TodoStatus = "todo" | "inProgress" | "done";

const todoSchema = schema({
  todos: schema.LoroMovableList(
    schema.LoroMap({
      text: schema.String(),
      status: schema.String<TodoStatus>(),
    }),
    (t) => t.$cid,
  ),
});

export function TodoApp() {
  const doc = useMemo(() => new LoroDoc(), []);
  const { state, setState } = useLoroStore({
    doc,
    schema: todoSchema,
    initialState: { todos: [] },
  });

  function addTodo(text: string) {
    setState((s) => {
      s.todos.push({ text, status: "todo" });
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => addTodo("Write blog")}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {state.todos.map((t) => (
          <li key={t.$cid}>
            <input
              value={t.text}
              onChange={(e) =>
                setState((s) => {
                  const i = s.todos.findIndex((x) => x.$cid === t.$cid);
                  // Text delta will be calculated automatically
                  if (i !== -1) s.todos[i].text = e.target.value;
                })
              }
            />
            <select
              value={t.status}
              onChange={(e) =>
                setState((s) => {
                  const i = s.todos.findIndex((x) => x.$cid === t.$cid);
                  if (i !== -1)
                    s.todos[i].status = e.target.value as TodoStatus;
                })
              }
            >
              <option value="todo">Todo</option>
              <option value="inProgress">In Progress</option>
              <option value="done">Done</option>
            </select>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

Undo/Redo

```tsx
import { UndoManageker } from "loro-crdt";

// Inside the same component, after creating `doc`:
const undo = useMemo(() => new UndoManager(doc), [doc]);

// Add controls anywhere in your UI:
<div>
  <button onClick={() => undo.undo()}>Undo</button>
  <button onClick={() => undo.redo()}>Redo</button>
  {/* UndoManager only reverts your local edits; remote edits stay. */}
  {/* See docs: <https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/undo> */}
  {/* For full time travel, see: <https://loro.dev/docs/tutorial/time_travel> */}
</div>;
```

What you get

- Type-safe, framework-agnostic state
- Each mutation becomes a minimal change-set (CRDT delta)âno manual diffing
- Fine-grained updates to subscribers for fast, predictable renders
- [Built-in history and time travel](https://loro.dev/docs/tutorial/time_travel)
- [Offline-first sync](https://loro.dev/docs/tutorial/sync) via updates or snapshots with deterministic conflict resolution over any transport (HTTP, WebSocket, P2P)
- [Collaborative undo/redo](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/undo) across clients

We built a example PWA app here [https://todo.loro.dev](https://todo.loro.dev) . Itâs open source at https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-todo. Itâs collaborative and account-free. The data will be persisted locally in IndexedDB and saved in the cloud for 7 days. You can share your todo list with others by just sharing the unique URL. In the codebase, only a tiny portion of the code is about Loro thanks to the help of loro-mirror.

## Where weâre going

Because Mirror owns the bidirectional mapping between application state and the Loro document, we can move value up the stack while lowering integration cost. For example:

- Text. Many interfaces render by lines, yet LoroTextâs lowâlevel API is indexâbased. Teams typically reâimplement line segmentation and map edits back to lines by hand. With Mirror in the middle, it becomes feasible to surface optional lineâaware events on top of LoroText so the UI receives stable, lineâbased diffs without custom conversionâwhile retaining the underlying CRDT guarantees.
- Tree. LoroTree CRDT already ensures correct concurrent moves, but developers still translate tree operations into applicationâstate patches. Mirror carries firstâclass mappings from tree events into your state shape, so consumers can work with natural âinsert/move/delete nodeâ updates.
- Ephemeral patches. We'll add [`setStateWithEphemeralPatch`](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-mirror/issues/35) so Mirror can stream temporary drag or scale interactions through an `EphemeralStore`, letting collaborators see live previews while the persisted history stays clean and deduplicated once the change finalizes.

By using loro-mirror to bridge CRDTs and application state consistency, and by expressing schemas declaratively, we can let AI help developers get more done correctly. This makes Loro not only suitable for professional creative tools with real-time collaboration, but also for enabling people to build practical mini-tools for themselves and their communities.

## Envisioning the Local-First Development Paradigm

Distributed states are commonly found in numerous scenarios, such as multiplayer
games, multi-device document synchronization, and edge networks. These scenarios
require synchronization to achieve consistency, usually entailing elaborate
design and coding. For instance, considerations for network issues or concurrent
write operations are necessary. However, for a wide range of applications CRDTs
can simplify the code significantly:

- CRDTs can automatically merge concurrent writes without conflicts.
- Fewer abstractions. There's no need to design specific backend database
  schemas, manually execute expected conflict merges, or implement interfaces to
  memory and memory to persistent structure conversions.
- Offline supports are right out of the box

<details>
<summary>What are CRDTs</summary>

### What are Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)?

CRDTs are data structures used in distributed systems that allow updates to be
merged across multiple replicas without conflicts. In this context, "replicas"
refer to different independent data instances within the system, such as the
same collaborative document on various user devices.

CRDTs enable users to operate independently on their replicas, like editing a
document, without needing real-time communication with other replicas. The CRDTs
merge these operations, ensuring all replicas achieve "strong eventual
consistency". As long as all nodes receive the same set of updates, regardless
of the order, their data states will eventually be consistent.

> [What are CRDTs](https://www.loro.dev/docs/concepts/crdt)

</details>

<details>
<summary>When you can't use CRDTs</summary>
### When you can't use CRDTs

CRDTs only guarantee _Strong Eventual Consistency_. You have to make sure it's
suitable for your application.

"Strong Eventual Consistency": As long as all nodes receive the same set of
updates, their data states will ultimately become consistent regardless of their
sequence.

Strong eventual consistency may not be acceptable in scenarios requiring
immediate consistency or transactional integrity, such as financial
transactions, exclusive resource access, or allocation.

</details>

Since the data resides locally, client applications can directly access and
manipulate local data, offering both speed and availability. Additionally, due
to CRDTs' nature, synchronization / real-time collaboration can be achieved
without relying on centralized servers (similar to Git, allowing migration to
other platforms without data loss). With performance improvements, CRDTs
increasingly replace traditional real-time collaboration solutions in various
contexts.

This represents a new paradigm. Local-first not only empowers users with control
over their data, but also makes developers' lives easier.

### Integrating CRDTs with UI State Management

![Loro's rich text collaboration example](./loro-now-open-source/richtext.gif)

<Caption>Loro's rich text collaboration example</Caption>

Since CRDTs enable conflict-free automatic merging, the challenge of managing
distributed states shifts to "how to express operations and states on CRDTs".

Front-end state management libraries typically require developers to define how
to retrieve State and specify Actions, as illustrated by this example from Vue's
state management tool, Pinia:

```ts no-run
export const useCartStore = defineStore({
  id: "cart",
  state: () => ({
    rawItems: [] as string[],
  }),
  getters: {
    items: (state): Array<{ name: string; amount: number }> =>
      state.rawItems.reduce(
        (items, item) => {
          const existingItem = items.find((it) => it.name === item);

          if (!existingItem) {
            items.push({ name: item, amount: 1 });
          } else {
            existingItem.amount++;
          }

          return items;
        },
        [] as Array<{ name: string; amount: number }>,
      ),
  },
  actions: {
    addItem(name: string) {
      this.rawItems.push(name);
    },

    removeItem(name: string) {
      const i = this.rawItems.lastIndexOf(name);
      if (i > -1) this.rawItems.splice(i, 1);
    },

    async purchaseItems() {
      const user = useUserStore();
      if (!user.name) return;

      console.log("Purchasing", this.items);
      const n = this.items.length;
      this.rawItems = [];

      return n;
    },
  },
});
```

This paradigm and CRDTs are easily compatible: The state in the state management
libraries corresponds to CRDT types, and Action corresponds to a set of CRDT
operations.

Thus, implementing UI state management through CRDTs does not require users to
change their habits. It also has many advanced features:

- Make states automatically synchronizable / support real-time collaboration.
- Like Git, maintain a complete distributed editing history.
- It can store an extensively large editing history with a low memory footprint
  and a compact encoding size. Below is an example.

With this, you can effortlessly implement products with real-time / async
collaboration and time machine features.

## Introduction to Loro

Loro is our CRDTs library, now open-sourced under a permissive license. We
believe a cooperative and friendly open-source community is key to creating
outstanding developer experiences.

We aim to make Loro simple to use, extensible, and maintain high performance.
The following is the latest status of Loro.

### CRDTs

We have explored extensively, supporting a range of CRDT algorithms that have
yet to be widely used.

#### OT-like CRDTs

> Update: This algorithm is now called Event Graph Walker (Eg-Walker)

Our CRDTs library is built on the brilliant concept of OT-like CRDTs from Seph
Gentle's [Diamond-types](https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types). Joseph Gentle
is currently writing a paper on it, which is worth looking forward to. Its
notable features include reducing the cost of local operations, easier
historical data reclamation, and sometimes lower storage and memory overhead.
However, it relies on high-performance algorithms to apply remote operations.
This design has great potential and we are excited about its future.

<details>
<summary>Brief Introduction to OT-like CRDT algorithms</summary>

To briefly introduce the concept of OT-like CRDTs, this part is complex and
requires some prior knowledge. I might not encapsulate it well.

The general idea of OT-like CRDTs is that they do not retain the CRDTs' data
structure (e.g., originLeft originRight information). When merging remote
operations, they return to the lowest common ancestor in the directed acyclic
graph history of local and remote, and from there, reapply each operation. This
process reconstructs the CRDTs structure, resolving conflicts arising from
parallel editing. Its advantage is that, since it doesn't need to retain these
CRDTs Meta information, local operations are virtually cost-free, like OT, where
only the index at which insertions and deletions occur needs to be saved. The
trade-off is a longer time for merging remote operations, but this issue can be
significantly mitigated with well-designed data structures and algorithms.
Moreover, since most parallel edits last only a short time, the lowest common
ancestor is not far, making the merging process quick.

The image below shows an example of merging versions 2@1 and 1@2 using this
algorithm on a DAG. The algorithm needs to revert to the lowest common ancestor
version 0@1 and apply all subsequent operations from there (a total of four
operations). For a better understanding of this image, refer to
[https://www.loro.dev/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive](https://www.loro.dev/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive)

</details>

#### Rich Text CRDTs

In May of this year, we open-sourced the
[crdt-richtext](https://github.com/loro-dev/crdt-richtext) project, integrating
the algorithms of [the rich text CRDT](https://loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext) and the
sequence CRDT [Fugue by Matthew Weidner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583). A
brief introduction to these two algorithms can be found in
[our blog at the time](https://www.notion.so/crdt-richtext-Rust-implementation-of-Peritext-and-Fugue-c49ef2a411c0404196170ac8daf066c0?pvs=21).

Based on our experience from previous projects, we have integrated a rich text
CRDT and Fugue into our framework in the current Loro. However, the biggest
challenge was that
[Peritext did not integrate well with OT-like CRDTs](https://github.com/inkandswitch/peritext/issues/31).
We have recently overcome this issue. We developed a new rich text CRDT
algorithm that can run on OT-like CRDTs and has passed the capabilities listed
in the Peritext paper's Criteria for rich text CRDTs, with no new issues
revealed in our current million fuzzing tests. We will write an article in the
future specifically to introduce this algorithm.

#### Movable Tree

We have also supported a movable tree CRDT. Synchronizing tree movements is
often complex due to the potential for circular references. Addressing this
issue in the distributed environment is even more challenging.

We implemented Martin Kleppmann's paper,
[_A Highly-Available Move Operation for Replicated Trees_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9563274/).
The idea of this algorithm is to sort all move operations, ensuring the ordering
is consistent across the replicas. Then, each operation is applied sequentially.
If an operation would cause a circular reference, it has no effect.

We found it to be elegant in design and also performant. The time complexity of
local operations is O(k) (k being the average tree depth, as circular reference
detection is required). For applying remote operations, which entails inserting
new operations into the sorted list, we must undo operations that are subsequent
in the ordering, apply the remote operation, and then redo the undone
operations, with a cost of O(km) (m being the number of operations to undo).

![Untitled](./loro-now-open-source/Untitled%201.gif)

<Caption>Visualization of applying a remote op</Caption>

Our tests show that local operations involving ten thousand random movements
among a thousand nodes take less than 10ms (tested on an M2 MAX chip). Moreover,
the cost of merging remote operations in this algorithm is similar to applying
remote operations in OT-like CRDTs, making it adoptable. We've also experimented
with [log-spaced snapshots](https://madebyevan.com/algos/log-spaced-snapshots/)
and immutable data structure approaches in our
[movable-tree project](https://github.com/loro-dev/movable-tree), concluding
that the undo + redo method is the fastest and the most memory-efficient.

### Data Structures

Designing and experimenting with data structures is routine in Loro's
development process.

We previously open-sourced
[generic-btree](https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree) and have redesigned
its structure for a more compact memory layout and cache-friendliness. Besides
its remarkable performance, its flexibility enables us to support various
information types required for Text, like utf16/Unicode code points/utf8, with
minimal code. We also extensively reuse it to fulfill various requirements,
highlighting Rust's impressive type expression capabilities.

Internally, we've
[separated the document's state from its history](https://www.loro.dev/docs/advanced/doc_state_and_oplog).
The state represents the current form of the document, akin to Git's HEAD
pointer, while the document's history resembles the complete operation history
behind Git. Hence, multiple document states can correspond to the same history.
This structure simplifies our code and facilitates future support for version
control.

Most of our optimizations thus far have focused on text manipulations,
historically one of the thorniest problems in CRDTs. In the future, we plan
optimizations for a wider range of real-world scenarios.

### The Future

![Untitled](./loro-now-open-source/Untitled%202.png)

We aim to reach version 1.0 by mid-next year, with much work to complete.

Given our limited workforce, we will first provide a WASM interface for web
developers to experiment with. Optimizing the WASM size is one of our goals for
this phase. Much of our design work is still ongoing, and we plan to stabilize
it in the next quarter, aiming for a simple yet powerful and flexible API. We
welcome ideas and suggestions in our
[community discussions](https://discord.gg/tUsBSVfqzf).

There's also extensive documentation work to make working with Loro enjoyable. A
potential indicator of success would be GPT generating sufficiently good code
based on our documentation.

Developing tools for developers is a challenging and exciting task. Many
developer tools and visualization methods in front-end development are
exceptionally good, and we hope to bring such experiences into the world of
CRDTs and local-first development. DevTools will reveal CRDTs' hidden states and
simplify control, making state maintenance and debugging a breeze.

We also plan to support richer CRDT semantics, including Movable Lists and
global undo/redo operations to support more diverse application scenarios.

## Seeking Collaborative Project Opportunities

Our design and optimization efforts need feedback from real-world applications.
If you are excited about a local-first future and think Loro can help you,

collaboration and ready to help.

If CRDTs are new to you, our article [What are CRDTs](/docs/concepts/crdt)
provides a brief introduction.

## Background

Loro is based on the
[Event Graph Walker (Eg-walker)](/docs/advanced/replayable_event_graph) algorithm
proposed by Joseph Gentle, but this algorithm cannot integrate the original
version of Peritext. This motivates us to create a new rich text algorithm. It
is independent of the specific List CRDTs, thus working nicely with Eg-walker, and is
developed on top of them to establish a rich text CRDT.

Before diving into the algorithm of Loro's rich text CRDT, I'd like to briefly
introduce Eg-walker and Peritext, and why Peritext cannot be used on Eg-walker.

<details>
<summary>Recap on List CRDTs</summary>

### Recap on List CRDTs

Unlike OT, most List-oriented CRDTs assign a unique ID to each item or
character, often corresponding to the operation ID of its insertion. With unique
IDs for each character, we can reliably reference a character or position
through its ID.

![](./loro-richtext/list_crdt_ids.png)

The unique ID eliminates concerns about consistent position descriptions during
synchronization. For instance, deletions are straightforward by specifying the
deleted character's ID, and insertions are described using the IDs of adjacent
characters. In cases of concurrent insertions at the same location, List CRDT
algorithms resolve the consistency issues.

![](./loro-richtext/list_crdt_insert.png)

![](./loro-richtext/list_crdt_delete.png)

However, a notable limitation of List CRDTs is the use of 'tombstones'. Upon
deletion of a character, it is not fully removed but replaced with a tombstone,
maintaining the ID's position. Depending on the algorithm, this tombstone may be
removed once all participating nodes acknowledge the deletion. However, it can
be challenging to determine if all peers have received the corresponding
deletion operation. This information often means additional overhead for many
CRDTs. Thus, the simplest solution is not to perform any tombstone collection.

### Brief Introduction to Event Graph Walker

Eg-walker is a novel CRDT algorithm introduced in:

> [Collaborative Text Editing with Eg-walker: Better, Faster, Smaller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14252)
> By: Joseph Gentle, Martin Kleppmann

Eg-walker is a novel CRDT algorithm that combines the strengths of both OT and CRDTs.
It has the distributed nature of CRDT that enables P2P collaboration and data
ownership. Moreover, it achieves minimal overhead in scenarios devoid of
concurrent edits, similar to OT.

import { ReactPlayer } from "../../components/video";

<ReactPlayer
  url="/static/REG.mp4"
  width={"100%"}
  muted={true}
  loop={true}
  controls={true}
  playing={true}
/>

Whether in real-time collaboration or multi-end synchronization, a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) forms over the history of these parallel edits, similar to
Git's history. The Eg-walker algorithm records the history of user edits on the DAG.

Unlike conventional CRDTs, Eg-walker can record just the original description of
operations, not the metadata of CRDTs. For instance, in text editing scenarios,
the [RGA algorithm] needs the op ID and [Lamport timestamp][Lamport] of the
character to the left to determine the insertion point. [Yjs]/Fugue, however,
requires the op ID of both the left and right characters at insertion. In
contrast, Eg-walker simplifies this by only recording the index at the time of
insertion. Loro, which uses [Fugue] upon Eg-walker, inherits these advantages.

An index is not a stable position descriptor, as the index of an operation can
be affected by other operations. For example, if you highlight content from
`index=x` to `index=y`, and concurrently someone inserts n characters at
`index=n` where `n<x`, then your highlighted range should shift to cover from
`x+n` to `y+n`. But Eg-walker can determine the exact position of this index by
replaying history. Thus, it can reconstruct the corresponding CRDT structure by
replaying history.

Reconstructing history might seem time-consuming, but Eg-walker can backtrack only
some. When merging updates from remote sources, it only needs to replay
operations parallel to the remote update, reconstructing the local CRDTs to
calculate the diff after applying remote operations to the current document.

The Eg-walker algorithm excels with its fast local update speeds and eliminate
concerns about tombstone collection in CRDTs.For instance, if an operation has
been synchronized across all endpoints, no new operations will occur
concurrently with it, allowing it to be safely removed from the history.

<summary>What is Fugue</summary>

Fugue is a new CRDT text algorithm, presented in
_[The Art of the Fugue: Minimizing Interleaving in Collaborative Text Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583)_
by
[Matthew Weidner](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Weidner%2C+M)
et al., nicely solves **the interleaving problem**.

The interleaving problem was proposed in the paper
_[Interleaving anomalies in collaborative text editors](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2019/03/25/papoc-interleaving-anomalies.html)_
by Martin Kleppmann et al.

An example of interleaving:

- A type "Hello " from left to right/right to left
- B type "Hi " from left to right/right to left
- The expected result: "Hello Hi " or "Hi Hello "
- The interleaving result may look like: "HHeil lo"
  - This happens when typing from right to left in RGA.

The [Fugue paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) summarizes the current state
of the interleaving problems in the table.

The interleaving problem sometimes are unsolvable when there are more than 2
sites. See [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) paper Appendix B, Proof of
Theorem 5 for detailed explanation.

However, we can still minimize the chance of interleaving. Fugue introduces the
concept of **maximal non-interleaving** and solves it with an elegant algorithm
that is easy to optimize. The definition of _maximal non-interleaving_ makes a
lot of sense to me and leaves little room for ambiguity. I won't reiterate the
definition here. But the basic idea is first to solve forward interleaving by
leftOrigin. If there is still ambiguity, then solve the backward interleaving by
rightOrigin. (The leftOrigin and rightOrigin refer to the ids of the original
neighbors when the character is inserted, just like Yjs)

</details>

### Brief Introduction to Peritext

[Peritext] was proposed by _Geoffrey Litt et al._ It's the first paper to
discuss rich text CRDTs. It can merge concurrent edits in rich text format while
[preserving users' intent as much as possible](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#preserving-the-authors-intent).
Its primary focus is merging the formats and annotations of rich text content,
such as bold, italic, and comments. It was implemented in [Automerge] and
[crdt-richtext].

> ð¡ The specific definition of user intent in the context of concurrent rich
> text editing can't be clearly explained in a few words. It's best understood
> through particular examples.

Peritext is designed to solve a couple of significant challenges:

Firstly, it addresses the anticipated problems arising from conflicting style
edits. For instance, consider a text example, "The quick fox jumped." If User A
highlights "The quick" in bold and User B highlights "quick fox jumped," the
ideal merge should result in the entire sentence, "The quick fox jumped," being
bold. However, existing algorithms might not meet this expectation, resulting in
either "The quick fox" or "The" and "jumped" being bold instead.

| Original Text                                | The quick fox jumped         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Concurrent Edit from A                       | **The quick** fox jumped     |
| Concurrent Edit from B                       | The **quick fox jumped**     |
| Expected Merged Result                       | **The quick fox jumped**     |
| Bad case from merging Markdown text directly | **The** quick **fox jumped** |
| Bad case from Yjs                            | **The quick** fox jumped     |

Additionally, Peritext manages conflicts between style and text edits. In the
same example, if User A highlights "The quick" in bold, but User B changes the
text to "The fast fox jumped," the ideal merge should result in "The fast" being
bold.

| Original Text          | The quick fox jumped     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Concurrent Edit from A | **The quick** fox jumped |
| Concurrent Edit from B | The fast fox jumped      |
| Expected Merged Result | **The fast** fox jumped  |

Whatâs more, Peritext takes into account different expectations for expanding
styles. For example, if you type after a bold text, you would typically want the
new text to continue being bold. However, if you're typing after a hyperlink or
a comment, you likely wouldn't want the new input to become part of the
hyperlink or comment.

<div style={{filter: "invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)"}}>
![Link style should not expand](./loro-richtext/Peritext.png)
</div>
<Caption>
Illustration of Peritext's internal state. It uses the IDs of the character's ops to record the style ranges. In the example, the bold mark has the range of `{ start: { type: "before", opId: "9@B" }, end: { type: "before", opId: "10@B" }}`
</Caption>

### Why Original Peritext Can't Be Directly Used with Eg-walker

On the one hand, Peritext's algorithm expresses style ranges
[through character OpIDs](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#generating-inline-formatting-operations).
Without replaying history, CRDTs based on Eg-walker cannot determine the specific
positions corresponding to these OpIDs.

On the other hand, it's not feasible to model Peritext on Eg-walker through replaying.
This is because Eg-walker's "local backtracking suffices" relies on the algorithm
satisfying "the same operation will produce the same effect, regardless of the
current state," which Peritext does not adhere to. For example, when inserting
the character "x" at position `p`, whether "x" is bold depends on "whether `p`
is surrounded by bold" and
"[whether the tombstones at `p` contain boundaries of bold and other styles](https://arc.net/l/quote/ifxpaand)."

## Loro's Rich Text CRDT

### Algorithm

Loro implements rich text using special control characters called 'style
anchors'. Each matching pair of start anchor and end anchor contains the
following information:

- The op ID of the style operation
- The style's key-value pair
- The style's [Lamport timestamp][Lamport]
- Style expansion behavior: Determines whether newly inserted text before or
  after the style boundaries should inherit the style.

The method to determine a character's style is as follows:

- Find all style anchor pairs that include the character, where each pair is
  created by the same style operation
- Aggregate pairs according to the key. There may be multiple style pairs with
  the same key but different values. In such cases, the value with the greatest
  Lamport timestamp is chosen (if Lamport timestamps are equal, then use the
  peer ID to break the tie)

Contrary to
[Yjs's method of using control characters](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#adding-control-characters-to-plain-text)
for rich text, our algorithm pairs start and end anchors when they originate
from the same style operation. This approach accurately handles the following
scenarios:

![overlap_bold](./loro-richtext/overlap_bold.png)

These special control characters are not exposed to the user; each control
character is effectively of zero length from the user's perspective. Our data
structure supports various methods of measuring text length for indexing text
content. Besides Unicode, UTF-16, and UTF-8, we also measure our rich text
length in `Entity length`. It treats each style anchor as an entity with a
length of 1 and measures plain text in Unicode length.

![len](./loro-richtext/len.png)

| Concept           | Definition                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Style Anchors     | Control characters used in Loro denote style boundaries' start and end. They are differentiated into start and end anchors, representing a style's beginning and end.          |
| Rich Text Element | A rich text element is either a span of text or a style anchor. A list of rich text elements represents the internal state of Loro's rich text.                                |
| Unicode Index     | A method of indexing text positions in rich text. In this method, the length of the text is measured in Unicode char length, and the length of style anchors is considered 0.  |
| Entity Index      | A method of indexing text positions in rich text. In this method, the length of the text is measured in Unicode char length, and the length of a style anchor is considered 1. |

#### Local Behavior

Multiple valid insertion points can exist when users insert text at a specific
Unicode index. It occurs due to style anchors, which are zero-length elements
from the user's perspective.

![Two Different Kinds of Indexes](./loro-richtext/two_index.png)

For example, in the case of `<b>Hello</b> world`, when a user inserts content at
Unicode `index=5`, they face the choice of inserting to the left or right of
`</b>`. If the user sets the expand behavior of bold to expand forward, the new
character will be inserted to the left of `</b>`, making the inserted text bold
as well.

When users delete text, Loro uses an additional mapping layer to avoid deleting
style anchors within the text range.

To model the deletion of a style, a new style anchor pair with a null value is
added.

We can implement the following optimizations to remove redundant style anchors:

- The style anchors that include no text can be removed.
- When styles completely negate each other, like a span of bold is canceled by a
  span of unbold, we can remove their style anchors.

All these behaviors happen locally, and the algorithm is independent of the
specific List CRDT.

##### Behavior When Inserting Text at Style Boundaries

Most modern rich text editors (Google Doc, Microsoft Word, Notion) behave as
follows: when new text is entered right after bold text, the new text should
inherit the bold style; when entered after a hyperlink, the new content should
not inherit the hyperlink style. Different styles have varying preferences for
text insertion positions, leading to potential conflicts. This is reflected in
the degree of freedom we have when inserting new text.

Users interact with rich text based on text-based indexes, like the Unicode
index. Since style anchors have a Unicode Length of 0, a Unicode index with n
style anchors presents n + 1 potential insertion positions.

We select the insertion position based on the following rules:

1. Insertions occur before a start anchor of a style that should not expand
   backward.
2. Insertions occur before style anchors that signify the end of bold-like marks
   (expand = "after" or expand = "both").
3. Insertions occur after style anchors that signify the end of link-like marks
   (expand = "none" or expand = "before").

Rule 1 should be prioritized over rules 2 and 3 to prevent
[the accidental creation of a new style](https://github.com/inkandswitch/peritext/issues/32).

The current method first scans forward to find the last position satisfying
rules 1 and 2.

Then, it scans backward to find the first position satisfying rule 3.

#### Merging Remote Updates

Loro treats style anchors as a special element and handles them using the same
List CRDT for resolving concurrent conflicts. The logic related to rich text is
independent of the particular List CRDT. Therefore, this algorithm can rely on
any List CRDT algorithm for merging remote operations. Loro utilizes the [Fugue]
List CRDT algorithm.

When new style anchors are inserted by remote updates, new styles are added; if
old style anchors are deleted, the corresponding old styles are removed.

#### Strong Eventual Consistency

The internal state of this algorithm consists of a list of elements, each either
a text segment or a style anchor. The rich text document is derived from this
internal state.

The internal state achieves strong eventual consistency through the upstream
List CRDT.

Identical internal states result in identical rich text documents. Hence, the
same set of updates will produce the same rich text documents, evidencing the
strong eventual consistency of this algorithm.

### Criteria in Peritext

[The Peritext paper](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/static/cscw-publication.pdf)
specifies the intent-preserving merge behavior for rich text inline format.
Loro's rich text algorithm successfully passes all test cases outlined therein.

#### 1. Concurrent Formatting and Insertion

| Name            | Text                |
| :-------------- | :------------------ |
| Origin          | Hello World         |
| Concurrent A    | **Hello World**     |
| Concurrent B    | Hello New World     |
| Expected Result | **Hello New World** |

Loro easily supports this case by treating style anchors as special elements
alongside text.

#### 2. Overlapping Formatting

| Name            | Text            |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Origin          | Hello World     |
| Concurrent A    | **Hello** World |
| Concurrent B    | Hel**lo World** |
| Expected Result | **Hello World** |

This case has been analyzed earlier. Since our style anchors contain style op ID
information, we know there are two bold segments: one from 0 to 5 and another
from 3 to 11, allowing us to merge them.

| Name            | Text                |
| :-------------- | :------------------ |
| Origin          | Hello World         |
| Concurrent A    | **Hello** World     |
| Concurrent B    | Hel*lo World*       |
| Expected Result | **Hel*lo*** _World_ |

Multiple style types are easily supported.

| Name            | Text                                                 | Note                |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Origin          | Hello World                                          |                     |
| Concurrent A    | **Hello World** <br /> Then <br /> **Hello** World   | Bold, then unbold   |
| Concurrent B    | Hello Wor**ld**                                      |                     |
| Expected Result | **Hello** Wor**ld** <br /> Or <br /> **Hello** World | Both are acceptable |

Like Peritext, we model unbolding by adding a new style with the key `bold` and
the value `null`. The final value of each style key on each character is
determined by the style with the greatest [Lamport] timestamp that includes the
character. Thus, it easily supports this case.

#### 3. Text Insertion at Span Boundaries

Insertion right after a bold style should result in the newly inserted text also
being bold.

<div style={{ filter: "invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)" }}>
  ![bold_expand](./loro-richtext/bold_expand.png)
</div>

However, insertion right after a link style should result in the newly inserted
text not having the hyperlink style.

<div style={{ filter: "invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)" }}>
  ![Link style should not expand](./loro-richtext/link_expand.png)
</div>

#### 4. Styles that Support Overlapping

<div style={{ filter: "invert(1)" }}>![](./loro-richtext/overlap_mark.png)</div>

The problem of overlapping styles is related to how we represent them.

We represent the rich text using
[Quill's Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/) format.

```ts no_run
[
  { insert: "Gandalf", attributes: { bold: true } },
  { insert: " the " },
  { insert: "Grey", attributes: { color: "#cccccc" } },
];
```

<Caption>An example of Quill's Delta format</Caption>

However, it cannot handle cases with multiple values assigned to the same key.
So, it's a headache to handle the styles that support overlapping.

![](./loro-richtext/overlap_comments.png)

For example, in the above case, the text "fox" is commented on by both Alice and
Bob. We can't represent it with Quill's Delta format directly. So the possible
workaround includes:

**Turn the attribute value into a list**

```ts no-run
[
  { insert: "The ", attributes: { comment: [{ ...commentA }] } },
  {
    insert: "fox",
    attributes: { comment: [{ ...commentA }, { ...commentB }] },
  },
  { insert: " jumped", attributes: { comment: [{ ...commentB }] } },
];
```

**Use op ID that creates the op as the key of the attribute**

```ts no-run
[
  { insert: "The ", attributes: { "id:0@A": { key: "comment", ...commentA } } },
  {
    insert: "fox",
    attributes: {
      "id:0@A": { key: "comment", ...commentA },
      "id:0@B": { key: "comment", ...commentB },
    },
  },
  {
    insert: " jumped",
    attributes: { "id:0@B": { key: "comment", ...commentA } },
  },
];
```

But both require special behaviors for both CRDT lib and for application code,
which are painful to work with.

Finally, we found that the optimal approach to represent an overlappable style
was to use `<key>:` as a prefix and allow users to assign a unique suffix to
create a distinct style key. This method simplifies the CRDTs library code, as
it doesn't require handling special cases. It effectively addresses scenarios
where multiple comments overlap and is also user-friendly for application
coding.

```ts no-run
[
  { insert: "The ", attributes: { "comment:alice": "Hi" } },
  {
    insert: "fox",
    attributes: { "comment:alice": "Hi", "comment:bob": "Jump" },
  },
  { insert: " jumped", attributes: { "comment:bob": "Jump" } },
];
```

Following is the example code in Loro:

```ts
const doc = new Loro();
doc.configTextStyle({
  comment: { expand: "none" },
});
const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "The fox jumped.");
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 7 }, "comment:alice", "Hi");
text.mark({ start: 4, end: 14 }, "comment:bob", "Jump");
expect(text.toDelta()).toStrictEqual([
  {
    insert: "The ",
    attributes: { "comment:alice": "Hi" },
  },
  {
    insert: "fox",
    attributes: {
      "comment:alice": "Hi",
      "comment:bob": "Jump",
    },
  },
  {
    insert: " jumped",
    attributes: { "comment:bob": "Jump" },
  },
  {
    insert: ".",
  },
]);
```

## Implementation of Loro's Rich Text Algorithm

The following is an overview of Loro's implementation as of January, 2024.

### Architecture of Loro

In line with the properties of Event Graph Walker, Loro uses `OpLog` and
`DocState` as the internal state.

`OpLog` is dedicated to recording history, while `DocState` only records the
current document state and does not include historical operation information.
When applying updates from remote sources, Loro uses the relevant operations
from `OpLog` and computes the diff through a `DiffCalculator`. This diff is then
applied to `DocState`. This architecture also makes time travel easier to
implement.

For more details, see the documentation on
[DocState and OpLog](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/doc_state_and_oplog).

![](./loro-richtext/apply_updates.png)

### Implementation of Loro's Rich Text CRDT

For rich text, Loro reuses the same `DiffCalculator` as Loro List, based on the
[Fugue] algorithm. As a result, the primary logic related to rich text is
concentrated in `DocState`. This includes expressing styles, inserting new
characters, and representing multiple index formats.

In the representation of rich text state, we distinguish between the data
structure `ContentTree`, which expresses the text (including style anchors), and
`StyleRangeMap`, which expresses styles.

![](./loro-richtext/text_state_arch.png)

Both structures are built on B+Trees.

`ContentTree` is responsible for efficient text finding, insertion, and
deletion. It can index specific insertion/deletion positions using
Unicode/UTF-8/UTF-16/Entity index. It does not store what specific style each
text segment should have.

We built the following B+Tree structure based on our
[generic-btree library](https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree) to express
text in memory:

- Each internal node in the B+Tree stores the Unicode char length, UTF-16
  length, UTF-8 length, and Entity length of its subtree. The Entity length
  considers the length of style anchors as 1, otherwise 0.
- The leaf nodes of the B+Tree are text or style anchors.

`StyleRangeMap` is responsible for efficient updating/querying of style ranges.

In the `StyleRangeMap` B+Tree expressing styles:

- Each internal node stores the `entity length` of its subtree.
- Each leaf node stores the collection of style information for the
  corresponding range and its `entity length.

Separating the text `ContentTree` and style `StyleRangeMap` into two structures
aims for better performance optimization. On rich text, style information is
often not abundant and tends to have good continuity, such as several paragraphs
having the same format, which can be expressed with a single leaf node. However,
our structure for storing text is unsuitable for leaf nodes with large content,
as conversion time between different encoding formats would become excessively
long.

When a user inserts a new character at `Unicode index` = i, the following
occurs:

- Find the position at `Unicode index` = i in `ContentTree`.
- Check if there are any adjacent style anchors at this position. If not,
  directly insert.
- If there are, decide whether to insert to the left or right of the
  corresponding style anchor based on its type and properties. If there are
  multiple such style anchors, insert them according to the previous section on
  ["Behavior When Inserting Text at Style Boundaries"](#behavior-when-inserting-text-at-style-boundaries).

### Testing

We have written tests for the criteria proposed by Peritext and passed all of
them.

To ensure the correctness of our CRDTs, we have added numerous fuzzing tests to
simulate different collaborative behaviors, synchronization behaviors, and
time-travel behaviors. These tests check for the strong eventual consistency and
the correctness of internal invariants. We run these fuzzing tests continuously
for several days after every critical modification to avoid oversights.

## How to Use

Before using the Loro's rich text module, it is necessary to define the
configuration for rich text styles, specifying the expand behavior for different
keys and whether overlap is allowed.

Here is an example of using Loro's rich text in JavaScript:

```typescript
const doc = new Loro();
doc.configTextStyle({
  bold: {
    expand: "after",
  },
  comment: {
    expand: "none",
    overlap: true,
  },
  link: {
    expand: "none",
  },
});

const text = doc.getText("text");
text.insert(0, "Hello world!");
text.mark({ start: 0, end: 5 }, "bold", true);
expect(text.toDelta()).toStrictEqual([
  {
    insert: "Hello",
    attributes: { bold: true },
  },
  {
    insert: " world!",
  },
] as Delta<string>[]);

text.insert(5, "!");
expect(text.toDelta()).toStrictEqual([
  {
    insert: "Hello!",
    attributes: { bold: true },
  },
  {
    insert: " world!",
  },
] as Delta<string>[]);
```

## Summary

This article presents Loro's rich text algorithm design and implementation. Its
correctness is readily demonstrable. It can be built upon any existing List CRDT
algorithm. It allows Loro to support rich text collaboration using
[Eg-walker](#brief-introduction-to-replayable-event-graph) and [Fugue], combining the
strengths of multiple CRDT algorithms.

We are continuously refining its design and actively seeking design partners. We
are open to all forms of feedback and constructive criticism. Should you have

Presenting a new Rust crate that combines [Peritext](https://inkandswitch.com/peritext) and [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583)'s power with impressive performance, tailored specifically for rich text. This crate's functionality is set to be incorporated into **[Loro](https://www.loro.dev/)**, a general-purpose CRDT library currently under development.

# Whatâs Peritext

[Peritext: A CRDT for Rich-Text Collaboration](https://inkandswitch.com/peritext)

Peritext is a novel rich-text CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) algorithm. It is capable of merging concurrent edits in rich text format while [preserving users' intent as much as possible](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#preserving-the-authors-intent). Its primary focus is on merging the formats and annotations of rich text content, such as bold, italic, and comments.

> ð¡ The specific definition of user intent in the context of concurrent rich text editing can't be clearly explained in a few words. it's best understood through specific examples.

Peritext is designed to solve a couple of significant challenges:

Firstly, it addresses the anticipated problems arising from conflicting style edits. For instance, consider a text example, "The quick fox jumped." If User A highlights "The quick" in bold and User B highlights "quick fox jumped," the ideal merge should result in the entire sentence, "The quick fox jumped," being bold. However, existing algorithms might not meet this expectation, resulting in either "The quick fox" or "The" and "jumped" being bold instead.

| Original Text                                | The quick fox jumped         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Concurrent Edit from A                       | **The quick** fox jumped     |
| Concurrent Edit from B                       | The **quick fox jumped**     |
| Expected Merged Result                       | **The quick fox jumped**     |
| Bad case from merging Markdown text directly | **The** quick **fox jumped** |
| Bad case from Yjs                            | **The quick** fox jumped     |

Additionally, Peritext manages conflicts between style and text edits. In the same example, if User A highlights "The quick" in bold, but User B changes the text to "The fast fox jumped," the ideal merge should result in "The fast" being bold.

| Original Text          | The quick fox jumped     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Concurrent Edit from A | **The quick** fox jumped |
| Concurrent Edit from B | The fast fox jumped      |
| Expected Merged Result | **The fast** fox jumped  |

Whatâs more, Peritext takes into account different expectations for expanding styles. For example, if you type after a bold text, you would typically want the new text to continue being bold. However, if you're typing after a hyperlink or a comment, you likely wouldn't want the new input to become part of the hyperlink or comment.

# Whatâs Fugue

Fugue is a new CRDT text algorithm, presented in _[The Art of the Fugue: Minimizing Interleaving in Collaborative Text Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583)_ by [Matthew Weidner](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Weidner%2C+M) et al., nicely solves **the interleaving problem**.

## The interleaving problem

The interleaving problem was proposed in the paper _[Interleaving anomalies in collaborative text editors](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2019/03/25/papoc-interleaving-anomalies.html)_ by Martin Kleppmann et al.

An example of interleaving:

- A type "Hello " from left to right/right to left
- B type "Hi " from left to right/right to left
- The expected result: "Hello Hi " or "Hi Hello "
- The interleaving result may look like: "HHeil lo"
  - This happens when typing from right to left in RGA.

The [Fugue paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) summarizes the current state of the interleaving problems in the table.

![Source: Weidner, M., Gentle, J., & Kleppmann, M. (2023). The Art of the Fugue: Minimizing Interleaving in Collaborative Text Editing. *ArXiv*. /abs/2305.00583](./images/richtext1.png)

The interleaving problem sometimes are unsolvable when there are more than 2 sites. See [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) paper Appendix B, Proof of Theorem 5 for detailed explanation.

![The case where the interleaving problem is unsolvable

However, we can still minimize the chance of interleaving. Fugue introduces the concept of **maximal non-interleaving** and solves it with an elegant algorithm that is easy to optimize. The definition of _maximal non-interleaving_ makes a lot of sense to me and leaves little room for ambiguity. I won't reiterate the definition here. But the basic idea is first to solve forward interleaving by leftOrigin. If there is still ambiguity, then solve the backward interleaving by rightOrigin. (The leftOrigin and rightOrigin refer to the ids of the original neighbors when the character is inserted, just like Yjs)

# CRDT-Richtext

Based on the algorithms of Peritext and Fugue, we made `crdt-richtext`, a lib written in Rust that provides a wasm interface. Itâs available on [crates.io](http://crates.io) and npm now.

## Example

```tsx
import { RichText } from "crdt-richtext-wasm";

const text = new RichText(BigInt(1));
text.insert(0, "ä½ å¥½ï¼ä¸çï¼");
text.insert(2, "å");
expect(text.toString()).toBe("ä½ å¥½åï¼ä¸çï¼");
text.annotate(0, 3, "bold", AnnotateType.BoldLike);
const spans = text.getAnnSpans();
expect(spans.length).toBe(2);
expect(spans[0].text).toBe("ä½ å¥½å");
expect(spans[0].annotations.size).toBe(1);
expect(spans[0].annotations.has("bold")).toBeTruthy();
expect(spans[1].text.length).toBe(4);

const b = new RichText(BigInt(2));
b.import(text.export(new Uint8Array()));
expect(b.toString()).toBe("ä½ å¥½åï¼ä¸çï¼");
```

## Data structure

We heavily use B-Trees to optimize our algorithm. We made a library called [generic-btree](https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree), which is written in safe Rust code, which provides a flexible foundation for our optimization efforts.

[https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree](https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree)

![The cached content inside B-Tree](./images/richtext3.png)

The cached content inside B-Tree

There are several common tasks we need to address in Text CRDT, including:

- Finding, inserting, or deleting content at a given index:
  - We use a BTree to look up and update the content
  - The time complexity is O(logN), where N is the length of the content
- Finding content with a given op ID:
  - We use a combination of HashMap and BTree
  - The time complexity if O(logN), where N is the number of operations
- Compressing content in memory:
  - To reduce the amount of memory used by storing every operation in raw format, we compress the content using the RLE tricks from Yjs and DiamondTypes.
    - The insight behind this compression is that neighboring inserts and deletions tend to be continuous, so we can merge them and store less metadata.
  - Commonly, every leaf node in the diagram contains a dozen of characters
- Converting index between UTF-16 and UTF-8:
  - In JS, the default encoding of a string is utf16, but in Rust, the default one is utf8. Although the WASM interface can help us convert the encoding of the string, we still need to convert the _index_ of the operation.
  - To solve this, `crdt-richtext` also store the UTF-16 length of the content in B-Tree. So we can query the B-Tree with either the utf8 index or the utf16 index.
- Storing the boundary of style/format/comments:
  - We use the same B-Tree to store the boundary, with each subtree corresponding to a span of text or tombstones. For each node in the tree, we store which annotations start before it, start after it, end before it, or end after it.
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Default, Clone)]
    pub struct ElemAnchorSet {
        start_before: FxHashSet<AnnIdx>,
        end_before: FxHashSet<AnnIdx>,
        start_after: FxHashSet<AnnIdx>,
        end_after: FxHashSet<AnnIdx>,
    }
    ```
  - This is basically the same optimization as Peritext, except we do it on the tree.

## Encoding

We use columnar encoding, which was first adopted to CRDTs by Martin Kelppmann [in automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-classic/pull/253). To make it easier in Rust, we created the lib [Serde Columnar: Ergonomic columnar storage encoding crate](https://www.notion.so/Serde-Columnar-Ergonomic-columnar-storage-encoding-crate-7b0c86d6f8d24e4da45a1e2ebd86741c?pvs=21).

## Heavily tested by libFuzzer

Test-Driven Development (TDD) provides an amazing development experience. If possible, I always write unit tests for a standalone module before moving forward. However, for algorithms like CRDTs, it is infeasible to list all possible cases manually but is easy to generate test cases automatically. This is where fuzzing tests come into play.

Some fuzzers can track coverage information and generate mutations on the input data to maximize code coverage. LibFuzzer can also identify memory leaks and UAF problems.

`[cargo-fuzz`](https://www.notion.so/crdt-richtext-Rust-implementation-of-Peritext-and-Fugue-c49ef2a411c0404196170ac8daf066c0?pvs=21) provides a user-friendly API for writing fuzzing tests, and it supports two fuzzers: libFuzzer and AFL. It makes the unstructured libFuzzer feel structured. So weâre able to write fuzzing tests in this way

```rust
use arbitrary::Arbitrary;

#[derive(Arbitrary, Clone, Debug, Copy)]
pub enum Action {
    Insert {
        actor: u8,
        pos: u8,
        content: u16,
    },
    Delete {
        actor: u8,
        pos: u8,
        len: u8,

We will run millions of Fuzzing Tests after making big changes. The fuzzer can help us extract the most useful thousands of tests to be included into the corpus. The minor changes can be verified by running the corpus.

We use fuzzing tests in Loro's CRDTs too. This test suite is like our safety net when we're making big tweaks to the code. It's great at spotting all our little slip-ups.

# Performance

## Benchmark

- Benchmark setup
  ### **B4: Real-world editing dataset**
  Replay a real-world editing dataset. This dataset contains the character-by-character editing trace of a large-ish text document, the LaTeX source of this paper:Â [https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960(opens in a new tab)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960)
  Source:Â [https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index)
  - 182,315 single-character insertion operations
  - 77,463 single-character deletion operations
  - 259,778 operations totally
  - 104,852 characters in the final document
    We simulate one client replaying all changes and storing each update. We measure the time to replay the changes and the size of all update messages (`updateSize`), the size of the encoded document after the task is performed (`docSize`), the time to encode the document (`encodeTime`), the time to parse the encoded document (`parseTime`), and the memory used to hold the decoded document in memory (`memUsed`).
  ### **[B4 x 100] Real-world editing dataset 100 times**
  Replay the [B4] dataset one hundred times. The final document has a size of over 10 million characters. As comparison, the book "Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire" is only 1.6 million characters long (including whitespace).
  - 18,231,500 single-character insertion operations
  - 7,746,300 single-character deletion operations
  - 25,977,800 operations totally
  - 10,485,200 characters in the final document

The benchmark was conducted on a 2020 M1 MacBook Pro 13-inch on 2023-05-11.

The complete benchmark result and code is available at https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/fugue-bench.

It is worth noting that:

- The benchmark for Automerge is based on `automerge-wasm`, which is not the latest version of Automerge 2.0.
- `crdt-richtext` and `fugue` are special-purpose CRDTs that tend to be faster and have a smaller encoding size.
- The encoding of `yjs`, `ywasm`, and `loro-wasm` still contains redundancy that can be compressed significantly. For more details, see [the full report](https://loro.dev/docs/performance/docsize).
- loro-wasm and fugue only support plain text for now

   * For Tree:

   *
   * For Map:

   *
   * For tree structures, index-based paths follow depth-first traversal order.
   * The indices start from 0 and represent the position of a node among its siblings.

   * @example
   * ```ts
   * import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
