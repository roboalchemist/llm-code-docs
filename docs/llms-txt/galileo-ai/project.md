What is a Galileo project?

Upon logging in to the Galileo console, you are presented with your latest [runs](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/concepts/run).

These runs sit inside of projects. Projects are a collection of runs within modules like Evaluate and Observe in Galileo. Projects are an easy way to organize multiple runs under a specific workflow, and can contain any number of runs. Projects are named upon creation, but can be renamed by editing their name inside of the project. The name of a project should reflect the goal of the project. Projects are a great way to organize and iterate your experimentation for a given goal.

To share or delete a project, first open the module it belongs to on the left panel of the Galileo console. Then, hover over the project and select either the share icon or the delete icon.

## Creating a Project

To create a project, follow the steps below:

1. Login to the Galileo Console

2. Hit + on the left panel

3. Choose the appropriate module

   1. Evaluate (for experimentation with LLMs, Chains, Agents etc.)

   2. Fine Tune (for high quality fine tuning)

   3. Observe (for state of the art monitoring leveraging Galileo metrics)

4. Give your project a relevant name and hit **Create Project**
