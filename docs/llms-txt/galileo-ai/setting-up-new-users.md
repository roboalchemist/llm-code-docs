# Setting Up New Users

> Learn how to onboard new users in Galileo deployments with detailed instructions on user roles, access control, and permissions management.

### What is a Galileo User?

Each person has their own account with Galileo with their own login credentials.

Each Galileo User needs to provide their own credentials to the Galileo client when training their models such that their runs are logged under, and visible in their individual Galileo console.

### How to create the Admin User?

You should have an Admin User created during the deployment step. If we did not create one, the Galileo console will prompt you to create the Admin User first:

</Frame>

### How to Add a new user?

The Admin User has the ability to invite users to set up their own accounts with Galileo.

### How to manage user permissions?

Go to "Settings & Permissions" to manage your users and groups. Check out this How To guide on defining [Access Controls](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/how-to/access-control).
