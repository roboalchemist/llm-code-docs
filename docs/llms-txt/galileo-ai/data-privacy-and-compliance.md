# Data Privacy And Compliance

> This page covers concerns regarding residency of data and compliances provided by Galileo.

## Security Standards

Clusters hosted by Galileo are hosted in Amazon Web Services, ensuring the highest degree of physical security and environmental control. All intermediate environments which transfer or store data are reviewed to meet rigid security standards.

## Incident Response, Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

Galileo has a well-defined incident response and disaster recovery policy. In the unlikely event of an incident, Galileo will:

* Assemble response team members, including two assigned on-call engineers available at all times of day

* Immediately revoke relevant access or passwords

* Notify Galileo's Engineering and Customer Success Teams

* Notify customers impacted of the intrusion and if/how their data was compromised

* Provide a resolution timeline

* Conduct an audit of systems to ascertain the source of the breach

* Refine existing practices to prevent future impact and harden systems

* Communicate the improvement plan to customers impacted

## Compliance

Galileo provides on-going training for employees for all information security practices and policies, and maintains measures to address violations of procedures. As part of onboarding and off-boarding team members, access controls are managed to ensure those in role are only given access to what the role requires.

Galileo is SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 compliant, and therefore we adhere to the requirements of this compliance throughout the year. These include independent audit.
