# Dependencies

> Understand Galileo deployment prerequisites and dependencies to ensure a smooth installation and integration across supported platforms.

### Core Dependencies

* Kubernetes Cluster: Galileo is deployed within a Kubernetes environment, leveraging various Kubernetes resources.

### Data Stores

* PostgreSQL: Used for persistent data storage (if not using AWS RDS or GCP CloudSQL).

* ClickHouse: A columnar database used for storing and querying large volumes of data efficiently. It supports analytics and real-time reporting.

* MinIO: Serves as the object storage solution (if not using AWS S3 or GCP Cloud Storage).

### Messaging

* RabbitMQ: Acts as the message broker for asynchronous communication.

### Monitoring and Logging

* Prometheus: For metrics collection and monitoring. This will also send metrics to Galileo's centralized Grafana server for observability.

* Prometheus Adapter: This component is crucial for enabling Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to use Prometheus metrics for scaling applications. It must be activated through the `.Values.prometheus_adapter.enabled` Helm configuration. Care should be taken to avoid conflicts with existing services, such as the metrics-server, potentially requiring resource renaming for seamless integration.

* Grafana: For visualizing metrics. Optional, as users might not require metric visualization.

* Fluentd: For logging and forwarding to AWS CloudWatch. Optional, depending on the logging and log forwarding requirements.

* Alertmanager: Manages alerts for the monitoring system. Optional, if no alerting is needed or a different alerting mechanism is in place.

Ensure that the corresponding Helm values (`prometheus_adapter.enabled`, `fluentd.enabled`, `alertmanager.enabled`) are configured according to your deployment needs.

### Networking

* Ingress NGINX: Manages external access to the services.

* Calico: Provides network policies.

* Cert-Manager: Handles certificate management.

### Configuration and Management

* Helm: Galileo leverages Helm for package management and deployment. Ensure Helm is configured correctly to deploy the charts listed above.

### Miscellaneous

* Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjusts the size of the Kubernetes cluster.

* Kube-State-Metrics: Generates metrics about the state of Kubernetes objects.

* Metrics Server: Aggregates resource usage data.

* Node Exporter: Collects metrics from the nodes.

* ClickHouse Keeper: Acts as the service for managing ClickHouse replicas and coordinating distributed tasks, similar to Zookeeper. Essential for ClickHouse high availability and consistency.
