# Create a Satellite

When you're ready to deploy your project to production, you'll need to create a [satellite](/docs/terminology.md#satellite).

1.  To get started, sign-in to the Juno [console](https://console.juno.build). If you are a new developer on Juno and the Internet Computer, you may be prompted to create your first anonymous [Internet Identity](/docs/terminology.md#internet-identity).
2.  Click **Launch a new satellite**.
3.  Enter a name for your satellite (note: this is for display purposes only and does not need to be unique).
4.  Confirm with **Create a Satellite.**
5.  The platform will then create your satellite and provision its resources.
6.  Once the process is complete, click **Continue** to access the overview page.

ð Youâre all set! You can now deploy your frontend app, static website, or publish your serverless functions to production.

â¡ï¸ Continue with the [deployment](/docs/category/deployment.md) guides to take the next step.
