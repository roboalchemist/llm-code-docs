# Create a Satellite

When you're ready to deploy your project to production, you'll need to create a [Satellite](/docs/terminology.md#satellite).

1.  To get started, sign-in to the Juno [Console](https://console.juno.build).
2.  Click **Launch your first Satellite**.
3.  Enter a name for your Satellite (note: this is for display purposes only and does not need to be unique).
4.  Select whether you're deploying a **Website** or **Application**.
5.  Confirm with **Create a Satellite.**
6.  The platform will then create your Satellite and provision its resources.
7.  Once the process is complete, click **Continue** to access the service page.

ð Youâre all set! You can now deploy your frontend app, static website, or publish your serverless functions to production.

â¡ï¸ Continue with the [deployment](/docs/category/deployment.md) guides to take the next step.

**Note:**

Choose **Website** if you're deploying a static site, blog, portfolio, etc.

Choose **Application** if your project needs user sign-in, data management, or serverless functions.

You can change this later in your Satellite "Hosting" settings.
