# Local Development

Juno offers something most platforms don't: a full local development environment that closely mirrors production.

## TL;DR

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime supported | Docker or Podman |
| Start emulator | `juno emulator start` |
| Stop emulator | `juno emulator stop` |
| Console UI URL | [http://localhost:5866](http://localhost:5866) |

---

## What the Emulator Includes

When you develop locally, you're running an emulator that includes the well known infrastructure services â including the actual administration Console UI.

This enables:

*   A development experience that mirrors mainnet, helping you build with confidence
*   A smooth dev loop, from prototype to deployment
*   A unique way to build, debug, and validate smart contract logic and frontend behavior â all in one place

## Before you begin

The emulator is a self-contained local environment that runs in a container managed entirely by Juno â using either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) under the hood.

Make sure your preferred runtime is installed on your machine:

*   [Docker: Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
*   [Docker: macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
*   [Docker: Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
*   [Podman: Installation guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

**Important:**

For MacBooks with M-series processors, if you aim to use **Docker**, it is important to install Docker Desktop **version 4.25.0 or later**, ideally the latest available version.

For **Podman**, we are not aware of any particular version requirements at this time.

---

## Getting Started

To run the emulator for local development, you need to have the Juno CLI installed.

If you haven't installed it yet, run:

*   npm
*   yarn
*   pnpm

```
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

```
yarn global add @junobuild/cli
```

```
pnpm add -g @junobuild/cli
```

Then, in your project folder, start the local emulator with:

```
juno emulator start
```

This will launch the emulator along with all the services needed to develop your project.

We recommend running this in a dedicated terminal window or tab, while your frontend project (e.g. using Vite or Next.js) runs separately using npm run dev or similar.

To stop the emulator, run:

```
juno emulator stop
```

**Note:**

While you could technically start the emulator using `docker run` or `podman run`, we recommend using the Juno CLI to manage the emulator lifecycle. It handles important checks, sets the correct configuration, and ensures everything runs as expected.

## Available Images

Juno provides two local environments. Most developers should start with **Skylab**, but Satellite is available for advanced or specialized workflows.

### ð§ª Skylab: Full Local Stack (Recommended)

The `junobuild/skylab` image is the default and recommended environment. It mirrors the production stack and includes everything needed for end-to-end development.

Use it for the full experience, including the Console UI and supporting infrastructure.

### âï¸ Satellite: Minimal Setup

The `junobuild/satellite` image is a lightweight alternative that runs a single Satellite. It skips the Console UI and supporting infrastructure.

Use it when you need a faster, minimal setup focused on CI pipelines or automated testing.

**Note:**

The default (auto-deployed) Satellite is available with a predefined canister ID `jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai`.

### ð Feature Comparison

The table below shows which modules are available in each image and helps clarify what's included when running locally with Skylab or Satellite.

| Module | Skylab | Satellite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Console (Backend) | â   | â   |
| Console (UI) | â   | â   |
| Create Satellites / Orbiters via Console UI | â   | â   |
| Default (auto-deployed) Satellite | â   | â   |
| Observatory | â   | â   |

Likewise, not all services are mounted by default - but they can be turned on (or off).

| Service | Skylab | Satellite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Identity | â   | â   |
| ICP Ledger | â   | â   |
| ICP Index | â   | â   |
| NNS Governance | â   | â   |
| Cycles Minting (CMC) | â   | â   |
| Cycles Ledger | â   | â   |
| Cycles Index | â   | â   |
| Registry | â   | â   |
| SNS | â   | â   |
| NNS-dapp | â   | â   |

## Console UI

When using the `junobuild/skylab` image, the Console UI becomes available by default at:

```
http://localhost:5866/
```

Once the emulator is running (`juno emulator start`), visit this URL in your browser to explore the Console â where you can create and manage Satellites, and explore features like Datastore, Authentication, Storage, and more.

---

## Hot Reload

The local container supports live reloading. When you modify your [configuration](/docs/reference/emulator/satellite.md#configuration) or build custom [Functions](/docs/build/functions.md) to enhance Juno's capabilities with serverless features, those changes will be automatically redeployed.

---

## Configuration Options

To customize the behavior of the local emulatorâsuch as changing ports, setting a persistent volume name, or overriding the runner image â refer to the [Emulator Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration.md#emulator-configuration) section.

There you'll find detailed information about available options including:

*   âï¸ Runner settings (e.g. image, platform, volume)
*   ð Custom port mappings
*   ð Shared folders and hot reloading
*   ð§ª CI and test environment tips

---

## Usage

During local development - `npm run dev` - your app connects to the local emulator (container) by default â no extra configuration needed.

### Automatic Configuration (Recommended)

The recommended way to connect your app to the local container run in the emulator or any environment is by using the [plugins](/docs/reference/plugins.md).

They automatically resolve the Satellite ID and other environment variables and handle initialization for you.

### Manual Initialization

If you're not using a plugin and are initializing Juno manually, here's how to configure it to use the local container:

```
import { initSatellite } from "@junobuild/core";const container = import.meta.env.DEV === true;await initSatellite({  satelliteId: container    ? "jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai"    : "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",  container});
```

### Opt-out

The SDK automatically uses the emulator in local development. If you want to disable that behavior and connect directly to a remote canister (e.g. in CI or production testing), you can do:

```
await initSatellite({  satelliteId: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",  container: false});
```

---

## Administration

The admin server running on port `5999` provides a variety of internal management. Below are some tips and example scripts to make use of this little server.

### Get Cycles

If you're using the full environment, the Console UI includes a "Get Cycles" button in the wallet. It's a quick way to get Cycles out of the box.

![A screenshot of the wallet with the Get Cycles call to action of Console UI in dev mode](/assets/images/wallet-2337251849c790b75db91656c65e61d5.png)

You might want to transfer some Cycles from the ledger to a specified principal, which can be particularly useful when you're just getting started developing your app and no users currently own Cycles. This can be achieved by querying:

```
http://localhost:5999/ledger/transfer/?to=$PRINCIPAL&ledgerId=um5iw-rqaaa-aaaaq-qaaba-cai&amount330000000000000
```

For example, you can use the following script:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash# Check if a principal is passed as an argument; otherwise, prompt for itif [ -z "$1" ]; then  read -r -p "Enter the Wallet ID (owner account, principal): " PRINCIPALelse  PRINCIPAL=$1fi# Make a transfer request to the admin servercurl "http://localhost:5999/ledger/transfer/?to=$PRINCIPAL"
```
