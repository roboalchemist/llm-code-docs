# Review Workflows

The Review Workflows feature allows you to create and manage workflows for your various content-types. Each workflow can consist of any review stages for your content, enabling your team to collaborate in the content creation flow from draft to publication.

For the review workflows to be usable in the [Content Manager](/cms/features/content-manager), the default one should be configured or a new one should be created.

The default workflow is configured to have 4 stages: To do, In progress, Ready to review, and Reviewed. All 4 stages can be edited, reordered or deleted as needed, and it is also possible to add new stages.

### Creating a new workflow

2. In the workflow edit interface, configure the new workflow:
