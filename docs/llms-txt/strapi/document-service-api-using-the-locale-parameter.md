# Document Service API: Using the `locale` parameter

By default the [Document Service API](/cms/api/document-service) returns the default locale version of documents (which is 'en', i.e. the English version, unless another default locale has been set for the application, see [Internationalization (i18n) feature](/cms/features/internationalization)). This page describes how to use the `locale` parameter to get or manipulate data only for specific locales.

## Get a locale version with `findOne()` {#find-one}

If a `locale` is passed, the [`findOne()` method](/cms/api/document-service#findone) of the Document Service API returns the version of the document for this locale:

</ApiCall>

If no `status` parameter is passed, the `draft` version is returned by default.

## Get a locale version with `findFirst()` {#find-first}

To return a specific locale while [finding the first document](/cms/api/document-service#findfirst) matching the parameters with the Document Service API:

</ApiCall>

If no `status` parameter is passed, the `draft` version is returned by default.

## Get locale versions with `findMany()` {#find-many}

When a `locale` is passed to the [`findMany()` method](/cms/api/document-service#findmany) of the Document Service API, the response will return all documents that have this locale available.

If no `status` parameter is passed, the `draft` versions are returned by default.

</ApiCall>

<summary>Explanation:</summary>

Given the following 4 documents that have various locales:

- Document A:
  - en
  - `fr`
  - it
- Document B:
  - en
  - it
- Document C:
  - `fr`
- Document D:
  - `fr`
  - it

`findMany({ locale: 'fr' })` would only return the draft version of the documents that have a `‘fr’` locale version, that is documents A, C, and D.

</ApiCall>

## `delete()` locale versions {#delete}

Use the `locale` parameter with the [`delete()` method](/cms/api/document-service#delete) of the Document Service API to delete only some locales. Unless a specific `status` parameter is passed, this deletes both the draft and published versions.

</ApiCall>

### Unpublish all locale versions

</ApiCall>

</ApiCall>

## `discardDraft()` for locale versions {#discard-draft}

To discard draft data only for some locales versions of a document with the [`discardDraft()` method](/cms/api/document-service#discarddraft) of the Document Service API, pass `locale` as a parameter:

### Discard draft for a locale version

To discard draft data for a specific locale version of a document and override it with data from the published version for this locale, pass the `locale` as a parameter to `discardDraft()`:

</ApiCall>

</ApiCall>

## `count()` documents for a locale {#count}

To count documents for a specific locale, pass the `locale` along with other parameters to the [`count()` method](/cms/api/document-service#count) of the Document Service API.

If no `status` parameter is passed, draft documents are counted (which is the total of available documents for the locale since even published documents are counted as having a draft version):

```js
// Count number of published documents in French
strapi.documents('api::restaurant.restaurant').count({ locale: 'fr' });
```
