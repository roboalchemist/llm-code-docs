# User walkthrough

This tutorial guides you through the complete workflow of creating a data center topology using Infrahub's design-driven automation. You'll create a new branch, load a topology design, run a generator to create infrastructure, review the changes, and merge them to the main branch.

By the end of this walkthrough, you'll understand how to use Infrahub's branch-based workflow to safely design, validate, and deploy network infrastructure.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

* Completed the [installation guide](/demo-dc/install.md) and have Infrahub running
* Loaded the bootstrap data and schemas
* Access to the Infrahub web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

## What you'll accomplish[​](#what-youll-accomplish "Direct link to What you'll accomplish")

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Load a data center design (DC-3)
3. Wait for the automatic generator to create devices, interfaces, and connections
4. Create a proposed change
5. Review the generated artifacts and validation results
6. Merge the changes to the main branch

## Step 1: Create a new branch[​](#step-1-create-a-new-branch "Direct link to Step 1: Create a new branch")

All changes in Infrahub happen in branches. This allows you to work on infrastructure changes safely without affecting the main branch until you're ready.

* Web Interface
* CLI

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Click on the branch selector in the top-right corner (shows "main" by default)
3. Click **Create Branch**
4. Enter branch name: `add-dc3`
5. Click **Create**

You should see a success message confirming the branch was created.

Create the branch from the command line:

```
uv run infrahubctl branch create add-dc3
```

You should see a success message confirming the branch was created.

tip

Branch names should be descriptive and indicate what changes you're making, like `add-dc3`, `update-security-policies`, or `fix-bgp-config`.

## Step 2: Switch to your new branch[​](#step-2-switch-to-your-new-branch "Direct link to Step 2: Switch to your new branch")

In the web interface:

1. Click the branch selector in the top-right
2. Select `add-dc3` from the list
3. The interface should now show `add-dc3` as the active branch

info

All subsequent actions will be performed on the `add-dc3` branch until you switch back to another branch.

## Step 3: load the DC-3 design[​](#step-3-load-the-dc-3-design "Direct link to Step 3: load the DC-3 design")

The DC-3 design is a pre-configured data center topology specification that defines:

* A data center named "DC-3"
* Spine-leaf fabric architecture
* Device roles and platform assignments
* IP address pools and subnets
* BGP autonomous system configuration

Load the design data onto your branch:

```
uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-arista-s.yml --branch add-dc3
```

Watch the output for success messages. You should see confirmations that the topology data has been loaded.

### Verify the design loaded[​](#verify-the-design-loaded "Direct link to Verify the design loaded")

In the web interface:

1. Ensure you're on the `add-dc3` branch
2. Navigate to **Network Topologies → Deployments → Data center**
3. You should see a new entry for **DC-3**
4. Click on DC-3 to view its properties

The design specifies high-level parameters like:

* Data center name and location
* Number of spines and leaves
* Underlay routing protocol (eBGP or OSPF)
* Addressing schemes

### Multi-vendor support[​](#multi-vendor-support "Direct link to Multi-vendor support")

This demo supports multiple network device vendors with pre-configured data center designs. The DC-3 topology you just loaded uses Arista EOS switches, but the demo can generate configurations for several other vendors.

**Available vendor designs:**

* **Arista EOS** - The default DC-3 design with Arista switches (`objects/dc/dc-arista-s.yml`)
* **Cisco NX-OS** - The DC-2 design (`objects/dc/dc-cisco-s.yml`)
* **Juniper JunOS** - DC-5 design with Juniper switches
* **SONiC NOS** - DC-4 design with EdgeCore switches running SONiC

**Using alternative vendor designs:**

To explore Arista EOS configurations, you can use the automated demo command:

```
uv run invoke demo-dc-arista
```

This command creates a branch, loads the Arista design, waits for generator completion, then creates a proposed change.

For other vendors, load the design files directly:

```
# Juniper design (DC-5)
uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-juniper-s.yml --branch add-dc5

# SONiC design (DC-4)
uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-sonic-border-leafs.yml --branch add-dc4
```

Each vendor design generates appropriate configurations for that platform's CLI syntax and features. The same workflow (branch creation, design loading, generator execution, proposed change, merge) applies regardless of vendor.

## Step 4: Wait for automatic generator execution[​](#step-4-wait-for-automatic-generator-execution "Direct link to Step 4: Wait for automatic generator execution")

When you loaded the DC-3 design in Step 3, Infrahub automatically triggered a generator action that transforms the abstract design into concrete infrastructure objects including devices, interfaces, IP addresses, and routing configurations.

This automation is configured through an event action (defined in `objects/events/98_generator_action.yml`) that runs the `create_dc` generator whenever a data center topology is created or updated.

### Monitor generator progress[​](#monitor-generator-progress "Direct link to Monitor generator progress")

Generator execution can take several minutes as it creates hundreds of objects. Monitor the task status:

1. Navigate to **System → Tasks** in the left sidebar
2. Find your generator task in the list (look for `create_dc`)
3. Watch the status change from "Pending" to "Running" to "Completed"

info

Generator actions are event-driven automations configured in Infrahub. When you load a data center topology object, the event system automatically triggers the `create_dc` generator. This eliminates the need for manual generator execution and ensures consistency across deployments.

tip

Generators create infrastructure following best practices. For DC-3, the create\_dc generator will create spine switches, leaf switches, border leafs, management connections, fabric peering, loopback interfaces, and BGP configurations.

## Step 5: Review generated infrastructure[​](#step-5-review-generated-infrastructure "Direct link to Step 5: Review generated infrastructure")

Once the generator completes, explore what was created:

### View devices[​](#view-devices "Direct link to View devices")

1. Navigate to **Device Management → Infrastructure → All Devices**

2. You should see multiple devices created:

   <!-- -->

   * Spine switches (typically 2 or more)
   * Leaf switches (typically 4 or more)
   * Border leaf switches (typically 2)

### View interfaces[​](#view-interfaces "Direct link to View interfaces")

Click on any device to see its details including:

* Physical and loopback interfaces
* IP addresses assigned to each interface
* Interface descriptions and roles

### View IP prefixes[​](#view-ip-prefixes "Direct link to View IP prefixes")

Navigate to **IP Address Management → IP Prefixes** to see:

* Management network prefixes
* Loopback prefixes
* Underlay point-to-point link prefixes

### View routing[​](#view-routing "Direct link to View routing")

Navigate to **Routing** sections to see:

* BGP peer groups
* BGP sessions between spines and leaves
* Autonomous system assignments

## Step 6: Create a proposed change[​](#step-6-create-a-proposed-change "Direct link to Step 6: Create a proposed change")

Now that you've made changes on your branch, create a proposed change to merge them into main. Proposed changes provide a review mechanism with diffs, validation checks, and artifact generation.

### Create the proposed change[​](#create-the-proposed-change "Direct link to Create the proposed change")

1. Navigate to **Proposed Changes**

2. Click **New Proposed Change**

3. Fill in the form:

   <!-- -->

   * **Name**: `Add DC-3 data center`
   * **Source Branch**: `add-dc3`
   * **Destination Branch**: `main`
   * **Description** (optional): `This change adds the DC-3 data center with spine-leaf fabric`

4. Click **Create Proposed Change**

### Understanding what happens next[​](#understanding-what-happens-next "Direct link to Understanding what happens next")

When you create a proposed change, Infrahub automatically:

* Creates a diff showing all objects added, modified, or deleted
* Runs validation checks defined in your checks
* Regenerates all artifacts affected by the changes
* Runs repository checks if configured

## Step 7: Review validations and artifacts[​](#step-7-review-validations-and-artifacts "Direct link to Step 7: Review validations and artifacts")

Navigate to your proposed change to review the results:

### View the diff[​](#view-the-diff "Direct link to View the diff")

1. Click on the **Files** or **Diff** tab

2. Review all the objects that will be created when you merge

3. You should see hundreds of additions including:

   <!-- -->

   * Devices
   * Interfaces
   * IP addresses
   * BGP configurations
   * Routing protocols

### Check validation results[​](#check-validation-results "Direct link to Check validation results")

1. Click on the **Checks** or **Validations** tab
2. Review the validation results
3. All checks should pass with a green checkmark
4. If any checks fail, review the error messages and fix issues before merging

Common validations include:

* **Spine connectivity checks** - Verify all spines are properly connected
* **Leaf connectivity checks** - Verify all leaves are connected to all spines
* **IP address uniqueness** - Ensure no duplicate IP assignments
* **BGP configuration** - Validate BGP peer groups and sessions

### View generated artifacts[​](#view-generated-artifacts "Direct link to View generated artifacts")

1. Click on the **Artifacts** tab

2. You should see generated artifacts including:

   <!-- -->

   * **Device configurations** (one per device)

     <!-- -->

     * Spine, leaf, and border-leaf configurations in native vendor CLI format
     * For Arista and Juniper leaf switches, additional OpenConfig-formatted configurations demonstrating multi-format output

   * **Topology cabling matrix** (CSV format) - Complete cabling plan with source/destination interfaces

   * **Containerlab topology file** - Virtual lab topology definition for testing configurations

Click on any artifact to view its content. For example, view a spine configuration to see the generated CLI commands.

**Multi-format configuration rendering:**

Infrahub's transformation system can generate multiple configuration formats from the same source data. For Arista EOS and Juniper JunOS leaf switches, you'll find both:

* **Native CLI format** - Vendor-specific command syntax ready for deployment
* **OpenConfig format** - Standardized, vendor-neutral YANG-based configuration

This demonstrates how a single data model in Infrahub can produce multiple output formats, enabling flexibility in deployment methods (traditional CLI, NETCONF, gNMI, etc.) without duplicating source data.

**Infrastructure artifacts:**

Beyond device configurations, the generator creates supporting artifacts:

* **CSV cabling matrix** - Documents physical connectivity between all devices and interfaces, useful for operations teams during installation and troubleshooting
* **Containerlab topology file** - Enables spinning up virtual lab environments that mirror your production topology for testing and validation

tip

Artifacts are regenerated automatically when you create a proposed change. This ensures they always reflect the latest data.

## Step 8: Merge the proposed change[​](#step-8-merge-the-proposed-change "Direct link to Step 8: Merge the proposed change")

Once you've reviewed everything and all validations pass, you're ready to merge:

1. In the proposed change view, click the **Merge** button
2. Confirm the merge in the dialog
3. Wait for the merge task to complete

The merge process:

* Applies all changes from the source branch to the destination branch
* Runs any post-merge hooks or actions
* Updates the main branch with your new infrastructure

### Verify the merge[​](#verify-the-merge "Direct link to Verify the merge")

1. Switch back to the **main** branch using the branch selector
2. Navigate to **Device Management → Infrastructure → All Devices**
3. You should now see all the DC-3 devices in the main branch
4. Navigate to **Services → Topology Deployments → Data center**
5. Verify that DC-3 appears in the main branch

## Step 9: View device configurations[​](#step-9-view-device-configurations "Direct link to Step 9: View device configurations")

Now that DC-3 is in the main branch, view the generated device configurations:

1. Ensure you're on the **main** branch
2. Navigate to **Device Management → Infrastructure → All Devices**
3. Click on a spine device (for example, `dc3-spine1`)
4. Look for an **Artifacts** section or tab
5. Click on the spine configuration artifact

You should see a complete device configuration including:

* Interface configurations
* IP addressing
* BGP configuration
* OSPF configuration (if using OSPF underlay)
* VxLAN EVPN configuration
