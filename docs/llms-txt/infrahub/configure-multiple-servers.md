# How to Configure Multiple Infrahub Servers

If you need to work with multiple Infrahub environments (development, staging, production), this guide shows you how to configure and manage multiple server connections in the VSCode extension.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* Infrahub VSCode extension installed
* Access to multiple Infrahub servers
* API tokens for each server (if authentication is required)

## Step 1: Open extension settings[​](#step-1-open-extension-settings "Direct link to Step 1: Open extension settings")

Open your VSCode settings configuration:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"
3. Press Enter

## Step 2: Add multiple server configurations[​](#step-2-add-multiple-server-configurations "Direct link to Step 2: Add multiple server configurations")

Add your server configurations to the settings file:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Staging",
      "address": "https://staging.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN}"
    }
  ]
}
```

tip

If you're using a development server with a self-signed certificate, you can disable certificate verification by adding `"tls_insecure": true` to the server configuration. **This should only be used in development environments.**

## Step 3: Set up environment variables[​](#step-3-set-up-environment-variables "Direct link to Step 3: Set up environment variables")

For security, use environment variables for API tokens:

### On macOS and Linux[​](#on-macos-and-linux "Direct link to On macOS and Linux")

Add to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```
export INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN="your-dev-token"
export INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN="your-staging-token"
export INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN="your-prod-token"
```

Then reload your shell or restart VSCode.

### On windows[​](#on-windows "Direct link to On windows")

Using PowerShell:

```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN', 'your-dev-token', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN', 'your-staging-token', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN', 'your-prod-token', 'User')
```

Restart VSCode after setting environment variables.

## Step 4: Verify all connections[​](#step-4-verify-all-connections "Direct link to Step 4: Verify all connections")

1. Open the Infrahub Servers tree view in the Activity Bar
2. You should see all three servers listed
3. Expand each server to verify it can retrieve branches
4. Check the status bar - it shows the first server's connection status

## Step 5: Switch between servers for queries[​](#step-5-switch-between-servers-for-queries "Direct link to Step 5: Switch between servers for queries")

When executing GraphQL queries:

1. Select the play icon next to the query
2. You'll be prompted to select a server from your configured list
3. Choose the appropriate environment
4. Select the branch to query against

## Advanced configuration[​](#advanced-configuration "Direct link to Advanced configuration")

### Using different schemas per environment[​](#using-different-schemas-per-environment "Direct link to Using different schemas per environment")

Configure different schema directories for each environment:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Server groups with naming conventions[​](#server-groups-with-naming-conventions "Direct link to Server groups with naming conventions")

Use clear naming conventions to organize servers:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "[LOCAL] Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000"
    },
    {
      "name": "[AWS] US-East-1 Staging",
      "address": "https://staging-us-east-1.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_AWS_STAGING_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "[AWS] US-East-1 Production",
      "address": "https://us-east-1.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_AWS_PROD_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "[Azure] Europe-West Production",
      "address": "https://eu-west.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_AZURE_PROD_TOKEN}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Working with self-signed certificates[​](#working-with-self-signed-certificates "Direct link to Working with self-signed certificates")

For development or testing environments using self-signed SSL certificates, you can disable certificate verification:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development (Self-Signed)",
      "address": "https://dev.infrahub.local",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}",
      "tls_insecure": true
    }
  ]
}
```

warning

The `tls_insecure` option disables TLS certificate verification, which makes connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. **Never use this option for production servers.** Only use it in controlled development environments with self-signed certificates.

## Validation[​](#validation "Direct link to Validation")

To verify your configuration is working correctly:

1. **Check Status Bar**: The first server's status appears in the status bar
2. **Tree View**: All servers should appear in the Infrahub Servers tree view
3. **Branch Listing**: Expanding each server should show its branches
4. **Query Execution**: Test a query against each server

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### Server not appearing in tree view[​](#server-not-appearing-in-tree-view "Direct link to Server not appearing in tree view")

* Save your settings.json file
* Reload VSCode window (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`)
* Check for JSON syntax errors in settings

### Authentication failures[​](#authentication-failures "Direct link to Authentication failures")

* Verify environment variables are set correctly:

  ```
  echo $INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN  # macOS/Linux
  echo %INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN%  # Windows CMD
  ```

* Ensure tokens have necessary permissions

* Check token expiration dates

### Connection timeouts[​](#connection-timeouts "Direct link to Connection timeouts")

* Verify server URLs are accessible from your network
* Check for proxy/firewall restrictions
* Ensure VPN connection if required

### Certificate verification errors[​](#certificate-verification-errors "Direct link to Certificate verification errors")

If you encounter certificate errors with development servers:

* For self-signed certificates, add `"tls_insecure": true` to the server configuration
* For production servers with certificate issues, fix the certificate rather than disabling verification
* Check that your system's CA certificate store is up to date
