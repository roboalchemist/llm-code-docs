# Feature Flags

Emma uses feature flags to enable experimental and beta functionality. This allows you to try new features while maintaining stability in production environments.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Feature flags in Emma control access to:

* **Experimental features** - Early implementations that may change significantly
* **Beta features** - Stable implementations undergoing final testing
* **Advanced features** - Complex functionality for power users

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Set feature flags using the `EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS` environment variable:

```
# Single feature
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder"

# Multiple features (comma-separated)
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder,template_builder"
```

## Feature flag management[​](#feature-flag-management "Direct link to Feature flag management")

### Checking active flags[​](#checking-active-flags "Direct link to Checking active flags")

Emma displays active feature flags in several places:

**Settings Panel:**

* Lists all enabled flags
* Shows feature status (Alpha, Beta, Experimental)
* Provides links to feature documentation

**Feature Indicators:**

* Icons next to experimental features
* Tooltips explaining feature status
* Warnings about stability

### Dynamic configuration[​](#dynamic-configuration "Direct link to Dynamic configuration")

Some feature flags can be toggled at runtime:

**Session-level flags** (temporary):

* Set via URL parameters: `?features=query_builder,template_builder`
* Override environment variables for testing
* Reset when browser session ends

**User preferences** (persistent):

* Stored in browser local storage
* Survive browser restarts
* Can be cleared via settings panel

### Validation and error handling[​](#validation-and-error-handling "Direct link to Validation and error handling")

Emma validates feature flags on startup:

**Valid flag formats:**

```
# Correct
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder,template_builder"

# Also correct (spaces are stripped)
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder, template_builder"
```

**Invalid configurations:**

```
# Unknown flags are ignored with warnings
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="invalid_flag,query_builder"
# Warning: Unknown feature flag 'invalid_flag' ignored

# Empty values are acceptable
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS=""
```

## Best practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")

### Development environments[​](#development-environments "Direct link to Development environments")

**Enable experimental features** for testing:

```
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder,template_builder,ai_suggestions"
```

**Benefits:**

* Access to latest functionality
* Opportunity to provide feedback
* Early adoption of useful features

**Considerations:**

* Features may break or change
* Performance may be sub-optimal
* Some features require additional setup

### Production environments[​](#production-environments "Direct link to Production environments")

**Use only stable features** in production:

```
# Only enable well-tested features
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="advanced_import"
```

**Recommended approach:**

1. Test features in development first
2. Enable beta features in staging
3. Only use stable features in production
4. Monitor for issues after enabling new features

### Team deployments[​](#team-deployments "Direct link to Team deployments")

**Coordinate feature usage** across teams:

* Document which features are enabled in each environment
* Communicate feature changes to team members
* Provide training for new experimental features
* Establish rollback procedures
