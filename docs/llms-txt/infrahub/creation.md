# Creating a new sync instance

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a new sync instance for infrahub-sync, allowing you to synchronize data between your source and destination systems efficiently.

## Step 1: Define basic configuration[​](#step-1-define-basic-configuration "Direct link to Step 1: Define basic configuration")

Start by defining your synchronization source and destination in a YAML configuration file.

```
---
name: example-sync-task

source:
  name: nautobot
  settings:
    url: "https://nautobot.example.com"
    token: "NAUTOBOT_TOKEN" # This can also be loaded from environment variables

destination:
  name: infrahub
  settings:
    url: "https://infrahub.example.com"
    token: "INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN" # This can also be loaded from environment variables
```

## Step 2: Define synchronization order[​](#step-2-define-synchronization-order "Direct link to Step 2: Define synchronization order")

The `order` key specifies the sequence in which objects should be synchronized. This is important because some objects may depend on others.

```
order:
  - "InfraDevice"
  - "InfraInterface"
```

## Step 3: Configure schema mapping[​](#step-3-configure-schema-mapping "Direct link to Step 3: Configure schema mapping")

The `schema_mapping` section defines how data is mapped from the source to the destination.

info

* The `name` key in the destination model corresponds to the Infrahub attribute.
* The `mapping` key in the destination model corresponds to the key in the source payload to use.
* If `reference` is used, it links to a model that has been synchronized prior to this model.

```
schema_mapping:
  - name: InfraDevice
    mapping: "dcim.devices"
    identifiers: ["name"]
    fields:
      - name: "name"
        mapping: "name"
      - name: "device_type"
        mapping: "device_type.display_name"
      - name: "manufacturer"
        mapping: "device_type.manufacturer.name"

  - name: InfraInterface
    mapping: "dcim.interfaces"
    identifiers: ["device", "name"]
    fields:
      - name: "name"
        mapping: "name"
      - name: "interface_type"
        static: "10gbe"
      - name: "description"
        mapping: "description"
      - name: "device"
        reference: "InfraDevice"
```

In this example, `device_type` and `manufacturer` are Attributes of InfraDevice. If you are using another object with a Relationship, you would need to first import those objects and then reference them (like InfraDevice in InfraInterface).

## Step 4: Configure synchronization behavior[​](#step-4-configure-synchronization-behavior "Direct link to Step 4: Configure synchronization behavior")

You can control how the synchronization process handles various scenarios using DiffSync flags.

```
# Optional: Control sync behavior with diffsync flags
diffsync_flags:
  - "SKIP_UNMATCHED_DST"  # Skip objects in destination that don't exist in source
```

Understanding DiffSync Flags

DiffSync flags control how the synchronization process handles various scenarios. You can add these flags to your configuration to customize the sync behavior:

```
diffsync_flags:
  - "SKIP_UNMATCHED_DST"  # Default if no flags are specified
```

Available flags:

| Flag                 | Description                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SKIP_UNMATCHED_DST` | Skip objects in the destination that don't exist in the source (prevents deletion)   |
| `SKIP_UNMATCHED_SRC` | Skip objects in the source that don't exist in the destination (prevents creation)   |
| `SKIP_MODIFIED`      | Skip objects that exist in both systems but have different values (prevents updates) |

If no flags are specified, `SKIP_UNMATCHED_DST` is used by default, which means objects in the destination that don't exist in the source will be preserved rather than deleted.

For more information on customizing your sync configuration and troubleshooting, see the [Sync Instance configuration reference](/sync/reference/config.md)

The next steps will be to run the sync, you can check the [Run a sync instance guide](/sync/guides/run.md)
