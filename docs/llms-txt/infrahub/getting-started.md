# Getting Started with Infrahub Backup

This tutorial walks you through your first experience with Infrahub Backup, teaching you the fundamentals by creating a backup of your Infrahub instance and then restoring it. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the basic workflow and be confident in using `infrahub-backup` for essential maintenance tasks.

## What you'll learn[​](#what-youll-learn "Direct link to What you'll learn")

In this tutorial, you'll:

* Install infrahub-backup on your system
* Detect your Infrahub deployment environment
* Create your first backup
* Verify the backup was successful
* Capture a snapshot of artifact storage alongside database backups
* Restore from the backup you created

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

* A running Infrahub instance (using Docker Compose)
* Docker installed and running on your system
* Terminal access with sudo privileges
* At least 1GB of free disk space for backups

## Step 1: install infrahub-backup[​](#step-1-install-infrahub-backup "Direct link to Step 1: install infrahub-backup")

First, install the infrahub-backup tool. The recommended method is to download binaries:

```
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/ops/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/infrahub-backup -o infrahub-backup

chmod +x infrahub-backup

# Verify installation
./infrahub-backup version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Version: 1.0.0
```

## Step 2: detect your environment[​](#step-2-detect-your-environment "Direct link to Step 2: detect your environment")

Before performing any operations, verify that infrahub-backup can detect your Infrahub deployment:

```
./infrahub-backup environment detect
```

Expected output:

```
INFO[0000] Detecting deployment environment...
INFO[0000] Docker environment detected
INFO[0000] Found Docker Compose project: infrahub
```

If you have multiple Infrahub projects, list them all:

```
./infrahub-backup environment list
```

This shows all available Docker Compose projects running Infrahub.

## Step 3: create your first backup[​](#step-3-create-your-first-backup "Direct link to Step 3: create your first backup")

Now, let's create a backup of your Infrahub instance. This operation will:

1. Check for running tasks
2. Backup the Neo4j database
3. Backup the PostgreSQL task manager database
4. Create a compressed archive

Run the backup command:

```
./infrahub-backup create
```

You'll see detailed progress output:

```
INFO[0000] Starting backup process...
INFO[0000] Checking for running tasks...
INFO[0001] No running tasks found
INFO[0004] Backing up Neo4j database...
INFO[0010] Neo4j backup completed
INFO[0010] Backing up PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0012] PostgreSQL backup completed
INFO[0012] Creating backup archive...
INFO[0015] Backup created successfully: infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
INFO[0015] Starting application containers...
INFO[0020] Backup process completed
```

note

The backup file is stored in the `infrahub_backups` directory by default. Note the filename for the restore step.

## Step 4: verify your backup[​](#step-4-verify-your-backup "Direct link to Step 4: verify your backup")

Check that your backup was created successfully:

```
# List backup files
ls -lh infrahub_backups/

# View backup contents (without extracting)
tar -tzf infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_*.tar.gz | head -10
```

You should see:

* A `.tar.gz` file with today's timestamp
* Inside the archive: `backup_information.json`, database files, and other components

## Step 5: capture artifact storage[​](#step-5-capture-artifact-storage "Direct link to Step 5: capture artifact storage")

If your Infrahub workflows produce artifacts stored outside the databases, take a moment to snapshot that storage so the backup remains consistent. Identify the bucket, container, or volume where artifacts live and copy the contents into a dated folder or version. Use your provider’s native tooling (for example, `aws s3 sync`, `az storage blob download`, or `rsync` for shared volumes) and note where you stored the snapshot so you can pair it with the database backup when restoring.

If using standard Docker Compose deployment:

```
# Copy artifacts directory to backup location
docker compose cp -a infrahub-server:/opt/infrahub/storage /backup/artifacts/
```

## Step 6: restore from backup[​](#step-6-restore-from-backup "Direct link to Step 6: restore from backup")

To complete the learning cycle, let's restore from the backup you just created. This simulates recovering from a disaster or rolling back changes.

warning

Restoring will replace all current data in your Infrahub instance. In a production environment, always verify you have a current backup before restoring an older one.

```
# Replace with your actual backup filename
./infrahub-backup restore infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
```

The restore process will:

1. Validate the backup file
2. Stop all containers
3. Restore the Neo4j database
4. Restore the PostgreSQL database
5. Restart all services

Expected output:

```
INFO[0000] Starting restore process...
INFO[0000] Validating backup file...
INFO[0001] Backup validation successful
INFO[0001] Stopping all containers...
INFO[0005] Restoring Neo4j database...
INFO[0015] Neo4j restore completed
INFO[0015] Restoring PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0018] PostgreSQL restore completed
INFO[0018] Starting all containers...
INFO[0025] Restore completed successfully
```

## Step 7: verify the restore[​](#step-7-verify-the-restore "Direct link to Step 7: verify the restore")

Confirm your Infrahub instance is running correctly:

```
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# Test Infrahub connectivity (adjust URL as needed)
curl -I http://localhost:8080
```

All containers should be in the "Up" state, and the HTTP request should return a successful response.

## What you've learned[​](#what-youve-learned "Direct link to What you've learned")

Congratulations! You've completed your first backup and restore cycle with Infrahub Backup. You now know how to:

* Install and verify infrahub-backup
* Detect your deployment environment
* Create comprehensive backups of your Infrahub instance
* Capture artifact storage snapshots to keep backups complete
* Restore from a backup file
* Verify successful operations

## Next steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")

Now that you understand the basics, explore:

* [How to backup your Infrahub instance](/backup/guides/backup-instance.md)
* [How to restore from backup](/backup/guides/restore-backup.md)

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If you encounter issues:

**Permission denied when running commands:**

* Ensure your user has Docker permissions: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
* Log out and back in for changes to take effect

**Cannot detect environment:**

* Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
* Check Docker Compose is installed: `docker compose version`

**Backup fails with "running tasks detected":**

* Wait for tasks to complete, or use `--force` flag to proceed anyway
* Check task status in Infrahub UI
