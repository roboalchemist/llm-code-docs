# Understanding the Extension Architecture

This document explains the architecture of the Infrahub VSCode extension, its design decisions, and how the various components interact to provide a seamless development experience for infrastructure automation.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The Infrahub VSCode extension follows a modular architecture pattern that separates concerns into distinct components. This design enables maintainability, testability, and extensibility while providing real-time connectivity to Infrahub servers.

## Core architecture components[​](#core-architecture-components "Direct link to Core architecture components")

### Extension activation[​](#extension-activation "Direct link to Extension activation")

The extension activates when VSCode detects specific conditions in your workspace:

```
"activationEvents": [
  "workspaceContains:.infrahub.yml",
  "workspaceContains:.infrahub.yaml"
]
```

This lazy loading approach ensures the extension only consumes resources when you're working with Infrahub projects. The activation triggers when VSCode finds an `.infrahub.yml` or `.infrahub.yaml` file in your workspace, signaling that this is an Infrahub-enabled project.

### Component hierarchy[​](#component-hierarchy "Direct link to Component hierarchy")

The extension architecture consists of several interconnected layers:

```

```

## Key architectural patterns[​](#key-architectural-patterns "Direct link to Key architectural patterns")

### Provider pattern[​](#provider-pattern "Direct link to Provider pattern")

The extension uses VSCode's provider pattern extensively. Providers are classes that implement specific interfaces to extend VSCode's functionality:

#### Tree data providers[​](#tree-data-providers "Direct link to Tree data providers")

Tree data providers manage the hierarchical views in the sidebar:

* **InfrahubServerTreeViewProvider**: Manages server connections and branch listings
* **InfrahubYamlTreeViewProvider**: Parses and displays `.infrahub.yml` structure

These providers implement the `TreeDataProvider` interface, which requires:

* `getTreeItem()`: Returns the UI representation of an item
* `getChildren()`: Returns child elements for expandable items
* `onDidChangeTreeData`: Event emitter for refreshing the tree

#### Language providers[​](#language-providers "Direct link to Language providers")

Language providers enhance the editing experience:

* **YamlDefinitionProvider**: Enables go-to-definition for schema references
* **YamlDocumentSymbolProvider**: Creates document outline/symbols

### Event-driven updates[​](#event-driven-updates "Direct link to Event-driven updates")

The extension uses an event-driven architecture for real-time updates:

```
// Automatic refresh every 10 seconds
setInterval(() => InfrahubServerTreeView.refresh(), 10000);

// Configuration change listener
vscode.workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration(e => {
  if (e.affectsConfiguration('infrahub-vscode.servers')) {
    this.refresh();
  }
});
```

This approach ensures:

* Status bar updates reflect current server state
* Tree views stay synchronized with server changes
* Configuration changes take effect immediately

### Client management[​](#client-management "Direct link to Client management")

The extension maintains a client pool for server connections:

```
private clients: Map<string, InfrahubClient> = new Map();
```

Each server configuration creates a dedicated client instance, allowing:

* Concurrent connections to multiple servers
* Isolated authentication per server
* Efficient connection reuse

## Design decisions and rationale[​](#design-decisions-and-rationale "Direct link to Design decisions and rationale")

### Why tree views?[​](#why-tree-views "Direct link to Why tree views?")

Tree views were chosen as the primary UI component because:

1. **Familiar Paradigm**: Developers are accustomed to file explorers and tree structures
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Natural representation of servers → branches → schemas
3. **Contextual Actions**: Right-click menus provide discoverable functionality
4. **Space Efficiency**: Collapsible nodes manage complex information efficiently

### Status bar integration[​](#status-bar-integration "Direct link to Status bar integration")

The status bar provides ambient awareness of connection state:

* **Always Visible**: Users see server status without opening panels
* **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interrupt workflow
* **Quick Feedback**: Color coding indicates connection health instantly

### Configuration strategy[​](#configuration-strategy "Direct link to Configuration strategy")

The extension uses VSCode's built-in settings system rather than custom configuration files:

**Advantages**:

* Integrated with VSCode's settings UI
* Supports workspace and user-level settings
* Environment variable substitution for security
* Settings sync across devices

**Trade-offs**:

* Limited to JSON structure
* No runtime configuration changes
* Requires VSCode restart for some changes

### SDK integration[​](#sdk-integration "Direct link to SDK integration")

The extension uses the official `infrahub-sdk` package:

```
import { InfrahubClient, InfrahubClientOptions } from 'infrahub-sdk';
```

**Benefits**:

* Consistent API with other Infrahub tools
* Maintained by the Infrahub team
* Type safety with TypeScript
* Automatic API version compatibility

## Mental models[​](#mental-models "Direct link to Mental models")

### Connection lifecycle[​](#connection-lifecycle "Direct link to Connection lifecycle")

Understanding how connections are established and maintained:

1. **Initialization**: Server configurations are loaded from settings
2. **Client Creation**: Each server gets an InfrahubClient instance
3. **Health Checking**: Status bar polls server health every 10 seconds
4. **Query Execution**: Clients are reused for GraphQL operations
5. **Cleanup**: Connections persist until VSCode closes

### Data flow[​](#data-flow "Direct link to Data flow")

How data moves through the extension:

```
User Action → Command Handler → Client Method → Server API
                    ↓                               ↓
              UI Update ← Result Processing ← API Response
```

Example: Executing a GraphQL query:

1. User selects play icon next to query in tree view
2. Command handler prompts for variables
3. Client sends query to selected server/branch
4. Results are formatted and displayed in webview
5. Tree view updates if data changed

### State management[​](#state-management "Direct link to State management")

The extension maintains minimal state:

* **Server Configurations**: Read from settings, cached in memory
* **Client Instances**: Stored in Map, reused across operations
* **Tree View State**: Managed by VSCode, persists across sessions
* **No Persistent Storage**: Extension doesn't write to disk

## Integration points[​](#integration-points "Direct link to Integration points")

### VSCode extension API[​](#vscode-extension-api "Direct link to VSCode extension API")

The extension integrates with multiple VSCode APIs:

* **Commands API**: Registers executable commands
* **Tree View API**: Creates custom sidebar views
* **Language API**: Provides IntelliSense features
* **Webview API**: Displays query results
* **Status Bar API**: Shows server connection status

### Infrahub server[​](#infrahub-server "Direct link to Infrahub server")

Communication with Infrahub servers occurs through:

* **GraphQL Endpoint**: Query and mutation execution
* **REST API**: Server version and health checks

### File system integration[​](#file-system-integration "Direct link to File system integration")

The extension interacts with the workspace:

* **Schema Files**: Validates YAML in configured directories
* **Query Files**: Reads `.gql` files for execution
* **Configuration**: Parses `.infrahub.yml` for project structure

## Performance considerations[​](#performance-considerations "Direct link to Performance considerations")

### Lazy loading[​](#lazy-loading "Direct link to Lazy loading")

Components load only when needed:

* Tree views populate on expansion
* Clients connect on first use
* Validation runs on file save

### Caching strategy[​](#caching-strategy "Direct link to Caching strategy")

The extension implements strategic caching:

* Server configurations cached until settings change
* Branch lists refresh every 10 seconds
* Client connections persist across operations

### Resource management[​](#resource-management "Direct link to Resource management")

Efficient resource usage through:

* Single client instance per server
* Debounced validation on typing
* Incremental tree view updates

## Extension boundaries[​](#extension-boundaries "Direct link to Extension boundaries")

### What the extension does[​](#what-the-extension-does "Direct link to What the extension does")

* **Client-Side Operations**: All processing happens locally
* **Read Operations**: Primarily queries data
* **UI Enhancement**: Improves developer experience
* **Validation**: Schema and syntax checking

### What the extension doesn't do[​](#what-the-extension-doesnt-do "Direct link to What the extension doesn't do")

* **Server Management**: Cannot start/stop Infrahub servers
* **Data Persistence**: Doesn't store data locally
* **Background Sync**: No automatic data synchronization
* **Conflict Resolution**: Merge conflicts handled server-side
