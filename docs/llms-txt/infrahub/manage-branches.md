# How to Manage Branches

If you need to work with Infrahub's branch-based version control system, this guide shows you how to create, delete, and manage branches using the VSCode extension.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* Infrahub VSCode extension installed
* At least one configured Infrahub server
* Appropriate permissions to create/delete branches on your server

## Step 1: View existing branches[​](#step-1-view-existing-branches "Direct link to Step 1: View existing branches")

To see all branches on a server:

1. Open the Infrahub icon in the Activity Bar

2. Expand the "Infrahub Servers" tree view

3. Click on your server to expand it

4. You'll see all branches listed with:

   <!-- -->

   * Branch name
   * "(default)" marker for the main branch
   * Branch metadata when available

## Step 2: Create a new branch[​](#step-2-create-a-new-branch "Direct link to Step 2: Create a new branch")

### From the tree view[​](#from-the-tree-view "Direct link to From the tree view")

1. Right-click on your server in the Infrahub Servers view
2. Select **New Branch** from the context menu
3. Enter the branch name (for example, "feature-network-update")
4. Optionally add a description
5. Press Enter to create the branch

### Naming conventions[​](#naming-conventions "Direct link to Naming conventions")

Follow these branch naming patterns for clarity:

* `feature-[description]` - New features
* `fix-[issue-number]` - Bug fixes
* `update-[component]` - Updates to existing components
* `test-[scenario]` - Testing branches
* `dev-[username]` - Personal development branches

Example: `feature-datacenter-schema`

## Step 3: Delete a branch[​](#step-3-delete-a-branch "Direct link to Step 3: Delete a branch")

To remove a branch you no longer need:

1. Expand your server in the tree view
2. Right-click on the branch to delete
3. Select **Delete Branch**
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

> **Warning**: Branch deletion is permanent. Ensure you've merged or saved any important changes before deleting.

## Step 4: Work with branch-specific data[​](#step-4-work-with-branch-specific-data "Direct link to Step 4: Work with branch-specific data")

### Execute queries on specific branches[​](#execute-queries-on-specific-branches "Direct link to Execute queries on specific branches")

When running GraphQL queries:

1. Right-click on a query in the Infrahub YAML view
2. Select **Execute GraphQL Query**
3. Choose your server
4. Select the target branch from the list
5. The query runs against that branch's data

### Compare data across branches[​](#compare-data-across-branches "Direct link to Compare data across branches")

To compare data between branches, execute the same query on different branches:

```
query BranchComparison {
  NetworkDevice {
    count
    edges {
      node {
        hostname {
          value
        }
        _updated_at
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run this query on:

1. Main branch - baseline data
2. Feature branch - modified data
3. Compare the results to see differences

## Step 5: Branch workflow examples[​](#step-5-branch-workflow-examples "Direct link to Step 5: Branch workflow examples")

### Feature development workflow[​](#feature-development-workflow "Direct link to Feature development workflow")

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```
   Name: feature-add-firewall-schema
   Description: Adding firewall device schema and relationships
   ```

2. **Develop and Test**

   * Modify schemas
   * Test queries against the branch
   * Validate changes

3. **Merge Process**

   * Review changes
   * Merge via Infrahub UI or API
   * Delete feature branch after merge

### Hotfix workflow[​](#hotfix-workflow "Direct link to Hotfix workflow")

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**

   ```
   Name: fix-device-status-issue
   Description: Urgent fix for device status validation
   ```

2. **Apply Fix**

   * Make necessary corrections
   * Test on hotfix branch

3. **Deploy**

   * Merge to main
   * Verify fix
   * Clean up branch

## Step 6: Advanced branch management[​](#step-6-advanced-branch-management "Direct link to Step 6: Advanced branch management")

### Working with long-lived branches[​](#working-with-long-lived-branches "Direct link to Working with long-lived branches")

For branches that persist over time:

```
# Document branch purposes in your project
# branches.yml
branches:
  - name: develop
    purpose: Integration branch for ongoing development
    merge_target: main
    
  - name: staging
    purpose: Pre-production testing
    merge_target: main
    
  - name: feature-q4-updates
    purpose: Q4 feature development
    merge_target: develop
```

### Branch metadata tracking[​](#branch-metadata-tracking "Direct link to Branch metadata tracking")

Track branch information in your queries:

```
query BranchInfo {
  Branch {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        description
        created_at
        branched_from
        is_default
        has_schema_changes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation[​](#validation "Direct link to Validation")

To ensure branch operations are working:

1. **Creation Verification**: New branch appears in tree view immediately
2. **Query Testing**: Execute a query against the new branch
3. **Deletion Confirmation**: Deleted branch disappears from tree view
4. **Refresh Check**: Tree view updates every 10 seconds automatically

## Best practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")

### Branch lifecycle[​](#branch-lifecycle "Direct link to Branch lifecycle")

1. **Create** with descriptive names
2. **Develop** in isolation
3. **Test** thoroughly on the branch
4. **Review** changes before merging
5. **Merge** when ready
6. **Delete** after successful merge

### Naming strategy[​](#naming-strategy "Direct link to Naming strategy")

Use consistent prefixes:

* `feature-` for new functionality
* `fix-` for bug fixes
* `update-` for updates
* `test-` for experiments
* `release-` for release preparation

### Documentation[​](#documentation "Direct link to Documentation")

Document active branches:

```
## Active Branches

### feature-network-redesign
- **Created**: 2024-01-15
- **Owner**: Network Team
- **Purpose**: Redesigning network schema for multi-vendor support
- **Target Merge**: 2024-02-01

### fix-validation-error
- **Created**: 2024-01-20

- **Target Merge**: ASAP
```

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### Branch creation fails[​](#branch-creation-fails "Direct link to Branch creation fails")

* Check server permissions
* Verify branch name doesn't already exist
* Ensure valid characters in branch name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)

### Branch not appearing[​](#branch-not-appearing "Direct link to Branch not appearing")

* Wait 10 seconds for automatic refresh
* Manually reload VSCode window if needed
* Check server connectivity

### Cannot delete branch[​](#cannot-delete-branch "Direct link to Cannot delete branch")

* Verify you have deletion permissions
* Ensure branch isn't protected
* Check if branch is the default branch (cannot be deleted)
