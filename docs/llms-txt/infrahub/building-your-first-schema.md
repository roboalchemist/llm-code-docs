# Building Your First Schema

This guide walks you through creating your first Infrahub schema using Emma's AI Schema Builder. We'll create a practical schema for modeling network devices.

## What we'll build[​](#what-well-build "Direct link to What we'll build")

By the end of this guide, you'll have created a "NetworkDevice" schema that includes:

* Basic device information (name, model, serial number)
* Network configuration (management IP, location)
* Operational status and metadata
* Relationships to location and vendor schemas

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before starting, ensure you have:

* Emma running and connected to your Infrahub instance
* Basic understanding of what schemas are (see [First Steps](/emma/getting-started/first-steps.md))
* An OpenAI API key configured for AI features

## Step 1: Plan your schema[​](#step-1-plan-your-schema "Direct link to Step 1: Plan your schema")

Before jumping into the Schema Builder, think about what you want to model:

**Core Attributes:**

* `name` - Unique device identifier
* `model` - Device model/part number
* `serial_number` - Hardware serial number
* `management_ip` - IP address for device management
* `status` - Operational status (active, maintenance, decommissioned)

**Relationships:**

* `location` - Reference to a Location object
* `vendor` - Reference to a Vendor/Organization object

**Metadata:**

* `description` - Human-readable description
* `tags` - Flexible tagging system

## Step 2: Open the schema builder[​](#step-2-open-the-schema-builder "Direct link to Step 2: Open the schema builder")

1. **Navigate to Schema Builder** in Emma's sidebar
2. **Verify AI configuration** - Ensure your OpenAI API key is set
3. **Check Infrahub connection** - Confirm you're connected to the right instance and branch

## Step 3: Describe your schema[​](#step-3-describe-your-schema "Direct link to Step 3: Describe your schema")

In the Schema Builder interface, enter this description:

```
Create a NetworkDevice schema for modeling network infrastructure devices with the following requirements:

Core Information:
- name: unique identifier for the device
- model: device model or part number
- serial_number: hardware serial number
- description: human-readable description

Network Configuration:
- management_ip: IPv4 address for device management
- management_interface: name of the management interface

Location and Organization:
- location: relationship to a Location object
- vendor: relationship to an Organization object representing the device vendor

Operational Status:
- status: enumeration with values: active, maintenance, decommissioned, planned
- commissioned_date: when the device was put into service
- last_seen: timestamp of last successful connection

The schema should inherit from the base Device schema if available, and include proper validation for IP addresses and required fields.
```

## Step 4: Review the generated schema[​](#step-4-review-the-generated-schema "Direct link to Step 4: Review the generated schema")

The AI will generate a complete YAML schema. Review it carefully:

### Check the schema structure[​](#check-the-schema-structure "Direct link to Check the schema structure")

```
# Example generated schema (yours may vary)
---
version: '1.0'
schemas:
  - name: NetworkDevice
    namespace: Infrastructure
    description: Network infrastructure device
    inherit_from:
      - CoreDevice
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        unique: true
        optional: false
      - name: model
        kind: Text
        optional: true
      # ... more attributes
    relationships:
      - name: location
        peer: LocationGeneric
        optional: true
        cardinality: one
      # ... more relationships
```

### Verify key elements[​](#verify-key-elements "Direct link to Verify key elements")

✅ **Naming**: Schema name follows your conventions ✅ **Namespace**: Appropriate namespace for organization ✅ **Inheritance**: Inherits from appropriate base schema ✅ **Attributes**: All required attributes are present with correct types ✅ **Relationships**: References to Location and Organization schemas ✅ **Validation**: IP address validation and required field constraints

## Step 5: Refine if needed[​](#step-5-refine-if-needed "Direct link to Step 5: Refine if needed")

If the generated schema needs adjustments, refine your description:

**Add missing details:**

```
Also include:
- hostname: DNS hostname for the device
- firmware_version: current firmware version
- power_consumption: power usage in watts
```

**Adjust relationships:**

```
The location relationship should be required (not optional) and
the vendor relationship should reference Organization objects
with a role filter for vendors only.
```

**Modify validation:**

```
The management_ip should validate as a proper IPv4 address,
and the serial_number should be required and unique.
```

## Step 6: Load the schema[​](#step-6-load-the-schema "Direct link to Step 6: Load the schema")

Once you're satisfied with the generated schema:

1. **Copy the YAML** from the Schema Builder output
2. **Navigate to Schema Loader** in Emma's sidebar
3. **Paste the schema** into the YAML editor
4. **Preview the schema** to verify it looks correct
5. **Load into Infrahub** by clicking "Load Schema"

## Step 7: Verify the schema[​](#step-7-verify-the-schema "Direct link to Step 7: Verify the schema")

After loading, verify your schema worked correctly:

### Using the schema visualizer[​](#using-the-schema-visualizer "Direct link to Using the schema visualizer")

1. **Go to Schema Visualizer**
2. **Find your NetworkDevice schema** in the schema list
3. **Examine the relationships** to Location and Organization
4. **Verify the attributes** appear correctly

### Using Infrahub directly[​](#using-infrahub-directly "Direct link to Using Infrahub directly")

1. **Open your Infrahub instance** in a web browser
2. **Navigate to Schema** section
3. **Find NetworkDevice** in the schema list
4. **Review the generated schema** definition

## Step 8: Test with sample data[​](#step-8-test-with-sample-data "Direct link to Step 8: Test with sample data")

Now test your schema by adding some sample data:

### Using the data importer[​](#using-the-data-importer "Direct link to Using the data importer")

Create a CSV file:

```
name,model,serial_number,management_ip,status,description
switch-01,Cisco 3850,FCW2140L0EF,192.168.1.10,active,Core distribution switch
router-01,Cisco ISR4431,FJC2140L0AG,192.168.1.1,active,Main internet gateway
switch-02,Cisco 3850,FCW2140L0EH,192.168.1.11,maintenance,Access layer switch
```

Then:

1. **Go to Data Importer** in Emma
2. **Upload your CSV file**
3. **Map columns** to your NetworkDevice schema attributes
4. **Preview the import** to verify mappings
5. **Execute the import** to create your first devices

### Verify the data[​](#verify-the-data "Direct link to Verify the data")

1. **Check Infrahub** to see your imported devices
2. **Use the Data Exporter** to export and verify the data
3. **Navigate between relationships** to see how location and vendor references work

## Common issues and solutions[​](#common-issues-and-solutions "Direct link to Common issues and solutions")

### Schema generation issues[​](#schema-generation-issues "Direct link to Schema generation issues")

**Problem**: AI generates incorrect attribute types **Solution**: Be more specific about data types in your description, for example: "IPv4 address" instead of "IP address"

**Problem**: Missing relationships **Solution**: Explicitly mention all required relationships and their cardinality

**Problem**: Schema doesn't inherit correctly **Solution**: Check if base schemas exist in your Infrahub instance first

### Schema loading issues[​](#schema-loading-issues "Direct link to Schema loading issues")

**Problem**: Validation errors when loading **Solution**: Check that referenced schemas (Location, Organization) exist in Infrahub

**Problem**: Namespace conflicts **Solution**: Use unique namespaces or check existing schema names

### Data import issues[​](#data-import-issues "Direct link to Data import issues")

**Problem**: Relationship resolution fails **Solution**: Ensure referenced objects (locations, vendors) exist before importing devices

**Problem**: Validation errors on IP addresses **Solution**: Verify IP address format in your CSV data
