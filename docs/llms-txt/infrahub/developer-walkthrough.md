# Developer Walkthrough

In this walkthrough, we detail the key building blocks of the demo, explain how it works, and describe how the components interact. This guide is intended for developers who want to understand the implementation details of the service catalog PoC.

## The schema[​](#the-schema "Direct link to The schema")

To structure and store data, we define a schema in Infrahub. You can find the schema files in the `schemas` folder.

### Schema architecture overview[​](#schema-architecture-overview "Direct link to Schema architecture overview")

The following diagram illustrates the complete schema architecture, showing how different objects relate to each other in the Service Catalog demo:

<!-- -->

#### Key concepts in the diagram[​](#key-concepts-in-the-diagram "Direct link to Key concepts in the diagram")

1. **Generic vs Concrete Objects**:

   * **Generic** (dashed boxes): Abstract base classes that define common attributes
   * **Concrete** (solid boxes): Actual objects that can be instantiated

2. **Object Categories**:

   * **Service Layer** (blue): Service definitions and instances
   * **Location Layer** (pink): Geographic hierarchy and hosting locations
   * **DCIM Layer** (orange): Physical devices and interfaces
   * **IPAM Layer** (green): Network resources (IPs, VLANs, prefixes)

3. **Relationship Types**:

   * **Inheritance** (dashed arrows): Shows class hierarchy
   * **Associations** (solid arrows): Shows data relationships with cardinality
   * **Resource Allocation** (dotted arrows): Shows dynamic provisioning flow

### Consuming the schema library[​](#consuming-the-schema-library "Direct link to Consuming the schema library")

Much of the schema is based on the [Infrahub schema library](https://github.com/opsmill/schema-library), which provides reusable schema components for quickly scaffolding a schema.

* `base`: Contains generic definitions for `IPAM` (IP address, prefix, etc.), `DCIM` (network device, interface, etc.), `location`, and `organization` (provider, manufacturer). Importing this folder is mandatory as it provides the basic definitions required for extensions.
* `location_minimal`: Defines a hierarchical tree for country, metro, and site.
* `vlan`: Includes nodes for VLANs and L2 domains.

### Custom service schema[​](#custom-service-schema "Direct link to Custom service schema")

The service layer is unique to each organization, so we define a custom schema to represent services and their components.

      # By configuring directions in relationships to point toward the generic service from a site’s perspective and initiating the relationship in the node pointing toward the site, we achieve the desired behavior.

success

We now have the data model and data to support our use case. It captures everything from services to the backbone, with some abstraction for flexibility. This setup is a strong foundation for automation.

## The generator[​](#the-generator "Direct link to The generator")

The generator is a powerful feature of Infrahub that allows you to codify the rules and processes associated with your service implementation. It enables fast and consistent implementation across the board.

important

We want to build the generator with the concept of **idempotency** in mind, meaning it should be repeatable: it assigns resources the first time it runs, and if run again, it changes nothing if the desired state is already achieved. This approach ensures the code is robust and predictable.

Infrahub provides a set of features to help:

* Resource manager: It allows users to create pools and allocate resources from them, such as prefixes, IP addresses, or even numbers. We will use this feature to allocate our prefixes/vlan in a branch-agnostic and idempotent way. Learn more about [resource managers](https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/resource-manager).
* `allow_upsert=True`: This parameter is provided when saving the node, allowing it to be created if it doesn't exist or updated if it does. This is useful for ensuring that the generator can run multiple times without creating duplicates or errors.

### Generator architecture patterns[​](#generator-architecture-patterns "Direct link to Generator architecture patterns")

1. **Resource Tracking**: Every allocation linked to the service
2. **Relationship Integrity**: Bi-directional references maintained
3. **Error Handling**: Fail fast with clear messages
4. **Logging**: Detailed progress tracking for troubleshooting

### Service provisioning flow[​](#service-provisioning-flow "Direct link to Service provisioning flow")

Here's a focused view of how resources flow during service provisioning:

### Summary: From request to reality[​](#summary-from-request-to-reality "Direct link to Summary: From request to reality")

The generator transforms a service request:

```
Service: DI-12345
Location: Atlanta 
Bandwidth: 1 Gbps
IP Package: Medium
```

Into fully provisioned infrastructure:

* VLAN 142 allocated and configured
* IP prefix 10.0.42.0/28 assigned
* Switch port ge-0/0/5 configured
* Router interface vlan\_142 with IP 10.0.42.1/28

All in seconds, consistently, and idempotently!

## The service portal architecture[​](#the-service-portal-architecture "Direct link to The service portal architecture")

### Streamlit for the user interface[​](#streamlit-for-the-user-interface "Direct link to Streamlit for the user interface")

The demo uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the user interface because it:

* Builds web UIs with pure Python (no JavaScript required)
* Provides ready-made components for forms and data display
* Integrates seamlessly with the Infrahub Python SDK
* Enables rapid prototyping of service catalogs

### Portal design patterns[​](#portal-design-patterns "Direct link to Portal design patterns")

#### Infrahub SDK integration[​](#infrahub-sdk-integration "Direct link to Infrahub SDK integration")

The portal uses several patterns to efficiently interact with Infrahub:

Client Caching Pattern

```
@st.cache_resource
def get_client(branch: str = "main") -> InfrahubClientSync:
    """Create and cache Infrahub client."""
    address = get_instance_address()
    return InfrahubClientSync(
        address=address,
        config=Config(default_branch=branch)
    )
```

Why Cache the Client?

The `@st.cache_resource` decorator:

* Creates client once and reuses it
* Reduces connection overhead
* Maintains consistent state
* Improves page load performance

## Architecture takeaways[​](#architecture-takeaways "Direct link to Architecture takeaways")

### Key design decisions[​](#key-design-decisions "Direct link to Key design decisions")

1. **Schema as Foundation**: Well-designed schema enables everything else
2. **Automation through Generators**: Complex provisioning made straightforward
3. **Resource Management**: Centralized pools prevent conflicts
4. **Branch-Based Workflows**: Safe testing and rollback capabilities
5. **User-Friendly Abstractions**: Hide complexity behind clear choices

### Extending the demo[​](#extending-the-demo "Direct link to Extending the demo")

Consider these enhancements for production use:

* Additional service types (MPLS, Cloud Connect, etc.)
* Approval workflows with human checkpoints
* Integration with ITSM platforms
* Automated testing of provisioned services
* Rollback and decommissioning automation

## Next steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")

Now that you understand the architecture:

1. **Run the Demo**: Follow the [installation guide](/demo-service-catalog/getting-started/installation.md) to set up locally
2. **Try the Portal**: Walk through the [user experience](/demo-service-catalog/getting-started/user-walkthrough.md)
3. **Explore Further**: Modify the schema or create new service types
4. **Build Your Own**: Apply these patterns to your infrastructure needs

The combination of Infrahub's flexible schema, powerful generators, and Python-based portals enables you to build sophisticated service automation tailored to your organization's needs.
