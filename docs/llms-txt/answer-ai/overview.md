### /llms.txt—a proposal to provide information to help LLMs use websites

We propose that those interested in providing LLM-friendly content add a
/llms.txt file to their site. This is a markdown file that provides
brief background information and guidance, along with links to markdown
files providing more detailed information.

### A new kind of literate program – Claudette

Claudette is the first ever ‘literate nbdev’ project. Its source is a
rendered Notebook with callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images,
detailed explanations. It explains how and why the code is written the
way it is, along with how to use the libraries it depends on.
