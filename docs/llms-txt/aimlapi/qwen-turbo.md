## Model Overview

This model is designed to enhance both the performance and efficiency of AI agents developed on the Alibaba Cloud Model Studio platform. Optimized for speed and precision in generative AI application development. Improves AI agent comprehension and adaptation to enterprise data, especially when integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures.\
Large context window (<kbd>1,000,000</kbd> tokens).

<summary>How to make the first API call</summary>

:digit\_one:  **Required setup (don’t skip this)**\
▪ **Create an account:** Sign up on the AI/ML API website (if you don’t have one yet).\
▪ **Generate an API key:** In your account dashboard, create an API key and make sure it’s **enabled** in the UI.

**2️ Copy the code example**\
At the bottom of this page, pick the snippet for your preferred programming language (Python / Node.js) and copy it into your project.

**3️ Update the snippet for your use case**\
▪ **Insert your API key:** replace `<YOUR_AIMLAPI_KEY>` with your real AI/ML API key.\
▪ **Select a model:** set the `model` field to the model you want to call.\
▪ **Provide input:** fill in the request input field(s) shown in the example (for example, `messages` for chat/LLM models, or other inputs for image/video/audio models).

**4️ (Optional) Tune the request**\
Depending on the model type, you can add optional parameters to control the output (e.g., generation settings, quality, length, etc.). See the API schema below for the full list.

**5️ Run your code**\
Run the updated code in your development environment. Response time depends on the model and request size, but simple requests typically return quickly.
