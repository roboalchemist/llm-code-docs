# Ownership teams

{% hint style="info" %}
Team ownership features are only available on Growth and Isolation plans.
{% endhint %}

If you ever wondered, **"Who are the experts on this app in my system?",** you can find exactly that with Ownership teams on IcePanel.

Ownership teams are a great way to show groups of people as experts on an object, giving better accountability for keeping everything updated. On each assigned object, you can see the names, roles and emails of those in the assigned team(s) so you can speak to the right person quickly.  Object details can also be locked so they're only editable by team owners.

## Locking object details from being edited

Object details such as their name, type, and status can be locked from being edited by non-owners. When you lock an object, only Admins and Owners can edit the details or delete it from your model. All outgoing connections from that object will also be restricted from being edited. Editors can still remove locked objects or their outgoing connections from the diagram.

To lock object details:

1. Select the object you want to lock.
2. In the right-hand menu, select the team(s) you want to lock edit access to in the `Owner` field.
3. Click on the `Editable by` field (by default, this is set to all editors) and change it to *Owners only.*

{% hint style="info" %}
Locking an object to a team restricts non-owners from editing its details. However, nested objects will still be editable. For example, if you lock an app, other teams won't be able to change its name, but they'll be able to add, edit, or delete objects such as components within the app.
{% endhint %}

If you attempt to remove a team you're a part of as an Owner of a locked object, you'll see a confirmation prompt. Only do this if you're certain that you no longer need access to the object.  You'll need an Admin or another owner to give you access again.

When non-owners view a locked object, they'll see a banner at the top of the details menu. They'll be unable to change or delete the object from the model.
