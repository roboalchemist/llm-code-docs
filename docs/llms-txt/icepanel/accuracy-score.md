# Inaccuracy score

It's hard always to trust diagrams because they get out-of-date quickly. Even with modelling efficiencies, keeping tabs on what needs to be updated can be overwhelming, especially if you have a complex system.

IcePanel's Inaccuracy Score helps you make meaningful documentation that can be trusted from the start without asking creators if it accurately depicts the current reality.

## What is the Inaccuracy Score?

Each domain or diagram has its inaccuracy count in the header bar on the top right. This score is diagram-specific, so it's always contextual to what you're looking at. The score reflects the unique number of out-of-date links or unresolved inaccuracy comments.
