# Organizations

An organization in IcePanel contains landscapes, domains, and model objects. This is also where you'll manage billing, teams, integrations, and other settings, such as share links.

{% hint style="info" %}
All billing and licenses are associated with an organization. We recommend sticking with a single organization unless you require a separate billing and integration setup.
{% endhint %}

## How to manage your organization

To manage your organization:

1. Click on the dropdown on the top left of the screen from the landscape page.
2. Click on the `...` menu beside the organization name.
3. Click on `Manage organization`.

### Switching between organizations
