# AI in IcePanel

IcePanel utilizes OpenAI models to enhance various capabilities within the platform.

### **Use of OpenAI Models**

IcePanel utilizes OpenAI models to enhance various capabilities within the platform. All AI-powered features are **strictly opt-in** and are **disabled by default**. Users must explicitly enable these features in their settings before any OpenAI models are used on their behalf.

### **Data Usage and Training**

IcePanel does **not** train or fine-tune OpenAI models on customer data. When AI features are enabled, the models are used as-is, ensuring that user information remains private and secure. IcePanel does not contribute any user-specific data for training. OpenAI may process inputs to improve the general performance of its systems, in accordance with their policies.

### **Opting In**

Users can choose to enable or disable AI-powered features at any time through their account settings. If AI features are not enabled, OpenAI models are not used in any part of the IcePanel platform.

### **Feedback and Improvements**

Feedback from IcePanel users helps improve the overall experience and quality of AI-powered features. If you’d like to chat with us, feel free to book time with our team or reach out at **<mail@icepanel.io>**.
