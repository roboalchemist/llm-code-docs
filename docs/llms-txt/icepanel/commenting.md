# Comments

It takes a team to build great diagrams. Comments help clarify parts of your diagram, mark inaccuracies, or share ideas. Everyone in your organization can leave, view and resolve comments to add to the discussion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Comments are only visible to an organization's admins, editors, and viewers. Share-link viewers can't see them.
{% endhint %}

## Comment types

There are 3 comment types in IcePanel. Each comment type can be used to discuss a particular topic:&#x20;

* Question - to discuss parts that you're unsure about.
* Inaccuracy - to flag parts of the diagram that are incorrect.
* Idea - to share thoughts about changes or improvements.

### Question comment type

Questions should be used when you're unsure of part of the diagram, want to know how something works, or if something is unclear. Questions are added to the [recommendations tab](https://docs.icepanel.io/core-features/recommendation) to be resolved by your teammates.

### Inaccuracy comment type

Inaccuracy comments should be used when something in the diagram or documentation is untrue or has changed. Each inaccurate comment reduces the [Inaccuracy Score](https://docs.icepanel.io/integrations/accuracy-score) of the landscape, and resolving them will improve it.

### Idea comment type

Ideas are thoughts about future improvements to your architecture or diagram. For example, changes to a system or app to improve performance. Idea comments don't affect Inaccuracy Scores and can't be resolved (only deleted).
