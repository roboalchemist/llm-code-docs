# n8n v1.0 migration guide

This document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.

The release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.

## New features

### Python support in the Code node

Although JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the [Code node](../code/code-node/) and even make use of [many Python modules](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.

[PR #4295](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4295), [PR #6209](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6209)

### Execution order

n8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:

In multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.

n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.

Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in [workflow settings](../workflows/settings/).

[PR #4238](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4238), [PR #6246](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6246), [PR #6507](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6507)

## Deprecations

### MySQL and MariaDB

n8n has deprecated support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.

[PR #6189](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6189)

### EXECUTIONS_PROCESS and "own" mode

Previously, you could use the `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the `main` process or in their `own` processes. This option and `own` mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, `main` will be the new default.

Note that executions start much faster in `main` mode than in `own` mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure [queue mode](../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) to distribute executions among multiple workers.

[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196)

## Breaking changes

### Docker

#### Permissions change

When using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user `node` instead of `root`. This change increases security.

If permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:

```
docker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n
```

#### Image removal

We've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.

#### Entrypoint change

The entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running `n8n worker --concurrency=5` it's now `worker --concurrency=5`

[PR #6365](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6365)

### Workflow failures due to expression errors

Workflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an "error workflow" under workflow settings.

[PR #6352](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6352)

### Mandatory owner account

This change makes [User Management](../user-management/) mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on [n8n.cloud](https://n8n.cloud/) or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.

[PR #6362](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6362)

### Directory for installing custom nodes

n8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global `node_modules` directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to `~/.n8n/custom` (or a directory defined by `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in `~/.n8n/nodes`. If you have custom nodes that were linked using `npm link` into the global `node_modules` directory, you need to link them again, into `~/.n8n/nodes` instead.

[PR #6396](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6396)

### WebSockets

The `N8N_PUSH_BACKEND` environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: `sse` and `websocket`. Starting with n8n 1.0, `websocket` is the default method.

[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196)

### Date transformation functions

n8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript `Date` or a Luxon `DateTime` object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a `Date`, it returns a `Date`. Similarly, if you call it on a `DateTime` object, it returns a `DateTime` object.

To identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this [utility workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1929-v1-helper-find-params-with-affected-expressions/).

For more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the [official documentation](../code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/).

[PR #6435](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6435)

### Execution data retention

Starting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under "Workflow Settings," or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` setting will be enabled by default, with `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.

[PR #6577](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6577)

### Removed N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB

The legacy `request` library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the `N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB` environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new `HttpRequest` interface.

If you build custom nodes, refer to [HTTP request helpers](../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information on migrating to the new interface.

[PR #6413](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6413)

### Removed WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL

As of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` configuration option to `WEBHOOK_URL`. In n8n 1.0, `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to [the docs](../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/).

[PR #1408](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/1408)

### Remove Node 16 support

n8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.

## Updating to n8n 1.0

1. Create a full backup of n8n.
1. n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.
1. Carefully read the [Deprecations](#deprecations) and [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.
1. Update to n8n 1.0:
   - During beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the `next` Docker image.
   - After July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the `latest` Docker image.
1. If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.

## Reporting issues

Thank you for being a part of our journey!

# n8n v2.0 breaking changes

n8n v2.0 will be released soon. This document highlights important breaking changes and actions you should take to prepare for the transition. These updates improve security, simplify configuration, and remove legacy features.

The release of n8n 2.0 continues n8n's commitment to providing a secure, reliable, and production-ready automation platform. This major version includes important security enhancements and cleanup of deprecated features.

## Behavior changes

### Return expected sub-workflow data when the sub-workflow resumes from waiting (waiting for webhook, forms, HITL, etc.)

Previously, when an execution (parent) called a sub-execution (child) that contained a node that causes the sub-execution to enter the waiting state and the parent-execution is set up to wait for the sub-execution's completion, the parent-execution would receive incorrect results.

Entering the waiting state would happen for example if the sub-execution contains a Wait node with a timeout higher than 65 seconds or a webhook call or a form submission, or a human-in-the-loop node, like the slack node.

Parent-Workflow:

Sub-Workflow:

v1: The parent-execution reproduces the sub-execution's input as its output.:

v2: The parent execution receives the result of the child execution:

This allows using human-in-the-loop nodes in the sub-workflow and use the results (for example approving or declining an action) in the parent-workflow.

**Migration path:** Review any workflows that call sub-workflows and expect to receive the input to the sub-workflow. Update these workflows to handle the new behavior, where the parent-workflow receives the output from the end of the child-workflow instead.

### Start node removed

The Start node is no longer supported. This node was the original way to begin workflows but more specific trigger nodes now replace it.

**Migration path:** Replace the Start node based on how you use your workflow:

- **Manual executions:** Replace the Start node with a [Manual Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) node.
- **Sub-workflows:** If another workflow calls this workflow as a sub-workflow, replace the Start node with an [Execute Workflow Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) node and activate the workflow.
- **Disabled Start nodes:** If the Start node is disabled, delete it from the workflow.

### Saving and publishing workflows

The new workflow publishing system replaces the previous active/inactive toggle. This means that the old "Activate/Deactivate" toggles become the new "Publish/Unpublish" buttons. This change gives you better control over when your workflow changes go live, reducing the risk of accidentally deploying work-in-progress changes to production. More information can be found here: [Saving and publishing workflows.](../workflows/publish/)

### Removed nodes for retired services

The following nodes have been removed because the external services they connect to are no longer available:

- Spontit node
- crowd.dev node
- Kitemaker node
- Automizy node

**Migration path:** If your workflows use any of these nodes, update or remove those workflows to avoid errors.

## Security

### Block environment variable access from Code Node by default

To improve security, n8n will block access to environment variables from the Code node by default. The default value for `N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE` is now set to `true`.

**Migration path:** If your workflows require access to environment variables in Code nodes, set `N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE=false` in your environment configuration. For sensitive data, use credentials or other secure methods instead of environment variables.

### Enforce settings file permissions

n8n will require strict file permissions for configuration files to improve security. By default, configuration files must use `0600` permissions, which means only the file owner can read and write them. This approach is similar to how SSH protects private keys.

**Migration path:** To test this behavior before v2.0, set `N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true`. If your environment doesn't support file permissions (for example, on Windows), set `N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=false` to disable this requirement.

### Enable task runners by default

n8n will enable [task runners](../hosting/configuration/task-runners/) by default to improve security and isolation. All Code node executions will run on task runners.

**Migration path:** Before upgrading to v2.0, set N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true to test this behavior. Make sure your infrastructure meets the requirements for running task runners. For additional security, consider using [external mode](../hosting/configuration/task-runners/#external-mode).

### Remove task runner from `n8nio/n8n` docker image

Starting with v2.0, the main `n8nio/n8n` Docker image will no longer include the task runner for external mode. You must use the separate `n8nio/runners` Docker image to run task runners in external mode.

**Migration path:** If you run task runners in Docker with external mode, update your setup to use the `n8nio/runners` image instead of `n8nio/n8n`.

### Remove Pyodide-based Python Code node and tool

n8n will remove the Pyodide-based Python Code node and tool and replace them with a [task runner-based](../hosting/configuration/task-runners/) implementation that uses native Python for better security and performance. Starting in v2.0, you can only use Python Code nodes with task runners in [external mode](../hosting/configuration/task-runners/#external-mode) and native Python tools.

The native Python Code node doesn't support built-in variables like `_input` or dot access notation, which were available in the Pyodide-based version. For details, see the [Code node documentation](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/#python-native).

The native Python tool supports `_query` for the input string that the AI Agent passes to the tool when it calls it.

**Migration path:** To continue using Python in Code nodes, set up task runners in external mode and review your existing Python Code nodes and tools for compatibility.

### Disable ExecuteCommand and LocalFileTrigger nodes by default

n8n will disable the `ExecuteCommand` and `LocalFileTrigger` nodes by default because they pose security risks. These nodes allow users to run arbitrary commands and access the file system.

**Migration path:** If you need to use these nodes, remove them from the disabled nodes list in your n8n configuration by updating the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable. For example, set `NODES_EXCLUDE="[]"` to enable all nodes, or remove only the specific nodes you need.

### Require authentication on OAuth callback URLs by default

n8n will require authentication for OAuth callback endpoints by default. The default value for `N8N_SKIP_AUTH_ON_OAUTH_CALLBACK` will change from `true` (no authentication required) to `false` (authentication required).

**Migration path:** Before upgrading to v2.0, set `N8N_SKIP_AUTH_ON_OAUTH_CALLBACK=false` and test your OAuth integrations to ensure they work with authentication enabled.

### Set default value for N8N_RESTRICT_FILE_ACCESS_TO

n8n will set a default value for `N8N_RESTRICT_FILE_ACCESS_TO` to control where file operations can occur. This affects the `ReadWriteFile` and `ReadBinaryFiles` nodes. By default, these nodes can only access files in the `~/.n8n-files` directory.

**Migration path:** Review your workflows that use file nodes and make sure they only access files in the allowed directory. If you need to allow access to other directories, set the `N8N_RESTRICT_FILE_ACCESS_TO` environment variable to your desired path.

### Change the default value of N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS to true

By default, the Git node will now block bare repositories for security reasons. The default value for `N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS` is set to `true`, which means bare repositories are disabled unless you change this setting.

**Migration path:** If your workflows need to use bare repositories, set `N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS=false` in your environment configuration to enable them.

## Data

### Drop MySQL/MariaDB support

n8n will no longer support MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends. This support was deprecated in v1.0. For best compatibility and long-term support, use PostgreSQL. MySQL node will continue to be supported as before.

**Migration path:** Before upgrading to v2.0, use the database migration tool to move your data from MySQL or MariaDB to PostgreSQL or SQLite.

### Remove SQLite legacy driver

n8n will remove the legacy SQLite driver due to reliability issues. The pooling driver will become the default and only SQLite driver. The pooling driver uses WAL mode, a single write connection, and a pool of read connections. Our benchmarks show it can be up to 10 times faster.

**Migration path:** The `sqlite-pooled` driver will become the default automatically. You can enable pooling now by setting `DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE` to a value greater than `0`. The default pool size will be set to `2`.

### Remove in-memory binary data mode

n8n will remove the `default` mode for `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE`, which keeps execution binary data in memory during execution. For better performance and stability the following options will be available starting from v2:

- `filesystem`: Binary data is stored in the filesystem. Default option in regular mode.
- `database`: Binary data is stored in the database. Default option in queue mode.
- `s3`: Binary data is stored in S3 compatible store.

The `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` setting will also be removed, so the mode is now determined only by `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE`.

**Migration path:** Filesystem or database mode will be used automatically based on configuration. Make sure your n8n instance has enough disk space to store binary data. For details, see the [binary data configuration](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data/).

## Configuration & Environment

### Upgrade dotenv

n8n loads environment configuration from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` library. The library will be upgraded from version 8.6.0 to the latest version, which may change how `.env` files are parsed. Key breaking changes include:

- Backtick support ([#615](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/pull/615)): If your values contain backticks, wrap them in single or double quotes.
- Multiline support: You can now use multiline values.
- `#` marks the beginning of a comment: Lines starting with # are treated as comments.

**Migration path:** Review the [dotenv changelog](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and update your `.env` file to ensure compatibility with the new version.

### Remove `n8n --tunnel` option

The `n8n --tunnel` command-line option will be removed in v2.0.

**Migration path:** If you currently use the `--tunnel` option for development or testing, switch to an alternative tunneling solution such as ngrok, localtunnel, or Cloudflare Tunnel. Update your workflow and documentation to reflect this change.

### Remove QUEUE_WORKER_MAX_STALLED_COUNT

The `QUEUE_WORKER_MAX_STALLED_COUNT` environment variable and the Bull retry mechanism for stalled jobs will be removed because they often caused confusion and didn't work reliably.

**Migration path:** Delete this environment variable from your configuration. After upgrading, n8n will no longer automatically retry stalled jobs. If you need to handle stalled jobs, consider implementing your own retry logic or monitoring.

### Remove N8N_CONFIG_FILES

The `N8N_CONFIG_FILES` environment variable has been removed.

**Migration path:** Delete this environment variable from your configuration. Move configuration into environment variables, an `.env` file or [`_FILE`](../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) based configuration.

## CLI & Workflow

### Replace CLI command update:workflow

The `update:workflow` CLI command will be deprecated and replaced by two new commands to deliver similar functionality and more clarity:

- `publish:workflow` with parameters `id` and `versionId` (optional)
- The `--all` parameter will be removed to prevent accidental publishing of workflows in production environments
- `unpublish:workflow` with parameters `id` and `all`

**Migration path:** Use the new `publish:workflow` command to publish workflows individually by ID, optionally specifying a version. For unpublishing, use the new `unpublish:workflow` command. This provides better clarity and control over workflow publishing states.

## External Hooks

### Deprecated frontend workflow hooks

The hooks `workflow.activeChange` and `workflow.activeChangeCurrent` will be deprecated. These will be replaced by a new hook `workflow.published`. The new hook will be triggered when any version of a workflow is published.

**Migration path:** Update your code to use the new `workflow.published` hook instead of `workflow.activeChange` and `workflow.activeChangeCurrent`. This hook provides more consistent behavior and will be triggered whenever a workflow version is published.

## Release channels

n8n has renamed the release channels from `latest` and `next` to `stable` and `beta`, respectively.

The `stable` tag designates the latest stable release, and the `beta` tag designates the latest experimental release. These tags are available on both npm and Docker Hub. For now, n8n will continue to tag releases as `latest` and `next`. These tags will be removed in a future major version.

**Recommendation:** Pin your n8n version to a specific version number, for example, `2.0.0`.

## Reporting issues

# External secrets

Feature availability

- External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans.
- n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault.
- n8n doesn't support [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets).

Infisical deprecation

Infisical is deprecated and is no longer recommended. Use an alternative external secrets provider.

You can use an external secrets store to manage [credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) for n8n.

n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple [n8n environments](../source-control-environments/) in one central place.

## Connect n8n to your secrets store

Secret names

Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`), and underscores. n8n currently only supports plaintext values for secrets, not JSON objects or key-value pairs.

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **External Secrets**.

1. Select **Set Up** for your store provider.

1. Enter the credentials for your provider:

   - Azure Key Vault: Provide your **vault name**, **tenant ID**, **client ID**, and **client secret**. Refer to the Azure documentation to [register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.

   - AWS Secrets Manager: provide your **access key ID**, **secret access key**, and **region**. The IAM user must have the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`, `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue`, and `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permissions.

     To give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user:

     ```
     {
     	"Version": "2012-10-17",
     	"Statement": [
     		{
     			"Sid": "AccessAllSecrets",
     			"Effect": "Allow",
     			"Action": [
     				"secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
     				"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue",
     				"secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy",
     				"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
     				"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
     				"secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds",
     			],
     			"Resource": "*"
     		}
     	]
     }
     ```

     You can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` and `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values.

     Next, you need set the scope for the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets.

     For example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with `n8n` in your specified AWS account and region:

     ```
     {
     	"Version": "2012-10-17",
     	"Statement": [

   - Infisical: provide a **Service Token**. Refer to Infisical's [Service token](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/token) documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the **Site URL**.

     Infisical environment

     Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment.

     Infisical folders

     n8n doesn't support [Infisical folders](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/folder).

   - Google Cloud Platform: provide a **Service Account Key** (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` and `Secret Manager Secret Viewer`. Refer to Google's [service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) for more information.

1. **Save** your configuration.

1. Enable the provider using the **Disabled / Enabled** toggle.

## Use secrets in n8n credentials

To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:

1. Create a new credential, or open an existing one.

1. On the field where you want to use a secret:

   1. Hover over the field.
   1. Select **Expression**.

1. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an [expression](../glossary/#expression-n8n) referencing the secret name:

   ```
   {{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }}
   ```

   `<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.

## Using external secrets with n8n environments

n8n's [Source control and environments](../source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.

For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.

## Using external secrets in projects

To use external secrets in an [RBAC project](../user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](../user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.

## Troubleshooting

### Infisical version changes

Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.

### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin

Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.

Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production.

#### AI agent

AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.

#### AI chain

AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).

#### AI completion

Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.

#### AI embedding

Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.

#### AI groundedness

In AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.

#### AI hallucination

Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.

#### AI reranking

Reranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.

#### AI memory

In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.

#### AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.

#### AI tool

In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.

#### AI vector store

A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

#### API

APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.

#### canvas (n8n)

The canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.

#### cluster node (n8n)

In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.

#### credential (n8n)

In n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.

#### data pinning (n8n)

Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.

#### editor (n8n)

The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.

#### entitlement (n8n)

In n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.

Floating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.

#### evaluation (n8n)

In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.

#### expression (n8n)

In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.

#### LangChain

LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.

#### Large language model (LLM)

Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.

#### node (n8n)

In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.

#### project (n8n)

n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.

#### root node (n8n)

Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.

#### sub node (n8n)

n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.

#### template (n8n)

n8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.

#### trigger node (n8n)

A trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.

#### workflow (n8n)

An n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.

# Insights

Insights gives instance owners and admins visibility into how workflows perform over time. This feature consists of three parts:

- [**Insights summary banner**](#insights-summary-banner): Shows key metrics about your instance from the last 7 days at the top of the overview space.
- [**Insights dashboard**](#insights-dashboard): A more detailed visual breakdown with per-workflow metrics and historical comparisons.
- [**Time saved (Workflow ROI)**](#setting-the-time-saved-by-a-workflow): For each workflow, you can choose to set a fixed amount of time saved per workflow, or dynamically calculate time saved based on the execution path taken on a specific workflow.

Feature availability

The insights summary banner displays activity from the last 7 days for all plans. The insights dashboard is only available on Pro (with limited date ranges) and Enterprise plans.

## Insights summary banner

n8n collects several metrics for both the insights summary banner and dashboard. They include:

- Total production executions (not including sub-workflow executions or manual executions)
- Total failed production executions
- Production execution failure rate
- Time saved (when set on at least one or more active workflows)
- Run time average (including wait time from any wait nodes)

## Insights dashboard

Those on the Pro and Enterprise plans can access the **Insights** section from the side navigation. Each metric from the summary banner is also clickable, taking you to the corresponding chart.

The insights dashboard also has a table showing individual insights from each workflow including total production executions, failed production executions, failure rate, time saved, and run time average.

## Insights time periods

By default, the insights summary banner and dashboard show a rolling 7 day window with a comparison to the previous period to identify increases or decreases for each metric. On the dashboard, paid plans also display data for other date ranges:

- Pro: 7 and 14 days
- Enterprise: 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year

## Setting the time saved by a workflow

For each workflow, you can track how much time it saves you. This setting helps you calculate how much time automating a process saves over time vs the manual effort to complete the same task or process.

Once configured, n8n calculates the amount of time the workflow saves you based on the number of production executions and displays it on the summary banner and insights dashboard.

You can choose between two methods for calculating time saved:

### Fixed time saved

With fixed time saved, you set a single time value that applies to every production execution of the workflow, regardless of which path the execution takes.

To configure fixed time saved:

1. Navigate to the workflow
1. Select the three dots menu in the top right and select **Settings**
1. In the **Estimated time saved** dropdown, select **Fixed**
1. Enter the number of minutes of work each execution saves
1. Save your settings

### Dynamic time saved

Dynamic time saved calculates time savings based on the actual execution path taken, accounting for workflows where different execution paths save different amounts of time.

To configure dynamic time saved:

1. Navigate to the workflow
1. Select the three dots menu in the top right and select **Settings**
1. In the **Estimated time saved** dropdown, select **Dynamic**
1. Save your settings
1. Add **Time Saved** nodes to your workflow at the points where time is saved
1. For each Time Saved node, configure:
   - **Time saved**: The amount of time saved (in minutes)
   - **Calculation mode**: Choose whether to calculate the time saved once for all items in an execution, or per item which will multiply minutes saved by the total number of input items

When you use dynamic time saved, n8n adds up the time from all Time Saved nodes that execute during a workflow run to calculate the total time saved for that execution.

Subworkflow support

Time saved tracking currently only works on parent workflows. Time saved from subworkflows isn't currently supported, with plans to support this in a future release.

## Disable or configure insights metrics collection

If you self-host n8n, you can disable or configure insights and metrics collection using [environment variables](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/insights/).

## Insights FAQs

### Which executions do n8n use to calculate the values in the insights banner and dashboard?

n8n insights only collects data from production executions (for example, those from active workflows triggered on a schedule or a webhook) from the main (parent) workflow. This means that it doesn't count manual (test) executions or executions from sub-workflows or error workflows.

### Does n8n use historic execution data when upgrading to a version with insights?

n8n only starts collecting data for insights once you update to the first supported version (1.89.0). This means it only reports on executions from that point forward and you won't see execution data in insights from prior periods.

# n8n v2.0 migration tool

The migration tool helps you prepare your n8n instance for upgrading to version 2.0 by identifying workflows and configurations that need attention before the upgrade.

You can see all breaking changes for v2 [on this page](../2-0-breaking-changes/).

## Accessing the Tool

Navigate to **Settings > Migration Report** to view your compatibility status.

User role access

The migration tool is available for global admins only.

## Understanding Your Migration Status

At the top of the page, you'll see:

"X out of Y workflows are compatible with n8n 2.0"

This tells you how many workflows will continue working without changes after upgrading. Your goal is to address the issues preventing the remaining workflows from being compatible, as well as global instance issues.

## Viewing Issues

The tool organizes potential problems into two categories:

### Workflow Issues Tab

Shows breaking changes that affect specific workflows in your instance. What you'll see for each issue:

- **Issue title:** A clear name for the problem
- **Severity badge (Critical/Medium/Low):** How urgent this is to fix
- **Critical:** Fix before upgrading or workflows will fail
- **Medium:** May cause unexpected behavior or require attention soon
- **Low:** Minor changes or deprecations that won't break functionality
- **Description:** Explanation of what's changing and why it matters
- **Documentation link:** Click to read detailed migration explanations
- **Affected workflow count:** How many of your workflows have this issue

#### Workflow Issue Detail Page

Click **X workflows affected** to see all affected workflows. What you'll see for each workflow:

- **Name:** The workflow name. Click on the name to open the workflow editor.
- **State:** Whether workflow is published or not
- **Node affected:** The list of all the workflow nodes affected by the issue. You can click on each to open the workflow editor with the specific node view opened.
- **Number of executions:** The total number of executions of the workflow
- **Last executed:** The date the workflow was last executed
- **Last updated:** The date the workflow was last updated

### Instance Issues Tab

Shows configuration changes that affect your entire n8n instance, not specific workflows. What you'll see for each issue:

- Same information as workflow issues (title, severity, description, docs)
- **No workflow count:** These are global settings that apply instance-wide

The v2.0 migration tool scans your n8n instance to identify potential compatibility issues and configuration changes required for upgrading to v2.0. This reference details each check the tool performs, explains the impact of detected issues, and provides recommendations to prepare your instance for migration.

## Understanding Empty States

### No Workflow Issues Found

All your workflows are compatible with v2.0. Check the **Instance Issues** tab to ensure your server configuration is also ready.

### No Instance Issues Found

Your instance configuration is compatible with v2.0. Check the **Workflow Issues** tab to ensure all workflows are also ready.

### Both Tabs Empty

Your n8n instance is fully ready to upgrade to version 2.0.

## Recommended Workflow

### Initial Assessment

- Review the compatibility summary
- Browse all issues in both tabs to understand the scope

### Sort by Severity

- Start with Critical issues (they'll break workflows)
- Move to Medium issues (may cause problems)
- Address Low issues last (deprecation warnings)

### Fix Workflow Issues

- Click into each issue to see affected workflows
- Read the documentation for fix instructions
- Update each workflow as needed
- Test workflows in a development environment

### Address Instance Issues

- Update environment variables or server configuration
- Follow documentation for each instance-level change

### Verify Your Work

- Click **Refresh** to re-scan. If you don't see any **Refresh** button, just reload the page to re-scan.
- Confirm that unresolved issues don't remain
- Verify compatibility count matches total workflows

### Proceed with Upgrade

After addressing all issues, you're ready to upgrade to n8n 2.0

### **Chat node: human-in-the-loop actions**

The **Chat** node now includes two new Actions for human-in-the-loop interactions in agentic workflows:

- **Send a message**: send a message to the user and continue the workflow
- **Send a message and wait for response**: send a message and pause execution until the user replies. Users can respond with free text in the Chat or by clicking inline approval buttons, as defined in the node’s configuration.

These Actions can be used as deterministic workflow steps or as tools for an **AI Agent**, enabling multi-turn human interaction within a single execution when using the **Chat Trigger**.

When used as an agent tool, the agent can ask for clarification before proceeding, helping it better interpret user intent and follow instructions. Agents can also send updates during long-running workflows using these Actions.

### **How to**

1. Trigger your workflow with the **Chat Trigger** node. In the node parameters, add the *Response Mode* option and set it to *Using Response Nodes*.
1. Add a **Chat** node later in the workflow, or add it as a tool for an **AI Agent**. Select one of the following operations: *Send a message* or *Send a message and wait for response*.

### **Keep in mind**

- If you want an AI Agent to choose between sending a message or waiting for input, add two **Chat** tool nodes, one for each action.
- For AI Agents triggered by the **Chat Trigger** node, adding **Send a message and wait for response** is recommended so the agent can request clarification when needed.

Learn more in the [Chat node documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/#operation).

### **Time Saved node**

Previously, teams could only track a single fixed time saved value for each workflow regardless of which path an execution takes. The new Time Saved node enables more precise time savings calculations where different execution paths will save different amounts of time.

With this release you can now:

- **Choose fixed value or dynamic time tracking**: Use fixed time saved for simple workflows, or use one or many time saved nodes to calculate savings dynamically based on the actual execution path taken
- **Configure per-item calculations**: When using the Time Saved node, choose whether to calculate time saved once for all items or multiply by the number of items processed

The new Time Saved node provides increased accuracy for complex workflows where different execution paths save different amounts of time.

n8n automatically totals the time from all Time Saved nodes executed during each workflow run and reports it within the insights dashboard.

**Release date:** 2025-12-05

### Major Version Change

n8n 2.0.0 is a hardening release, not a feature release. It strengthens n8n's position as an enterprise-grade platform with secure-by-default execution, removal of legacy options that caused edge-case bugs, and better performance under load. The goal is a more predictable foundation you can rely on for mission-critical workflows.

This release is currently in **beta**. There's no urgency to upgrade immediately — take time to review the breaking changes and assess your workflows using the migration tool before upgrading.

For the full story behind 2.0, read our [announcement blog post](https://blog.n8n.io/introducing-n8n-2-0/).

### Breaking changes

Version 2.0 includes breaking changes across security defaults, data handling, and configuration. Key changes include:

- Task runners enabled by default (Code node executions now run in isolated environments)
- Environment variable access blocked from Code nodes by default
- ExecuteCommand and LocalFileTrigger nodes disabled by default
- In-memory binary data mode removed

Review the complete list and migration guidance in the [v2.0 breaking changes docs.](https://docs.n8n.io/2-0-breaking-changes/)

### Before you upgrade

Use the **Migration Report** tool to identify workflow-level and instance-level issues that need attention before upgrading.

See the [v2.0 migration tool docs](https://docs.n8n.io/migration-tool-v2/) for details.

### Product updates

**Publish / Save workflow paradigm**

n8n 2.0 introduces a safer approach to updating live workflows. The `Save` button now preserves your edits without changing production. A new `Publish` button lets you explicitly push changes live when ready. See [Publish workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/publish/) for details.

**Canvas and navigation improvements**

Subtle refinements to the workflow editor canvas and reorganized sidebar navigation.

# Sustainable Use License

Proprietary licenses for Enterprise

Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. [Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.

n8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

## License FAQs

### What license do you use?

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:

- Content of branches other than master.
- Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md).

### What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

- You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
- You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
- You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?

Our license restricts use to "internal business purposes". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

- White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.
- Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license:

- Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.
- Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.
- Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.
- Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.

#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?

Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.

Here are two examples to clarify:

##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot

Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.

**NOT ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.

##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app

Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.

**ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.

### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed).

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why don't you use an open source license?

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license?

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
1. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

1. To be as permissive as possible.
1. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
1. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?

Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](../help-community/contributing/).

### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to "sell" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is n8n open source?

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

- Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
- Has its source code openly available.
- Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
- Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?

Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

## Related resources

Related documentation and tools.

### Node types

This feature uses [Cluster nodes](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/): groups of [root](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/) and [sub](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) nodes that work together.

[Cluster nodes](../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

### Workflow templates

You can browse [workflow templates](../glossary/#template-n8n) in-app or on the n8n website [Workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows/?categories=25,26) page.

Refer to [Templates](../workflows/templates/) for information on accessing templates in-app.

### Chat trigger

Use the [n8n Chat Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to trigger a workflow based on chat interactions.

### Chatbot widget

n8n provides a chatbot widget that you can use as a frontend for AI-powered chat workflows. Refer to the [@n8n/chat npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) for usage information.

# Accessing n8n MCP server

Connect supported MCP clients to your n8n workflows through n8n's built-in MCP server.

The server allows clients such as Lovable or Claude Desktop to connect securely to an n8n instance. Once connected, these clients can:

- Search within workflows marked as available in MCP
- Retrieve metadata and trigger information for workflows
- Trigger and run exposed workflows

## Difference between instance-level MCP access and MCP Server Trigger node

Instance-level MCP access lets you create one connection per n8n instance, use centralized authentication, and choose which workflows to enable for access. Enabled workflows are easy to find and run without extra setup for each workflow.

In comparison, you configure an MCP Server Trigger node inside a single workflow. This node exposes tools only from that workflow, a useful approach when you want to craft a specific MCP server behavior within one workflow.

### Key considerations when using instance-level MCP access

- It isn't a way to build or edit workflows from an AI client; authoring remains in n8n.
- It doesn't provide blanket exposure to all workflows in your instance. You must enable MCP at the instance level and then enable each workflow individually.
- It's not scoped to each MCP client. Any connected client sees all workflows you’ve enabled for MCP access.

## Enabling MCP access

### For Cloud and self-hosted instances

1. Navigate to **Settings > Instance-level MCP**
1. Toggle **Enable MCP access** (requires instance owner or admin permissions).

Once enabled, you'll see:

1. List of workflows exposed to MCP clients
1. List of connected OAuth clients
1. Main MCP toggle to enable/disable instance-level access
1. *Connection details* button that shows detailed instructions for connecting MCP clients

**To disable:** Toggle the main MCP toggle off.

### For self-hosted: Complete disablement

To remove the feature entirely, set the environment variable:

`N8N_DISABLED_MODULES=mcp`

This action removes MCP endpoints and hides all related UI elements.

## Setting up MCP authentication

The **Connection details** popup menu provides two authentication options for MCP clients:

- **OAuth2**
- **Access Token**

### Using OAuth2

Copy your instance server URL from the **OAuth** tab and use it to configure your MCP client. After connecting, the client will redirect you to n8n to authorize access.

#### Revoking client access

To revoke access for connected MCP clients:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Instance-level MCP**.
1. Switch to the **Connected clients** tab. You should see a table of connected OAuth clients.
1. Use the action menu in each client's row to revoke access for specific clients.

### Using Access Token

Use your instance server URL and your personal MCP Access Token from the **Access Token** tab on the *Connection details* menu.

When you first visit the **MCP Access page**, n8n automatically generates a personal MCP Access Token tied to your user account.

Info

Copy your token right away. On future visits, you'll only see a redacted value and the copy button will be disabled.

#### Rotating your token

If you lose your token or need to rotate it:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Instance-level MCP**.

1. Open the *Connection details* menu by clicking the button in the top-right corner.

1. Switch to the **Access Token** tab.

1. Generate a new token using the button next to the redacted token value.

   n8n revokes the previous token when you generate a new one.

1. Update all connected MCP clients with the new value.

## Exposing workflows to MCP clients

### Workflow eligibility

In order for a workflow to be available to MCP clients, it must meet the following criteria:

1. Be published
1. Contain one of the following trigger nodes:
   - Webhook
   - Schedule
   - Chat
   - Form

By default, no workflows are visible to MCP clients. You must explicitly enable access for each eligible workflow you want to expose.

When evaluating workflow eligibility, n8n will take into account only the published version of the workflow. Workflows that have a supported trigger added to a draft version won't be considered eligible until the version is published.

Info

Once you unpublish a workflow, n8n removes its MCP access. You will have to re-enable access when you publish the workflow again.

### Enabling access

#### Option 1: From MCP settings page (available from n8n v2.2.0)

1. Click the **Enable workflows** button (in the workflows table header or in the table's empty state)
1. Search for the desired workflow (by name or description) and select it from the list
1. Click **Enable** button to confirm

#### Option 2: From the workflow editor

1. Open the workflow.
1. Click the main workflow menu (`...`) in the top-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Toggle **Available in MCP**.

#### Option 3: From the workflows list

1. Go to **Workflows**.
1. Open the menu on a workflow card.
1. Select **Enable MCP access**.

### Managing access

The **Instance-level MCP** settings page shows all workflows available to MCP clients. From this list you can:

- Open a workflow, its home project or parent folder directly
- Revoke access using the action menu (or use **Disable MCP access** from the workflow card menu)
- Update workflow description using the action menu (or use the menu in the workflow editor)
- Enable access for more workflows using the **Enable workflows** button (available from n8n v2.2.0)

### Workflow descriptions

To help MCP clients identify workflows, you can add free-text descriptions as follows:

1. Option 1: From the **Instance-level MCP** page

   1. Navigate to **Settings > Instance-level MCP**.
   1. Make sure you are on the **Workflows** tab.
   1. Use the action menu in the desired workflow's row and select the **Edit description** action.
   1. Alternatively, click the description text directly to open the edit dialog.

1. Option 2: From the workflow editor

   1. Open the workflow.
   1. Click the main workflow menu (`...`) in the top-right corner.
   1. Select **Edit description**.

## Executing workflows through MCP clients

MCP clients can execute eligible workflows on your request. When a client triggers a workflow, it runs as usual in n8n, and you can monitor its execution in the **Executions** list. Once the execution is complete, the MCP client will retrieve the results.

### Providing input data

MCP clients are typically able to assess what inputs are expected by a workflow. If you have a webhook trigger and If you see a client struggling to determine the right inputs, we recommend you provide this information in the workflow description.

### Workflow timeouts

n8n enforces a 5-minute timeout for workflow executions triggered by MCP clients. If a workflow doesn't finish in time, n8n stops the execution and sends an error to the MCP client, ignoring any timeout you set in the workflow settings for MCP-triggered executions.

### Limitations

- If there are multiple supported triggers in a workflow, MCP clients may only be able to use one (first one) of them to trigger the workflow.
- Executing workflows with multi-step forms or any kind of human-in-the-loop interactions isn't supported.
- Binary input data isn't supported. MCP clients can only provide text-based inputs for your workflows.

## Examples

#### Connecting Lovable to n8n MCP server

1. Configure MCP Server in Lovable (OAuth).
   - Navigate to your workspace  **Settings > Integrations**.
   - In the **MCP Servers** section, find **n8n** and click **Connect**.
   - Enter your n8n server URL (shown on the **MCP Access** page).
   - Save the connection. If successful, n8n redirects you to authorize Lovable.
1. Verify connectivity.
   - Once connected, Lovable can query for workflows with MCP access enabled.
   - **Example:** Asking Lovable to build a workflow UI that lists users and allows deleting them.

#### Connecting Claude Desktop to n8n MCP server

##### Using OAuth2

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Connectors** in Claude Desktop.
1. Click on **Add custom connector**.
1. Enter the following details:
   - **Name:** n8n MCP
   - **Remote MCP Server URL**: Your n8n base URL (shown on the **Instance-level MCP** page)
1. Save the connector.
1. When prompted, authorize Claude Desktop to access your n8n instance.

##### Using Access Token

Info

This requires the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Add the following entry to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "supergateway",
        "--streamableHttp",
        "https://<your-n8n-domain>/mcp-server/http",
        "--header",
        "authorization:Bearer <YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Here, replace:

- `<your-n8n-domain>`: Your n8n base URL (shown on the **Instance-level MCP** page)
- `<YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>`: Your generated token

### Connecting Claude Code to n8n MCP server

Use the following CLI command:

```
claude mcp add --transport http n8n-mcp https://<your-n8n-domain>/mcp-server/http \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>"
```

Alternatively, add the following entry to your `claude.json` file:

```
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "n8n-local": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://<your-n8n-domain>/mcp-server/http",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here, replace:

- `<your-n8n-domain>`: Your n8n base URL (shown on the **Instance-level MCP** page)
- `<YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>`: Your generated token

### Connecting Codex CLI to n8n MCP server

Add the following entry to your `~/.codex/config.toml` file:

```
[mcp_servers.n8n_mcp]
command = "npx"
args = [
    "-y",
    "supergateway",
    "--streamableHttp",
    "https://<your-n8n-domain>/mcp-server/http",
    "--header",
    "authorization:Bearer <YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>"
]
```

Here, replace:

- `<your-n8n-domain>`: Your n8n base URL (shown on the **Instance-level MCP** page)
- `<YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN>`: Your generated token

### Connecting Google ADK agent to n8n MCP server

Here's sample code to create an agent that connects to a remote n8n MCP server:

```
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPServerParams

N8N_INSTANCE_URL = "https://localhost:5678"
N8N_MCP_TOKEN = "YOUR_N8N_MCP_TOKEN"

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    name="n8n_agent",
    instruction="Help users manage and execute workflows in n8n",
    tools=[
        McpToolset(
            connection_params=StreamableHTTPServerParams(
                url=f"{N8N_INSTANCE_URL}/mcp-server/http",
                headers={
                    "Authorization": f"Bearer {N8N_MCP_TOKEN}",
                },
            ),
        )
    ],
)
```

For more details, see [Connect ADK agent to n8n](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/third-party/n8n/).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting MCP clients to your n8n instance, consider the following:

- Ensure that your n8n instance is publicly accessible if you are using cloud-based MCP clients.
- Verify that the MCP access is enabled in n8n settings.
- Check that the workflows you want to access are marked as available in MCP.
- Confirm that the authentication method (OAuth2 or Access Token) is correctly configured in your MCP client.
- Review n8n server logs for any error messages related to MCP connections.
- If you are using desktop MCP clients, make sure you have the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version installed.

# AI Workflow Builder

AI Workflow Builder enables you to create, refine, and debug workflows using natural language descriptions of your goals.

It handles the entire workflow construction process, including node selection, placement, and configuration, thereby reducing the time required to build functional workflows.

For details of pricing and availability of AI Workflow Builder, see [n8n Plans and Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

## Working with the builder

1. **Describe your workflow:** Either select an example prompt or describe your requirements in natural language.
1. **Monitor the build:** The builder provides real-time feedback through several phases.
1. **Review and refine the generated workflow:** Review required credentials and other parameters. Refine the workflow using prompts.

### Commands you can run in the builder

- `/clear`: Clears the context for the LLM and lets you start from scratch

## Understanding credits

### How credits work

Each time you send a message to the builder asking it to create or modify a workflow, that counts as one **interaction**, which is worth one **credit**.

✅ **Counts as an interaction**

- Sending a message to create a new workflow
- Asking the builder to modify an existing workflow
- Clicking the **Execute and refine** button in the builder window after a workflow is built

❌ **Does NOT count as an interaction**

- Messages that fail or produce generation errors
- Requests you manually stop by clicking the stop button

### Getting more credits

If you've used your monthly limit, you can upgrade to a higher plan.

For details on plans and pricing, see [n8n Plans and Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

## AI model and data handling

The following data are sent to the LLM:

- Text prompts that you provide to create, refine, or debug the workflow
- Node definitions, parameters, and connections and the current workflow definition.
- Any mock execution data that is loaded when using the builder

The following data are not sent:

- Details of any credentials you use
- Past executions of the workflow

# Chat Hub

## Overview

Chat Hub is a centralized AI chat interface where you can access multiple AI models, interact with n8n agents, and create your own agents. Chat Hub also introduces Chat user, a role that lets users interact with the chat interface without accessing n8n workflows.

## How to use

To use Chat Hub, find the **Chat** option in the navigation bar, select a model, and start a conversation.

### Creating simple personal agents

To make AI more reliable for simple, repetitive tasks, you can create Custom Agents with custom instructions. To create a simple personal agent:

1. Click on **Personal Agents** and then **+New Agent**.
1. Define the name, description, system prompt, preferred model, and access to tools.
1. Select **Save**.

Once created, you can select the personal agent from the model selector.

### Using n8n workflows agents

For more complex scenarios, use n8n workflow agents (built by you or your colleagues) to make your workflows available in Chat Hub. Right now, you can only use workflows that have a **Chat Trigger** with streaming enabled in the **Agent** node. To make your workflow available:

1. Open your selected workflow.

1. Open the **Chat Trigger**.

   Note

   Only chat triggers of the newest version will work. To get the newest chat trigger version, delete your existing chat trigger and insert a new one.

1. Enable the **Make Available in n8n Chat** option and set the name and description of the personal agent.

1. Make sure that your AI Agent node has the **Enable Streaming** option enabled.

1. Activate your workflow.

Once defined, you can select your workflow from the model selector in Chat Hub. Your colleagues need access to the workflow by sharing it or having it in a project where they have at least viewer access.

## Managing permissions

You can define which users can perform which actions through n8n's role system. Chat Hub also gives you more ways to control who uses what.

### Chat user role

The Chat user is a role for people in your organization who want to use workflows without building them. Chat users only see the chat interface and can't add credentials or workflows by default.

Chat users are only available on Starter, Pro, Business and Enterprise plans.

### Provider settings

Admins can control which models and providers users can access in Chat Hub. This includes:

- Enabling or disabling specific models and providers
- Preventing users from adding their own models
- Setting default credentials for each provider
- Restricting users from adding their own credentials (through n8n's permission system)

To manage these settings, go to **Settings > Chat** and edit the providers.

## Considerations and limitations

1. You can't add file knowledge when creating simple personal agents.
1. Tool selection is limited to a few options.
1. Only workflows with [Chat Trigger node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and streaming-enabled [AI Agent node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) work as workflow agents. Your workflows must meet specific requirements.

# Human-in-the-loop for AI tool calls

You can require human approval before an AI Agent executes a specific tool. When a tool requires human review, the workflow pauses and waits for a person to take one of the following actions:

- **Approve**: The tool executes with the input specified by the AI.
- **Deny**: The action is canceled and doesn't run.

This feature allows for selective oversight of tool use within AI workflows, making it easier to apply additional review to tools with higher risk, such as sending messages, modifying records, or deleting data.

## When to use human review

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) review is useful when:

- **Tools perform irreversible actions**: Deleting data, sending external communications, or making purchases.
- **Compliance requirements exist**: Regulated industries may require human approval for certain automated actions.
- **High-value decisions are involved**: Actions that have significant business impact benefit from human oversight.
- **You're building trust in AI workflows**: Start with human review enabled, then reduce oversight as confidence grows.

HITL can be applied to all tools connected to an AI Agent node, or just selected individual tools, offering more precise control than general output gating.

## How it works

1. The AI Agent determines it needs to use a tool that has human review enabled.
1. The workflow pauses and sends an approval request through your configured channel (such as Slack, Telegram, or the n8n Chat interface).
1. A human reviewer receives the request showing which tool the AI wants to use and with what parameters.
1. The reviewer either approves or denies the request.
1. If approved, the tool executes with the AI-specified input. If denied, the action is canceled and the AI is informed of the rejection.

Different approval channels

The review step can happen through a different channel than the main interaction. For example, you could have users interact with an AI agent through the n8n Chat interface, but route approval requests to a specific person in Slack.

## Setting up human review for tools

### Step 1: Open the Tools Panel

In your workflow, click the **Tools** connector on an AI Agent node to open the Tools Panel.

### Step 2: Add a human review step

1. In the Tools Panel, find the **Human review** section.
1. Select your preferred approval channel from the available options.
1. Configure the approval channel with the appropriate credentials and settings.

### Step 3: Connect tools to the review step

1. Add the tools that require approval to the human review step's tool connector.
1. Configure each tool as you normally would.

## Available approval channels

You can use any of the following services as your human review channel:

| Channel                                                                                    | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [Chat](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/)                    | n8n's built-in chat interface                     |
| [Slack](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)                        | Send approval requests to a Slack channel or DM   |
| [Discord](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/)                    | Send approval requests to a Discord channel       |
| [Telegram](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/)                  | Send approval requests through Telegram           |
| [Microsoft Teams](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftteams/)     | Send approval requests to a Teams channel or chat |
| [Gmail](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)                        | Send approval requests via email                  |
| [WhatsApp Business Cloud](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/)   | Send approval requests through WhatsApp           |
| [Google Chat](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlechat/)             | Send approval requests to Google Chat             |
| [Microsoft Outlook](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftoutlook/) | Send approval requests via Outlook email          |

## Using expressions in human review tools

### The $tool variable

When configuring the human review step, you can use the `$tool` variable to construct a message for the reviewer that provides context about what the AI is trying to do. This variable has two properties:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$tool.name`       | The name of the tool the AI Agent is trying to call. This is the node name as shown on the canvas in n8n.                                                            |
| `$tool.parameters` | The parameters the AI Agent is trying to use in the tool call. This includes any fields in the tool's input schema that are configured with `$fromAI()` expressions. |

**Example message configuration:**

```
The AI wants to use {{ $tool.name }} with the following parameters:
{{ JSON.stringify($tool.parameters, null, 2) }}
```

This helps reviewers understand exactly what action the AI is attempting before they approve or deny the request.

### Using $fromAI() in human review tools

The [`$fromAI()` function](../examples/using-the-fromai-function/) works with tools connected to human review steps. This means the AI can dynamically specify tool parameters, and those AI-determined values are what the human reviewer sees and approves.

## System prompt best practices

For the AI Agent to correctly interpret and handle denied tool call attempts, include information about the human review setup in your system prompt.

System prompt configuration required

Make sure you include the tool setup and human review steps in your system prompt. This helps the AI understand which tools require approval and how to respond gracefully when a tool call is denied.

Consider including:

- Which tools require human approval
- What happens when approval is denied
- How the AI should respond to rejections (for example, inform the user, suggest alternatives, or ask for clarification)

## Chaining and subagents

When using an AI Agent as a tool for another AI Agent, human review steps in the subagent work correctly.

# Build an AI chat agent with n8n

Welcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes.

Many people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both!

### What you will need

- **n8n**: For this tutorial we recommend using the [n8n cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/) service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the [installation pages](../../hosting/installation/docker/).
- **Credentials for a chat model**: This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the [sub-nodes documentation](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) for more).

### What you will learn

- AI concepts in n8n
- How to use the AI Agent node
- Working with Chat input
- Connecting with AI models
- Customising input
- Observing the conversation
- Adding persistence

## AI concepts in n8n

If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.

An [AI agent](../../glossary/#ai-agent) builds on [Large Language Models (LLMs)](../../glossary/#large-language-model-llm), which generate text based on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use [tools](../../glossary/#ai-tool), process their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.

In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections.

| Feature             | LLM                        | AI Agent                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Core Capability     | Text generation            | Goal-oriented task completion      |
| Decision-Making     | None                       | Yes                                |
| Uses Tools/APIs     | No                         | Yes                                |
| Workflow Complexity | Single-step                | Multi-step                         |
| Scope               | Generates language         | Performs complex, real-world tasks |
| Example             | LLM generating a paragraph | An agent scheduling an appointment |

By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the *content* of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent.

## 1. Create a new workflow

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

- An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
- The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the **button** to create a new workflow.

## 2. Add a trigger node

Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called ['trigger nodes'](../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n). For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node.

1. Select **Add first step** or press `Tab` to open the node menu.
1. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. Close the node details view (Select **Back to canvas**) to return to the canvas.

More about the Chat Trigger node...

The trigger node generates output when there is an event causing it to trigger. In this case we want to be able to type in text to cause the workflow to run. In production, this trigger can be hooked up to a public chat interface as provided by n8n or embedded into another website. To start this simple workflow we will just use the built-in local chat interface to communicate, so no further setup is required.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_01.json)

## 3. Add an AI Agent Node

The AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows.

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search.
1. Start typing "AI" and choose the **AI agent** node to add it.
1. The editing view of the **AI agent** will now be displayed.
1. There are some fields which can be changed. As we're using the **Chat Trigger** node, the default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_02.json)

## 4. Configure the node

AI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts.

1. Add a chat model by clicking the plus button underneath the **Chat Model** connection on the **AI Agent** node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).
1. The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use **OpenAI Chat Model**.
1. Selecting the **OpenAI Chat model** from the list will attach it to the **AI Agent** node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.

Which chat model?

As mentioned earlier, the LLM is the component which generates the text according to a prompt it is given. LLMs have to be created and trained, usually an intensive process. Different LLMS may have different capabilities or specialties, depending on the data they were trained with.

## 5. Add credentials (if needed)

In order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some [credentials](../../credentials/) (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.

1. To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear
1. This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.
1. The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the **API key** section.

Keeping your credentials safe

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

## 6. Test the node

Now that the node is connected to the **Chat Trigger** and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow.

1. Click on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right.
1. Type in a message and press `Enter`. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message.
1. The log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent.

Accessing the logs...

You can access the logs for the AI node even when you aren't using the chat interface. Open up the **AI Agent** node and click on the **Logs** tab in the right hand panel.

## 7. Changing the prompt

The logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the **AI Agent** primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to "You are a helpful assistant". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.

1. Open the **AI Agent** node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'
1. The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like "You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets" for example.
1. Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed.

## 8. Adding persistence

The chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation.

1. Use the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example "Hi there, my name is Nick".
1. Wait for the response, then type the message "What's my name?". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no [memory](../../glossary/#ai-memory).
1. In order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the **AI Agent** node. On the canvas click on the on the bottom of the **AI Agent** node labeled "Memory".
1. From the panel which appears, select "Simple Memory". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later.
1. Repeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name.

## 9. Saving the workflow

Before we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost.

1. Click on the "Save" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features.

## Congratulations!

You have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an **AI Agent** and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.

# RAG in n8n

## What is RAG

[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../glossary/#ai-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) is a technique that improves AI responses by combining language models with external data sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to [ground](../../glossary/#ai-groundedness) responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.

## What is a vector store?

A [vector store](../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) is a special database designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors: numerical representations of text, images, or other data. When you upload a document, the vector store splits it into chunks and converts each chunk into a vector using an [embedding model](../../glossary/#ai-embedding).

You can query these vectors using similarity searches, which construct results based on *semantic meaning*, rather than keyword matches. This makes vector stores a powerful foundation for RAG and other AI systems that need to retrieve and reason over large sets of knowledge.

## How to use RAG in n8n

Start with a RAG template

👉 Try out RAG in n8n with the [RAG Starter Template](https://n8n.io/workflows/5010-rag-starter-template-using-simple-vector-stores-form-trigger-and-openai). The template includes two ready-made workflows: one for uploading files and one for querying them.

### Inserting data into your vector store

Before your agent can access custom knowledge, you need to upload that data to a vector store:

1. Add the nodes needed to fetch your source data.
1. Insert a **Vector Store** node (e.g. the [Simple Vector Store](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreinmemory/)) and choose the **Insert Documents** operation.
1. Select an **embedding model**, which converts your text into vector embeddings. Consult the FAQ for more information on [choosing the right embedding model](#how-do-i-choose-the-right-embedding-model).
1. Add a [Default Data Loader](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) node, which splits your content into chunks. You can use the default settings or define your own chunking strategy:
   - **Character Text Splitter:** splits by character length.
   - **Recursive Character Text Splitter:** recursively splits by Markdown, HTML, code blocks or simple characters (recommended for most use cases).
   - **Token Text Splitter:** splits by token count.
1. (Optional) Add **metadata** to each chunk to enrich the context and allow better filtering later.

### Querying your data

You can query the data in two main ways: using an agent or directly through a node.

### Using agents

1. Add an [agent](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to your workflow.
1. Add the vector store as a **tool** and give it a **description** to help the agent understand when to use it:
   - Set the **limit** to define how many chunks to return.
   - Enable **Include Metadata** to provide extra context for each chunk.
1. Add the same **embedding model** you used when inserting the data.

Pro tip

To save tokens on an expensive model, you can first use the [Vector Store Question Answer tool](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to retrieve relevant data, and only then pass the result to the Agent. To see this in action, check out [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/5011-save-costs-in-rag-workflows-using-the-qanda-tool-with-multiple-models).

### Using the node directly

1. Add your vector store node to the canvas and choose the **Get Many** operation.
1. Enter a query or prompt:
   - Set a **limit** for how many chunks to return.
   - Enable **Include Metadata** if needed.

## FAQs

### How do I choose the right embedding model?

The right embedding model differs from case to case.

In general, smaller models (for example, `text-embedding-ada-002`) are faster and cheaper and thus ideal for short, general-purpose documents or lightweight RAG workflows. Larger models (for example, `text-embedding-3-large`) offer better semantic understanding. These are best for long documents, complex topics, or when accuracy is critical.

### What is the best text splitting for my use case?

This again depends a lot on your data:

- Small chunks (for example, 200 to 500 tokens) are good for fine-grained retrieval.
- Large chunks may carry more context but can become diluted or noisy.

Using the right overlap size is important for the AI to understand the context of the chunk. That's also why using the Markdown or Code Block splitting can often help to make chunks better.

Another good approach is to add more context to it (for example, about the document where the chunk came from). If you want you can read more about this, you can check out [this great article from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval).

# Light evaluations

Available on registered community and paid plans

Light evaluations are available to registered community users and on all paid plans.

## What are light evaluations?

When building your workflow, you often want to test it with a handful of examples to get a sense of how it performs and make improvements. At this stage of workflow development, looking over workflow outputs for each example is often enough. The benefits of setting up more [formal scoring or metrics](../metric-based-evaluations/) don't yet justify the effort.

Light evaluation allows you to run the examples in a test dataset through your workflow one-by-one, writing the outputs back to your dataset. You can then examine those outputs next to each other, and visually compare them to the expected outputs (if you have them).

## How it works

Credentials for Google Sheets

Evaluations use data tables or Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use Google Sheets as a dataset source, configure a [Google Sheets credential](../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).

Light evaluations take place in the 'Editor' tab of your workflow, although you’ll find instructions on how to set it up in the 'Evaluations' tab.

Steps:

1. Create a dataset
1. Wire the dataset up to the workflow
1. Write workflow outputs back to dataset
1. Run evaluation

The following explanation will use a sample workflow that assigns a category and priority to incoming support tickets.

### 1. Create a dataset

Create a data table or Google Sheet with a handful of examples for your workflow. Your dataset should contain columns for:

- The workflow input
- (Optional) The expected or correct workflow output
- The actual output

Leave the actual output column or columns blank, since you'll be filling them during the evaluation.

A [sample dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uuPS5cHtSNZ6HNLOi75A2m8nVWZrdBZ_Ivf58osDAS8/edit?gid=294497137#gid=294497137) for the support ticket classification workflow.

### 2. Wire the dataset up to your workflow

#### Insert an evaluation trigger to pull in your dataset

Each time the [evaluation trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger/) runs, it will output a single item representing one row of your dataset.

Clicking the 'Evaluate all' button to the left of the evaluation trigger will run your workflow multiple times in sequence, once for each row in your dataset. This is a special behavior of the evaluation trigger.

While wiring the trigger up, you often only want to run it once. You can do this by either:

- Setting the trigger's 'Max rows to process' to 1
- Clicking on the 'Execute node' button on the trigger (rather than the 'Evaluate all' button)

#### Wire the trigger up to your workflow

You can now connect the evaluation trigger to the rest of your workflow and reference the data that it outputs. At a minimum, you need to use the dataset’s input column(s) later in the workflow.

If you have multiple triggers in your workflow you will need to [merge their branches together](../tips-and-common-issues/#combining-multiple-triggers).

The support ticket classification workflow with the evaluation trigger added in and wired up.

### 3. Write workflow outputs back to dataset

To populate the output column(s) of your dataset when the evaluation runs:

- Insert the 'Set outputs' action of the [evaluation node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/)
- Wire it up to your workflow at a point after it has produced the outputs you're evaluating
- In the node's parameters, map the workflow outputs into the correct dataset column

The support ticket classification workflow with the 'set outputs' node added in and wired up.

### 4. Run evaluation

Click on the **Execute workflow** button to the left of the evaluation trigger. The workflow will execute multiple times, once for each row of the dataset:

Review the outputs of each execution in the data table or Google Sheet, and examine the execution details using the workflow's 'executions' tab if you need to.

Once your dataset grows past a handful of examples, consider [metric-based evaluation](../metric-based-evaluations/) to get a numerical view of performance. See also [tips and common issues](../tips-and-common-issues/).

# Metric-based evaluations

Available on Pro and Enterprise plans

Metric-based evaluation is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. Registered community and Starter plan users can also use it for a single workflow.

### What are metric-based evaluations?

Once your workflow is ready for deployment, you often want to test it on more examples than [when you were building it](../light-evaluations/).

For example, when production executions start to turn up edge cases, you want to add them to your test dataset so that you can make sure they're covered.

For large datasets like the ones built from production data, it can be hard to get a sense of performance just by eyeballing the results. Instead, you must measure performance. Metric-based evaluations can assign one or more scores to each test run, which you can compare to previous runs. Individual scores get rolled up to measure performance on the whole dataset.

This feature allows you to run evaluations that calculate metrics, track how those metrics change between runs and drill down into the reasons for those changes.

Metrics can be deterministic functions (such as the distance between two strings) or you can calculate them using AI. Metrics often involve checking how far away the output is from a *reference output* (also called ground truth). To do so, the dataset must contain that reference output. Some evaluations don't need this reference output though (for example, checking text for sentiment or toxicity).

## How it works

Credentials for Google Sheets

Evaluations use data tables or Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use Google Sheets as a dataset source, configure a [Google Sheets credential](../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).

1. Set up [light evaluation](../light-evaluations/)
1. Add metrics to workflow
1. Run evaluation and view results

### 1. Set up light evaluation

Follow the [setup instructions](../light-evaluations/) to create a dataset and wire it up to your workflow, writing outputs back to the dataset.

The following steps use the same support ticket classification workflow from the light evaluation docs:

### 2. Add metrics to workflow

Metrics are dimensions used to score the output of your workflow. They often compare the actual workflow output with a reference output. It's common to use AI to calculate metrics, although it's sometimes possible to just use code. In n8n, metrics are always numbers.

You need to add the logic to calculate the metrics for your workflow, at a point after it has produced the outputs. You can add any reference outputs your metric uses as a column in your dataset. This makes sure they it will be available in the workflow, since they will be output by the evaluation trigger.

Use the **Set Metrics** operation to calculate:

- **Correctness (AI-based)**: Whether the answer's meaning is consistent with a supplied reference answer. Uses a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.
- **Helpfulness (AI-based)**: Whether the response answers the given query. Uses a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.
- **String Similarity**: How close the answer is to the reference answer, measured character-by-character (edit distance). Returns a score between 0 and 1.
- **Categorization**: Whether the answer is an exact match with the reference answer. Returns 1 when matching and 0 otherwise.
- **Tools Used**: Whether the execution used tools or not. Returns a score between 0 and 1.

You can also add custom metrics. Just calculate the metrics within the workflow and then map them into an Evaluation node. Use the **Set Metrics** operation and choose **Custom Metrics** as the Metric. You can then set the names and values for the metrics you want to return.

For example:

- [RAG document relevance](https://n8n.io/workflows/4273): when working with a vector database, whether the documents retrieved are relevant to the question.

Calculating metrics can add latency and cost, so you may only want to do it when running an evaluation and avoid it when making a production execution. You can do this by putting the metric logic after a ['check if evaluating' operation](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/#check-if-evaluating).

### 3. Run evaluation and view results

Switch to the **Evaluations** tab on your workflow and click the **Run evaluation** button. An evaluation will start. Once the evaluation has finished, it will display a summary score for each metric.

You can see the results for each test case by clicking on the test run row. Clicking on an individual test case will open the execution that produced it (in a new tab).

# Overview

## What are evaluations?

Evaluation is a crucial technique for checking that your AI workflow is reliable. It can be the difference between a flaky proof of concept and a solid production workflow. It's important both in the building phase and after deploying to production.

The foundation of evaluation is running a test dataset through your workflow. This dataset contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a sample input for your workflow, and often includes the expected output(s) too.

Evaluation allows you to:

- **Test your workflow over a range of inputs** so you know how it performs on edge cases
- **Make changes with confidence** without inadvertently making things worse elsewhere
- **Compare performance** across different models or prompts

The following video explains what evaluations are, why they're useful, and how they work:

## Why is evaluation needed?

AI models are fundamentally different than code. Code is deterministic and you can reason about it. This is difficult to do with LLMs, since they're black boxes. Instead, you must *measure* LLM output by running data through them and observing the output.

You can only build confidence that your model performs reliably after you have run it over multiple inputs that accurately reflect all the edge cases that it will have to deal with in production.

## Two types of evaluation

### Light evaluation (pre-deployment)

Building a clean, comprehensive dataset is hard. In the initial building phase, it often makes sense to generate just a handful of examples. These can be enough to iterate the workflow to a releasable state (or a proof of concept). You can visually compare the results to get a sense of the workflow's quality, without setting up formal metrics.

### Metric-based evaluation (post-deployment)

Once you deploy your workflow, it's easier to build a bigger, more representative dataset from production executions. When you discover a bug, you can add the input that caused it to the dataset. When fixing the bug, it's important to run the whole dataset over the workflow again as a [regression test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) to check that the fix hasn't inadvertently made something else worse.

Since there are too many test cases to check individually, evaluations measure the quality of the outputs using a metric, a numeric value representing a particular characteristic. This also allows you to track quality changes between runs.

### Comparison of evaluation types

|                                                  | Light evaluation (pre-deployment) | Metric-based evaluation (post-deployment) |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Performance improvements with each iteration** | Large                             | Small                                     |
| **Dataset size**                                 | Small                             | Large                                     |
| **Dataset sources**                              | Hand-generated AI-generated Other | Production executions AI-generated Other  |
| **Actual outputs**                               | Required                          | Required                                  |
| **Expected outputs**                             | Optional                          | Required (usually)                        |
| **Evaluation** **metric**                        | Optional                          | Required                                  |

# Tips and common issues

## Combining multiple triggers

If you have another trigger in the workflow already, you have two potential starting points: that trigger and the [evaluation trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger/). To make sure your workflow works as expected no matter which trigger executes, you will need to merge these branches together.

Logic to merge two trigger branches together so that they have the same data format and can be referenced from a single node.

To do so:

1. **Get the data format of the other trigger**:
   - Execute the other trigger.
   - Open it and navigate to the JSON view of its output pane.
   - Click the **copy** button on the right.
1. **Re-shape the evaluation trigger data to match**:
   - Insert an [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the evaluation trigger and connect them together.
   - Change its mode to **JSON**.
   - Paste your data into the 'JSON' field, removing the `[` and `]` on the first and last lines.
   - Switch the field type to **Expression**.
   - Map in the data from the trigger by dragging it from the input pane.
   - For strings, make sure to replace the entire value (including the quotes) and add `.toJsonString()` to the end of the expression.
1. **Merge the branches using a 'No-op' node**: Insert a [No-op node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.noop/) and wire both the other trigger and the Set node up to it. The 'No-op' node just outputs whatever input it receives.
1. **Reference the 'No-op' node outputs in the rest of the workflow**: Since both paths will flow through this node with the same format, you can be sure that your input data will always be there.

## Avoiding evaluation breaking the chat

n8n's internal chat reads the output data of the last executed node in the workflow. After adding an evaluation node with the ['set outputs' operation](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/#set-outputs), this data may not be in the expected format, or even contain the chat response.

The solution is to add an extra branch coming out of your agent. [Lower branches execute later](../../../flow-logic/execution-order/) in n8n, which means any node you attach to this branch will execute last. You can use a no-op node here since it only needs to pass the agent output through.

## Accessing tool data when calculating metrics

Sometimes you need to know what happened in executed sub-nodes of an agent, for example to check whether it executed a tool. You can't reference these nodes directly with expressions, but you can enable the **Return intermediate steps** option in the agent. This will add an extra output field called `intermediateSteps` which you can use in later nodes:

## Multiple evaluations in the same workflow

You can only have one evaluation set up per workflow. In other words, you can only have one evaluation trigger per workflow.

Even so, you can still test different parts of your workflow with different evaluations by putting those parts in [sub-workflows](../../../flow-logic/subworkflows/) and evaluating each sub-workflow.

## Dealing with inconsistent results

Metrics can often have noise: they may be different across evaluation runs of the exact same workflow. This is because the workflow itself may return different results, or any LLM-based metrics might have natural variation in them.

You can compensate for this by duplicating the rows of your dataset, so that each row appears more than once in the dataset. Since this means that each input will effectively be running multiple times, it will smooth out any variations.

# Demonstration of key differences between agents and chains

In this workflow you can choose whether your chat query goes to an [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) or [chain](../../../glossary/#ai-chain). It shows some of the ways that agents are more powerful than chains.

# What's an agent in AI?

One way to think of an [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is as a [chain](../understand-chains/) that knows how to make decisions. Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.

Agents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool). When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.

## Agents in n8n

n8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.

When you execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user.

# What's a chain in AI?

[Chains](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) bring together different components of AI to create a cohesive system. They set up a sequence of calls between the components. These components can include models and [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).

## Chains in n8n

n8n provides three chain nodes:

- [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.
- [Question and Answer Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a [vector store](../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.
- [Summarization Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.

There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app.

# What's memory in AI?

Memory is a key part of AI chat services. The [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) keeps a history of previous messages, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.

## AI memory in n8n

To add memory to your AI workflow you can use either:

- [Simple Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/): stores a customizable length of chat history for the current session. This is the easiest to get started with.
- One of the memory services that n8n provides nodes for. These include:
  - [Motorhead](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)
  - [Redis Chat Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryredischat/)
  - [Postgres Chat Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat/)
  - [Xata](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryxata/)
  - [Zep](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)

If you need to do advanced AI memory management in your workflows, use the [Chat Memory Manager](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node.

This node is useful when you:

- Can't add a memory node directly.
- Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed.
- Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context.

# What's a tool in AI?

In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:

> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/))

> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/))

## AI tools in n8n

n8n provides tool [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that you can connect to your [AI agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent). As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:

- [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
- [Custom Code Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.
- [HTTP Request Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

The next three examples highlight the Call n8n Workflow Tool:

- [Chat with Google Sheets](../data-google-sheets/)
- [Call an API to fetch data](../api-workflow-tool/)
- [Set up a human fallback](../human-fallback/)

You can also learn how to [let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the `$fromAI()` function](../using-the-fromai-function/).

# What are vector databases?

Vector databases store information as numbers:

> A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db))

This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.

## A simplified example

A vector database could store the sentence "n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.

Suppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:

| Sentence                                                         | Vector (array of dimensions) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]              |
| Zapier is an automation tool                                     | [0.1]                        |
| Make is an automation tool                                       | [0.1]                        |
| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host                 | [0.3]                        |

This example is very simplified

In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.

## Demonstrating the power of similarity search

Qdrant provides [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/) to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.

> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))

For full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery).

## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders

Vector databases require other tools to function:

- Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for [embedding](../../../glossary/#ai-embedding). Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.
- Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.
- Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.

# Let AI specify the tool parameters

When configuring [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connected to the Tools Agent, many parameters can be filled in by the AI model itself. The AI model will use the context from the task and information from other connected tools to fill in the appropriate details.

There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between them.

## Let the model fill in the parameter

Each appropriate parameter field in the tool's editing dialog has an extra button at the end:

On activating this button, the [AI Agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) will fill in the expression for you, with no need for any further user input. The field itself is filled in with a message indicating that the parameter has been defined automatically by the model.

If you want to define the parameter yourself, click on the 'X' in this box to revert to user-defined values. Note that the 'expression' field will now contain the expression generated by this feature, though you can now edit it further to add extra details as described in the following section.

Warning

Activating this feature will overwrite any manual definition you may have already added.

## Use the `$fromAI()` function

The `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

Only for tools

The `$fromAI()` function is only available for tools connected to the AI Agent node. The `$fromAI()` function doesn't work with the [Code](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/) tool or with [other non-tool cluster sub-nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/).

To use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:

```
{{ $fromAI('email') }}
```

The `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.

For instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.

### Parameters

The `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Type   | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`          | string |           | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `description`  | string |           | A string describing the argument.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `type`         | string |           | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string).                                                                                                        |
| `defaultValue` | any    |           | The default value to use for the argument.                                                                                                                                                              |

### Examples

As an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:

```
$fromAI("name", "The commenter's name", "string", "Jane Doe")
```

If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:

```
$fromAI("name")
```

To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:

```
$fromAI("numItemsInStock", "Number of items in stock", "number", 5)
```

If you only want to fill in parts of a field with a dynamic value from the model, you can use it in a normal expression as well. For example, if you want the model to fill out the `subject` parameter for an e-mail, but always pre-fix the generated value with the string 'Generated by AI:', you could use the following expression:

```
Generated by AI: {{ $fromAI("subject") }}
```

### Templates

You can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following [templates](../../../glossary/#template-n8n):

- [Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text](https://n8n.io/workflows/2462-angie-personal-ai-assistant-with-telegram-voice-and-text/)
- [Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier](https://n8n.io/workflows/2468-automate-customer-support-issue-resolution-using-ai-text-classifier/)
- [Scale Deal Flow with a Pitch Deck AI Vision, Chatbot and QDrant Vector Store](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/)

# Populate a Pinecone vector database from a website

Use n8n to scrape a website, load the data into Pinecone, then query it using a chat workflow. This workflow uses the [HTTP node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get website data, extracts the relevant content using the [HTML node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/), then uses the [Pinecone Vector Store node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) to send it to Pinecone.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/populate_a_pinecone_vector_database_from_a_website.json)

## Key features

This workflow uses:

- [HTTP node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): fetches website data.
- [HTML node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/): simplifies the data by extracting the main content from the page.
- [Pinecone Vector Store node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) and [Embeddings OpenAI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsopenai/): transform the data into vectors and store it in Pinecone.
- [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and [Question and Answer Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) to query the vector database.

## Using the example

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

- Yellow: notes and information.
- Green: instructions to run the workflow.
- Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
- Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# LangChain concepts in n8n

This page explains how LangChain concepts and features map to n8n nodes.

This page includes lists of the LangChain-focused nodes in n8n. You can use any n8n node in a workflow where you interact with LangChain, to link LangChain to other services. The LangChain features uses n8n's [Cluster nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/).

n8n implements LangChain JS

This feature is n8n's implementation of [LangChain's JavaScript framework](https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction).

## Trigger nodes

[Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/)

## Cluster nodes

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

### Root nodes

Each cluster starts with one [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n).

#### Chains

A [chain](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) is a series of LLMs, and related tools, linked together to support functionality that can't be provided by a single LLM alone.

Available nodes:

- [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/)
- [Retrieval Q&A Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/)

Learn more about [chaining in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel).

#### Agents

> An [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) has access to a suite of tools, and determines which ones to use depending on the user input. Agents can use multiple tools, and use the output of one tool as the input to the next. [Source](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/def3a26c054575e1ed40b9062087e8c0a8899633/docs/core_docs/docs/modules/agents/index.mdx)

Available nodes:

- [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)

Learn more about [Agents in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/agents).

#### Vector stores

[Vector stores](../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) store embedded data, and perform vector searches on it.

- [Simple Vector Store](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreinmemory/)
- [PGVector Vector Store](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepgvector/)

Learn more about [Vector stores in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/vectorstores/).

#### Miscellaneous

Utility nodes.

[LangChain Code](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/): import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it.

### Sub-nodes

Each root node can have one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) attached to it.

#### Document loaders

Document loaders add data to your chain as documents. The data source can be a file or web service.

Available nodes:

- [Default Document Loader](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/)
- [GitHub Document Loader](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader/)

Learn more about [Document loaders in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/document_loaders).

#### Language models

[LLMs (large language models)](../../../glossary/#large-language-model-llm) are programs that analyze datasets. They're the key element of working with AI.

Available nodes:

- [Anthropic Chat Model](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatanthropic/)

Learn more about [Language models in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models).

#### Memory

[Memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) retains information about previous queries in a series of queries. For example, when a user interacts with a chat model, it's useful if your application can remember and call on the full conversation, not just the most recent query entered by the user.

Available nodes:

- [Motorhead](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)

# Use LangSmith with n8n

[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) is a developer platform created by the LangChain team. You can connect your n8n instance to LangSmith to record and monitor runs in n8n, just as you can in a LangChain application.

Feature availability

Self-hosted n8n only.

## Connect your n8n instance to LangSmith

1. [Log in to LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and get your API key.
1. Set the LangSmith environment variables:

| Variable                         | Value                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT`             | `"https://api.smith.langchain.com"`             |
| `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`           | `true`                                          |
| `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`              | Set this to your API key                        |
| `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`              | Optional project name (defaults to `"default"`) |
| `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` | `true` (asynchronous trace upload)              |

Note

If you just created your LangSmith account, you will see a project named **"default"** only after the first trace is sent from n8n.\
All traces go to this project unless you set `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` to a different name.

Note

Traces may appear with a short delay because `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` defaults to asynchronous submission.\
Set it to `false` if you prefer synchronous uploads for debugging.

Set the variables so that they're available globally in the environment where you host your n8n instance. You can do this in the same way as the rest of your general configuration.

1. Restart n8n.

For information on using LangSmith, refer to [LangSmith's documentation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).

# LangChain in n8n

n8n provides a collection of nodes that implement LangChain's functionality. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and so on. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.

- [Learning resources](../langchain-learning-resources/): n8n's documentation for LangChain assumes you're familiar with AI and LangChain concepts. This page provides links to learning resources.
- [LangChain concepts and features in n8n](../langchain-n8n/): how n8n represents LangChain concepts and features.

# n8n public REST API

Feature availability

The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.

Using n8n's public [API](../glossary/#api), you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. This section introduces n8n's REST API, including:

- How to [authenticate](authentication/)
- [Paginating](pagination/) results
- Using the [built-in API playground](using-api-playground/) (self-hosted n8n only)
- [Endpoint reference](api-reference/)

n8n provides an [n8n API node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

## Learn about REST APIs

The API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:

- [KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs](https://support.knowledgeowl.com/help/working-with-apis): a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.
- [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api): this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.
- [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis): more detailed information about REST APIs.
- [MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview): REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.

Use the API playground

Trying out the API in the [playground](using-api-playground/) can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.


# API authentication

n8n uses API keys to authenticate API calls.

Feature availability

The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.

## API Scopes

Users of [enterprise instances](https://n8n.io/enterprise/) can limit which resources and actions a key can access with scopes. API key scopes allow you specify the exact level of access a key needs for its intended purpose.

Non-enterprise API keys have full access to all the account's resources and capabilities.

## Create an API key

1. Log in to n8n.
1. Go to **Settings** > **n8n API**.
1. Select **Create an API key**.
1. Choose a **Label** and set an **Expiration** time for the key.
1. If on an enterprise plan, choose the **Scopes** to give the key.
1. Copy **My API Key** and use this key to authenticate your calls.

## Call the API using your key

Send the API key in your API call as a header named `X-N8N-API-KEY`.

For example, say you want to get all active workflows. Your curl request will look like this:

```
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'
```

## Delete an API key

1. Log in to n8n.
1. Go to **Settings** > **n8n API**.
1. Select **Delete** next to the key you want to delete.
1. Confirm the delete by selecting **Delete Forever**.

# API pagination

The default page size is 100 results. You can change the page size limit. The maximum permitted size is 250.

When a response contains more than one page, it includes a cursor, which you can use to request the next pages.

For example, say you want to get all active workflows, 150 at a time.

Get the first page:

```
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'
```

The response is in JSON format, and includes a `nextCursor` value. This is an example response.

```
{
  "data": [
    // The response contains an object for each workflow
    {
      // Workflow data
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA"
}
```

Then to request the next page:

```
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

# For n8n Cloud
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150&cursor=MTIzZTQ1NjctZTg5Yi0xMmQzLWE0NTYtNDI2NjE0MTc0MDA' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

# Using an API playground

This documentation site provides a playground to test out calls. Self-hosted users also have access to a built-in playground hosted as part of their instance.

## Documentation playground

You can test API calls from this site's [API reference](../api-reference/). You need to set your server's base URL and instance name, and add an API key.

n8n uses [Scalar's](https://github.com/scalar/scalar) open source API platform to power this functionality.

Exposed API key and data

Use a test API key with limited scopes and test data when using a playground. All calls from the playground are routed through Scalar's proxy servers.

Real data

You have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.

## Built-in playground

Feature availability

The API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.

The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.

n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:

```
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs
```

The API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.

Real data

If you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.

The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:

```
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}
```

How to find `credentialTypeName`

To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:

```
{
    ...,
    "credentials": {
        "googleDriveOAuth2Api": {
        "id": "9",
        "name": "Google Drive"
        }
    }
}
```

# Code in n8n

n8n is a low-code tool. This means you can do a lot without code, then add code when needed.

## Code in your workflows

There are two places in your workflows where you can use code:

- **Expressions**

  Use [expressions](../glossary/#expression-n8n) to transform [data](../data/) in your nodes. You can use JavaScript in expressions, as well as n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](builtin/overview/) and [Data transformation functions](builtin/data-transformation-functions/).

  [Expressions](expressions/)

- **Code node**

  Use the Code node to add JavaScript or Python to your workflow.

  [Code node](code-node/)

## Other technical resources

These are features that are relevant to technical users.

### Technical nodes

n8n provides core nodes, which simplify adding key functionality such as API requests, webhooks, scheduling, and file handling.

- **Write a backend**

  The [HTTP Request](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/), [Webhook](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/), and [Code](code-node/) nodes help you make API calls, respond to webhooks, and write any JavaScript in your workflow.

  Use this do things like [Create an API endpoint](https://n8n.io/workflows/1750-creating-an-api-endpoint/).

  [Core nodes](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/)

- **Represent complex logic**

  You can build complex flows, using nodes like [If](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), [Switch](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/), and [Merge](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) nodes.

  [Flow logic](../flow-logic/)

### Other developer resources

- **The n8n API**

  n8n provides an API, where you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. There's an [n8n API node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

  [API](../api/)

- **Self-host**

  You can self-host n8n. This keeps your data on your own infrastructure.

  [Hosting](../hosting/)

- **Build your own nodes**

  You can build custom nodes, install them on your n8n instance, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

# AI coding with GPT

Not available on self-hosted.

Python isn't supported. ///

## Use AI in the Code node

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
1. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
1. Write your query.
1. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## Usage limits

During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.

## Feature limits

The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:

- The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.
- The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.
- Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.
- Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.
- May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.

## Writing good prompts

Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.

Some general tips:

- Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.
- Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: "First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name."
- Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying "Get the older users," you might say "Filter users who are 60 years and above."
- Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.

And some n8n-specific guidance:

- Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.
- Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. "Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: "Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node."
- Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.

### Example prompts

These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.

#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the third Code node, enter this prompt:

> The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```
const slackUser = $("Mock Slack").all()[0];
const notionUsers = $input.all();
const slackUserEmail = slackUser.json.email;

const notionUser = notionUsers.find(
  (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail
);

return notionUser ? [{ json: { notionId: notionUser.json.id } }] : [];
```

#### Example 2: Data transformation

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/data-transformation.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Join items** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```
const items = $input.all();
const usernames = items.map((item) => `"${item.json.username}"`);
const result = usernames.join(", ");
return [{ json: { usernames: result } }];
```

#### Example 3: Summarize data and create a Slack message

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/summarize-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Summarize** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property_type field. A feature has the property "Feature", a bug has the property "Bug" and an idea has the property "Bug". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use "" as markdown for links.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```
const submissions = $input.all();

// Count the number of ideas, features, and bugs
let ideaCount = 0;
let featureCount = 0;
let bugCount = 0;

submissions.forEach((submission) => {
  switch (submission.json.property_type[0]) {
    case "Idea":
      ideaCount++;
      break;
    case "Feature":
      featureCount++;
      break;
    case "Bug":
      bugCount++;
      break;
  }
});

// Sort submissions by votes and take the top 5
const topSubmissions = submissions
  .sort((a, b) => b.json.property_votes - a.json.property_votes)
  .slice(0, 5);

let topSubmissionText = "";
topSubmissions.forEach((submission) => {
  topSubmissionText += `<${submission.json.url}|${submission.json.name}> with ${submission.json.property_votes} votes\n`;
});

// Construct the Slack message
const slackMessage = `*Summary of Submissions*\n
Ideas: ${ideaCount}\n
Features: ${featureCount}\n
Bugs: ${bugCount}\n
Top 5 Submissions:\n
${topSubmissionText}`;

return [{ json: { slackMessage } }];
```

### Reference incoming node data explicitly

If your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/reference-incoming-data-explicitly.json) and import it into n8n.

In the second Code node, enter this prompt:

> The data in "Mock data" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal_info.first_name and work_info.job_title.

This is the JavaScript you need:

```
const items = $input.all();
const newItems = items.map((item) => {
  const firstName = item.json.personal_info.first_name;
  const jobTitle = item.json.work_info.job_title;
  return {
    json: {
      firstName,
      jobTitle,
    },
  };
});
return newItems;
```

### Related resources

Pluralsight offer a short guide on [How to use ChatGPT to write code](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/how-use-chatgpt-programming-coding), which includes example prompts.

## Fixing the code

The AI-generated code may work without any changes, but you may have to edit it. You need to be aware of n8n's [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/). You may also find n8n's built-in methods and variables useful.

# Using the Code node

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

Coding in n8n

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](../) section. It includes:

- Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/)
- Guidance on [Handling dates](../cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](../cookbook/jmespath/)
- A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](../cookbook/code-node/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.

Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

## Usage

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode

There are two modes:

- **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
- **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features

The Code node supports:

- Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
- Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

- [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
- [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python (Pyodide - legacy)

Pyodide is a legacy feature. n8n v2 no longer supports this feature.

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

- [Read/Write File From Disk](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
- [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Python (Native)

n8n added native Python support using task runners in version 1.111.0. This feature is stable as of n8n v2.

Main differences from Pyodide:

- Native Python supports only `_items` in all-items mode and `_item` in per-item mode. It doesn't support other n8n built-in methods and variables.
- Native Python supports importing native Python modules from the standard library and from third-parties, if the `n8nio/runners` image includes them and explicitly allowlists them. See [adding extra dependencies for task runners](../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/#adding-extra-dependencies) for more details.
- Native Python denies insecure built-ins by default. See [task runners environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/) for more details.
- Unlike Pyodide, which accepts dot access notation, for example, `item.json.myNewField`, native Python only accepts bracket access notation, for example, `item["json"]["my_new_field"]`. There may be other minor syntax differences where Pyodide accepts constructs that aren't legal in native Python.
- On n8n cloud, the Python option for the Code node doesn't allow users to import any third-party Python libraries. Self-hosting users can find setup instructions to include external libraries [here](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/#adding-extra-dependencies). In the long term, the n8n team is committed to allowing users to securely execute arbitrary Python code with any first- and third-party libraries using task runners.

Upgrading to native Python is a breaking change, so you may need to adjust your Python scripts to use the native Python runner.

## Coding in n8n

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

- [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
- [Item linking](../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

- Accessing specific item data
- Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
- Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
1. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
1. Write your query.
1. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

# Expressions

Expressions are a powerful feature implemented in all n8n nodes. They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from:

- Previous node executions
- The workflow
- Your n8n environment

You can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code.

n8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament), and extends it with [custom methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) and [data transformation functions](../builtin/data-transformation-functions/). These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata.

n8n additionally supports two libraries:

- [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/), for working with dates and time.
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), for querying JSON.

Data in n8n

When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](../../data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.

## Writing expressions

To use an expression to set a parameter value:

1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
1. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.
1. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor** to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.

### Example: Get data from webhook body

Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.

Your webhook data looks similar to this:

```
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "n8n.instance.address",
      ...
    },
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "body": {
      "name": "Jim",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York"
    }
  }
]
```

In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:

```
{{$json.body.city}}
```

This expression:

1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.
1. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, "New York"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.

### Example: Writing longer JavaScript

You can do things like variable assignments or multiple statements in an expression, but you need to wrap your code using the syntax for an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

The following code use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months. We surround the code in both the handlebar brackets for an expression and the IIFE syntax.

```
{{(()=>{
  let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');
  let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');
  let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');
  return diffInMonths.toObject();
})()}}
```

## Common issues

For common errors or issues with expressions and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](../cookbook/expressions/common-issues/).

# Custom variables

Feature availability

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro Cloud plans.
- Only instance owners and admins can create variables.

Custom variables are read-only variables that you can use to store and reuse values in n8n workflows.

Variable scope and availability

- **Global variables** are available to everyone on your n8n instance, across all projects.
- **Project-scoped variables** are available only within the specific project they're created in.
- Project-scoped variables are available in 1.118.0 and above. Previous versions only support global variables accessible from the left side menu.

## Create variables

You can access the **Variables** tab from either the overview page or a specific project.

To create a new variable:

1. On the **Variables** tab, select **Add Variable**.
1. Enter a **Key** and **Value**. The maximum key length is 50 characters, and the maximum value length is 1000 characters. n8n limits the characters you can use in the key and value to lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
1. Select the **Scope** (only available when creating from the overview page):
   - **Global**: The variable is available across all projects in the n8n instance.
   - **Project**: The variable is available only within a specific project (you can select which project).
   - When creating from a project page, the scope is automatically set to that project.
1. Select **Save**. The variable is now available for use in workflows according to its scope.

## Edit and delete variables

To edit or delete a variable:

1. On the **Variables** tab, hover over the variable you want to change.
1. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.

## Use variables in workflows

You can access variables in the Code node and in [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n):

```
// Access a variable
$vars.<variable-name>
```

All variables are strings.

During workflow execution, n8n replaces the variables with the variable value. If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as `undefined`. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.

Variable precedence

When a project-scoped variable has the same key as a global variable, the project-scoped variable value takes precedence and overrides the global variable value within that project's workflows.

Variables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use [Workflow static data](../cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/).

# Convenience methods

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in [expressions](../../../glossary/#expression-n8n).

Python support

You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.

| `$evaluateExpression(expression: string, itemIndex?: number)` | Evaluates a string as an expression. If you don't provide `itemIndex`, n8n uses the data from item 0 in the Code node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                         |

Don't mix native JavaScript and Luxon dates

While you can use both native JavaScript dates and Luxon dates in n8n, they aren't directly interoperable. It's best to [convert JavaScript dates to Luxon](../../cookbook/luxon/#convert-javascript-dates-to-luxon) to avoid problems.

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

# HTTP node variables

Variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination.

# Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. This section provides a reference of available methods and variables for use in [expressions](../../../glossary/#expression-n8n), with a short description.

Availability in the expressions editor and the Code node

Some methods and variables aren't available in the Code node. These aren't in the documentation.

All data transformation functions are only available in the expressions editor.

The [Cookbook](../../) contains examples for some common tasks, including some [Code node only](../../cookbook/code-node/) functions.

- [Current node input](/code/builtin/current-node-input/)
- [Output of other nodes](/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/)
- [Date and time](/code/builtin/date-time/)
- [JMESPath](/code/builtin/jmespath/)
- [HTTP node](/code/builtin/http-node-variables/)
- [LangChain Code node](/code/builtin/langchain-methods/)
- [n8n metadata](/code/builtin/n8n-metadata/)
- [Convenience methods](/code/builtin/convenience/)
- [Data transformation functions](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/)

# Data transformation functions

Data transformation functions are helper functions to make data transformation easier in [expressions](../../../glossary/#expression-n8n).

JavaScript in expressions

You can use any JavaScript in expressions. Refer to [Expressions](../../expressions/) for more information.

For a list of available functions, refer to the page for your data type:

- [Arrays](arrays/)
- [Dates](dates/)
- [Numbers](numbers/)
- [Objects](objects/)
- [Strings](strings/)

## Usage

Data transformation functions are available in the expressions editor.

The syntax is:

```
{{ dataItem.function() }}
```

For example, to check if a string is an email:

```
{{ "example@example.com".isEmail() }}

// Returns true
```

# Query JSON with JMESPath

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

## The `jmespath()` method

n8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.

The basic syntax is:

```
$jmespath(object, searchString)
```

```
_jmespath(object, searchString)
```

To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:

```
var jmespath = require('jmespath');
jmespath.search(object, searchString);
```

Expressions must be single-line

The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.

`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) provide interactive examples.

Search parameter order

The examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/), which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.

## Common tasks

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.

### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections

From the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections):

> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
>
> - List Projections
> - Slice Projections
> - Object Projections
> - Flatten Projections
> - Filter Projections

The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections) for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

```
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "n8n.instance.address",
      ...
    },
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "body": {
      "people": [
        {
          "first": "James",
          "last": "Green"
        },
        {
          "first": "Jacob",
          "last": "Jones"
        },
        {
          "first": "Jayden",
          "last": "Smith"
        }
      ],
      "dogs": {
        "Fido": {
          "color": "brown",
          "age": 7
        },
        "Spot": {
          "color": "black and white",
          "age": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Retrieve a [list](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#list-and-slice-projections) of all the people's first names:

```
{{$jmespath($json.body.people, "[*].first" )}}
// Returns ["James", "Jacob", "Jayden"]
```

```
let firstNames = $jmespath($json.body.people, "[*].first" )
return {firstNames};
/* Returns:
[
	{
		"firstNames": [
			"James",
			"Jacob",
			"Jayden"
		]
	}
]
*/
```

```
firstNames = _jmespath(_json.body.people, "[*].first" )
return {"firstNames":firstNames}
"""
Returns:
[
 	{
		"firstNames": [
			"James",
			"Jacob",
			"Jayden"
		]
	}
]
"""
```

Get a [slice](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#list-and-slice-projections) of the first names:

```
{{$jmespath($json.body.people, "[:2].first")}}
// Returns ["James", "Jacob"]
```

```
let firstTwoNames = $jmespath($json.body.people, "[:2].first");
return {firstTwoNames};
/* Returns:
[
	{
		"firstNames": [
			"James",
			"Jacob",
			"Jayden"
		]
	}
]
*/
```

```
firstTwoNames = _jmespath(_json.body.people, "[:2].first" )
return {"firstTwoNames":firstTwoNames}
"""
Returns:
[
	{
		"firstTwoNames": [
		"James",
		"Jacob"
		]
	}
]
"""
```

Get a list of the dogs' ages using [object projections](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#object-projections):

```
{{$jmespath($json.body.dogs, "*.age")}}
// Returns [7,5]
```

```
let dogsAges = $jmespath($json.body.dogs, "*.age");
return {dogsAges};
/* Returns:
[
	{
		"dogsAges": [
			7,
			5
		]
	}
]
*/
```

```
dogsAges = _jmespath(_json.body.dogs, "*.age")
return {"dogsAges": dogsAges}
"""
Returns:
[
	{
		"dogsAges": [
			7,
			5
		]
	}
]
"""
```

### Select multiple elements and create a new list or object

Use [Multiselect](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#multiselect) to select elements from a JSON object and combine them into a new list or object.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

```
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "n8n.instance.address",
      ...
    },
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "body": {
      "people": [
        {
          "first": "James",
          "last": "Green"
        },
        {
          "first": "Jacob",
          "last": "Jones"
        },
        {
          "first": "Jayden",
          "last": "Smith"
        }
      ],
      "dogs": {
        "Fido": {
          "color": "brown",
          "age": 7
        },
        "Spot": {
          "color": "black and white",
          "age": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Use multiselect list to get the first and last names and create new lists containing both names:

```
{{$jmespath($json.body.people, "[].[first, last]")}}
// Returns [["James","Green"],["Jacob","Jones"],["Jayden","Smith"]]
```

```
let newList = $jmespath($json.body.people, "[].[first, last]");
return {newList};
/* Returns:
[
	{
		"newList": [
			[
				"James",
				"Green"
			],
			[
				"Jacob",
				"Jones"
			],
			[
				"Jayden",
				"Smith"
			]
		]
	}
]
*/
```

```
newList = _jmespath(_json.body.people, "[].[first, last]")
return {"newList":newList}
"""
Returns:
[
	{
		"newList": [
			[
				"James",
				"Green"
			],
			[
				"Jacob",
				"Jones"
			],
			[
				"Jayden",
				"Smith"
			]
		]
	}
]
"""
```

### An alternative to arrow functions in expressions

For example, generate some input data by returning the below code from the Code node:

```
return[
  {
    "json": {      
      "num_categories": "0",
      "num_products": "45",
      "category_id": 5529735,
      "parent_id": 1407340,
      "pos_enabled": 1,
      "pos_favorite": 0,
      "name": "HP",
      "description": "",
      "image": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "json": {
      "num_categories": "0",
      "num_products": "86",
      "category_id": 5529740,
      "parent_id": 1407340,
      "pos_enabled": 1,
      "pos_favorite": 0,
      "name": "Lenovo",
      "description": "",
      "image": ""
    }
  }  
]
```

You could do a search like "find the item with the name Lenovo and tell me their category ID."

```
{{ $jmespath($("Code").all(), "[?json.name=='Lenovo'].json.category_id") }}
```

# Date and time with Luxon

[Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.

Python support

Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience [variables](#get-the-current-datetime-or-date) created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:

- You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.
- The generic Luxon functionality, such as [Convert date string to Luxon](#convert-date-string-to-luxon), isn't available for Python users.

## Date and time behavior in n8n

Be aware of the following:

- In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.
- Using Luxon's `DateTime()` is the recommended approach in n8n. Using vanilla JavaScript's `Date()` doesn't work with some n8n features. For example, it doesn't respect the [Workflow-specific Time Zone](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/#timezone).
- With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

## Setting the timezone in n8n

Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:

- Default: `America/New York`
- A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.
- A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.

## Common tasks

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

### Get the current datetime or date

Use the [`$now` and `$today` Luxon objects](../../builtin/date-time/) to get the current time or day:

- `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.
- `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.

Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string:

```
{{$now}}
// n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp
// For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00
{{"Today's date is " + $now}}
// n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>"
// For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"
```

```
$now
// n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp>
// For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00
let rightNow = "Today's date is " + $now
// n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>"
// For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"
```

```
_now
# n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp>
# For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00
rightNow = "Today's date is " + str(_now)
# n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>"
# For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"
```

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

### Convert JavaScript dates to Luxon

To convert a native JavaScript date to a Luxon date:

- In expressions, use the [`.toDateTime()` method](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/#date-toDateTime). For example, `{{ (new Date()).ToDateTime() }}`.
- In the Code node, use `DateTime.fromJSDate()`. For example, `let luxondate = DateTime.fromJSDate(new Date())`.

### Convert date string to Luxon

You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.

A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date

With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:

Most dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:

```
{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}
```

```
let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')
```

Luxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso).

Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.

#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:

Use Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.

For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:

```
{{DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")}}
```

```
let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")
```

When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations). If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging) guide.

### Get n days from today

Get a number of days before or after today.

For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.

In the expressions editor, enter:

```
{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}
```

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.

In the code editor, enter:

```
let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})
```

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For more detailed information and examples, refer to:

- Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)
- Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)

### Create human-readable dates

In [Get n days from today](#get-n-days-from-today), the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: "yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00"]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.

For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.

This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.

```
{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}
```

```
let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()
```

You can alter the format. For example:

```
{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}
```

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".

```
let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})
```

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".

Refer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans) for more information.

### Get the time between two dates

To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.

For example, get the number of months between two dates:

```
{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}
```

This returns `[Object: {"months":1}]`.

```
let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()
```

This returns `{"months":1}`.

Refer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs) for more information.

### A longer example: How many days to Christmas?

This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.

The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.

```
{{"There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!"}}
```

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the expression does:

- `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.
- `"There are "`: a string.
- `+`: used to join two strings.
- `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
- `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
- `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {"days":-291}]`.
- `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](../jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
- `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
- `+ " days to Christmas!"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.
- `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.

```
let daysToChristmas = "There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!";
```

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

# Examples using n8n's built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. This section provides usage examples.

- [execution](/code/cookbook/builtin/execution/)
- [getWorkflowStaticData](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/)
- [Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow](/code/cookbook/builtin/itemmatching/)
- [(node-name).all](/code/cookbook/builtin/all/)

- [Code node](../../code-node/)

# `("<node-name>").all(branchIndex?: number, runIndex?: number)`

This gives access to all the items of the current or parent nodes. If you don't supply any parameters, it returns all the items of the current node.

## Getting items

```
// Returns all the items of the given node and current run
let allItems = $("<node-name>").all();

// Returns all items the node "IF" outputs (index: 0 which is Output "true" of its most recent run)
let allItems = $("IF").all();

// Returns all items the node "IF" outputs (index: 0 which is Output "true" of the same run as current node)
let allItems = $("IF").all(0, $runIndex);

// Returns all items the node "IF" outputs (index: 1 which is Output "false" of run 0 which is the first run)
let allItems = $("IF").all(1, 0);
```

```
# Returns all the items of the given node and current run
allItems = _("<node-name>").all();

# Returns all items the node "IF" outputs (index: 0 which is Output "true" of its most recent run)
allItems = _("IF").all();

# Returns all items the node "IF" outputs (index: 0 which is Output "true" of the same run as current node)
allItems = _("IF").all(0, _runIndex);

# Returns all items the node "IF" outputs (index: 1 which is Output "false" of run 0 which is the first run)
allItems = _("IF").all(1, 0);
```

## Accessing item data

Get all items output by a previous node, and log out the data they contain:

```
previousNodeData = $("<node-name>").all();
for(let i=0; i<previousNodeData.length; i++) {
	console.log(previousNodeData[i].json);
}
```

```
previousNodeData = _("<node-name>").all();
for item in previousNodeData:
	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
	# You need to convert it to a Dict
	itemDict = item.json.to_py()
	print(itemDict)
```

# `execution`

## `execution.id`

Contains the unique ID of the current workflow execution.

```
let executionId = $execution.id;
```

```
executionId = _execution.id
```

## `execution.resumeUrl`

The webhook URL to call to resume a [waiting](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) workflow.

See the [Wait > On webhook call](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#on-webhook-call) documentation to learn more.

`execution.resumeUrl` is available in workflows containing a Wait node, along with a node that waits for a webhook response.

## `execution.customData`

This is only available in the Code node.

```
// Set a single piece of custom execution data
$execution.customData.set("key", "value");

// Set the custom execution data object
$execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})

// Access the current state of the object during the execution
var customData = $execution.customData.getAll()

// Access a specific value set during this execution
var customData = $execution.customData.get("key")
```

```
# Set a single piece of custom execution data
_execution.customData.set("key", "value");

# Set the custom execution data object
_execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})

# Access the current state of the object during the execution
customData = _execution.customData.getAll()

# Access a specific value set during this execution
customData = _execution.customData.get("key")
```

Refer to [Custom executions data](../../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for more information.

______________________________________________________________________

# `getWorkflowStaticData(type)`

This gives access to the static workflow data.

Experimental feature

- Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a [trigger](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) or webhook to save static data.
- This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.

You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.

As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data has changed and saves it, if necessary.

There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.

Example with global data:

```
// Get the global workflow static data
const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');

// Access its data
const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;

// Update its data
workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();

// Delete data
delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution;
```

```
# Get the global workflow static data
workflowStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('global')

# Access its data
lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution

# Update its data
workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()

# Delete data
delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution
```

Example with node data:

```
// Get the static data of the node
const nodeStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('node');

// Access its data
const lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution;

// Update its data
nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();

// Delete data
delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution;
```

```
# Get the static data of the node
nodeStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('node')

# Access its data
lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution

# Update its data
nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()

# Delete data
delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution
```

# Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow

Every item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.

To access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `("<node-name>").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.

For example, consider a workflow that does the following:

1. The Customer Datastore node generates example data:

   ```
   [
   	{
   		"id": "23423532",
   		"name": "Jay Gatsby",
   		"email": "gatsby@west-egg.com",
   		"notes": "Keeps asking about a green light??",
   		"country": "US",
   		"created": "1925-04-10"
   	},
   	{
   		"id": "23423533",
   		"name": "José Arcadio Buendía",
   		"email": "jab@macondo.co",
   		"notes": "Lots of people named after him. Very confusing",
   		"country": "CO",
   		"created": "1967-05-05"
   	},
   	...
   ]
   ```

1. The Edit Fields node simplifies this data:

   ```
   [
   	{
   		"name": "Jay Gatsby"
   	},
   	{
   		"name": "José Arcadio Buendía"
   	},
       ...
   ]
   ```

1. The Code node restore the email address to the correct person:

   ```
   [
   	{
   		"name": "Jay Gatsby",
   		"restoreEmail": "gatsby@west-egg.com"
   	},
   	{
   		"name": "José Arcadio Buendía",
   		"restoreEmail": "jab@macondo.co"
   	},
   	...
   ]
   ```

The Code node does this using the following code:

```
for(let i=0; i<$input.all().length; i++) {
	$input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = $('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email;
}
return $input.all();
```

```
for i,item in enumerate(_input.all()):
	_input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = _('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email

return _input.all();
```

You can view and download the example workflow from [n8n website | itemMatchin usage example](https://n8n.io/workflows/1966-itemmatching-usage-example/) .

# `vars`

Feature availability

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans.
- You need access to the n8n instance owner account to create variables.

`vars` contains all [Variables](../../../variables/) for the active environment. It's read-only: you can access variables using `vars`, but must set them using the UI.

```
// Access a variable
$vars.<variable-name>
```

```
# Access a variable
_vars.<variable-name>
```

`vars` and `env`

`vars` gives access to user-created variables. It's part of the [Environments](../../../../source-control-environments/) feature. `env` gives access to the [configuration environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for your n8n instance.

# Code node cookbook

This section contains examples and recipes for tasks you can do with the Code node.

- [Get number of items returned by last node](/code/cookbook/code-node/number-items-last-node/)
- [Get the binary data buffer](/code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/)
- [Output to the browser console](/code/cookbook/code-node/console-log/)

## Related resources

- [Built-in methods and variables reference](../../builtin/overview/)
- [Code node](../../code-node/)

# Output to the browser console with `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node

You can use `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

For help opening your browser console, refer to [this guide by Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/).

## console.log (JavaScript)

For technical information on `console.log()`, refer to the [MDN developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log).

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

```
let a = "apple";
console.log(a);
```

## print (Python)

For technical information on `print()`, refer to the [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-print/).

For example, set your Code node **Language** to **Python**, copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:

```
a = "apple"
print(a)
```

### Handling an output of `[object Object]`

If the console displays `[object Object]` when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.

To check the data type:

```
print(type(myData))
```

#### JsProxy

If `type()` outputs `<class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>`, you need to convert the JsProxy to a native Python object using `to_py()`. This occurs when working with data in the n8n node data structure, such as node inputs and outputs. For example, if you want to print the data from a previous node in the workflow:

```
previousNodeData = _("<node-name>").all();
for item in previousNodeData:
	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
	# You need to convert it to a Dict
	itemDict = item.json.to_py()
	print(itemDict)
```

Refer to the Pyodide documentation on [JsProxy](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.JsProxy) for more information on this class.

# Get the binary data buffer

The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:

- Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
- Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
- Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.

Not available in Python

`getBinaryDataBuffer()` isn't supported when using Python.

You can access the buffer using n8n's `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function:

```
/* 
* itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data.
* binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property. 
* The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'. 
*/
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(itemIndex, binaryPropertyName);
```

For example:

```
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(0, 'data');
// Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item
```

You should always use the `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like `items[0].binary.data.data`.

# Get number of items returned by the previous node

To get the number of items returned by the previous node:

```
if (Object.keys(items[0].json).length === 0) {
return [
	{
		json: {
			results: 0,
		}
	}
]
}
return [
	{
		json: {
			results: items.length,
		}
	}
];
```

The output will be similar to the following.

```
[
	{
		"results": 8
	}
]
```

```
if len(items[0].json) == 0:
	return [
		{
			"json": {
				"results": 0,
			}
		}
	]
else:
	return [
		{
			"json": {
				"results": items.length,
			}
		}
	]
```

The output will be similar to the following.

```
[
	{
		"results": 8
	}
]
```

# Expressions cookbook

This section contains examples and recipes for tasks you can do with [expressions](../../../glossary/#expression-n8n).

Python support

You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.

- [Check incoming data](/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/)
- [Common issues](/code/cookbook/expressions/common-issues/)

## Related resources

- [Built-in methods and variables reference](../../builtin/overview/)
- [Expressions](../../expressions/)

# Check incoming data

At times, you may want to check the incoming data. If the incoming data doesn't match a condition, you may want to return a different value. For example, you want to check if a variable from the previous node is empty and return a string if it's empty. Use the following code snippet to return `not found` if the variable is empty.

```
{{$json["variable_name"]? $json["variable_name"] :"not found"}}
```

The above expression uses the ternary operator. You can learn more about the ternary operator [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

As an alternative, you can use the [nullish coalescing operator (??)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) or the [logical or operator (||)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR):

```
{{ $x ?? "default value" }}
{{ $x || "default value" }}
```

In either of the above two cases, the value of `$x` will be used if it's set to a non-null, non-false value. The string `default value` is the fallback value.

# Expressions common issues

Here are some common errors and issues related to [expressions](../../../expressions/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The 'JSON Output' in item 0 contains invalid JSON

This error occurs when you use JSON mode but don't provide a valid JSON object. Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as `The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object`.

To resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:

- Check the JSON with a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/).
- Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields.

## Can't get data for expression

This error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.

Another variation of this may appear as `Referenced node is unexecuted`. In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

> An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:

```
$("<node-name>").isExecuted
```

As an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:

```
{
  "my_field_1": {{ $input.params }}
}
```

## Invalid syntax

This error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.

For example, the expression in this JSON includes a trailing period, which results in an invalid syntax error:

```
{
  "my_field_1": "value",
  "my_field_2": {{ $('If').item.json. }}
}
```

To resolve this error, check your [expression syntax](../../../expressions/) to make sure they follow the expected format.

# Examples using n8n's HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. Use this node to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API.

Refer to [HTTP Request](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for information on node settings.

- [Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/)

## Related resources

- [HTTP Request](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [Built-in methods and variables reference](../../builtin/overview/)
- [Expressions](../../expressions/)

# Pagination in the HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](../../../builtin/http-node-variables/).

Refer to [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

- Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
- Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
- The structure of the data that the API returns.

## Enable pagination

In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.

## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`

If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.

1. In **Next URL**, use an [expression](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:

   ```
   {{ $response.body["next-page"] }}
   ```

## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`

If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
1. Set **Type** to **Query**.
1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.
1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.

## Navigate pagination through body parameters

If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:

1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**
1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
1. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.
1. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.
1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

## Set the page size in the query

If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:

1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.
1. In **Value**, enter your page size.

# Text courses

If you've found your way here, it means you're serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.

These tasks can and should be automated! And you don't need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this–with no-code tools like n8n, automation is for everyone.

## Available courses

- [Level 1: Beginner course](level-one/)
- [Level 2: Intermediate course](level-two/)

# Level one: Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 1**!

## Is this course right for me?

This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts within n8n and develops your low-code automation expertise.

This course is for you if you:

- Are starting to use n8n for the first time.
- Are looking for some extra help creating your first workflow.
- Want to automate processes in your personal or working life.

This course introduces n8n concepts and demonstrates practical workflow building without assuming any prior familiarity with n8n. If you'd like to get a feel for the basics without as much explanation, consult our [quickstart guide](../../try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow/).

## What will I learn in this course?

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of n8n, followed by practice of building workflows step by step.

By the end of this course you will know:

- How to set up n8n and navigate the Editor UI.
- How n8n structures data.
- How to configure different node parameters and add credentials.
- When and how to use conditional logic in workflows.
- How to schedule and control workflows.
- How to import, download, and share workflows with others.

You will build two workflows:

- A two-node workflow to get articles from Hacker News
- A seven-node workflow to help your client get records from a data warehouse, filter them, make calculations, and notify team members about the results

## What do I need to get started?

1. **n8n set up**: You can use [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/) (or the [self-hosted version](../../hosting/installation/docker/) if you have experience hosting services).
1. **A course user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI) to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in this course (Level 1).
1. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and [APIs](https://blog.n8n.io/what-are-apis-how-to-use-them-with-no-code/) would be helpful, but isn't necessary.
1. An [account on the n8n community forum](https://community.n8n.io/) if you wish to receive a profile badge and avatar upon successful completion.

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?

There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons:

- Building the [main workflow](chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)

You can always **check your progress** throughout the course by entering your unique ID [here](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/course-level-1/verify).

If you complete the milestones above, you will get [**a badge and an avatar**](https://community.n8n.io/badges/104/completed-n8n-course-level-1) in your forum profile. You can then share your profile and course verification ID to showcase your n8n skills to others.

[Let's get started!](chapter-1/)

# Navigating the Editor UI

In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the [Editor UI](../../../glossary/#editor-n8n). We will walk through the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.

n8n version

This course is based on n8n version 1.82.1. In other versions, some user interfaces might look different, but this shouldn't impact the core functionality.

## Getting started

Begin by setting up n8n.

We recommend starting with [n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register), a hosted solution that doesn't require installation and includes a free trial.

Alternative set up

If n8n Cloud isn't a good option for you, you can [self-host with Docker](../../../hosting/installation/docker/). This is an advanced option recommended only for technical users familiar with hosting services, Docker, and the command line.

For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](../../../choose-n8n/#platforms).

Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select **Overview** and then **Create Workflow** to view the main canvas.

It should look like this:

*Editor UI*

## Editor UI settings

The editor UI is the web interface where you build [workflows](../../../workflows/). You can access all your workflows and [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.

### Left-side panel

On the left side of the **Editor UI**, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.

The panel contains the following sections:

- **Overview**: Contains all the workflows, credentials, and executions you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.
- **Personal**: Every user gets a default personal project. If you don’t create a custom project, your workflows and credentials are stored here.
- **Projects**: Projects let you group workflows and credentials together. You can assign [roles](../../../user-management/rbac/role-types/) to users in a project to control what they can do. Projects aren’t available on the Community edition.
- **Admin Panel**: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.
- **Templates**: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.
- **Variables**: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.
- **Insights**: Provides analytics and insights about your workflows.
- **Help**: Contains resources around n8n product and community.
- **What’s New**: Shows the latest product updates and features.

*Editor UI left-side menu*

### Top bar

The top bar of the **Editor UI** contains the following information:

- **Workflow Name**: By default, n8n names a new workflow as "My workflow", but you can edit the name at any time.
- **+ Add Tag**: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.
- **Publish**: This button publishes the current workflow. By default, workflows are not published.
- **Share**: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.
- **Save**: This button saves the current workflow.
- **History**: Once you save your workflow, you can view previous versions here.

*Editor UI top bar*

### Canvas

The **canvas** is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:

- Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, reset zoom, and tidy up the nodes on screen.
- A button to **Execute workflow** once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence.
- A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.
- A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](../../../workflows/components/sticky-notes/) to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon).
- A button labeled **Ask Assistant** appears on the right side of the canvas. You can ask the AI Assistant for help with building workflows.
- A dotted square with the text "Add first step." This is where you add your first node.

*Workflow canvas*

Moving the canvas

You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:

- Select `Ctrl`+`Left Button` on the canvas and move it around.
- Select `Middle Button` on the canvas and move it around.
- Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.

Don't worry about workflow execution and publishing for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.

## Nodes

You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.

Node

A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.

Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:

- **App** or **Action Nodes** add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the [Action nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) for a full list of these nodes.
- **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/) for a list of trigger nodes.
- **Core Nodes** can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) for a full list of core nodes.
- **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to [Cluster nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/) for more information.

Learn more

Refer to [Node types](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.

### Finding nodes

You can find all available nodes in the **nodes panel** on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:

- Click the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas.
- Click the **+** icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).
- Click the `Tab` key on your keyboard.

*Nodes panel*

In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Advanced AI, Actions in an App, Data transformation, Flow, Core, and Human in the loop nodes.

If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.

### Adding nodes

There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:

- Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.
- Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.

### Node buttons

If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:

- Execute the node (Play icon)
- Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)
- Delete the node (Trash icon)

There will also be an ellipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other [node options](../../../workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls).

Moving a workflow

To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or `Ctrl`+`A`, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.

## Summary

In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas.

In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far.

# Building a Mini-workflow

In this lesson, you will build a small [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) that gets 10 articles about automation from Hacker News. The process consists of five steps:

1. [Add a Manual Trigger node](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node)
1. [Add the Hacker News node](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node)
1. [Configure the Hacker News node](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node)
1. [Execute the node](#4-execute-the-node)
1. [Save the workflow](#5-save-the-workflow)

The finished workflow will look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-2.json)

## 1. Add a Manual Trigger node

Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the **+** icon in the top right corner of the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) or selecting `Tab` on your keyboard).

Then:

1. Search for the **Manual Trigger** node.
1. Select it when it appears in the search.

This will add the [Manual Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) node to your canvas, which allows you to run the workflow at any time by selecting the **Execute workflow** button.

Manual triggers

For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.

In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to set up a schedule or some other [trigger](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) to run the workflow.

## 2. Add the Hacker News node

Select the **+** icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.

Then:

1. Search for the **Hacker News** node.
1. Select it when it appears in the search.
1. In the **Actions** section, select **Get many items**.

n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.

## 3. Configure the Hacker News node

When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options:

- **Parameters**: Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality.
- **Settings**: Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions.
- **Docs**: Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window.

Parameters vs. Settings

- **Parameters** are different for each node, depending on its functionality.
- **Settings** are the same for all nodes.

### Parameters

We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work:

- **Resource**: All\
  This resource selects all data records (articles).
- **Operation**: Get Many\
  This operation fetches all the selected articles.
- **Limit**: 10\
  This parameter sets a limit to the number of results the Get Many operation returns.
- **Additional Fields** > **Add Field** > **Keyword**: automation\
  **Additional fields** are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword "automation."

The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

*Hacker News node parameters*

### Settings

The **Settings** section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.

In the Hacker News node Settings, edit:

- **Notes**: Get the 10 latest articles.

  Node notes

  It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is helpful for complex or shared workflows in particular!

- **Display note in flow?**: toggle to true\
  This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.

The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

*Hacker News node settings*

Renaming a node

You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:

- Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.
- Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click **Rename** to save the node under the new name.
- Right-click on the node and select the **Rename** option.

*Renaming a node from the keyboard*

To find the original node name (the type of node), open the node window and select **Settings**. The bottom of the page contains the node type and version.

## 4. Execute the node

Select the **Execute step** button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output **Table** view.

*Results in Table view for the Hacker News node*

### Node executions

Node execution

A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve or process the specified data.

If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas

*Successfully executed workflow*

If there are no problems with the parameters and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in **Table**, **JSON**, and **Schema** format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table | JSON | Schema** button at the top of the node window.

Table vs JSON views

The **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.

Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view:

*Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node*

The node window displays more information about the node execution:

- Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node execution succeeded). Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:
  - **Start Time**: When the node execution started.
  - **Execution Time**: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing.
- Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.

Error in nodes

A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.

*Error in nodes*

## 5. Save the workflow

Once you're finished editing the node, select **Back to canvas** to return to the main canvas.

By default, your workflow is automatically saved as "My workflow."

For this lesson, rename the workflow to be "Hacker News workflow."

Reminder

You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.

Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.

There are two ways in which you can save a workflow:

- From the Canvas in Editor UI, click **Ctrl + S** or **Cmd + S** on your keyboard.
- Select the **Save** button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.

If you see a grey **Saved** text instead of the **Save** button, your workflow was automatically saved.

## Summary

Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.

In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work.

# Automating a (Real-world) Use Case

Meet Nathan 🙋. Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.

Some things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert**, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.

## Understanding the scenario

**You 👩‍🔧:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?

**Nathan 🙋:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.

I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.

This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?

**Nathan 🙋:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!

# Designing the Workflow

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's consider the steps he needs to take to achieve his goals:

1. Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse
1. Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)
1. Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders
1. Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel
1. Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up
1. Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning

Nathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services:

- Discord
- Airtable

Before that, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).

n8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/finished.json)

You will build this workflow in eight steps:

1. [Getting data from the data warehouse](../chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)
1. [Inserting data into Airtable](../chapter-5/chapter-5.2/)
1. [Filtering orders](../chapter-5/chapter-5.3/)
1. [Setting values for processing orders](../chapter-5/chapter-5.4/)
1. [Calculating booked orders](../chapter-5/chapter-5.5/)
1. [Notifying the team](../chapter-5/chapter-5.6/)
1. [Scheduling the workflow](../chapter-5/chapter-5.7/)
1. [Publishing and examining the workflow](../chapter-5/chapter-5.8/)

To build this workflow, you will need the credentials found in the email you received from n8n when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up already, you can do it [here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI?typeform-source=127.0.0.1). If you haven't received a confirmation email after signing up, [contact us](mailto:help@n8n.io).

[Start building!](../chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)

# Exporting and importing workflows

In this chapter, you will learn how to export and import workflows.

## Exporting and importing workflows

You can save n8n workflows locally as JSON files. This is useful if you want to share your workflow with someone else or import a workflow from someone else.

Sharing credentials

Exported workflow JSON files include [credential](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.

*Import & Export workflows menu*

You can export and import workflows in three ways:

- From the **Editor UI** menu:
  - Export: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Download**. This will download your current workflow as a JSON file on your computer.
  - Import: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Import from URL** (to import a published workflow) or **Import from File** (to import a workflow as a JSON file).
- From the **Editor UI** canvas:
  - Export: Select all the nodes on the canvas and use `Ctrl`+`C` to copy the workflow JSON. You can paste this into a file or share it directly with other people.
  - Import: You can paste a copied workflow JSON directly into the canvas with `Ctrl`+`V`.
- From the command line:
  - Export: See the [full list of commands](../../../hosting/cli-commands/) for exporting workflows or credentials.
  - Import: See the [full list of commands](../../../hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials) for importing workflows or credentials.

# Test your knowledge

Congratulations, you finished the n8n Course Level 1!

You've learned a lot about workflow automation and built your first business workflow. Why not showcase your skills?

You can test your knowledge by taking a **quiz**, which consists of questions about the theoretical concepts and workflows covered in this course.

- You need to have at least 80% correct answers in each part to pass the quiz.
- You can take the quiz as many times as you want.
- There's no time limit on answering the quiz questions.

[Take the quiz!](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/JMoBXeGA)

## What's next?

- Create new workflows for your work or personal use and share them with us. Don't have any ideas? Find inspiration on our [blog](https://n8n.io/blog/), [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/n8n-io), [community forum](https://community.n8n.io), and [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vWwMVThRta).
- Take the n8n [Course Level 2](../../level-two/).

# 1. Getting data from the data warehouse

In this part of the workflow, you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests with the [**HTTP Request**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.

After completing this section, your workflow will look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1.json)

First, let's set the scene for building Nathan's workflow.

## Create new workflow

Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:

- Select `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`N` or `Cmd`+`Option`+`N` on your keyboard.
- Open the left menu, navigate to **Workflows**, and select **Add workflow**.

Name this new workflow "Nathan's workflow."

The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.

In a previous chapter, you used an action node designed for a specific service (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.

Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node in n8n.

No node for that service?

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.

## Add an HTTP Request node

Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson [Adding nodes](../../chapter-1/#adding-nodes). The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.

*HTTP Request node*

This node will use credentials.

Credentials

[Credentials](../../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and allow them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.

In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI).

In the **Parameters** of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:

- **Method**: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.
- **URL**: Add the **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
- **Send Headers**: Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers**, ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.
  - **Header Parameters** > **Name**: Enter `unique_id`.
  - **Header Parameters** > **Value**: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
- **Authentication**: Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials before allowing you to access the data.
  - **Generic Auth Type**: Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)

  - **Credential for Header Auth**: To add your credentials, select **+ Create new credential**. This will open the Credentials window.

  - In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the **Header Auth name** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

  - In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the **Header Auth value** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

  - Select the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this:

    *HTTP Request node credentials*

Credentials naming

New credential names follow the " account" format by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

Once you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node.

## Get the data

Select the **Execute step** button in the HTTP Request node window. The table view of the HTTP request results should look like this:

*HTTP Request node output*

This view should be familiar to you from the [Building a mini-workflow](../../chapter-2/) page.

This is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information from 30 customers with five columns:

- `orderID`: The unique id of each order.
- `customerID`: The unique id of each customer.
- `employeeName`: The name of Nathan's colleague responsible for the customer.
- `orderPrice`: The total price of the customer's order.
- `orderStatus`: Whether the customer's order status is `booked` or still in `processing`.

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the data you retrieved into Airtable.

# 2. Inserting data into Airtable

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the [Airtable node](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

Spreadsheet nodes

You can replace the Airtable node with another spreadsheet app/service. For example, n8n also has a node for [**Google Sheets**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2.json)

## Configure your table

If we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:

1. [Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).

1. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, *beginner course*.

   *Create an Airtable base*

1. In the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`. These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our "orders" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. Prepare the table by doing the following:

   - Rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.
   - Delete the 3 blank records created by default.
   - Delete the `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status` fields.
   - Edit the `Name` field (the primary field) to read `orderID`, with the **Number** field type.
   - Add the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference:

   | Field name     | Field type       |
   | -------------- | ---------------- |
   | `orderID`      | Number           |
   | `customerID`   | Number           |
   | `employeeName` | Single line text |
   | `orderPrice`   | Number           |
   | `orderStatus`  | Single line text |

Now your table should look like this:

*Orders table in Airtable*

Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.

## Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node

Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.

Remember

You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the **+** icon next to the existing node.

In the node panel:

1. Search for Airtable.
1. Select **Create a record** from the **Record Actions** search results.

This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.

In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**:
  - Select **Create new credential**.
  - Keep the default option **Connect using: Access Token** selected.
  - **Access token**: Follow the instructions from the [Airtable credential](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) page to create your token. Use the recommended scopes and add access to your beginners course base. Save the credential and close the Credential window when you're finished.
- **Resource**: Record.
- **Operation**: Create. This operation will create new records in the table.
- **Base**: You can pick your base from a list (for example, beginner course).
- **Table**: orders.
- **Mapping Column Mode**: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields must have the same as the columns in Airtable.

## Test the Airtable node

Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting **Execute step**. This might take a moment to process, but you can follow the progress by viewing the base in Airtable.

Your results should look like this:

*Airtable node results*

All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:

*Imported records in the orders table*

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, this automation is already so useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status.

# 3. Filtering Orders

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the [If node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/).

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

To insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by `orderStatus`. Basically, we want to tell the program that *if* the `orderStatus` is processing, *then* insert all records with this status into Airtable; *else*, for example, if the `orderStatus` isn't *processing*, calculate the sum of all orders with the other `orderStatus` (`booked`).

This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, you can add conditional logic with the [If node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

If vs. Switch

If you need to filter data on more than boolean values (true and false), use the [Switch node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/). The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output connectors.

## Add If node before the Airtable node

First, let's add an If node between the connection from the HTTP Request node to the Airtable node:

1. Hover over the arrow connection the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node.
1. Select the **+** sign between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.

## Configure the If node

Selecting the plus removes the connection to the Airtable node to the HTTP request. Now, let's add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:

1. Search for the If node.
1. Select it when it appears in the search.

For the If node, we'll use an expression.

Expressions

An [expression](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that can be evaluated to get a value, often according to its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node.

In the If node window, configure the parameters:

- Set the `value1` placeholder to `{{ $json.orderStatus }}` with the following steps:

  1. Hover over the value1 field.

  1. Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the `value1` field.

  1. Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon:

     *Opening the Expression Editor*

  1. Use the left-side panel to select **HTTP Request** > **orderStatus** and drag it into the **Expression** field in the center of the window.

     *Expression Editor in the If node*

  1. Once you add the expression, close the **Edit Expression** dialog.

- **Operation**: Select **String** > **is equal to**

- Set the `value2` placeholder to `processing`.

Data Type

Make sure to select the correct data type (boolean, date & time, number, or string) when you select the **Operation**.

Select **Execute step** to test the If node.

Your results should look like this:

*If node output*

Note that the orders with a `processing` order status should show for the **True Branch** output, while the orders with a `booked` order status should show in the **False Branch** output.

Close the If node detail view when you're finished.

## Insert data into Airtable

Next, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the [Inserting data into Airtable](../chapter-5.2/) lesson?

> I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...

Since Nathan only needs the `processing` orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's `true` connector.

In this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the **If node** `true` connector and drag it to the Airtable node.

It's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select **Execute step**.

Review your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with `orderStatus` of `processing`). There should be 14 records now instead of 30.

At this stage, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3.json)

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: This If node is so useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the `employeeName` and `orderID`, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 fields might not seem like it'd make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and dozens of fields, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.

**Nathan 🙋**: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, I'll do that in the next step.

# 4. Setting Values for Processing Orders

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.4.json)

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to filter the data to only insert the `employeeName` and `orderID` of all `processing` orders into Airtable.

For this, you need to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/), which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one node to another.

Edit Fields node

The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.

## Add another node before the Airtable node

In your workflow, add another node before the **Airtable node** from the **If node** in the same way we did it in the [Filtering Orders](../chapter-5.3/#add-if-node-before-the-airtable-node) lesson on the If node's `true` connector. Feel free to drag the Airtable node further away if your canvas feels crowded.

## Configure the Edit Fields node

Now search for the **Edit Fields (Set) node** after you've selected the **+** sign coming off the If node's `true` connector.

With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:

- Ensure **Mode** is set to **Manual Mapping**.
- While you can use the **Expression editor** we used in the [Filtering Orders](../chapter-5.3/) lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the **Input** into the **Fields to Set**:
  - Drag **If** > **orderID** as the first field.
  - Drag **If** > **employeeName** as the second field.
- Ensure that **Include Other Input Fields** is set to false.

Select **Execute step**. You should see the following results:

*Edit Fields (Set) node*

## Add data to Airtable

Next, let's insert these values into Airtable:

1. Go to your Airtable base.

1. Add a new table called `processingOrders`.

1. Replace the existing columns with two new columns:

   - `orderID` (primary field): Number
   - `employeeName`: Single line text

   Reminder

   If you get stuck, refer to the [Inserting data into Airtable](../chapter-5.2/) lesson.

1. Delete the three empty rows in the new table.

1. In n8n, connect the Edit Fields node **connector to the** Airtable node\*\*.

1. Update the Airtable node configuration to point to the new `processingOrders` table instead of the `orders` table.

1. Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new `processingOrders` table.

At this stage, your workflow should now look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.4.json)

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: You've already automated half of my work! Now I still need to calculate the booked orders for my colleagues. Can we automate that as well?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Yes! In the next step, I'll use some JavaScript code in a node to calculate the booked orders.

# 5. Calculating Booked Orders

In this step of the workflow you will learn how n8n structures data and how to add custom JavaScript code to perform calculations using the Code node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.5.json)

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to calculate two values from the booked orders:

- The total number of booked orders
- The total value of all booked orders

To calculate data and add more functionality to your workflows you can use the Code node, which lets you write custom JavaScript code.

## About the Code node

Code node modes

The Code node has two operational **modes**, depending on how you want to process items:

- **Run Once for All Items** allows you to write code to process all input items at once, as a group.
- **Run Once for Each Item** executes your code once for each input item.

Learn more about how to use the [Code node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

In n8n, the data that's passed between nodes is an array of objects with the following JSON structure:

```
[
    {
   	 "json": { // (1)!
   		 "apple": "beets",
   		 "carrot": {
   			 "dill": 1
   		 }
   	 },
   	 "binary": { // (2)!
   		 "apple-picture": { // (3)!
   			 "data": "....", // (4)!
   			 "mimeType": "image/png", // (5)!
   			 "fileExtension": "png", // (6)!
   			 "fileName": "example.png", // (7)!
   		 }
   	 }
    },
    ...
]
```

1. (required) n8n stores the actual data within a nested `json` key. This property is required, but can be set to anything from an empty object (like `{}`) to arrays and deeply nested data. The code node automatically wraps the data in a `json` object and parent array (`[]`) if it's missing.
1. (optional) Binary data of item. Most items in n8n don't contain binary data.
1. (required) Arbitrary key name for the binary data.
1. (required) Base64-encoded binary data.
1. (optional) Should set if possible.
1. (optional) Should set if possible.
1. (optional) Should set if possible.

You can learn more about the expected format on the [n8n data structure](../../../../data/data-structure/) page.

## Configure the Code node

Now let's see how to accomplish Nathan's task using the Code node.

In your workflow, add a **Code node** connected to the `false` branch of the **If node**.

With the Code node window open, configure these parameters:

- **Mode**: Select **Run Once for All Items**.

- **Language**: Select **JavaScript**.

  Using Python in code nodes

  While we use JavaScript below, you can also use Python in the Code node. To learn more, refer to the [Code node](../../../../code/code-node/) documentation.

- Copy the Code below and paste it into the **Code** box to replace the existing code:

  ```
  let items = $input.all();
  let totalBooked = items.length;
  let bookedSum = 0;

  for (let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {
    bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;
  }

  return [{ json: {totalBooked, bookedSum} }];
  ```

Notice the format in which we return the results of the calculation:

```
return [{ json: {totalBooked, bookedSum} }]
```

Data structure error

If you don't use the correct data structure, you will get an error message: `Error: Always an Array of items has to be returned!`

Now select **Execute step** and you should see the following results:

*Code node output*

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, the Code node is powerful! This means that if I have some basic JavaScript skills I can power up my workflows.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Yes! You can progress from no-code to low-code!

**Nathan 🙋**: Now, how do I send the calculations for the booked orders to my team's Discord channel?

**You 👩‍🔧**: There's an n8n node for that. I'll set it up in the next step.

# 6. Notifying the Team

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/). After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6.json)

Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky) on Discord.

Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.

Communication app nodes

You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) and [Mattermost](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/).

In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.

When you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.

In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:

- **Connection Type**: Select **Webhook**.
- **Credential for Discord Webhook**: Select **- Create New Credential -**.
  - Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.
  - Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.
- **Operation**: Select **Send a Message**.
- **Message**:
  - Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.

  - Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.

    ```
    This week we've {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params["headerParameters"]["parameters"][0]["value"] }}
    ```

Now select **Execute step** in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:

*Discord node output*

And your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:

*Discord message*

## What's next?

**Nathan 🙋**: Incredible, you've saved me hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.

# 7. Scheduling the Workflow

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/finished.json)

The workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on **Execute Workflow**. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.

To achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead.

## Remove the Manual Trigger node

First, let's remove the Manual Trigger node:

1. Select the Manual Trigger node connected to your HTTP Request node.
1. Select the trash can icon to delete.

This removes the Manual Trigger node and you'll see an "Add first step" option.

## Add the Schedule Trigger node

1. Open the nodes panel and search for **Schedule Trigger**.
1. Select it when it appears in the search results.

In the Schedule Trigger node window, configure these parameters:

- **Trigger Interval**: Select **Weeks**.
- **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter `1`.
- **Trigger on weekdays**: Select **Monday** (and remove **Sunday** if added by default).
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select **9am**.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter `0`.

Your Schedule Trigger node should look like this:

*Schedule Trigger Node*

Keep in mind

To ensure accurate scheduling with the Schedule Trigger node, be sure to set the correct timezone for your [n8n instance](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) or the [workflow's settings](../../../../workflows/settings/). The Schedule Trigger node will use the workflow's timezone if it's set; it will fall back to the n8n instance's timezone if it's not.

## Connect the Schedule Trigger node

Return to the canvas and connect your Schedule Trigger node to the HTTP Request node by dragging the arrow from it to the HTTP Request node.

Your full workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/finished.json)

## What's next?

**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on **Execute workflow**, n8n will execute all the nodes: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.

**Nathan 🙋**: This is just what I needed! My workflow will run automatically every Monday morning, correct?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Not so fast. To do that, you need to publish your workflow. I'll do this in the next step and show you how to interpret the execution log.

# 8. Publishing and Examining the Workflow

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to publish your workflow and change the default workflow settings.

Publishing a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, newly created workflows are not published.

To publish your workflow, click **Publish** in the top navigation of the Editor UI. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:

*Published workflow*

## Workflow Executions

An execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow succeeded or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.

To view the executions for a specific workflow, you can switch to the **Executions** tab when the workflow is open on the canvas. Use the **Editor** tab to swap back to the node editor.

To see the execution log for the entire n8n instance, in your Editor UI, select **Overview** and then select the **Executions** tab in the main panel.

*Execution List*

The **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of the workflow
- **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started
- **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute
- **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution

Workflow execution status

You can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**). The information displayed here depends on which executions you configure to save in the [**Workflow Settings**](../../../../workflows/settings/).

## Workflow Settings

You can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some global default settings in [**Workflow Settings**](../../../../workflows/settings/).

Access these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI when the workflow is open on the canvas, then select **Settings**.

*Workflow Settings*

In the **Workflow Settings** window you can configure the following settings:

- **Execution Order**: Choose the execution logic for multi-branch workflows. You should leave this set to `v1` if you don't have workflows that rely on the legacy execution ordering.
- [**Error Workflow**](../../../../flow-logic/error-handling/): A workflow to run if the execution of the current workflow fails.
- **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/).
- **Timezone**: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone. In particular, this setting is important for the [Schedule Trigger node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.
- **Save failed production executions**: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it fails. Default is to save.
- **Save successful production executions**: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it succeeds. Default is to save.
- **Save manual executions**: If n8n should save executions started from the Editor UI. Default is to save.
- **Save execution progress**: If n8n should save the execution data of each node. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is to not save.
- **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is to not timeout.

## What's next?

**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.

**Nathan 🙋**: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?

**You 👩‍🔧**: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people.

[Let's get started!](chapter-1/)

# Understanding the data structure

In this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to transform data and simulate node outputs.

## Data structure of n8n

In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.

The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.

About array of objects

An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Donatello", "Raphael"];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.

An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):

```
{
	name: 'Michelangelo',
	color: 'blue',
}
```

An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:

```
var turtles = [
	{
		name: 'Michelangelo',
		color: 'orange',
	},
	{
		name: 'Donatello',
		color: 'purple',
	},
	{
		name: 'Raphael',
		color: 'red',
	},
	{
		name: 'Leonardo',
		color: 'blue',
	}
];
```

You can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.

Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.

*Items*

An n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.

*Items in the Customer Datastore node*

## Creating data sets with the Code node

Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:

```
return [
	{
		json: {
			apple: 'beets',
		}
	}
];
```

For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:

*Array of objects in the Code node*

JSON objects

Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.

*Illustration of data structure in n8n*

It's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the `json` key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.

You can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.

n8n data structure video

[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQHT3Unn4tY) offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n.

### Exercise

In a Code node, create an array of objects named `myContacts` that contains the properties `name` and `email`, and the `email` property is further split into `personal` and `work`.

Show me the solution

In the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

```
var myContacts = [
	{
		json: {
			name: 'Alice',
			email: {
				personal: 'alice@home.com',
				work: 'alice@wonderland.org'
			},
		}
	},
	{
		json: {
			name: 'Bob',
			email: {
				personal: 'bob@mail.com',
				work: 'contact@thebuilder.com'
				},
		}
	},
];

return myContacts;
```

When you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:

*Result of Code node*

## Referencing node data with the Code node

Just like you can use [expressions](../../../code/expressions/) to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some [methods and variables](../../../code/builtin/overview/) in the **Code node**.

Please make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.

### Exercise

Let's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named `workEmail` that references the work email of the first contact.

Show me the solution

In the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

```
let items = $input.all();
items[0].json.workEmail = items[0].json.email['work'];
return items;
```

When you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:

*Code node reference*

## Transforming data

The incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to [transform the data](../../../data/transforming-data/), so that each item can be processed individually.

The two most common operations for data transformation are:

- Creating multiple items from one item
- Creating a single item from multiple items

There are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:

- Use n8n's [data transformation nodes](../../../data/#data-transformation-nodes). Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the **Code node**:
  - Use the [**Split Out node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
  - Use the [**Aggregate node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- Use the **Code node** to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the **Run Once for All Items** mode:
  - To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named `data` set to an array of items in the form of: `[{ "data": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`:

    ```
    return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {
        return {
            json: item
        }
    });
    ```

  - To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:

    ```
    return [
    	{
        	json: {
        		data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)
        	}
        }
      ];
    ```

These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:

```
let items = $input.all();
return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => {
	return {
		json: item
	}
});
```

### Exercise

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the PokéAPI `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`. (This API requires no authentication).
1. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Split Out node**.
1. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Code node**.

Show me the solution

1. To get the pokemon from the PokéAPI, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:

   - **Authentication**: None
   - **Request Method**: GET
   - **URL**: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

1. To transform the data with the **Split Out node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and set the following parameters:

   - **Field To Split Out**: results
   - **Include**: No Other Fields

1. To transform the data with the **Code node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and write the following code in the JavaScript Code field:

   ```
   let items = $input.all();
   return items[0].json.results.map(item => {
   	return {
   		json: item
   	}
   });
   ```

# Processing different data types

In this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using [n8n core nodes](../../../workflows/components/nodes/).

## HTML and XML data

You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.

HTML vs. XML

HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.

If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

Use the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).

### HTML Exercise

Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).
1. Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.
   - Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.post .item-title a` should help!

Show me the solution

1. Configure the HTTP Request node with the following parameters:
   - **Authentication**: None
   - **Request Method**: GET
   - **URL**: https://blog.n8n.io/ The result should look like this:

*Result of HTTP Request node*

2. Connect an **HTML node** to the **HTTP Request node** and configure the former's parameters:
   - **Operation**: Extract HTML Content
   - **Source Data**: JSON
   - **JSON Property**: data
   - **Extraction Values**:
     - **Key**: title
     - **CSS Selector**: `.post .item-title a`
     - **Return Value**: HTML

You can add more values to extract more data.

The result should look like this:

*Result of HTML Extract node*

Use the **XML node** to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.

### XML Exercise

In the [final exercise of Chapter 1](../chapter-1/#exercise_2), you used an **HTTP Request node** to make a request to the PokéAPI. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:

1. Add an **HTTP Request node** that makes the same request to the PokéAPI at `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`.
1. Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.

Show me the solution

1. To get the pokemon from the PokéAPI, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
   - **Authentication**: None
   - **Request Method**: GET
   - **URL**: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
1. Connect an **XML node** to it with the following parameters:
   - **Mode**: JSON to XML
   - **Property name**: data

The result should look like this:

*XML node (JSON to XML) – Table View*

To transform data the other way around, select the mode **XML to JSON**.

## Date, time, and interval data

Date and time data types include `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `YEAR`. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:

- `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29
- `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30
- `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00
- `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)
- `YEAR`: 2022, 22

There are a few ways you can work with dates and times:

- Use the [**Date & Time node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.
- Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.

Sometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.

If you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:

- At a specific time.
- After a specified time interval.
- On a webhook call.

### Date Exercise

Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.

To begin:

1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.
1. Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.
1. Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.
1. Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.
1. Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.
1. Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) for testing!)

Show me the solution

1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.
   - Select the option to **Return All**.
1. Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.
   - Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.
   - Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.
   - Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.
   - In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**
1. Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.
   - Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.
   - Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**
   - Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)
1. Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.
   - Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.
   - Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.
   - Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.
1. Add an **Edit Fields (Set) node** to the **Wait node**.
   - Use either JSON or Manual Mapping **Mode**.
   - Set a new field called `outputValue` to be the value of the new-date field.
   - Select the option to **Include Other Input Fields** and include **All** fields.
1. Add a **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow.
   - Set the **Trigger Interval** to use `Minutes`.
   - Set the **Minutes Between Triggers** to 30.
   - To test your schedule, be sure to publish the workflow.
   - Be sure to connect this node to the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** you began with!

The workflow should look like this:

*Workflow for transforming dates*

To check the configuration of each node, you can copy the JSON code of this workflow and either paste it into the Editor UI or save it as a file and import from file into a new workflow. See [Export and import workflows](../../../workflows/export-import/) for more information.

## Binary data

Up to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.

In n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:

- [HTTP Request](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.
- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n

Reading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.

To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).

Naming the right path

The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:

- npm: `~/my_file.json`
- n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`

### Binary Exercise 1

For our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:

1. Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: `https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf.`
1. Use the **Extract From File node** to convert the file from binary to JSON.

Show me the solution

In the **HTTP Request node**, you should see the PDF file, like this:

*HTTP Request node to get PDF*

When you convert the PDF from binary to JSON using the **Extract From File node**, the result should look like this:

*Extract From File node*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

```
{
	"name": "Binary to JSON",
	"nodes": [

			[
			{

			}
			]
		]
		}
	}
}
```

### Binary Exercise 2

For our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary:

1. Make an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API `https://poetrydb.org/random/1`.
1. Convert the returned data from JSON to binary using the **Convert to File node**.
1. Write the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the **Read/Write Files From Disk node**.
1. To check that it worked out, use the **Read/Write Files From Disk node** to read the generated binary file.

Show me the solution

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Workflow for moving JSON to binary data*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

```

# Merging and splitting data

In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.

## Merging data

In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.

Merging data can involve:

- Creating one data set from multiple sources.
- Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.

One-way vs. two-way sync

In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.

In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.

[This blog tutorial](https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.

In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), which provides several merging options:

- [Append](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#append)
- [Combine](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine)
  - [Merge by Fields](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine-by-matching-fields): requires input fields to match on
  - [Merge by Position](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine-by-position)
  - [Combine all possible combinations](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine-by-all-possible-combinations)
- [Choose Branch](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#choose-branch)

Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.

*Property Input fields in the Merge node*

Property Input in dot notation

If you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).

Note

You can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.

### Merge Exercise

Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.

1. Add a **Merge node** that takes `Input 1` from a **Customer Datastore node** and `Input 2` from a **Code node**.
1. In the **Customer Datastore node**, run the operation **Get All People**.
1. In the **Code node**, create an array of two objects with three properties: `name`, `language`, and `country`, where the property `country` has two sub-properties `code` and `name`.
   - Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.
   - For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.
1. In the **Merge node**, try out different merge options.

Show me the solution

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Workflow exercise for merging data*

If you merge data with the option **Keep Matches** using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):

## Looping

In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).

n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.

However, there are some [exceptions of nodes and operations](../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.

To [create a loop in an n8n workflow](../../../flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n), you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an **If node** to check when to stop the loop.

## Splitting data in batches

If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the **Code node** multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.

For these processes, use the [**Loop Over Items node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/). This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.

Execution of Loop Over Items node

The **Loop Over Items node** stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an **If node** to stop the loop.

### Loop/Batch Exercise

Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:

1. A **Code node** that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (`https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io`) and dev.to (`https://dev.to/feed/n8n`).
1. A **Loop Over Items node** with `Batch Size: 1`, that takes in the inputs from the **Code node** and **RSS Read node** and iterates over the items.
1. An **RSS Read node** that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
   - The **RSS Read node** is one of the [exception nodes](../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) which processes only the first item it receives, so the **Loop Over Items node** is necessary for iterating over multiple items.

Show me the solution

1. Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:
   - Set **Mode** to `Run Once for All Items`.

   - Set **Language** to `JavaScript`.

   - Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:

     ```
     let urls = [
     	{
     		json: {
     		url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io'
     		}
     	},
     	{
     	json: {
     		url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n'
     		} 
     	}
     ]
     return urls;
     ```
1. Add a **Loop Over Items node** connected to the **Code node**.
   - Set **Batch Size** to `1`.
1. The **Loop Over Items node** automatically adds a node called "Replace Me". Replace that node with an **RSS Read node**.
   - Set the **URL** to use the url from the Code Node: `{{ $json.url }}`.

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

# Dealing with errors in workflows

Sometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.

But don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.

## Checking failed workflows

n8n tracks executions of your workflows.

When one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.

Open the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](../../../workflows/executions/#execution-modes) in the left-side panel.

To investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.

*Executions log*

This will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.

To toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.

*Workflow execution view*

## Catching erroring workflows

To catch failed workflows, create a separate [**Error Workflow**](../../../flow-logic/error-handling/) with the [**Error Trigger node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/). This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.

Use additional nodes in your **Error Workflow** that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.

To receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the **Error Workflow** in the [Workflow Settings](../../../workflows/settings/) to an Error Workflow that uses an **Error Trigger node**.

The only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an **Error Trigger node**. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.

Error workflows

- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to publish the workflow.
- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.
- You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.

### Exercise

In the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:

1. Create a new Error Workflow.
1. Add the **Error Trigger node**.
1. Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like [Slack](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/), [Discord](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/), [Telegram](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/), or even [Gmail](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) or a more generic [Send Email](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/).
1. In the workflow you want to monitor, open the [Workflow Settings](../../../workflows/settings/) and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.

Show me the solution

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Error workflow*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

```
{
	"nodes": [
		{
			"parameters": {},
			"name": "Error Trigger",
			"type": "n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger",
			"typeVersion": 1,
			"position": [
				720,
				-380
			]
		},
		{
			"parameters": {
				"channel": "channelname",
				"text": "=This workflow {{$(\"Error Trigger\").item.json[\"workflow\"][\"name\"]}}failed.\nHave a look at it here: {{$(\"Error Trigger\").item.json[\"execution\"][\"url\"]}}",
				"attachments": [],
				"otherOptions": {}
			},
			"name": "Slack",
			"type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
			"position": [
				900,
				-380
			],
			"typeVersion": 1,
			"credentials": {
				"slackApi": {
					"id": "17",
					"name": "slack_credentials"
				}
			}
		}
	],
	"connections": {
		"Error Trigger": {
			"main": [
				[
					{
						"node": "Slack",
						"type": "main",
						"index": 0
					}
				]
			]
		}
	}
}
```

## Throwing exceptions in workflows

Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:

- **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error
- **Error Object**: returns the type of error

You can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.

When to throw errors

Throwing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.

If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:

- Wrongly formatted JSON output
- Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)
- Missing values
- Errors from remote servers

Though this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.

# Automating a business workflow

Remember [our friend Nathan](../../../level-one/chapter-3/)?

**Nathan 🙋:** Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.\
**You 👩‍🔧:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?\
**Nathan 🙋:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.\
**You 👩‍🔧:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!

## Workflow design

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
1. Sort the data and format the dates.
1. Write binary files.
1. Send notifications using email and Discord.

n8n provides [core nodes](../../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:

1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
1. A workflow that generates the reports.
1. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.

## Workflow prerequisites

To build the workflows, you will need the following:

- An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).
- A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.
- A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).

Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.

# Workflow 1: Merging data

Nathan's company stores its customer data in Airtable. This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.

To accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:

When setting up your Airtable, ensure that the `customerSince` column is configured as a Date type field with the **Include time** option enabled. Without this setting, you may encounter errors in step 4 when updating the table.

Next, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:

1. Use the [**Airtable node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list the data in the Airtable table named `customers`.
1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the REST Countries API: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`, and send the query parameter name `fields` with the value `name,region,subregion`. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.
1. Use the [**Merge node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as `customerCountry` in Airtable and `name.common` in the Countries API, respectively.
1. Use another Airtable node to update the fields `region` and `subregion` in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.

The workflow should look like this:

*Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API*

Quiz questions

- How many items does the **HTTP Request node** return?
- How many items does the **Merge node** return?
- How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?
- What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?

# Workflow 2: Generating reports

In this workflow, you will merge data from different sources, transform binary data, generate files, and send notifications about them. The final workflow should look like this:

*Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files*

To make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts.

## Part 1: Getting data from different sources

The first part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

*Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources*

1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters:

   - **Method**: Get
   - **URL**: The **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Authentication**: Generic Credential Type
     - **Generic Auth Type**: Header Auth
     - **Credentials for Header Auth**: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Send Headers**: Toggle to true
     - **Specify Headers**: Select `Using Fields Below`
     - **Name**: `unique_id`
     - **Value**: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

1. Use the [**Airtable node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list data from the `customers` table (where you updated the fields `region` and `subregion`).

1. Use the [**Merge node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for `customerID`.

1. Use the [**Sort node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/) to sort data by `orderPrice` in descending order.

Quiz questions

- What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1?
- What's the order status of customer 2?
- What's the highest order price?

## Part 2: Generating file for regional sales

The second part of the workflow consists of four nodes:

*Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales*

1. Use the [**If node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to filter to only display orders from the region `Americas`.
1. Use the [**Convert to File**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)
1. Use the [**Gmail node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.
1. Use the [**Discord node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
   - **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Text**: "I sent the file using email with the label ID `{label ID}`. My ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\
     Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces `{}` with [expressions](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) that reference the data from the nodes.

Quiz questions

- How many orders are assigned to the `Americas` region?
- What's the total price of the orders in the `Americas` region?
- How many items does the **Write Binary File node** return?

## Part 3: Generating files for total sales

The third part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

*Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales*

1. Use the [**Loop Over Items node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5.
1. Use the [**Set node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: `customerEmail`, `customerRegion`, `customerSince`, and `orderPrice`.
1. Use the [**Date & Time node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to change the date format of the field `customerSince` to the format MM/DD/YYYY.
   - Set the **Include Input Fields** option to keep all the data together.
1. Use the [**Convert to File node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: `{{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}`.
1. Use the [**Discord node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
   - **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Text**: "I created the spreadsheet `{file name}`. My ID:" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\
     Note that you need to replace `{file name}` with an expression that references data from the previous **Convert to File node**.

Quiz questions

- What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?
- What's the formatted date of customer 7?
- How many items does the **Convert to File node** return?

# Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors

Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.

To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:

1. Create a new workflow.

1. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).

1. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:

   - **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.

   - **Text**: "The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.

     Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.

1. Execute the Discord node.

1. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.

The workflow should look like this:

*Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors*

Quiz questions

- What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?
- What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?
- What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?
- What's the expression to reference the workflow name?

# Credentials

[Credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.

Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting **Credentials**. n8n lists credentials you created on the **My credentials** tab. The **All credentials** tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.

- [Create and edit credentials](add-edit-credentials/).
- Learn about [credential sharing](credential-sharing/).
- Find information on setting up credentials for your services in the [credentials library](../integrations/builtin/credentials/).

# Create and edit credentials

Credentials are securely stored authentication information used to connect n8n workflows to external services such as APIs, or databases.

## Create a credential

1. Select the  **Create** button in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select credential.
1. If your n8n instance supports [projects](../../glossary/#project-n8n), you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll create the credential inside your personal space.
1. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

Or:

1. Using the **Create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific project. Select Credential.
1. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project.
1. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](../../integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.

Credentials naming

n8n names new credentials "*node name* account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

## Expressions in credentials

You can use [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs:

1. In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.
1. When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.
1. Toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter your expression.

### Example workflow

[View workflow file](/_workflows/credentials/dynamic_credentials_using_expressions.json)

#### Using the example

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

- Yellow: notes and information.
- Green: instructions to run the workflow.
- Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
- Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# Credential sharing

Feature availability

Available on all Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.

You can share a credential directly with other users to use in their own workflows. Or share a credential in a [project](../../glossary/#project-n8n) for all members of that project to use. Any users using a shared credential won't be able to view or edit the credential details.

Users can share credentials they created and own. Only project admins can share credentials created in and owned by a project. Instance owners and instance admins can view and share all credentials on an instance.

Refer to [Account types](../../user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

In [projects](../../user-management/rbac/), a user's role controls how they can interact with the workflows and credentials associated to the projects they're a member of.

# Data

Data is the information that n8n nodes receive and process. For basic usage of n8n you don't need to understand data structures and manipulation. However, it becomes important if you want to:

- Create your own node
- Write custom [expressions](../glossary/#expression-n8n)
- Use the Function or Function Item node

This section covers:

- [Data structure](data-structure/)
- [Data flow within nodes](data-flow-nodes/)
- [Transforming data](transforming-data/)
- [Process data using code](code/)
- [Pinning](data-pinning/) and [editing](data-editing/) data during workflow development.
- [Data mapping](data-mapping/) and [Item linking](data-mapping/data-item-linking/): how data items link to each other.

## Related resources

### Data transformation nodes

n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data:

- [Aggregate](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- [Limit](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
- [Remove Duplicates](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
- [Sort](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
- [Split Out](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
- [Summarize](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Binary data

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents.

This page collects resources relating to binary data in n8n.

## Working with binary data in your workflows

You can process binary data in n8n workflows. n8n provides nodes to help you work with binary data. You can also use code.

### Nodes

There are three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

There are separate nodes for working with XML and HTML data:

- [HTML](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/)
- [XML](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/)

And nodes for performing common tasks:

- [Compression](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.compression/)
- [Edit Image](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage/)
- [FTP](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ftp/)

You can trigger a workflow based on changes to a local file using the [Local File trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).

To split or concatenate binary data items, use the [data transformation nodes](../#data-transformation-nodes).

### Code

You can use the [Code node](../../code/code-node/) to manipulate binary data in your workflows. For example, [Get the binary data buffer](../../code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/): get the binary data available in your workflow.

## Configure binary data mode when self-hosting

You can configure how your self-hosted n8n instance handles binary data using the [Binary data environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data/). This includes tasks such as setting the storage path and choosing how to store binary data.

Your configuration affects how well n8n scales: [Scaling | Binary data filesystem mode](../../hosting/scaling/binary-data/).

Reading and writing binary files can have security implications. If you want to disable reading and writing binary data, use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.

# Processing data with code

## Function

A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript or Python code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.

The [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can create any function you want using JavaScript code.

# Data editing

n8n allows you to edit [pinned data](../data-pinning/). This means you can check different scenarios without setting up each scenario and sending the relevant data from your external system. It makes it easier to test edge cases.

For development only

Data editing isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Edit output data

To edit output data:

1. Run the node to load data.
1. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
1. Select **Edit** .
1. Edit your data.
1. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.

## Use data from previous executions

You can copy data from nodes in previous workflow executions:

1. Open the left menu.
1. Select **Executions**.
1. Browse the workflow executions list to find the one with the data you want to copy.
1. Select **Open Past Execution** .
1. Double click the node whose data you want to copy.
1. If it's table layout, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
1. There are two ways to copy the JSON:
1. Select the JSON you want by highlighting it, like selecting text. Then use `ctrl` + `c` to copy it.
1. Select the JSON you want to copy by clicking on a parameter. Then:
   1. Hover over the JSON. n8n displays the **Copy** button.
   1. Select **Copy** .
   1. You can choose what to copy:
      - **Copy Item Path** and **Copy Parameter Path** gives you expressions that access parts of the JSON.
      - **Copy Value**: copies the entire selected JSON.
1. Return to the workflow you're working on:
   1. Open the left menu.
   1. Select **Workflows**.
   1. Select **Open**.
   1. Select the workflow you want to open.
1. Open the node where you want to use the copied data.
1. If there is no data, run the node to load data.
1. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
1. Select **Edit** .
1. Paste in the data from the previous execution.
1. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.

# Data filtering

Feature availability

Available on Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans.

Search and filter data in the node **INPUT** and **OUTPUT** panels. Use this to check your node's data.

To search:

1. In a node, select **Search** in the **INPUT** or **OUTPUT** panel.
1. Enter your search term.

n8n filters as you type your search, displaying the objects or rows containing the term.

Filtering is purely visual: n8n doesn't change or delete data. The filter resets when you close and reopen the node.

# Data flow within nodes

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

```
[
	{
		name-input-value: "test1"
	},
	{
		name-input-value: "test2"
	}
]
```

# Data mocking

Data mocking is simulating or faking data. It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:

- Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.
- Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.
- Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.

## Mocking with real data using data pinning

Using [data pinning](../data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](../data-editing/).

Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
1. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** . When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes

You can create a custom dataset in your workflow using either the [Code node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) or the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/).

In the Code node, you can create any data set you want, and return it as the node output. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add fields** to add your custom data.

The Edit Fields node is a good choice for small tests. To create more complex datasets, use the Code node.

## Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node

The Customer Datastore node provides a fake dataset to work with. Add and execute the node to explore the data.

Use this approach if you need some test data when exploring n8n, and you don't have a real use-case to work with.

# Data pinning

You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions.

You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:

- If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
- If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
- You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.

You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output ("error" outputs don't count for this purpose).

For development only

Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Pin data

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
1. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** . When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Unpin data

When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the **Unpin** link in the banner.

# Data structure

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. It has the following structure:

```
[
	{
		// For most data:
		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json'
		"json": {
			// Example data
			"apple": "beets",
			"carrot": {
				"dill": 1
			}
		},
		// For binary data:
		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary'
		"binary": {
			// Example data
			"apple-picture": {
				"data": "....", // Base64 encoded binary data (required)
				"mimeType": "image/png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
				"fileExtension": "png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
				"fileName": "example.png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
			}
		}
	},
]
```

Skipping the `json` key and array syntax

From 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the `json` key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array (`[]`) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the `json` key.

## Data item processing

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

```
[
	{
		name-input-value: "test1"
	},
	{
		name-input-value: "test2"
	}
]
```

# Data tables

## Overview

Data tables integrate data storage within your n8n environment. Using data tables, you can save, manage, and interact with data directly inside your workflows without relying on external database systems for scenarios such as:

- Persisting data across workflows in the same project
- Storing markers to prevent duplicate runs or control workflow triggers
- Reusing prompts or messages across workflows
- Storing evaluation data for AI workflows
- Storing data generated from workflow executions
- Combining data from different sources to enrich your datasets
- Creating lookup tables as quick reference points within workflows

## How to use data tables

There are two parts to working with data tables: creating them and interacting with them in workflows.

### Step 1: Creating a data table

1. In your n8n project, select the **Data tables** tab.
1. Click the split button located in the top right corner and select **Create Data table**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for your table.

In the table view that appears, you can:

- Add and reorder columns to organize your data
- Add, delete, and update rows
- Edit existing data

### Step 2: Interacting with Data tables in workflows

Interact with data tables in your workflow using the **Data table** node, which allows you to retrieve, update, and manipulate the data stored in a Data table.

See [Data table node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datatable/).

## Considerations and limitations of data tables

- Data tables are suitable for light to moderate data storage. By default, the total storage used by all data tables in an instance is limited to 50MB. In self-hosted environments, you can increase this default size limit using the environment variable `N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`.
- When your data tables approach 80% of your storage limit, a warning will alert you. A final warning appears when you reach the storage limit. Exceeding this limit will disable manual additions to tables and cause workflow execution errors during attempts to insert or update data.
- By default, data tables created within a project are accessible to all team members in that project.
- Tables created in a **Personal** space are only accessible by their creator.

## Data tables versus variables

| Feature                    | Data tables | Variables |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Unified tabular view       | ✓           | ✗         |
| Row-column relationships   | ✓           | ✗         |

| Individual value display   | ✗           | ✓         |
| Optimized for short values | ✗           | ✓         |
| Structured data            | ✓           | ✗         |
| Scoped to projects         | ✓           | ✗         |
| Use values as expressions  | ✗           | ✓         |

## Exporting and importing data

To transfer data between n8n and external tools, use workflows that:

1. Retrieve data from a data table.
1. Export it using an API or file export.
1. Import data into another system or data table accordingly.

# Schema Preview

Schema Preview exposes expected schema data from the previous node in the Node Editor without the user having to provide credentials or execute the node. This makes it possible to construct workflows without having to provide credentials in advance. The preview doesn't include mock data, but it does expose the expected fields, making it possible to select and incorporate them into the input of subsequent nodes.

## Using the preview

1. There must be a node with Schema Preview available in your workflow.
1. When clicking on the details of the next node in the sequence, the Schema Preview data will show up in the Node Editor where schema data would typically be exposed.
1. Use data from the Schema Preview just as you would other schemas - drag and drop fields as input into your node parameters and settings.

# Transforming data

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](../data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:

- [Aggregate](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- [Limit](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.limit/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
- [Remove Duplicates](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
- [Sort](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
- [Split Out](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
- [Summarize](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Data mapping

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes.

This section contains guidance on:

- Mapping data in most scenarios: [Data mapping in the UI](data-mapping-ui/) and [Data mapping in expression](data-mapping-expressions/)
- How to handle [item linking](data-item-linking/) when using the Code node or building your own nodes.

# Mapping in the expressions editor

These examples show how to access linked items in the expressions editor. Refer to [expressions](../../../code/expressions/) for more information on expressions, including built in variables and methods.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](../data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## Access the linked item in a previous node's output

When you use this, n8n works back up the item linking chain, to find the parent item in the given node.

```
// Returns the linked item
{{$("<node-name>").item}}
```

As a longer example, consider a scenario where a node earlier in the workflow has the following output data:

```
[
  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",
    "name": "Max Sendak",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423535",
    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie",
  }
]
```

To extract the name, use the following expression:

```
{{$("<node-name>").item.json.name}}
```

### Access the linked item in the current node's input

In this case, the item linking is within the node: find the input item that the node links to an output item.

```
// Returns the linked item
{{$input.item}}
```

As a longer example, consider a scenario where the current node has the following input data:

```
[
  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",
    "name": "Max Sendak",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423535",
    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie",
  }
]
```

To extract the name, you'd normally use drag-and-drop [Data mapping](../), but you could also write the following expression:

```
{{$input.item.json.name}}
```

# Mapping in the UI

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.

You can map data in the following ways:

- Using the expressions editor.
- By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](../data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## How to drag and drop data

1. Run your workflow to load data.
1. Open the node where you need to map data.
1. You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:
   - In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.
   - In JSON view: click and hold a key.
   - In schema view: click and hold a key.
1. Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.

### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop

Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:

```
[
	{
		"fruit": "apples",
		"color": "green"
	}
]
```

You can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.

### Understand nested data

Given the following data:

```
[
  {
    "name": "First item",
    "nested": {
      "example-number-field": 1,
      "example-string-field": "apples"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Second item",
    "nested": {
      "example-number-field": 2,
      "example-string-field": "oranges"
    }
  }
]
```

n8n displays it in table form like this:

# Data item linking

An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items.

You need to understand this behavior if you're:

- Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.
- Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow.
- Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.

This section provides:

- A conceptual overview of [Item linking concepts](item-linking-concepts/).
- Information on [Item linking for node creators](item-linking-node-building/).
- Support for end users who need to [Work with the data path](item-linking-code-node/) to retrieve item data from previous nodes, and link items when using the Code node.
- Guidance on troubleshooting [Errors](item-linking-errors/).

# Item linking in the Code node

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/). This document focuses on practical usage examples.

When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$("<node-name>").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.

These scenarios are when you:

- Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.
- Return new items.
- Want to manually control the item linking.

[n8n's automatic item linking](../item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.

To control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:

```
[
	{
		"json": {
			. . . 
		},
		// The index of the input item that generated this output item
		"pairedItem": 0
	}
]
```

### `pairedItem` usage example

Take this input data:

```
[
  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",
    "name": "Max Sendak"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423535",
    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie"
  }
]
```

And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:

```
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
    "json":
      {
        "name": items[i].json.name,
				"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
      }
    }
  )
}

return newItems;
```

`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.

Add the `pairedItem` object:

```
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
      "json":
        {
          "name": items[i].json.name,
					"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
        },
      "pairedItem": i
    }    
  )
}
return newItems;
```

Each new item now links to the item used to create it.

# Item linking concepts

Each output item created by a node includes metadata that links them to the input item (or items) that the node used to generate them. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node.

This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:

- [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.
- [Item linking in the Code node](../item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.
- [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.

## n8n's automatic item linking

If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:

- Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
- Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
- Multiple inputs and outputs:
  - If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
  - If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
  - If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.

If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/) for more information.

## Item linking example

In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.

The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:

- [Mapping in the UI](../../data-mapping-ui/)
- [Mapping in the expressions editor](../../data-mapping-expressions/)
- [Item linking in the Code node](../item-linking-code-node/)
- [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/)

# Item linking errors

In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`.

Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.

Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.

`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.

When using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:

- The thread is broken
- The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)

To solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.

You can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.

The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.

### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'

If you see this error message:

> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node

There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:

- Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](../item-linking-code-node/) for more information.
- Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/) for more information.

### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'

This is the error message:

> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression

Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.

When you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:

- Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.
- Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.

# Item linking for node creators

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../../integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

```
// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};
```

# Configuration

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

## Authentication

You can secure n8n by setting up [User management](../../user-management/), n8n's built-in authentication feature.

n8n supports [LDAP](../../user-management/ldap/) and [SAML](../../user-management/saml/).

### Credential overwrites

To offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.

In the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using OAuth by pressing the "connect" button on the credentials.

n8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.

#### Using environment variables

You can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.

Warning

Even though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.

#### Using REST APIs

The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available. You can set `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT_AUTH_TOKEN` to require a token for accessing the endpoint. When this token is configured, the endpoint is only accessible if the token is included in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token.

Note

The endpoint can be called just once for security reasons, unless `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT_AUTH_TOKEN` is set.

For example:

1. Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:

   ```
   export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials
   ```

1. A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:

   ```
   {
       "asanaOAuth2Api": {
           "clientId": "<id>",
           "clientSecret": "<secret>"
       },
       "githubOAuth2Api": {
           "clientId": "<id>",
           "clientSecret": "<secret>"
       }
   }
   ```

1. Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:

   ```
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials
   ```

Note

There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`. In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.

In case `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT_AUTH_TOKEN` is set to `secure-token`, the curl command will be:

````
```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer secure-token" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials
````

```

#### Persistence

To store credential overwrites in the database and propagate them automatically to all workers in multi-instance/queue mode, enable:

```

export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_PERSISTENCE=true

```

When enabled, n8n stores the encrypted overwrites in the `settings` table and broadcasts a `reload-overwrite-credentials` event so that workers reload the latest values. When disabled, overwrites remain in memory on the process that loaded them and aren't propagated to workers or preserved across restarts.

## Environment variables

n8n has many [environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. |
| `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number | `10000` | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit |
| `NODES_EXCLUDE` | Array of strings | `[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.localFileTrigger\"]` | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"`. To enable all nodes, specify `NODES_EXCLUDE: "[]"`. |
| `NODES_INCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes to load. |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enable [workflow templates](../../glossary/#template-n8n) (true) or disable (false). |
| `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` | String | `https://api.n8n.io` | Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to [Workflow templates](../../workflows/templates/) for more information. |

## Backend hooks

It's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.

### Available hooks

| Hook | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `credentials.create` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before new credentials get created. Use to restrict the number of credentials. |
| `credentials.delete` | `[id: credentialId]` | Called before credentials get deleted. |
| `credentials.update` | `[credentialData: ICredentialsDb]` | Called before existing credentials are saved. |
| `frontend.settings` | `[frontendSettings: IN8nUISettings]` | Gets called on n8n startup. Allows you to, for example, overwrite frontend data like the displayed OAuth URL. |
| `n8n.ready` | `[app: App]` | Called once n8n is ready. Use to, for example, register custom API endpoints. |
| `n8n.stop` |  | Called when an n8n process gets stopped. Allows you to save some process data. |
| `oauth1.authenticate` | `[oAuthOptions: clientOAuth1.Options, oauthRequestData: {oauth_callback: string}]` | Called before an OAuth1 authentication. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |
| `oauth2.callback` | `[oAuth2Parameters: {clientId: string, clientSecret: string \| undefined, accessTokenUri: string, authorizationUri: string, redirectUri: string, scopes: string[]}]` | Called in an OAuth2 callback. Use to overwrite an OAuth callback URL. |
| `workflow.activate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowDb]` | Called before a workflow gets activated. Use to restrict the number of active workflows. |
| `workflow.afterCreate` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after a workflow gets created. |
| `workflow.afterDelete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after a workflow gets deleted. |
| `workflow.afterUpdate` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after an existing workflow gets saved. |
| `workflow.create` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before a workflow gets created. Use to restrict the number of saved workflows. |
| `workflow.delete` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called before a workflow gets delete. |
| `workflow.postExecute` | `[run: IRun, workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called after a workflow gets executed. |
| `workflow.preExecute` | `[workflow: Workflow: mode: WorkflowExecuteMode]` | Called before a workflow gets executed. Allows you to count or limit the number of workflow executions. |
| `workflow.update` | `[workflowData: IWorkflowBase]` | Called before an existing workflow gets saved. |
| `workflow.afterArchive` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after you archive a workflow. |
| `workflow.afterUnarchive` | `[workflowId: string]` | Called after you restore a workflow from the archive. |

### Registering hooks

Set hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions.
To register a hook, set the environment variable `EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES`.

You can set the variable to a single file:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js`

Or to contain multiple files separated by a colon:

`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js:/data/hook2.js`

### Backend hook files

Hook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:

```

module.exports = { "frontend": { "settings": [ async function (settings) { settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth1 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth1/callback'; settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth2 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth2/callback'; } ] }, "workflow": { "activate": \[ async function (workflowData) { const activeWorkflows = await this.dbCollections.Workflow.count({ active: true });

```
            if (activeWorkflows > 1) {
                throw new Error(
                    'Active workflow limit reached.'
                );
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

}

```

### Backend hook functions

A hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.

If the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.

You can also access the database in any hook function using `this.dbCollections` (refer to the code sample in [Backend hook files](#backend-hook-files).

## Frontend external hooks

Like backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.

### Available hooks

| Hook | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `credentialsEdit.credentialTypeChanged` | Called when an existing credential's type changes. |
| `credentials.create` | Called when someone creates a new credential. |
| `credentialsList.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `dataDisplay.nodeTypeChanged` |  |
| `dataDisplay.onDocumentationUrlClick` | Called when someone selects the help documentation link. |
| `execution.open` | Called when an existing execution opens. |
| `executionsList.openDialog` | Called when someone selects an execution from existing Workflow Executions. |
| `expressionEdit.itemSelected` |  |
| `expressionEdit.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.filteredNodeTypesComputed` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.nodeFilterChanged` | Called when someone makes any changes to the node panel filter. |
| `nodeCreateList.selectedTypeChanged` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.mounted` |  |
| `nodeCreateList.destroyed` |  |
| `nodeSettings.credentialSelected` |  |
| `nodeSettings.valueChanged` |  |
| `nodeView.createNodeActiveChanged` |  |
| `nodeView.addNodeButton` |  |
| `nodeView.createNodeActiveChanged` |  |
| `nodeView.mount` |  |
| `pushConnection.executionFinished` |  |
| `showMessage.showError` |  |
| `runData.displayModeChanged` |  |
| `workflow.activeChange` |  |
| `workflow.activeChangeCurrent` |  |
| `workflow.afterUpdate` | Called when someone updates an existing workflow. |
| `workflow.open` |  |
| `workflowRun.runError` |  |
| `workflowRun.runWorkflow` | Called when a workflow executes. |
| `workflowSettings.dialogVisibleChanged` |  |
| `workflowSettings.saveSettings` | Called when someone saves the settings of a workflow. |

### Registering hooks

You can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your `editor-ui/public/index.html` file:

```

<script src="frontend-hooks.js"></script>

```

### Frontend hook files

Frontend external hook files are regular JavaScript files which have the following format:

```

window.n8nExternalHooks = { nodeView: { mount: [ function (store, meta) { // do something }, ], createNodeActiveChanged: [ function (store, meta) { // do something }, function (store, meta) { // do something else }, ], addNodeButton: [ function (store, meta) { // do something }, ], }, };

````

### Frontend hook functions

You can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:

- `store`: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.
- `metadata`: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the `editor-ui` package.```
````

# Deployment

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

See the [hosting documentation](../../hosting/installation/server-setups/) for detailed setup options.

## User data

n8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using [Rook](https://rook.io/) and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data.

Due to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud).

## Backups

n8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server.

## Restarting

If your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data.

# Workflow management in Embed

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

When managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:

| Solution                                                              | Pros                                                               | Cons                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create a workflow for each user                                       | No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger)         | Requires managing multiple workflows.          |
| Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing | Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). | To run the workflow, your product must call it |

Warning

The APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade.

## Workflow per user

There are three general steps to follow:

- Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow.
- Create the [n8n credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) for this user.
- Create the workflow.

### 1. Obtain user credentials

Here you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.

### 2. Create user credentials

After all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Credentials** > **New**.
1. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example *Airtable*.
1. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.
1. Click **Create** to finish and save.

#### Using the API

The frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.

For example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:

```
POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials
```

With the request body:

```
{
   "name":"MyAirtable",
   "type":"airtableApi",
   "nodesAccess":[
      {
         "nodeType":"n8n-nodes-base.airtable"
      }
   ],
   "data":{
      "apiKey":"q12we34r5t67yu"
   }
}
```

The response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:

```
{
   "data":{
      "name":"MyAirtable",
      "type":"airtableApi",
      "data":{
         "apiKey":"q12we34r5t67yu"
      },
      "nodesAccess":[
         {
            "nodeType":"n8n-nodes-base.airtable",
            "date":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z"
         }
      ],
      "id":"29",
      "createdAt":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z",
      "updatedAt":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z"
   }
}
```

### 3. Create the workflow

Best practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).

You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Workflows** > **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.
1. Select **Workflows** > **Duplicate**, then enter a name for this new workflow and click **Save**.
1. Update all relevant nodes to use the credentials for this user (created above).
1. **Save** this workflow set it to **Active** using the toggle in the top-right corner.

#### Using the API

1. Fetch the JSON of the template workflow using the endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<workflow_id>`

   ```
   GET https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012
   ```

The response will contain the JSON data of the selected workflow:

```

  "data": {
    "id": "1012",
    "name": "Nathan's Workflow",
    "active": false,

```

1. Save the returned JSON data and update any relevant credentials and fields for the new user.

1. Create a new workflow using the updated JSON as the request body at endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows`

   ```
   POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/
   ```

The response will contain the ID of the new workflow, which you will use in the next step.

1. Lastly, publish the new workflow:

   ```
   PATCH https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012
   ```

Passing the additional value `active` in your JSON payload:

```
// ...
"active":true,
"settings": {},
"staticData": null,
"tags": []
```

## Single workflow

There are four steps to follow to implement this method:

- Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow. See [Obtain user credentials](#1-obtain-user-credentials) above.
- Create the n8n credentials for this user. See [Create user credentials](#2-create-user-credentials) above.
- Create the workflow.
- Call the workflow as needed.

### Create the workflow

The details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind:

- This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.
- The incoming webhook call must contain the user’s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.
- Each node where the user’s credentials are needed should use an [expression](../../code/expressions/) so that the node’s credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.
- Save and publish the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to [webhook node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) for more information.

### Call the workflow

For each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters).

# Prerequisites

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

The requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.

| Component | Sizing                                   | Supported                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| CPU/vCPU  | Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed | Any public or private cloud |
| Database  | 512 MB - 4 GB SSD                        | SQLite or PostgreSQL        |
| Memory    | 320 MB - 2 GB                            |                             |

## CPU considerations

n8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.

## Database considerations

n8n uses its database to store [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n), past executions, and workflows.

A core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.

n8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.

For Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.

### Best practices

- SSD storage.
- In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.
- If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.
- Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.
- Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.

## Memory considerations

An n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.

For example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](../../code/code-node/) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources.

# White labelling

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

White labelling n8n means customizing the frontend styling and assets to match your brand identity. The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n):

- [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system): n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components
- [packages/frontend/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui): n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

Create a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) and clone your new repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n
cd n8n
```

Install all dependencies, build and start n8n.

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Whenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes.

## Theme colors

To customize theme colors open [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system) and start with:

- [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss)
- [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss)

At the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:

```
@mixin theme {
	--color-primary-h: 6.9;
	--color-primary-s: 100%;
	--color-primary-l: 67.6%;
```

In the following example the primary color changes to #0099ff. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp).

```
@mixin theme {
	--color-primary-h: 204;
	--color-primary-s: 100%;
	--color-primary-l: 50%;
```

## Theme logos

To change the editor’s logo assets look into [packages/frontend/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/public) and replace:

- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- n8n-logo.svg
- n8n-logo-collapsed.svg
- n8n-logo-expanded.svg

Replace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:

- [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue): top/left logo in the main sidebar.
- [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/Logo/Logo.vue): reused in other components.

In the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.

If your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue).

```
.logoItem {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: space-between;
	height: $header-height;
	line-height: $header-height;
	margin: 0 !important;
	border-radius: 0 !important;
	border-bottom: var(--border-width-base) var(--border-style-base) var(--color-background-xlight);
	cursor: default;

	&:hover, &:global(.is-active):hover {
		background-color: initial !important;
	}

	* { vertical-align: middle; }
	.icon {
		height: 18px;
		position: relative;
		left: 6px;
	}

}
```

## Text localization

To change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/frontend/@n8n/i18n/src/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/i18n/src/locales/en.json).

n8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages).

In the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue).

```
{
	"_brand.name": "My Brand",
	//replace n8n with link to _brand.name
	"about.aboutN8n": "About @:_brand.name",
	"about.n8nVersion": "@:_brand.name Version",
}
```

### Window title

To change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:

- [packages/frontend/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/index.html)
- [packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/composables/useDocumentTitle.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/composables/useDocumentTitle.ts)

The following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `useDocumentTitle.ts`.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<!-- Replace html title attribute -->
	<title>My Brand - Workflow Automation</title>
</head>
```

```
import { useSettingsStore } from '@/stores/settings.store';

// replace n8n
const DEFAULT_TITLE = 'My Brand';
const DEFAULT_TAGLINE = 'Workflow Automation';
```

# Workflow templates

Feature availability

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

n8n provides a library of workflow [templates](../../glossary/#template-n8n). When embedding n8n, you can:

- Continue to use n8n's workflow templates library (this is the default behavior)
- Disable workflow templates
- Create your own workflow templates library

## Disable workflow templates

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` to false.

## Use your own workflow templates library

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` to the base URL of your API.

### Endpoints

Your API must provide the same endpoints and data structure as n8n's.

The endpoints are:

| Method | Path                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | /templates/workflows/`<id>`   |
| GET    | /templates/search             |
| GET    | /templates/collections/`<id>` |
| GET    | /templates/collections        |
| GET    | /templates/categories         |
| GET    | /health                       |

### Query parameters

The `/templates/search` endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

| Parameter  | Type                                         | Description                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `page`     | integer                                      | The page of results to return                    |
| `rows`     | integer                                      | The maximum number of results to return per page |
| `category` | comma-separated list of strings (categories) | The categories to search within                  |
| `search`   | string                                       | The search query                                 |

The `/templates/collections` endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

| Parameter  | Type                                         | Description                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `category` | comma-separated list of strings (categories) | The categories to search within |
| `search`   | string                                       | The search query                |

## Add your workflows to the n8n library

You can submit your workflows to n8n's template library.

n8n is working on a creator program, and developing a marketplace of templates. This is an ongoing project, and details are likely to change.

Refer to [n8n Creator hub](https://www.notion.so/n8n/n8n-Creator-hub-7bd2cbe0fce0449198ecb23ff4a2f76f) for information on how to submit templates and become a creator.

# Flow logic

n8n allows you to represent complex logic in your workflows.

This section covers:

- [Splitting with conditionals](/flow-logic/splitting/)
- [Merging data](/flow-logic/merging/)
- [Looping](/flow-logic/looping/)

## Related sections

You need some understanding of [Data](../data/) in n8n, including [Data structure](../data/data-structure/) and [Data flow within nodes](../data/data-flow-nodes/).

When building your logic, you'll use n8n's [Core nodes](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), including:

- Splitting: [IF](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Switch](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/).
- Merging: [Merge](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), [Compare Datasets](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/), and [Code](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

# Error handling

When designing your flow logic, it's a good practice to consider potential errors, and set up methods to handle them gracefully. With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.

Investigating errors

To investigate failed executions, you can:

- Review your [Executions](../../workflows/executions/), for a [single workflow](../../workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) or [all workflows you have access to](../../workflows/executions/all-executions/). You can [load data from previous execution](../../workflows/executions/debug/) into your current workflow.
- Enable [Log streaming](../../log-streaming/).

## Create and set an error workflow

For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).

You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.

1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
1. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
   1. Select **Options** > **Settings**.
   1. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
   1. Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

## Error data

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

```
[
	{
		"execution": {
			"id": "231",
			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231",
			"retryOf": "34",
			"error": {
				"message": "Example Error Message",
				"stack": "Stacktrace"
			},
			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error",
			"mode": "manual"
		},
		"workflow": {
			"id": "1",
			"name": "Example Workflow"
		}
	}
]
```

All information is always present, except:

- `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

```
{
  "trigger": {
    "error": {
      "context": {},
      "name": "WorkflowActivationError",
      "cause": {
        "message": "",
        "stack": ""
      },
      "timestamp": 1654609328787,
      "message": "",
      "node": {
        . . . 
      }
    },
    "mode": "trigger"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "id": "",
    "name": ""
  }
}
```

## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error

When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.

You can add the [Stop And Error](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.

# Execution order in multi-branch workflows

n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:

- For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
- For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/).

# Looping in n8n

Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.

## Using loops in n8n

n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:

1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
1. Configure the parameters.
1. Execute the node.

You would receive five messages: one for each item.

This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.

### Executing nodes once

For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.

## Creating loops

n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.

### Loop until a condition is met

To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop.

Here is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:

### Loop until all items are processed

Use the [Loop Over Items](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.

You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.

The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.

## Node exceptions

Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:

- [CrateDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
- [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
- [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.
- [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
- [Microsoft SQL](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
- [MongoDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
- [QuestDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.
- [Redis](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):
  - Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
- [RSS Read](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rssfeedread/) executes once for the requested URL.
- [TimescaleDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.

# Merging data

Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.

- Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.
- Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.
- Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.

Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.

## Merge data from different data streams

If your workflow [splits](../splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/)

## Merge data from different nodes

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

Merging data from two previous nodes

## Merge data from multiple node executions

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](../looping/) scenarios.

Node executions and workflow executions

This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/) using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/)

## Compare, merge, and split again

The [Compare Datasets](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different data streams.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/) for an example.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/)

# Splitting workflows with conditional nodes

Splitting uses the [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.

Compare these workflows:

This is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.

Refer to the [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) documentation for usage details.

# Sub-workflows

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](../../hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.

Sub-wokflow executions don't count towards your plan's monthly execution or active workflow limits.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

   Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

   You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

   You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

1. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

   1. Select the **Options** menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:

   - **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
1. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../workflows/executions/debug/).
1. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

1. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

   Find your workflow ID

   Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

1. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
1. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

## Sub-workflow conversion

See [sub-workflow conversion](../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) for how to divide your existing workflows into sub-workflows.

# Waiting

Waiting allows you to pause a workflow mid-execution, then resume where the workflow left off, with the same data. This is useful if you need to rate limit your calls to a service, or wait for an external event to complete. You can wait for a specified duration, or until a webhook fires.

Making a workflow wait uses the [Wait](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node. Refer to the node documentation for usage details.

n8n provides a workflow template with a basic example of [Rate limiting and waiting for external events](https://n8n.io/workflows/1749-rate-limiting-and-waiting-for-external-events/).

# CLI commands for n8n

n8n includes a CLI (command line interface), allowing you to perform actions using the CLI rather than the n8n editor. These include starting workflows, and exporting and importing workflows and credentials.

## Running CLI commands

You can use CLI commands with self-hosted n8n. Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands:

- npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.

- Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:

  ```
  docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>
  ```

## Start a workflow

You can start workflows directly using the CLI.

Execute a saved workflow by its ID:

```
n8n execute --id <ID>
```

## Change the active status of a workflow

You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.

Restart required

These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:

```
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=false
```

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:

```
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=true
```

Set the active status to false for all the workflows:

```
n8n update:workflow --all --active=false
```

Set the active status to true for all the workflows:

```
n8n update:workflow --all --active=true
```

## Export entities

You can export your database entities from n8n using the CLI. This tooling allows you to export all entity types from one database type, such as SQLite, and import them into another database type, such as Postgres.

Command flags:

| Flag                                | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --help                              | Help prompt.                                                                                   |
| --outputDir                         | Output directory path                                                                          |
| --includeExecutionHistoryDataTables | Include execution history data tables, these are excluded by default as they can be very large |

```
n8n export:entities --outputDir=./outputs --includeExecutionHistoryDataTables=true
```

## Export workflows and credentials

You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Command flags:

| Flag        | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --help      | Help prompt.                                                                                |
| --all       | Exports all workflows/credentials.                                                          |
| --backup    | Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output.                |
| --id        | The ID of the workflow to export.                                                           |
| --output    | Outputs file name or directory if using separate files.                                     |
| --pretty    | Formats the output in an easier to read fashion.                                            |
| --separate  | Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output. |
| --decrypted | Exports the credentials in a plain text format.                                             |

### Workflows

Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):

```
n8n export:workflow --all
```

Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:

```
n8n export:workflow --id=<ID> --output=file.json
```

Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:

```
n8n export:workflow --all --output=backups/latest/file.json
```

Export all the workflows to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

```
n8n export:workflow --backup --output=backups/latest/
```

### Credentials

Export all your credentials to the standard output (terminal):

```
n8n export:credentials --all
```

Export credentials by their ID and specify the output file name:

```
n8n export:credentials --id=<ID> --output=file.json
```

Export all credentials to a specific directory in a single file:

```
n8n export:credentials --all --output=backups/latest/file.json
```

Export all the credentials to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

```
n8n export:credentials --backup --output=backups/latest/
```

Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.

Sensitive information

All sensitive information is visible in the files.

```
n8n export:credentials --all --decrypted --output=backups/decrypted.json
```

## Import entities

You can import entities from a previous `export:entities` command using this command, it allows importing of entities into a database type that differs from the exported database type. Current supported database types include: SQLite, Postgres.

The database is expected to be empty prior to import, this can be forced with the `--truncateTables` parameter.

Command flags:

| Flag             | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| --help           | Help prompt.                                       |
| --inputDir       | Input directory that holds output files for import |
| --truncateTables | Truncate tables before import                      |

```
n8n import:entities --inputDir ./outputs --truncateTables true
```

## Import workflows and credentials

You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

Update the IDs

When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.

Available flags:

| Flag        | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --help      | Help prompt.                                                                               |
| --input     | Input file name or directory if you use --separate.                                        |
| --projectId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with `--userId`. |
| --separate  | Imports `*.json` files from directory provided by --input.                                 |
| --userId    | Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with `--projectId`. |

Migrating to SQLite

n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.

This might result in errors like **Data too long for column name** during the import process.

In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.

### Workflows

Import workflows from a specific file:

```
n8n import:workflow --input=file.json
```

Import all the workflow files as JSON from the specified directory:

```
n8n import:workflow --separate --input=backups/latest/
```

### Credentials

Import credentials from a specific file:

```
n8n import:credentials --input=file.json
```

Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:

```
n8n import:credentials --separate --input=backups/latest/
```

## License

### Clear

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:

```
n8n license:clear
```

If your license includes [floating entitlements](../../glossary/#entitlement-n8n), running this command will also attempt to release them back to the pool, making them available for other instances.

### Info

Display information about the existing license:

```
n8n license:info
```

## User management

You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.

Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.

```
n8n user-management:reset
```

### Disable MFA for a user

If a user loses their recovery codes you can disable MFA for a user with this command. The user will then be able to log back in to set up MFA again.

```
n8n mfa:disable --email=johndoe@example.com
```

### Disable LDAP

You can reset the LDAP settings using the command below.

```
n8n ldap:reset
```

## Uninstall community nodes and credentials

You can manage [community nodes](../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) using the n8n CLI. For now, you can only uninstall community nodes and credentials, which is useful if a community node causes instability.

Command flags:

| Flag         | Description                                                                                                                |

| --help       | Show CLI help.                                                                                                             |
| --credential | The credential type. Get this value by visiting the node's `<NODE>.credential.ts` file and getting the value of `name`.    |
| --package    | Package name of the community node.                                                                                        |
| --uninstall  | Uninstalls the node.                                                                                                       |
| --userId     | The ID of the user who owns the credential. On self-hosted, query the database. On cloud, query the API with your API key. |

### Nodes

Uninstall a community node by package name:

```
n8n community-node --uninstall --package <COMMUNITY_NODE_NAME>
```

For example, to uninstall the [Evolution API community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-evolution-api), type:

```
n8n community-node --uninstall --package n8n-nodes-evolution-api
```

### Credentials

Uninstall a community node credential:

```
n8n community-node --uninstall --credential <CREDENTIAL_TYPE> --userId <ID>
```

For example, to uninstall the [Evolution API community node credential](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-evolution-api), visit the [repository](https://github.com/oriondesign2015/n8n-nodes-evolution-api) and navigate to the [`credentials.ts` file](https://github.com/oriondesign2015/n8n-nodes-evolution-api/blob/main/credentials/EvolutionApi.credentials.ts) to find the `name`:

```
n8n community-node --uninstall --credential evolutionApi --userId 1234
```

## Security audit

You can run a [security audit](../securing/security-audit/) on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

```
n8n audit
```

# Database structure

This page describes the purpose of each table in the n8n database.

## Database and query technology

By default, n8n uses SQLite as the database. If you are using another database the structure will be similar, but the data-types may be different depending on the database.

n8n uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) for queries and migrations.

To inspect the n8n database, you can use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io), which is an open-source universal database tool.

## Tables

These are the tables n8n creates during setup.

### auth_identity

Stores details of external authentication providers when using [SAML](../../../user-management/saml/).

### auth_provider_sync_history

Stores the history of a SAML connection.

### credentials_entity

Stores the [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) used to authenticate with integrations.

### event_destinations

Contains the destination configurations for [Log streaming](../../../log-streaming/).

### execution_data

Contains the workflow at time of running, and the execution data.

### execution_entity

Stores all saved workflow executions. Workflow settings can affect which executions n8n saves.

### execution_metadata

Stores [Custom executions data](../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

### installed_nodes

Lists the [community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) installed in your n8n instance.

### installed_packages

Details of npm community nodes packages installed in your n8n instance. [installed_nodes](#installed_nodes) lists each individual node. `installed_packages` lists npm packages, which may contain more than one node.

### migrations

A log of all database migrations. Read more about [Migrations](https://typeorm.io/docs/advanced-topics/migrations/) in TypeORM's documentation.

### project

Lists the [projects](../../../user-management/rbac/projects/) in your instance.

### project_relation

Describes the relationship between a user and a [project](../../../user-management/rbac/projects/), including the user's [role type](../../../user-management/rbac/role-types/).

### role

Not currently used. For use in future work on custom roles.

### settings

Records custom instance settings. These are settings that you can't control using environment variables. They include:

- Whether the instance owner is set up
- Whether the user chose to skip owner and user management setup
- Whether certain types of authentication, including SAML and LDAP, are on
- License key

# Architecture

Understanding n8n's underlying architecture is helpful if you need to:

- Embed n8n
- Customize n8n's default databases

This section is a work in progress. If you have questions, please try the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/) and let n8n know which architecture documents would be useful for you.

# Configuration

You can change n8n's settings using environment variables. For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](../environment-variables/).

## Set environment variables by command line

### npm

For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal. The command depends on your command line.

Bash CLIs:

```
export <variable>=<value>
```

In cmd.exe:

```
set <variable>=<value>
```

In PowerShell:

```
$env:<variable>=<value>
```

### Docker

In Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:

```
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED="false" \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

## Docker Compose file

In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

For example:

```
n8n:
    environment:
      - N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false
```

## Keeping sensitive data in separate files

You can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for details on each variable.

While most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) and database configuration. Here are some examples:

```
CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA_FILE=/path/to/credentials_data
DB_TYPE_FILE=/path/to/db_type
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE=/path/to/database_name
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE=/path/to/database_host
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE=/path/to/database_port
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE=/path/to/database_user
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/database_password
DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE=/path/to/database_schema
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE=/path/to/ssl_ca
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ssl_cert
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/ssl_key
DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_FILE=/path/to/ssl_reject_unauth
```

# Supported databases

By default, n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB (only [actively maintained versions](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/)).

## Database type by n8n installation

The database type used varies depending on your n8n installation:

### Self-hosted n8n

By default, self-hosted installations use **SQLite**. You can optionally configure PostgreSQL by setting the appropriate environment variables (see [PostgresDB configuration](#postgresdb)).

### n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud installations use different databases depending on your plan tier:

- **SQLite**: Trial, Starter, and Pro plans, as well as legacy Enterprise plans
- **PostgreSQL**: Enterprise Scaling plans only

## Shared settings

The following environment variables get used by all databases:

- `DB_TABLE_PREFIX` (default: -) - Prefix for table names

## PostgresDB

To use PostgresDB as the database, you can provide the following environment variables:

- `DB_TYPE=postgresdb`
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE` (default: 'n8n')
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST` (default: 'localhost')
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT` (default: 5432)
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_USER` (default: 'postgres')
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD` (default: empty)
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA` (default: 'public')
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA` (default: undefined): Path to the server's CA certificate used to validate the connection (opportunistic encryption isn't supported)
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT` (default: undefined): Path to the client's TLS certificate
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY` (default: undefined): Path to the client's private key corresponding to the certificate
- `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` (default: true): If TLS connections that fail validation should be rejected

```
export DB_TYPE=postgresdb
export DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n
export DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=postgresdb
export DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
export DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n
export DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=n8n
export DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=n8n

# optional:
export DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA=$(pwd)/ca.crt
export DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false

n8n start
```

### Required permissions

n8n needs to create and modify the schemas of the tables it uses.

Recommended permissions:

```
CREATE DATABASE n8n-db;
CREATE USER n8n-user WITH PASSWORD 'random-password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE n8n-db TO n8n-user;
```

### TLS

You can choose between these configurations:

- Not declaring (default): Connect with `SSL=off`
- Declaring only the CA and unauthorized flag: Connect with `SSL=on` and verify the server's signature
- Declaring `_{CERT,KEY}` and the above: Use the certificate and key for client TLS authentication

## SQLite

This is the default database that gets used if nothing is defined.

The database file is located at: `~/.n8n/database.sqlite`

# Task runners

Task runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript and Python code in the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

This document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them.

Internal mode not recommended for production

Using internal mode in production environments can pose a security risk. For production deployments, use [external mode](#external-mode) to ensure proper isolation between n8n and task runner processes. Refer to [Hardening task runners](../../securing/hardening-task-runners/) for additional security measures.

## How it works

The task runner feature consists of these components: one or more task runners, a task broker, and a task requester.

Task runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.

The runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.

The n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.

## Task runner modes

You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.

### Internal mode

In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same `uid` and `gid` as n8n. This is **not** recommended for production.

### External mode

In external mode, a [launcher application](https://github.com/n8n-io/task-runner-launcher) launches task runners on demand and manages their lifecycle. Typically, this means that next to n8n you add a sidecar container running the [`n8nio/runners`](https://hub.docker.com/r/n8nio/runners) image containing the launcher, the JS task runner and the Python task runner. This sidecar container is independent from the n8n instance.

When using [Queue mode](../../scaling/queue-mode/), each worker needs to have its own sidecar container for task runners.

In addition, if you haven't enabled offloading manual executions to workers (if you aren't setting `OFFLOAD_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS_TO_WORKERS=true` in your configuration), then your main instance will run manual executions and needs its own sidecar container for task runners as well. Please note that running n8n with offloading disabled isn't recommended for production.

## Setting up external mode

In external mode, you run the `n8nio/runners` image as a sidecar container next to n8n. Below you will find a docker compose as a reference. Keep in mind that the `n8nio/runners` image version must match that of the `n8nio/n8n` image, and the n8n version must be >=1.111.0.

```
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:1.111.0
    container_name: n8n-main
    environment:
      - N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true
      - N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external
      - N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
      - N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-here
      - N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER=true
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
    # etc.

  task-runners:
    image: n8nio/runners:1.111.0
    container_name: n8n-runners
    environment:
      - N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=http://n8n-main:5679
      - N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-here
      # etc.
    depends_on:
      - n8n

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

There are three layers of configuration: the n8n container, the runners container, and the launcher inside the runners container.

### Configuring n8n container in external mode

These are the main environment variables that you can set on the n8n container running in external mode:

| Environment variables                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`                             | Enables task runners.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external`                            | Use task runners in external mode.                                                                                                                                            |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker.                                                                                                                    |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`            | By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections. |

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](../environment-variables/task-runners/).

### Configuring runners container in external mode

These are the main environment variables that you can set on the runners container running in external mode:

| Environment variables                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679`           | The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15`                 | Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to `0` to disable automatic shutdown. |

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](../environment-variables/task-runners/).

### Configuring launcher in runners container in external mode

The launcher reads environment variables from runners container environment, and performs the following actions:

- Passing environment variables from the launcher's own environment to all runners (`allowed-env`)
- Setting specific environment variables on specific runners (`env-overrides`)

Which environment variables to pass and to set are defined in the [launcher config file](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/runners/n8n-task-runners.json) included in the runners image. This config file is located in the container at `/etc/task-runners.json`. To learn more about the launcher config file, refer to the [Config file documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/task-runner-launcher/blob/main/docs/setup.md#config-file).

The default launcher configuration file is locked down, but you can edit this file, for example, to allowlist first- or third-party modules. To customize the launcher configuration file, mount to this path:

```
path/to/n8n-task-runners.json:/etc/n8n-task-runners.json
```

## Adding extra dependencies

### 1. Extend the `n8nio/runners` image

You can extend the `n8nio/runners` image to add extra dependencies to the runners. You'll need `n8nio/runners:1.121.0` or later to do this.

```
FROM n8nio/runners:1.121.0
USER root
RUN cd /opt/runners/task-runner-javascript && pnpm add moment uuid
RUN cd /opt/runners/task-runner-python && uv pip install numpy pandas
COPY n8n-task-runners.json /etc/n8n-task-runners.json
USER runner
```

You must also allowlist any first-party or third-party packages for use by the Code node. Do this by editing the configuration file `n8n-task-runners.json` to include the packages in your extended image.

```
{
  "task-runners": [
    {
      "runner-type": "javascript",
      "env-overrides": {
        "NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN": "crypto",         // <-- allowlist Node.js builtin modules here
        "NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL": "moment,uuid",   // <-- allowlist third-party JS packages here
      }
    },
    {
      "runner-type": "python",
      "env-overrides": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/opt/runners/task-runner-python",
        "N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW": "json",              // <-- allowlist Python standard library packages here
        "N8N_RUNNERS_EXTERNAL_ALLOW": "numpy,pandas"     // <-- allowlist third-party Python packages here
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`: comma-separated list of allowed node builtin modules.
- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`: comma-separated list of allowed JS packages.
- `N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW`: comma-separated list of allowed Python standard library packages.
- `N8N_RUNNERS_EXTERNAL_ALLOW`: comma-separated list of allowed Python packages.

### 2. Build your custom image

For example, from the n8n repository root:

```
docker buildx build \
  -f docker/images/runners/Dockerfile \
  -t n8nio/runners:custom \
  .
```

### 3. Run the image

For example:

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=test \
  -e N8N_RUNNERS_LAUNCHER_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
  -e N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=http://host.docker.internal:5679 \
  -p 5680:5680 \
  n8nio/runners:custom
```

# Configure self-hosted n8n for user management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance.

This document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.

Refer to the main [User management](../../../user-management/) guide for more information about usage, including:

- [Managing users](../../../user-management/manage-users/)
- [Account types](../../../user-management/account-types/)
- [Best practices](../../../user-management/best-practices/)

For LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](../../../user-management/ldap/).

For SAML setup information, refer to [SAML](../../../user-management/saml/).

Basic auth and JWT removed

n8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.

## Setup

There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:

1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
1. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
1. Invite users.

### Step one: SMTP

n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets.

Optional from 0.210.1

From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.

Get the following information from your SMTP provider:

- Server name
- SMTP username
- SMTP password
- SMTP sender name

To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to [Configuration](../configuration-methods/)

| `N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_PROJECT_SHARED`     | String  | Overrides the default HTML template for notifying users that a project was shared. Provide the full path to the template.    | Optional  |

If your n8n instance is already running, you need to restart it to enable the new SMTP settings.

More configuration options

There are more configuration options available as environment variables. Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for a list. These include options to disable tags, workflow templates, and the personalization survey, if you don't want your users to see them.

If you're not familiar with SMTP, this [blog post by SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) offers a short introduction, while [Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) provides more detailed technical background.

### Step two: In-app setup

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
1. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
1. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.

### Step three: Invite users

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.

1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)
1. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
1. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
1. Click **Invite**.
1. Enter the new user's email address.
1. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.

# Configuration examples

This section contains examples for how to configure n8n to solve particular use cases.

- [Isolate n8n](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/)
- [Configure the Base URL](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/base-url/)
- [Configure custom SSL certificate authorities](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/custom-certificate-authority/)
- [Set a custom encryption key](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/encryption-key/)
- [Configure workflow timeouts](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/execution-timeout/)
- [Specify custom nodes location](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/custom-nodes-location/)
- [Enable modules in Code node](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/)
- [Set the timezone](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/)
- [Specify user folder path](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/user-folder/)
- [Configure webhook URLs with reverse proxy](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/)
- [Enable Prometheus metrics](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)

# Configure the Base URL for n8n's front end access

Requires manual UI build

This use case involves configuring the `VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API` environmental variable which requires a manual build of the `n8n-editor-ui` package. You can't use it with the default n8n Docker image where the default setting for this variable is `/`, meaning that it uses the root-domain.

You can configure the Base URL that the front end uses to connect to the back end's REST API. This is relevant when you want to host n8n's front end and back end separately.

```
export VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API=https://n8n.example.com/
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on this variable.

# Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate

You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

Added in version 1.42.0

This feature is available in version 1.42.0 and above.

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container. The external path that you map to `/opt/custom-certificates` must be writable by the container.

## Docker

The examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.

### Docker CLI

When using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:

```
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

### Docker Compose

```
name: n8n
services:
    n8n:
        volumes:
            - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
        container_name: n8n
        ports:
            - 5678:5678
        image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):

```
docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates
```

## Certificate requirements for Custom Trust Store

Supported certificate types:

- Root CA Certificates: these are certificates from Certificate Authorities that sign other certificates. Trust these to accept all certificates signed by that CA.
- Self-Signed Certificates: certificates that servers create and sign themselves. Trust these to accept connections to that specific server only.

You must use PEM format:

- Text-based format with BEGIN/END markers
- Supported file extensions: `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`
- Contains the public certificate (no private key needed)

For example:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAKoK/heBjcOuMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMEUxCzAJBgNV
[base64 encoded data]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

The system doesn't accept:

- DER/binary format files
- PKCS#7 (.p7b) files
- PKCS#12 (.pfx, .p12) files
- Private key files
- Convert these formats to PEM before use.

# Specify location for your custom nodes

Every user can add custom nodes that get loaded by n8n on startup. The default location is in the subfolder `.n8n/custom` of the user who started n8n.

You can define more folders with an environment variable:

```
export N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS="/home/jim/n8n/custom-nodes;/data/n8n/nodes"
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on this variable.

# Set a custom encryption key

n8n creates a random encryption key automatically on the first launch and saves it in the `~/.n8n` folder. n8n uses that key to encrypt the credentials before they get saved to the database. If the key isn't yet in the settings file, you can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n uses your custom key instead of generating a new one.

In [queue mode](../../../scaling/queue-mode/), you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.

```
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<SOME RANDOM STRING>
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on this variable.

# Configure workflow timeout settings

A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.

`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` default is `-1`. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:

```
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600
```

You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:

```
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/executions/) for more information on these variables.

# Isolate n8n

By default, a self-hosted n8n instance sends data to n8n's servers. It notifies users about available updates, workflow templates, and diagnostics.

To prevent your n8n instance from connecting to n8n's servers, set these environment variables to false:

```
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false
```

Unset n8n's diagnostics configuration:

```
EXTERNAL_FRONTEND_HOOKS_URLS=
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFIG_FRONTEND=
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFIG_BACKEND=
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these variables.

# Enable modules in Code node

For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:

- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`: For built-in modules
- `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.

```
# Allows usage of all builtin modules
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=*

# Allows usage of only crypto
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto

# Allows usage of only crypto and fs
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN=crypto,fs

# Allow usage of external npm modules.
export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=moment,lodash
```

If using Task Runners

If n8n instance is setup with [Task Runners](../../task-runners/), add the environment variables to the Task Runners instead to the main n8n node.

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on these variables.

# Enable Prometheus metrics

To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the [prom-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prom-client) library.

The `/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the `N8N_METRICS` environment variable.

```
export N8N_METRICS=true
```

Refer to the respective [Environment Variables](../../environment-variables/endpoints/) (`N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*`) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.

Both `main` and `worker` instances are able to expose metrics.

## Queue metrics

To enable queue metrics, set the `N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS` env var to `true`. You can adjust the refresh rate with `N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL`.

n8n gathers these metrics from Bull and exposes them on the main instances. On multi-main setups, when aggregating queries, you can identify the leader using the `instance_role_leader` gauge, set to `1` for the leader main and `0` otherwise.

```
# HELP n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_active Current number of jobs being processed across all workers in scaling mode.
# TYPE n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_active gauge
n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_active 0

# HELP n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_completed Total number of jobs completed across all workers in scaling mode since instance start.
# TYPE n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_completed counter
n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_completed 0

# HELP n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_failed Total number of jobs failed across all workers in scaling mode since instance start.
# TYPE n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_failed counter
n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_failed 0

# HELP n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_waiting Current number of enqueued jobs waiting for pickup in scaling mode.
# TYPE n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_waiting gauge
n8n_scaling_mode_queue_jobs_waiting 0
```

# Set the self-hosted instance timezone

The default timezone is America/New_York. For instance, the Schedule node uses it to know at what time the workflow should start. To set a different default timezone, set `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` to the appropriate value. For example, if you want to set the timezone to Berlin (Germany):

```
export GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
```

You can find the name of your timezone [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/timezone-localization/) for more information on this variable.

# Specify user folder path

n8n saves user-specific data like the encryption key, SQLite database file, and the ID of the tunnel (if used) in the subfolder `.n8n` of the user who started n8n. It's possible to overwrite the user-folder using an environment variable.

```
export N8N_USER_FOLDER=/home/jim/n8n
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on this variable.

# Configure n8n webhooks with reverse proxy

n8n creates the webhook URL by combining `N8N_PROTOCOL`, `N8N_HOST` and `N8N_PORT`. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, it's important to do the following:

- set the webhook URL manually with the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable so that n8n can display it in the editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.
- Set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` environment variable to `1`.
- On the last proxy on the request path, set the following headers to pass on information about the initial request:
  - [`X-Forwarded-For`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)
  - [`X-Forwarded-Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host)
  - [`X-Forwarded-Proto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto)

```
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/
export N8N_PROXY_HOPS=1
```

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/endpoints/) for more information on this variable.

# Binary data environment variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

By default, n8n uses memory to store binary data. Enterprise users can choose to use an external service instead. Refer to [External storage](../../../scaling/external-storage/) for more information on using external storage for binary data.

| Variable                          | Type   | Default                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE`    | String | `default`                    | The default binary data mode. `default` keeps binary data in memory. Set to `filesystem` to use the filesystem, or `s3` to AWS S3, or `database` to use the DB. Note that binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future. |

# Database environment variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

By default, n8n uses SQLite. n8n also supports PostgreSQL. n8n [deprecated support for MySQL and MariaDB](../../../../1-0-migration-checklist/#mysql-and-mariadb) in v1.0.

This page outlines environment variables to configure your chosen database for your self-hosted n8n instance.

| `DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE`         | Number  | `0`     | Controls whether to open the SQLite file in [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) or [rollback journal mode](https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback). Uses rollback journal mode when set to zero. When greater than zero, uses WAL mode with the value determining the number of parallel SQL read connections to configure. WAL mode is much more performant and reliable than the rollback journal mode. |
| `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` | Boolean | `false` | Runs [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation on startup to rebuild the database. Reduces file size and optimizes indexes. This is a long running blocking operation and increases start-up time.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# Deployment environment variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists the deployment configuration options for your self-hosted n8n instance, including setting up access URLs, enabling templates, customizing encryption, and configuring server details.

Proxy variable priorities

The [`proxy-from-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) package that n8n uses to handle proxy environment variables (those ending with `_PROXY`) imposes a certain variable precedence. Notably, for proxy variables, lowercase versions (like `http_proxy`) have precedence over uppercase variants (for example `HTTP_PROXY`) when both are present.

To learn more about proxy environment variables, check the [environment variables section of the package details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env#environment-variables).

# Queue mode environment variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. Queue mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](../../../scaling/queue-mode/) for more information.

# Docker Installation

n8n recommends using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for most self-hosting needs. It provides a clean, isolated environment, avoids operating system and tooling incompatibilities, and makes database and environment management simpler.

You can also use n8n in Docker with [Docker Compose](../server-setups/docker-compose/). You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

You can also follow along with our video guide here:

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, install Docker:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Docker Desktop includes the Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) are also available as separate packages for Linux. Use this for Linux machines without a graphical environment or when you don't want the Docker Desktop UI.

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Starting n8n

From your terminal, run the following commands, replacing the `<YOUR_TIMEZONE>` placeholders with [your timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List):

```
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="<YOUR_TIMEZONE>" \
 -e TZ="<YOUR_TIMEZONE>" \
 -e N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true \
 -e N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

This command creates a volume to store persistent data, downloads the required n8n image, and starts the container with the following settings:

- Maps and exposes port `5678` on the host.
- Sets the timezone for the container:
  - the `TZ` environment variable sets the system timezone to control what scripts and commands like `date` return.
  - the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/) sets the correct timezone for schedule-oriented nodes like the [Schedule Trigger node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/).
- Enforces secure file permissions for the n8n configuration file.
- Enables [task runners](../../configuration/task-runners/), the recommended way of executing tasks in n8n.
- Mounts the `n8n_data` volume to the `/home/node/.n8n` directory to persist your data across container restarts.

Once running, you can access n8n by opening: <http://localhost:5678>

## Using with PostgreSQL

By default, n8n uses SQLite to save [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgreSQL, configurable using environment variables as detailed below.

Persisting the `.n8n` directory still recommended

When using PostgreSQL, n8n doesn't need to use the `.n8n` directory for the SQLite database file. However, the directory still contains other important data like encryption keys, instance logs, and source control feature assets. While you can work around some of these requirements, (for example, by setting the [`N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/)), it's best to continue mapping a persistent volume for the directory to avoid potential issues.

To use n8n with PostgreSQL, execute the following commands, replacing the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets, for example `<POSTGRES_USER>`) with your actual values:

```
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="<YOUR_TIMEZONE>" \
 -e TZ="<YOUR_TIMEZONE>" \
 -e N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true \
 -e N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true \
 -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

You can find a complete `docker-compose` file for PostgreSQL in the [n8n hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).

## Updating

To update n8n, in Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:

```
# Pull latest (stable) version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

# Pull specific version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:1.81.0

# Pull next (unstable) version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next
```

After pulling the updated image, stop your n8n container and start it again. You can also use the command line. Replace `<container_id>` in the commands below with the container ID you find in the first command:

```
# Find your container ID
docker ps -a

# Stop the container with the `<container_id>`
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove the container with the `<container_id>`
docker rm <container_id>

# Start the container
docker run --name=<container_name> [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

### Updating Docker Compose

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

```
# Navigate to the directory containing your docker compose file
cd </path/to/your/compose/file/directory>

# Pull latest version
docker compose pull

# Stop and remove older version
docker compose down

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

## n8n with tunnel

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

```
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="<YOUR_TIMEZONE>" \
 -e TZ="<YOUR_TIMEZONE>" \
 -e N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true \
 -e N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \
 start --tunnel
```

## Next steps

- Find more information about Docker setup in the README file for the [Docker image](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n).
- Learn more about [configuring](../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../try-it-out/).

# npm

npm is a quick way to get started with n8n on your local machine. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. n8n requires a Node.js version between 20.19 and 24.x, inclusive.

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Try n8n with npx

You can try n8n without installing it using npx.

From the terminal, run:

```
npx n8n
```

This command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening <http://localhost:5678>.

## Install globally with npm

To install n8n globally, use npm:

```
npm install n8n -g
```

To install or update to a specific version of n8n use the `@` syntax to specify the version. For example:

```
npm install -g n8n@0.126.1
```

To install `next`:

```
npm install -g n8n@next
```

After the installation, start n8n by running:

```
n8n
# or
n8n start
```

### Next steps

Try out n8n using the [Quickstarts](../../../try-it-out/).

## Updating

To update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:

```
npm update -g n8n
```

To install the `next` version:

```
npm install -g n8n@next
```

## n8n with tunnel

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

```
n8n start --tunnel
```

## Reverting an upgrade

Install the older version that you want to go back to.

If the upgrade involved a database migration:

1. Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
1. Run `n8n db:revert` on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.

## Windows troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

# Update self-hosted n8n

It's important to keep your n8n version up to date. This ensures you get the latest features and fixes.

Some tips when updating:

- Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
- Check the [Release notes](../../../release-notes/) for breaking changes.
- Use [Environments](../../../source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.

For instructions on how to update, refer to the documentation for your installation method:

- [Installed with npm](../npm/#updating)
- [Installed with Docker](../docker/#updating)

# Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Hosting options

AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

## Prerequisites

The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io).

While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Create a cluster

Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:

```
eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>
```

This can take a while to create the cluster.

Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting). The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting.git
```

And change directory:

```
cd n8n-hosting/kubernetes
```

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/general-purpose.html#gp3-ebs-volume-type), is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

```
…
spec:
  storageClassName: gp3
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
…
```

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.

PostgreSQL uses a root user (`POSTGRES_USER`) for setup and administration, but it’s best practice to create a separate non-root user (`POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_USER`) for n8n. The root user has full control, while n8n only needs the non-root user permissions to run. Configuring both improves security and helps prevent accidental changes to the database system.

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

```
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…
```

### Pod resources

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

```
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "250Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "500Mi"
…
```

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:

```
kubectl apply -f .
```

Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.

To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:

1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.
1. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.
1. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.
1. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.

Use HTTP

This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an "HTTPS" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.

## Delete resources

If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

```
kubectl delete -f .
```

## Next steps

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# Hosting n8n on Azure

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Azure. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

You need [The Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Hosting options

Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.

## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service

From [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select **Kubernetes services**.

## Create a cluster

From the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.

## Set Kubectl context

The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting). The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting.git
```

And change directory:

```
cd n8n-hosting/kubernetes
```

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

Specialized storage classes

If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, [read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes).

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

- Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
- If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

```
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…
```

### Pod resources

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to.

```
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "250Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "500Mi"
…
```

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f .
```

Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, "5678" to the URL.

Static IP addresses with AKS

[Read this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip) for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS.

## Delete resources

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

```
kubectl delete -f .
```

# Hosting n8n on DigitalOcean

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a DigitalOcean droplet. It uses:

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Droplet from the internet. Caddy will also automatically create and manage SSL / TLS certificates for your n8n instance.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Create a Droplet

1. [Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) to DigitalOcean.
1. Select the project to host the Droplet, or [create a new project](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/how-to/create/).
1. In your project, select **Droplets** from the **Manage** menu.
1. [Create a new Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/) using the [Docker image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker) available on the **Marketplace** tab.

Droplet resources

When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.

SSH key or Password

DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.

## Log in to your Droplet and create new user

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) for more information.

You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:

1. Log in as root.

1. Create a new user:

   ```
   adduser <username>
   ```

1. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.

1. Grant the new user administrative privileges:

   ```
   usermod -aG sudo <username>
   ```

   You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.

1. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended).

1. Log out of the droplet.

1. Log in using SSH as the new user.

## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```
cd n8n-docker-caddy
```

## Default folders and files

The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volumes

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

```
sudo docker volume create caddy_data
```

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

```
sudo docker volume create n8n_data
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).

## Open ports

n8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:

```
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

## Configure n8n

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

```
nano .env
```

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

```
nano docker-compose.yml
```

## Configure Caddy

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

```
nano caddy_config/Caddyfile
```

Change the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

If you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:

```
automate.example.com {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

## Start Docker Compose

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```
sudo docker compose stop
```

## Updating

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

```
# Navigate to the directory containing your docker compose file
cd </path/to/your/compose/file/directory>

# Pull latest version
docker compose pull

# Stop and remove older version
docker compose down

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

## Next steps

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# Docker-Compose

These instructions cover how to run n8n on a Linux server using Docker Compose.

If you have already installed Docker and Docker-Compose, then you can start with [step 3](#3-dns-setup).

You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

The way that you install Docker and Docker Compose depends on your Linux distribution. You can find specific instructions for each component in the links below:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

After following the installation instructions, verify that Docker and Docker Compose are available by typing:

```
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## 2. Optional: Non-root user access

You can optionally grant access to run Docker without the `sudo` command.

To grant access to the user that you're currently logged in with (assuming they have `sudo` access), run:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# Register the `docker` group membership with current session without changing your primary group
exec sg docker newgrp
```

To grant access to a different user, type the following, substituting `<USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>` with the appropriate username:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker <USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>
```

You will need to run `exec sg docker newgrp` from any of that user's existing sessions for it to access the new group permissions.

You can verify that your current session recognizes the `docker` group by typing:

```
groups
```

## 3. DNS setup

To host n8n online or on a network, create a dedicated subdomain pointed at your server.

Add an A record to route the subdomain accordingly:

| Record type | Name                              | Destination                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| A           | `n8n` (or your desired subdomain) | `<your_server_IP_address>` |

## 4. Create an `.env` file

Create a project directory to store your n8n environment configuration and Docker Compose files and navigate inside:

```
mkdir n8n-compose
cd n8n-compose
```

Inside the `n8n-compose` directory, create an `.env` file to customize your n8n instance's details. Change it to match your own information:

```
# DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN together determine where n8n will be reachable from
# The top level domain to serve from
DOMAIN_NAME=example.com

# The subdomain to serve from
SUBDOMAIN=n8n

# The above example serve n8n at: https://n8n.example.com

# Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron and other scheduling nodes
# New York is the default value if not set
GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin

# The email address to use for the TLS/SSL certificate creation
SSL_EMAIL=user@example.com
```

## 5. Create local files directory

Inside your project directory, create a directory called `local-files` for sharing files between the n8n instance and the host system (for example, using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)):

```
mkdir local-files
```

The Docker Compose file below can automatically create this directory, but doing it manually ensures that it's created with the right ownership and permissions.

## 6. Create Docker Compose file

Create a `compose.yaml` file. Paste the following in the file:

```
services:
  traefik:
    image: "traefik"
    restart: always
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint.to=websecure"
      - "--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entrypoint.scheme=https"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.email=${SSL_EMAIL}"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - traefik_data:/letsencrypt
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.rule=Host(`${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}`)
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.entrypoints=web,websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls.certresolver=mytlschallenge
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLRedirect=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSSeconds=315360000
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.browserXSSFilter=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.contentTypeNosniff=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.forceSTSHeader=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLHost=${DOMAIN_NAME}
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSIncludeSubdomains=true
      - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSPreload=true
      - traefik.http.routers.n8n.middlewares=n8n@docker
    environment:
      - N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true
      - N8N_HOST=${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}
      - N8N_PORT=5678
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=https
      - N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - WEBHOOK_URL=https://${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}/
      - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}
      - TZ=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
      - ./local-files:/files

volumes:
  n8n_data:
  traefik_data:
```

The Docker Compose file above configures two containers: one for n8n, and one to run [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), an application proxy to manage TLS/SSL certificates and handle routing.

It also creates and mounts two [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) and mounts the `local-files` directory you created earlier:

| Name            | Type                                                        | Container mount   | Description                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `n8n_data`      | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/)   | `/home/node/.n8n` | Where n8n saves its SQLite database file and encryption key.                                                                        |
| `traefik_data`  | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/)   | `/letsencrypt`    | Where traefik saves TLS/SSL certificate data.                                                                                       |
| `./local-files` | [Bind](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) | `/files`          | A local directory shared between the n8n instance and host. In n8n, use the `/files` path to read from and write to this directory. |

## 7. Start Docker Compose

Start n8n by typing:

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```

To stop the containers, type:

```
sudo docker compose stop
```

## 8. Done

You can now reach n8n using the subdomain + domain combination you defined in your `.env` file configuration. The above example would result in `https://n8n.example.com`.

n8n is only accessible using secure HTTPS, not over plain HTTP.

If you have trouble reaching your instance, check your server's firewall settings and your DNS configuration.

# Hosting n8n on Google Cloud Run

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud Run, a serverless container runtime. If you're just getting started with n8n and don't need a production-grade deployment, you can go with the "easy mode" option below for deployment. Otherwise, if you intend to use this n8n deployment at-scale, refer to the "durable mode" instructions further down.

You can also enable access via OAuth to Google Workspace, such as Gmail and Drive, to use these services as n8n workflow tools. Instructions for granting n8n access to these services are at the end of of this documentation.

If you want to deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) instead, you can refer to [these instructions](../google-kubernetes-engine/).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Before you begin: get a Google Cloud project

If you have not yet created a Google Cloud project, [do this first](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) (and ensure you have billing enabled on the project; even if your Cloud Run service runs for free you must have billing activated to deploy). Otherwise, navigate to the project where you want to deploy n8n.

## Easy mode

This is the fastest way to deploy n8n on Cloud Run. For this deployment, n8n's data is in-memory so this is only recommended for demo purposes. **Anytime this Cloud Run service scales to zero or is redeployed, the n8n data will be lost.** Refer to the durable mode instructions below if you need a production-grade deployment.

If you have not yet created a Google Cloud project, [do this first](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) (and ensure you have billing enabled on the project; even if your Cloud Run service will run for free you must have billing enabled to activated to deploy). Otherwise, navigate to the project where you want to deploy n8n.

Open the Cloud Shell Terminal (on the Google Cloud console, either type "G" then "S" or click on the terminal icon on the upper right).

Once your session is open, you may need to run this command first to login (and follow the steps it asks you to complete):

```
gcloud auth login
```

You can also explicitly enable the Cloud Run API (even if you don't do this, it will ask if you want this enabled when you deploy):

```
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

To deploy n8n:

```
gcloud run deploy n8n \
    --image=n8nio/n8n \
    --region=us-west1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port=5678 \
    --no-cpu-throttling \
    --memory=2Gi
```

(you can specify whichever region you prefer, instead of "us-west1")

Once the deployment finishes, open another tab to navigate to the Service URL. n8n may still be loading and you will see a "n8n is starting up. Please wait" message, but shortly thereafter you should see the n8n login screen.

Optional: If you want to keep this n8n service running for as long as possible to avoid data loss, you can also set manual scale to 1 to prevent it from autoscaling to 0.

```
gcloud run deploy n8n \
    --image=n8nio/n8n \
    --region=us-west1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port=5678 \
    --no-cpu-throttling \
    --memory=2Gi \
    --scaling=1
```

This does not prevent data loss completely, such as whenever the Cloud Run service is re-deployed/updated. If you want truly persistant data, you should refer to the instructions below for how to attach a database.

## Durable mode

The following instructions are intended for a more durable, production-grade deployment of n8n on Cloud Run. It includes resources such as a database for persistance and secret manager for sensitive data.

If you want to deploy the following setup via Terraform, refer to this [example](https://github.com/ryanpei/n8n-hosting/tree/main/google-cloud-run) which deploys the same setup as the following (without the OAuth setup for Google Workspace tools).

## Enable APIs and set env vars

Open the Cloud Shell Terminal (on the Google Cloud console, either type "G" then "S" or click on the terminal icon on the upper right) and run these commands in the terminal session:

```
## You may need to login first
gcloud auth login

gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
```

You'll also want to set some environment variables for the remainder of these instructions:

```
export PROJECT_ID=your-project
export REGION=region-where-you-want-this-deployed
```

## Setup your Postgres database

Run this command to create the Postgres DB instance (it will take a few minutes to complete; also ensure you update the root-password field with your own desired password):

```
gcloud sql instances create n8n-db \
    --database-version=POSTGRES_13 \
    --tier=db-f1-micro \
    --region=$REGION \
    --root-password="change-this-password" \
    --storage-size=10GB \
    --availability-type=ZONAL \
    --no-backup \
    --storage-type=HDD
```

Once complete, you can add the database that n8n will use:

```
gcloud sql databases create n8n --instance=n8n-db
```

Create the DB user for n8n (change the password value, of course):

```
gcloud sql users create n8n-user \
    --instance=n8n-db \
    --password="change-this-password"
```

You can save the password you set for this n8n-user to a file for the next step of saving the password in Secret Manager. Be sure to delete this file later.

## Store sensitive data in Secret Manager

While not required, it's absolutely recommended to store your sensitive data in Secrets Manager.

Create a secret for the database password (replace "/your/password/file" with the file you created above for the n8n-user password):

```
gcloud secrets create n8n-db-password \
    --data-file=/your/password/file \
    --replication-policy="automatic"
```

Create an encryption key (you can use your own, this example generates a random one):

```
openssl rand -base64 -out my-encryption-key 42
```

Create a secret for this encryption key (replace "my-encryption-key" if you are supplying your own):

```
gcloud secrets create n8n-encryption-key \
    --data-file=my-encryption-key \
    --replication-policy="automatic"
```

Now you can delete my-encryption-key and the database password files you created. These values are now securely stored in Secret Manager.

## Create a service account for Cloud Run

You want this Cloud Run service to be restricted to access only the resources it needs. The following commands create the service account and adds the permissions necessary to access secrets and the database:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create n8n-service-account \
    --display-name="n8n Service Account"

gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding n8n-db-password \
    --member="serviceAccount:n8n-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"

gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding n8n-encryption-key \
    --member="serviceAccount:n8n-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:n8n-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/cloudsql.client"
```

## Deploy the Cloud Run service

Now you can deploy your n8n service:

```
gcloud run deploy n8n \
    --image=n8nio/n8n:latest \
    --command="/bin/sh" \
    --args="-c,sleep 5;n8n start" \
    --region=$REGION \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port=5678 \
    --memory=2Gi \
    --no-cpu-throttling \
    --set-env-vars="N8N_PORT=5678,N8N_PROTOCOL=https,DB_TYPE=postgresdb,DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n,DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n-user,DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=/cloudsql/$PROJECT_ID:$REGION:n8n-db,DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432,DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=public,GENERIC_TIMEZONE=UTC,QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true" \
    --set-secrets="DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=n8n-db-password:latest,N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=n8n-encryption-key:latest" \
    --add-cloudsql-instances=$PROJECT_ID:$REGION:n8n-db \
    --service-account=n8n-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Once the deployment finishes, open another tab to navigate to the Service URL. You should see the n8n login screen.

## Troubleshooting

If you see a "Cannot GET /" screen this usually indicates that n8n is still starting up. You can refresh the page and it should eventually load.

## (Optional) Enabling Google Workspace services as n8n tools

If you want to use Google Workspace services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.) as tools in n8n, it's recommended to setup OAuth to access these services.

First ensure the respective APIs you want are enabled:

```
## Enable whichever APIs you need
## Note: If you want Sheets/Docs, it's not enough to just enable Drive; these services each have their own API
gcloud services enable gmail.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable drive.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sheets.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable docs.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable calendar-json.googleapis.com
```

Re-deploy n8n on Cloud Run with the necessary OAuth callback URLs as environment variables:

```
export SERVICE_URL="your-n8n-service-URL"
## e.g. https://n8n-12345678.us-west1.run.app

gcloud run services update n8n \
    --region=$REGION \
    --update-env-vars="N8N_HOST=$(echo $SERVICE_URL | sed 's/https:\/\///'),WEBHOOK_URL=$SERVICE_URL,N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL=$SERVICE_URL"
```

Lastly, you must setup OAuth for these services. Visit `https://console.cloud.google.com/auth` and follow these steps:

1. Click "Get Started" if this button shows (when you have not yet setup OAuth in this Cloud project).
1. For "App Information", enter whichever "App Name" and "User Support Email" you prefer.
1. For "Audience", select "Internal" if you intend to only enable access to your user(s) within this same Google Workspace. Otherwise, you can select "External".
1. Enter "Contact Information".
1. If you selected "External", then click "Audience" and add any test users you need to grant access.
1. Click "Clients" > "Create client", select "Web application" for "Application type", enter your n8n service URL into "Authorized JavaScript origins", and "/rest/oauth2-credential/callback" into "Authorized redirect URIs" where your YOUR-N8N-URL is also the n8n service URL (e.g. `https://n8n-12345678.us-west1.run.app/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`). Make sure you download the created client's JSON file since it contains the client secret which you will not be able to see later in the Console.
1. Click "Data Access" and add the scopes you want n8n to have access for (e.g. to access Google Sheets, you need `https://googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` and `https://googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`)
1. Now you should be able to use these workspace services. You can test if it works by logging into n8n, add a Tool for the respective service and add its credentials using the information in the OAuth client JSON file from step 6.

# Hosting n8n on Google Kubernetes Engine

Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. If you want to use Cloud Run, refer to [these instructions](../google-cloud-run/).

Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) instead to undertake all the steps.

## Prerequisites

- The [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- The [gke-gcloud-auth-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) (install the gcloud CLI first)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Create project

GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.

## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API

GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for "Kubernetes" in the top search bar and select "Kubernetes Engine" from the results.

Select **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.

## Create a cluster

From the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview), select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the "Standard" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an "Autopilot" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.

## Set Kubectl context

The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting **CONNECT**. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting) locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting.git
```

And change directory:

```
cd n8n-hosting/kubernetes
```

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Create a volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke) for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.

```
…
allowedTopologies:
  - matchLabelExpressions:
      - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
        values:
          - us-central1-b
          - us-central1-c
```

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

- Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
- If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

```
…
volumes:
  - name: n8n-claim0
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: n8n-claim0
…
```

### Pod resources

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml` files:

```
…
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "250Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "500Mi"
…
```

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f .
```

Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & Ingress** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **Endpoints** column.

GKE and IP addresses

[Read this GKE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#configuring_your_domain_name_records) for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.

## Delete resources

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

```
kubectl delete -f .
```

## Next steps

# Hosting n8n on Heroku

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.
- [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres) to host n8n's data storage.
- A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project

The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:

This opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.

### Configure environment variables

Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.

You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:

- **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.
- **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.

### Deploy n8n

Select **Deploy app**.

After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.

Heroku and DNS

Refer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns) to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.

## Changing the deployment template

You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku) and deploying from you fork.

### The Dockerfile

By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.

### Heroku and exposing ports

Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.

Docker limitations with Heroku

[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands) for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.

### Configuring Heroku

The `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:

- `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.
- The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.

# Hosting n8n on Hetzner cloud

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a Hetzner cloud server. It uses:

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Server from the internet.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.6.3 Current `beta`: 2.7.0

## Create a server

1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
1. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.
1. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.

You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select "Docker CE" from the **APPS** tab.

Type

When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.

SSH keys

Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.

## Log in to your server

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg) for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.

## Install Docker Compose

The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:

```
apt update && apt -y upgrade
apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git
```

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

```
cd n8n-docker-caddy
```

## Default folders and files

The host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volume

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

```
docker volume create caddy_data
```

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

```
sudo docker volume create n8n_data
```

## Set up DNS

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).

## Open ports

n8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands:

```
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

## Configure n8n

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

```
nano .env
```

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

```
nano docker-compose.yml
```

## Configure Caddy

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

```
nano caddy_config/Caddyfile
```

Change the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
      flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

## Start Docker Compose

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```
docker compose up -d
```

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

```
sudo docker compose stop
```

## Updating

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

```
# Navigate to the directory containing your docker compose file
cd </path/to/your/compose/file/directory>

# Pull latest version
docker compose pull

# Stop and remove older version
docker compose down

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

## Next steps

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# Logging in n8n

Logging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging library.

Log streaming

n8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes [Log streaming](../../../log-streaming/), in addition to the logging options described in this document.

## Setup

To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the [configuration file](../../configuration/environment-variables/))

| Setting in the configuration file | Using environment variables | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| n8n.log.level                     | N8N_LOG_LEVEL               | The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is `info`. You can learn more about these options [here](#log-levels). |
| n8n.log.output                    | N8N_LOG_OUTPUT              | Where to output logs. The available options are `console` and `file`. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (`,`). `console` is used by default.                                               |
| n8n.log.file.location             | N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION       | The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default, `<n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log` is used.                                                                                        |
| n8n.log.file.fileSizeMax          | N8N_LOG_FILE_SIZE_MAX       | The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB.                                                                                                                                   |
| n8n.log.file.fileCountMax         | N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX      | The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers.                                                                                           |

```
# Set the logging level to 'debug'
export N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Set log output to both console and a log file
export N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file

# Set a save location for the log file
export N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log

# Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file
export N8N_LOG_FILE_SIZE_MAX=50

# Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept
export N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX=60
```

### Log levels

n8n uses standard log levels to report:

- `silent`: outputs nothing at all
- `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else
- `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages
- `info`: contains useful information about progress
- `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.

## Development

During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.

### Implementation details

n8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.

The initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.

Once the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.

Check the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.

### Adding logs

Once the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.

Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.

In the example above, we use the standard log levels described [above](#log-levels). The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.

```
// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier

import {
	LoggerProxy as Logger
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties

Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow "${workflow.name}"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});
```

When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:

- Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
- Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
- Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.
- Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.

## Front-end logs

As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.

# Monitoring

There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: `/healthz`, `healthz/readiness`, and `/metrics`.

## healthz and healthz/readiness

The `/healthz` endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/healthz
```

The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness
```

## metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

Access the endpoint:

```
<your-instance-url>/metrics
```

Feature availability

The `/metrics` endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n

The `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:

```
# metrics
N8N_METRICS=true
# healthz
QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true
```

Refer to [Configuration methods](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on how to configure your instance using environment variables.

# Binary data

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents generated or processed during the execution of a workflow.

## Enable filesystem mode

When handling binary data, n8n keeps the data in memory by default. This can cause crashes when working with large files.

To avoid this, change the `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/binary-data/) to `filesystem`. This causes n8n to save data to disk, instead of using memory.

If you're using queue mode, switch this to `database`. n8n doesn't support `filesystem` mode with queue mode.

## Binary data pruning

n8n executes binary data pruning as part of execution data pruning. Refer to [Execution data | Enable executions pruning](../execution-data/#enable-executions-pruning) for details.

If you configure multiple binary data modes, binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. Refer to [External storage](../external-storage/#usage) for details.

# Self-hosted concurrency control

Only for self-hosted n8n

This document is for self-hosted concurrency control. Read [Cloud concurrency](../../../manage-cloud/concurrency/) to learn how concurrency works with n8n Cloud accounts.

In regular mode, n8n doesn't limit how many production executions may run at the same time. This can lead to a scenario where too many concurrent executions thrash the event loop, causing performance degradation and unresponsiveness.

To prevent this, you can set a concurrency limit for production executions in regular mode. Use this to control how many production executions run concurrently, and queue up any concurrent production executions over the limit. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

Concurrency control is disabled by default. To enable it:

```
export N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT=20
```

Keep in mind:

- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or [trigger](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI.

- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.

- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.

- To monitor concurrency control, watch logs for executions being added to the queue and released. In a future version, n8n will show concurrency control in the UI.

When you enable concurrency control, you can view the number of active executions and the configured limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Comparison to queue mode

In queue mode, you can control how many jobs a worker may run concurrently using the [`--concurrency` flag](../queue-mode/#configure-worker-concurrency).

Concurrency control in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency control in regular mode, but the environment variable `N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT` controls both of them. In queue mode, n8n takes the limit from this variable if set to a value other than `-1`, falling back to the `--concurrency` flag or its default.

# Execution data

Depending on your executions settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid this, n8n recommends that you don't save unnecessary data, and enable pruning of old executions data.

To do this, configure the corresponding [environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/executions/).

## Reduce saved data

Configuration at workflow level

You can also configure these settings on an individual workflow basis using the [workflow settings](../../../workflows/settings/).

You can select which executions data n8n saves. For example, you can save only executions that result in an `Error`.

```
# npm
# Save executions ending in errors
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all

# Don't save successful executions
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none

# Don't save node progress for each execution
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=false

# Don't save manually launched executions
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false
```

```
# Docker
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=true \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

```
# Docker Compose
n8n:
    environment:
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=true
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false
```

## Enable executions pruning

Executions pruning deletes finished executions along with their execution data and binary data on a regular schedule. n8n enables pruning by default. For performance reasons, pruning first marks targets for deletion, and then later permanently removes them.

n8n prunes executions when **either** of the following condition occur:

- **Age**: The execution finished more than `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` hours ago (default: 336 hours -> 14 days).
- **Count**: The total number of executions exceeds `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` (default: 10,000). When this occurs, n8n deletes executions from oldest to newest.

Keep in mind:

- Executions with the `new`, `running`, or `waiting` status aren't eligible for pruning.
- Annotated executions (for example, executions with tags or ratings) are never pruned.
- Pruning honors a safety buffer period of `EXECUTIONS_DATA_HARD_DELETE_BUFFER` hours (default: 1h), to ensure recent data remains available while the user is building or debugging a workflow.

```
# Enable executions pruning
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true

# How old (hours) a finished execution must be to qualify for soft-deletion
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168

# Max number of finished executions to keep. May not strictly prune back down to the exact max count. Set to `0` for unlimited.
export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000
```

```
# Docker
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true \
 -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

```
# Docker Compose
n8n:
    environment:
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000
```

SQLite

If you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data. To free up this space configure the `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite) or manually run the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation.

Binary data pruning

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# External storage

Feature availability

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans
- If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

n8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data.

n8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.

## Storing n8n's binary data in S3

n8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.

Enterprise-tier feature

You will need an [Enterprise license key](../../../license-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.

### Setup

Create and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:

```
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
  {
   "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": ["s3:*"],
   "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>", "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"]
  }
 ]
}
```

Set a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.

Once you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:

```
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_HOST=... # example: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=...
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=...
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=...
export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=...
```

No region

If your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`.

Tell n8n to store binary data in S3:

```
export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3
export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3
```

Auth autodetection

To automatically detect credentials to authenticate your S3 calls, set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_AUTH_AUTO_DETECT` to `true`. This will use the default [credential provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html#credchain).

Restart the server to load the new configuration.

### Usage

After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:

```
workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}
```

n8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.

If you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.

Binary data pruning

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# Memory-related errors

n8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.

Only for self-hosted n8n

This page describes memory-related errors when [self-hosting n8n](../../). Visit [Cloud data management](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/) to learn about memory limits for [n8n Cloud](../../../manage-cloud/overview/).

## Identifying out of memory situations

n8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.

Error messages including **Problem running workflow**, **Connection Lost**, or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable.

When self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs.

On n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.

## Typical causes

Such problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:

- Amount of [JSON data](../../../data/data-structure/).
- Size of binary data.
- Number of nodes in a workflow.
- Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.
- Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.
- Additional workflows running at the same time.

## Avoiding out of memory situations

When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.

### Increase available memory

When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.

On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.

### Reduce memory consumption

This approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.

- Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
- Avoid using the Code node where possible.
- Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
- Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

### Increase old memory

This applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes) `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).

# Scaling n8n

When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.

n8n can run in different [modes](../queue-mode/) depending on your needs. The `queue` mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](../queue-mode/) for configuration details.

You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to [Execution data](../execution-data/) for details.

# Performance and benchmarking

n8n can handle up to 220 workflow executions per second on a single instance, with the ability to scale up further by adding more instances.

This document outlines n8n's performance benchmarking. It describes the factors that affect performance, and includes two example benchmarks.

## Performance factors

The performance of n8n depends on factors including:

- The workflow type
- The resources available to n8n
- How you configure n8n's scaling options

## Run your own benchmarking

To get an accurate estimate for your use case, run n8n's [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/benchmark). The repository contains more information about the benchmarking.

## Example: Single instance performance

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

Setup:

- Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)
- n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)
- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node

This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.

## Example: Multi-instance performance

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

Setup:

- Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)
- n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis
- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node
- Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](../queue-mode/)

This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.

# Queue mode

You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.

Binary data storage

n8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage in filesystem. If your workflows need to persist binary data in queue mode, you can use [S3 external storage](../external-storage/).

## How it works

When running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions.

Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second).

By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.

This is the process flow:

1. The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution.
1. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, [Redis](#start-redis), which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.
1. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.
1. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.
1. After completing the workflow execution, the worker:
   - Writes the results to the database.
   - Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.
1. Redis notifies the main instance.

## Configuring workers

Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.

### Set encryption key

n8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.

The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.

Set the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:

```
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>
```

### Set executions mode

Database considerations

n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.

Set the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` on the main instance and any workers using the following command.

```
export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue
```

Alternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](../../configuration/environment-variables/).

### Start Redis

Running Redis on a separate machine

You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.

To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:

Run the following command to start a Redis instance:

```
docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379  -d redis
```

By default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.

| Using configuration file          | Using environment variables       | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`.                                                    |
| `queue.bull.redis.port:6379`      | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379`      | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. |

You can also set the following optional configurations:

| Using configuration file                    | Using environment variables          | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME`        | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME`          | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable.                               |
| `queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD`        | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD`          | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable.                                    |
| `queue.bull.redis.db:0`                     | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB`                | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration.                                                       |
| `queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms).                        |
| `queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30`     | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`      | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds. |

Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.

### Start workers

You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.

Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:

```
./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker
```

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

```
docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker
```

You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.

#### Worker server

Each worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:

- `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
- `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
- [credentials overwrite endpoint](../../../embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)
- [`/metrics`](../../configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)

#### View running workers

Feature availability

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
- If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

You can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.

## Running n8n with queues

When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. For webhooks, this means the HTTP request is received by the main/webhook process, but the actual workflow execution is passed to a worker, which can add some overhead and latency.

Redis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.

Migrate data

If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](../../cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.

## Webhook processors

Keep in mind

Webhook processes rely on Redis and need the `EXECUTIONS_MODE` environment variable set too. Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.

Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.

This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.

n8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.

You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:

```
./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook
```

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

```
docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 -e "EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue" docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook
```

### Configure webhook URL

To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:

```
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com
```

You can also set this value in the configuration file.

### Configure load balancer

When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:

- Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool
- All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process

**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.

You can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.

### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)

You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

```
export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true
```

When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.

## Configure worker concurrency

You can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:

```
n8n worker --concurrency=5
```

## Concurrency and scaling recommendations

n8n recommends setting concurrency to 5 or higher for your worker instances. Setting low concurrency values with a large numbers of workers can exhaust your database's connection pool, leading to processing delays and failures.

## Multi-main setup

Feature availability

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.

In queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.

In a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks:

- **regular tasks**, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and
- **at-most-once tasks**, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.

In a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:

- **followers**, which run **regular tasks**, and
- the **leader**, which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.

### Leader designation

In a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.

### Configuring multi-main setup

To deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure:

- All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.
- All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.
- All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.
- All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.

If needed, you can adjust the leader key options:

| Using configuration file    | Using environment variables             | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `multiMainSetup.ttl:10`     | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10`       | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. |
| `multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup.   |

# Block access to nodes

For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.

Use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.

## Exclude nodes

Update your `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.

For example, setting the variable this way:

```
NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"
```

Blocks the [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) nodes.

Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.

## Suggested nodes to block

The nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:

- [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)
- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)

## Enable nodes that are blocked by default

Some nodes, like Execute Command, are blocked by default. Remove them from the exclude list to enable them:

```
NODES_EXCLUDE: "[]"
```

## Related resources

Refer to [Nodes environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on this environment variable.

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

# Disable the public REST API

The [n8n public REST API](../../../api/) allows you to programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the n8n GUI.

If you don't plan on using this API, n8n recommends disabling it to improve the security of your n8n installation.

To disable the [public REST API](../../../api/), set the `N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED` environment variable to `true`, for example:

```
export N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED=true
```

## Disable the API playground

To disable the [API playground](../../../api/using-api-playground/), set the `N8N_PUBLIC_API_SWAGGERUI_DISABLED` environment variable to `true`, for example:

```
export N8N_PUBLIC_API_SWAGGERUI_DISABLED=true
```

## Related resources

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

# Hardening task runners

[Task runners](../../configuration/task-runners/) are responsible for executing code from the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/). While Code node executions are secure, you can follow these recommendations to further harden your task runners.

## Run task runners as sidecars in external mode

To increase the isolation between the core n8n process and code in the Code node, run task runners in [external mode](../../configuration/task-runners/#setting-up-external-mode). External task runners launch as separate containers, providing a fully isolated environment to execute the JavaScript defined in the Code node.

## Use the distroless image

For a reduced attack surface, use the distroless Docker image variant. Distroless images contain only the application and its runtime dependencies, excluding package managers, shells, and other utilities that aren't needed at runtime.

To use the distroless image, append the `-distroless` suffix to the Docker tag. For example: `2.4.6-distroless`.

## Run as the nobody user

For improved security, configure task runners to run as the unprivileged `nobody` user with user and group ID 65532. This prevents the container process from running with root privileges and limits potential damage from security vulnerabilities.

## Configure read-only root filesystem

Configure a [read-only root filesystem](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) to prevent any modifications to the container's filesystem at runtime. This helps protect against malicious code that might attempt to modify system files.

Task runners still require some temporary storage for operation. To accommodate this, mount a minimal `emptyDir` volume to `/tmp`. If your workflows require more temporary space, increase the size of the volume accordingly.

# Securing n8n

Securing your n8n instance can take several forms.

At a high level, you can:

- Conduct a [security audit](../security-audit/) to identify security risks.
- [Set up SSL](../set-up-ssl/) to enforce secure connections.
- [Set up Single Sign-On](../set-up-sso/) for user account management.
- Use [two-factor authentication (2FA)](../../../user-management/two-factor-auth/) for your users.

More granularly, consider blocking or opting out of features or data collection you don't want:

- [Disable the public API](../disable-public-api/) if you aren't using it.
- [Opt out of data collection](../telemetry-opt-out/) of the anonymous data n8n collects automatically.
- [Block certain nodes](../blocking-nodes/) from being available to your users.
- [Restrict account registration](../restrict-by-email-verification/) to email-verified users.

# Restrict account registration to email-verified users

You can require all new accounts to be verified by email. This prevents malicious admins from registering accounts without email verification.

## Prerequisites

- SMTP must be set up and n8n must be able to send emails.

## How to restrict account registration

Set the environment variable `N8N_INVITE_LINKS_EMAIL_ONLY` to `true`. This locks down your instance so that only users with verified email addresses can register.

For more details on configuring SMTP, see [Set up SMTP](../../configuration/user-management-self-hosted/#step-one-smtp).

# Security audit

You can run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

## Run an audit

You can run an audit using the CLI, the public API, or the n8n node.

### CLI

Run `n8n audit`.

### API

Make a `POST` call to the `/audit` endpoint. You must authenticate as the instance owner.

### n8n node

Add the [n8n node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to your workflow. Select **Resource** > **Audit** and **Operation** > **Generate**.

## Report contents

The audit generates five risk reports:

### Credentials

This report shows:

- Credentials not used in a workflow.
- Credentials not used in an active workflow.
- Credentials not use in a recently active workflow.

### Database

This report shows:

- Expressions used in **Execute Query** fields in SQL nodes.
- Expressions used in **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.
- Unused **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.

### File system

This report lists nodes that interact with the file system.

### Nodes

This report shows:

- Official risky nodes. These are n8n built in nodes. You can use them to fetch and run any code on the host system, which exposes the instance to exploits. You can view the list in [n8n code | Audit constants](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/security-audit/constants.ts#L51), under `OFFICIAL_RISKY_NODE_TYPES`.
- Community nodes.
- Custom nodes.

### Instance

This report shows:

- Unprotected webhooks in the instance.
- Missing security settings
- If your instance is outdated.

# Set up SSL

There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.

## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)

Use a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.

Refer to [Security | Data encryption](https://n8n.io/legal/#security) for more information.

## Pass certificates into n8n directly

You can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.

You'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.

Refer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these variables and [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

# Set up Single Sign-On (SSO)

Feature availability

- Available on Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure SAML or OIDC.

n8n supports the SAML and OIDC authentication protocols for single sign-on (SSO). See [OIDC vs SAML](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/oidc-vs-saml) for more general information on the two protocols, the differences between them, and their respective benefits.

- [Set up OIDC](../../../user-management/oidc/setup/): a general guide to setting up OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO in n8n.

# Data collection

n8n collects some anonymous data from self-hosted n8n installations. Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.

## Collected data

Refer to [Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n](../../../privacy-security/privacy/#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n) for details on the data n8n collects.

## How collection works

Your n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.

## Opting out of data collection

n8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.

### Opt out of telemetry events

To opt out of telemetry events, set the `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

```
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
```

### Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the `N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

```
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

## Disable all connection to n8n servers

If you want to fully prevent all communication with n8n's servers, refer to [Isolate n8n](../../configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

## Related resources

Refer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these environment variables.

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

# Integrations

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

## Built-in nodes

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

## Community nodes

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](community-nodes/installation/) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](../glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

- Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
- Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

Refer to [Custom operations](custom-operations/) for more information.

## Generic integrations

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

## Where to go next

- If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](creating-nodes/overview/) section.
- Check out [Community nodes](community-nodes/usage/) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
- If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](builtin/core-nodes/), [Actions](builtin/app-nodes/), and [Triggers](builtin/trigger-nodes/).
- If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](builtin/credentials/) section.

# Custom API operations

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](../../glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

- Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](../builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
- Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

## Predefined credential types

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
1. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
1. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
   1. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

### Credential scopes

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

# Built-in integrations

This section contains the [node](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

- Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
- Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Core nodes

Core nodes can be actions or [triggers](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n). Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.

## Cluster nodes

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

## Credentials

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n).

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.

To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.

To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](../../../credentials/).

## Community nodes

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](../../community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), refer to [Creating nodes](../../creating-nodes/overview/) for more information.

# Handling API rate limits

[API](../../../glossary/#api) rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.

APIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.

## Identify rate limit issues

When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.

If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.

To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.

## Handle rate limits for integrations

There are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) and [Wait](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) nodes:

- Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.
- With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.

### Enable Retry On Fail

When you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.

1. Open the node.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.
1. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Use Loop Over Items and Wait

Use the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.

1. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) for information on how to configure the node.
1. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) for information on how to configure the node.

For example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:

## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.

### Batch requests

Use the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Paginate results

APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination).

# Actions library

This section provides information about n8n's Actions.

# Action Network node

Use the Action Network node to automate work in Action Network, and integrate Action Network with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Action Network features, including creating, updating, and deleting events, people, tags, and signatures.

[Browse Grist integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/grist/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Get the Row ID

To update or delete a particular record, you need the Row ID. There are two ways to get the Row ID:

**Create a Row ID column in Grist**

Create a new column in your Grist table with the formula `$id`.

**Use the Get All operation**

The **Get All** operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.

You can get it with the expression `{{$("GristNodeName").item.json.id}}`.

## Filter records when using the Get All operation

- Select **Add Option** and select **Filter** from the dropdown list.
- You can add filters for any number of columns. The result will only include records which match all the columns.
- For each column, you can enter any number of values separated by commas. The result will include records which match any of the values for that column.

## Options

### Query Options

The Query Submission operation supports query options:

- In the main section of the **Parameters** panel:
  - **Start** controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).
  - **Limit** sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.
- In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:
  - **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{"status": "success", "_submission_time": {"$lt": "2021-11-01T01:02:03"}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.
  - **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.
  - **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{"status": 1, "_submission_time": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.

More details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](<https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters>)

### Submission options

All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:

- Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images).
- Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).

#### About reformatting

The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.

This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.

When enabled, the reformatting:

- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).
- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
- Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.
- Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.

Here's a detailed example in JSON:

```
{
  "_id": 471987,
  "formhub/uuid": "189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6",

  "_tags": [],
  "_notes": [],
  "_validation_status": {},
  "_submitted_by": null
}
```

With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respectively), n8n parses it into:

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Microsoft Entra ID node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails

You can't update the **Allow External Senders** and **Auto Subscribe New Members** options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.

When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.

# Microsoft Excel 365 node

Tag Replacement Behavior

When using the Zendesk node's "Update Ticket" operation and specifying the `Tag Names or IDs` field, the entire list of tags on the ticket **will be replaced**. Any tags not included in the update will be removed from the ticket due to how the Zendesk API processes tag updates by default.

**To avoid accidental tag removal:**

- First retrieve the ticket's tags and merge them with your new tags before updating.
- Alternatively, use the HTTP Request node with Zendesk's `additional_tags` property to add tags without removing existing ones.
- You can also call the ticket's `/tags` endpoint to add tags without replacing existing ones ([Zendesk tags endpoint documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/tags/)).

See the official documentation for details: [Adding tags to tickets without overwriting existing tags](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/adding-tags-to-tickets-without-overwriting-existing-tags/).

## Node reference

### Get the Record ID

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
1. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
1. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
1. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Airtable node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Airtable node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this:

```
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"
```

The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.

Refer to the [Airtable credentials](../../../credentials/airtable/) and [Airtables scopes documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) for more information.

## Service is receiving too many requests from you

Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.

If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.

You can find out more in the [Airtable's rate limits documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits). If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the [handling rate limits](../../../rate-limits/) page.

## Waiting for a response

By choosing the **Send and Wait for a Response** operation, you can send a message and pause the workflow execution until a person confirms the action or provides more information.

### Response Type

You can choose between the following types of waiting and approval actions:

- **Approval**: Users can approve or disapprove from within the message.
- **Free Text**: Users can submit a response with a form.
- **Custom Form**: Users can submit a response with a custom form.

You can customize the waiting and response behavior depending on which response type you choose. You can configure these options in any of the above response types:

- **Limit Wait Time**: Whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.
- **Append n8n Attribution**: Whether to mention in the message that it was sent automatically with n8n (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Approval response customization

When using the Approval response type, you can choose whether to present only an approval button or both approval *and* disapproval buttons.

You can also customize the button labels for the buttons you include.

### Free Text response customization

When using the Free Text response type, you can customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.

### Custom Form response customization

When using the Custom Form response type, you build a form using the fields and options you want.

You can customize each form element with the settings outlined in the [n8n Form trigger's form elements](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/#form-elements). To add more fields, select the **Add Form Element** button.

You'll also be able to customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Discord node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Discord node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add extra fields to embeds

Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.

The Discord node supports embeds when using the **Send** operation on the **Message** resource. Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.

To add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.

For example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:

```
{
    "author": "My Name",
	"url": "https://discord.js.org",
	"fields": [
		{
			"name": "Regular field title",
			"value": "Some value here"
		}
	],
	"footer": {
		"text": "Some footer text here",
		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
	}
}
```

You can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).

If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:

```
https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages
```

In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:

```
{
	"content": "Test",
	"embeds": [
		{
			"author": "My Name",
			"url": "https://discord.js.org",
			"fields": [
				{
					"name": "Regular field title",
					"value": "Some value here"
				}
			],
			"footer": {
				"text": "Some footer text here",
				"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

## Mention users and channels

To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.

You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:

- **User**: `<@USER_ID>`
- **Channel**: `<#CHANNEL_ID>`
- **Role**: `<@&ROLE_ID>`

## Related resources

Refer to Google's [Gmail API documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) for detailed information about the API that this node integrates with.

n8n provides a trigger node for Gmail. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmailtrigger/).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Gmail node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Gmail node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send a message](../message-operations/#send-a-message) or [reply to a message](../message-operations/#reply-to-a-message), the node appends this statement to the end of the email:

> This email was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Options** section, select **Add option**.
1. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
1. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send options](../message-operations/#send-options) and [Reply options](../message-operations/#reply-options) for more information.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays next to certain dropdowns in the node, like the **Label Names or IDs** dropdown. The full text looks something like this:

```
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"
```

The error most often displays when you're using a Google Service Account as the credential and the credential doesn't have **Impersonate a User** turned on.

Refer to [Google Service Account: Finish your n8n credential](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#finish-your-n8n-credential) for more information.

## 401 unauthorized error

The full text of the error looks like this:

```
401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}
```

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

1. For [OAuth2](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Gmail API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
1. For [Service Account](../../../credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
   1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
   1. Make sure you add the Gmail API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error most often occurs if you enter a Message ID, Thread ID, or Label ID that doesn't exist.

Try a **Get** operation with the ID to confirm it exists.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

# Google Drive node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this:

- If your app **User Type** is **Internal**, create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
- If your app **User Type** is **External**, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app: go to the [**Audience**](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of **Test users**.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

## Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

## Google Drive OAuth error

If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.

Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.

If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) environment variables use fully qualified domains.

## Get recent files from Google Drive

To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.

The process looks like this:

1. Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.
1. Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.
1. Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.
1. Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.
1. In the **Options**, set the **Fields** to **All**.
1. Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.
1. Choose **Simple** sort type.
1. Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.
1. Choose **Descending** sort order.
1. Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.
1. Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.
1. Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.
1. Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.
1. In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.
1. Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression.

# Google Sheets node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Append an array

To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format.

To do so, consider using:

1. The [Split Out](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) node.

1. The [AI Transform](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/) node. For example, try entering something like:

   ```
   Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.
   ```

1. The [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

## Column names were updated after the node's setup

You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.

To refresh the column names, re-select **Mapping Column Mode**. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.

  - By default, n8n appends empty rows or columns and then adds the new data. This approach can ensure data alignment but may be less efficient. Using the append endpoint can lead to better performance by minimizing the number of API calls and simplifying the process. But if the existing sheet data has inconsistencies such as gaps or breaks between rows and columns, n8n may add the new data in the wrong place, leading to misalignment issues.
  - Use this option when performance is a priority and the data structure in the sheet is consistent without gaps.

Refer to the [Method: spreadsheets.values.update | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/update) API documentation for more information.

## Related resources

Refer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html) for more information about the service.

Refer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html) for more information on writing SQL queries.

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

```
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]
```

You can write a query like:

```
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

```
// users is an example table name
users, {{ $json.email }}
```

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

# MySQL node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [MySQL node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Update rows by composite key

The MySQL node's **Update** operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a **Column to Match On** and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.

You can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.

To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`:

```
UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;
```

## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker

When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only MySQL is in Docker

If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:

```
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest
```

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](../../../credentials/ollama/) to use `localhost`.

## Decimal numbers returned as strings

By default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.

To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.

As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](../../../../../code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision.

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

# Notion node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Notion node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Relation property not displaying

The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.

To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on [name of related database]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.

If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:

```
https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>
```

Enable **Send Body**, set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON**, and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:

```
{
	"properties": {
		"Account": {
			"relation": [
				{
					"id": "<your_relation_ID>"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

## Create toggle heading

The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to **Page**, **Database Page**, or **Block** resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.

You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):

1. Add a heading with Notion node.
1. Select the resource you want to add a heading to:
   - To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.
   - To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.
1. Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, or **Heading 3**.
1. Add an [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.
1. Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.
1. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
1. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node after the HTTP Request node.
1. Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.
1. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.
1. Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.
1. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
1. Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.
1. Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).
1. Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).

The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block.

## Handle null and empty values

You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.

To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.

To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an [If](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.

As an alternative, you can set a [default value](../../../../../code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) if the incoming data doesn't provide one.

# Oracle Database node

Use the Oracle Database node to automate work in Oracle Database, and integrate Oracle Database with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Oracle Database features which includes executing an SQL statement, fetching, inserting, updating or deleting data from Oracle Database. This node uses the [node-oracledb driver](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb) internally.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Oracle Database node supports and links to more resources.

Note

Refer to [Oracle Database credentials](../../credentials/oracledb/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Use bind parameters

When creating a statement to run on an Oracle database instance, you can use the **Bind Variable Placeholder Values** field in the **Options** section to load data into the statement. n8n sanitizes data in statement parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you would want to find specific fruits by their color. Given the following input data:

```
[
    {
        "FRUIT_ID": 1,
        "FRUIT_NAME": "Apple",
        "COLOR": "Red" 
    },
    {
        "FRUIT_ID": 2,
        "FRUIT_NAME": "Banana",
        "COLOR": "Yellow"
    }
]
```

You can write a statement like:

```
SELECT * FROM FRUITS WHERE COLOR = :col
```

Then in **Bind Variable Placeholder Values**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the color from each input item in turn:

```
// fruits is an example table name
fruits, {{ $json.color }}
```

## Use n8n Expressions for bind values

For **Values to Send**, you can provide inputs using n8n Expressions. Below are examples for different data types — you can either enter constant values or reference fields from previous items (`$json`):

### JSON

- Constant: `{{ { k1: "v1", k2: "v2" } }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_JSON }}`

### VECTOR

- Constant: `{{ [1, 2, 3, 4.5] }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_VECTOR }}`

### BLOB

- Constant: `{{ [94, 87, 34] }}` or `{{ ' BLOB data string' }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_BLOB }}`

### RAW

- Constant: `{{ [94, 87, 34] }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_RAW }}`

### BOOLEAN

- Constant: `{{ true }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_BOOLEAN }}`

### NUMBER

- Constant: `1234`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_NUMBER }}`

## VARCHAR

- Constant: `' Hello World '`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_CHAR }}`

These examples assume JSON keys (e.g. `COL_JSON, COL_VECTOR`) map directly to the respective SQL column types.

## Related resources

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

```
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]
```

You can write a query like:

```
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

```
// users is an example table name
{{ [ 'users', $json.email ] }}

# Postgres node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters

In Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:

```
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');
```

While you can use n8n [expressions](../../../../../code/expressions/) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](../#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.

To construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:

1. Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.

1. In **Options**, select **Query Parameters**.

1. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.

1. In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:

   ```
   SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();
   ```

1. Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:

   ```
   SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => "$" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});
   ```

With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.

## Working with timestamps and time zones

To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:

- **Use UTC when storing and passing dates**: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
- **Set the execution timezone**: Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](../../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](../../../../../workflows/settings/).
- **Use ISO 8601 format**: The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](../../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`.

## Outputting Date columns as date strings instead of ISO datetime strings

n8n's uses the [`pg` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to integrate with Postgres, which affects how n8n processes date, timestamp, and related types from Postgres.

The `pg` package parses `DATE` values into `new Date(row_value)` by default, which produces a date that follows the [ISO 8601 datetime string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) format. For example, a date of `2025-12-25` might produce a datetime sting of `2025-12-25T23:00:00.000Z` depending on the instance's timezone settings.

To work around this, use the [Postgres `TO_CHAR` function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html#FUNCTIONS-FORMATTING) to format the date into the expected format at query time:

```
SELECT TO_CHAR(date_col, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS date_col_as_date FROM table_with_date_col
```

This will produce the date as a string without the time or timezone components. To continue the earlier example, with this casting, a date of `2025-12-25` would produce the string `2025-12-25`. You can find out more in the [`pg` package documentation on dates](https://node-postgres.com/features/types#date--timestamp--timestamptz).

# Supabase node

Use the Supabase node to automate work in Supabase, and integrate Supabase with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Supabase features, including creating, deleting, and getting rows.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Supabase node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [Supabase credentials](../../credentials/supabase/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Operations

- Row
  - Create a new row
  - Delete a row
  - Get a row
  - Get all rows
  - Update a row

## Using custom schemas

By default, the Supabase node only fetches the `public` schema. To fetch [custom schemas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/using-custom-schemas), enable **Use Custom Schema**.

In the new **Schema** field, provide the custom schema the Supabase node should use.

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

# Supabase node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Supabase node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Filtering rows by metadata

To filter rows by [Supabase metadata](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata), set the **Select Type** to **String**.

From there, you can construct a query in the **Filters (String)** parameter to filter the metadata using the [Supabase metadata query language](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata#metadata-query-language), inspired by the [MongoDB selectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) format. Access the metadata properties using the [Postgres `->>` arrow JSON operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING) like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):

```
metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}
```

For example to access an `age` property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the **Filters (String)** field:

```
metadata->>age=gte.21
```

You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.

## Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker

When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Supabase is in Docker

If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](../../../credentials/supabase/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](../../../credentials/supabase/), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`.

## Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase

If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the [Postgres](../../n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policy.

Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public `anon` key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.

To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the `anon` role, [create a policy](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#creating-policies) to enable the access patterns you intend to use.

# Telegram node

# Telegram node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: `Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
1. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
1. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
1. Search for the bot's username and select it.
1. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

## Get the Chat ID

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
1. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
1. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
1. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
1. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](../message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
1. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
1. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](../message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.

1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

# WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [WhatsApp Business Cloud node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.

To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.

Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) or [set a fallback value](../../../../../code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.

## Working with non-text media

The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.

If your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.

For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to "n8n", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`.

# OpenAI node

Use the OpenAI node to automate work in OpenAI and integrate OpenAI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of OpenAI features, including creating images and assistants, as well as chatting with models.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenAI node supports and links to more resources.

Previous node versions

The OpenAI node replaces the OpenAI assistant node from version 1.29.0 on. n8n version 1.117.0 introduces V2 of the OpenAI node that supports the OpenAI Responses API and removes support for the [to-be-deprecated Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration).

1. Use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota

Quota issues

There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

- Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
- Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
- Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
- Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
- Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
- Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

In n8n:

- check that the [OpenAI credentials](../../../credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
- ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](../) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](../../../credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

## Referenced node is unexecuted

This error displays when a previous node in the workflow hasn't executed and isn't providing output that this node needs as input.

The full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

```
An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.
```

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that call JavaScript or other custom code, determine if a node has executed before trying to use the value by calling:

```
$("<node-name>").isExecuted
```

# OpenAI Text operations

Use this operation to message a model or classify text for violations in OpenAI. Refer to [OpenAI](../) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.

Previous node versions

n8n version 1.117.0 introduces the OpenAI node V2 that supports the OpenAI Responses API. It renames the 'Message a Model' operation to 'Generate a Chat Completion' to clarify its association with the Chat Completions API and introduces a separate 'Generate a Model Response' operation that uses the Responses API.

## Generate a Chat Completion

Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model - using the Chat Completions API - and receive a response.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Generate a Chat Completion**.
- **Model**: Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information.
- **Messages**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles:
  - **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.
  - **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.
  - **System**: By default, there is no system message. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can set more than one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.
- **Output Content as JSON**: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with `GPT-4 Turbo` and all `GPT-3.5 Turbo` models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

### Options

- **Frequency Penalty**: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.
- **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens.
- **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.

Refer to [Chat Completions | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) documentation for more information.

## Generate a Model Response

Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model - using the Responses API - and receive a response.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Generate a Model Response**.
- **Model**: Select the model you want to use. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for an overview.
- **Messages**: Choose from one of these a **Message Types**:
  - **Text**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles.
  - **Image**: Provide an **Image** either through an Image URL, a File ID (using the [OpenAI Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files)) or by passing binary data from an earlier node in your workflow.
  - **File**: Provide a **File** in a supported format (currently: PDF only), either through a File URL, a File ID (using the [OpenAI Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files)) or by passing binary data from an earlier node in your workflow.
  - For any message type, you can choose from one of these roles:
    - **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.
    - **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.
    - **System**: By default, the system message is `"You are a helpful assistant"`. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

### Built-in Tools

The OpenAI Responses API provides a range of [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) to enrich the model's response:

- **Web Search**: Allows models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.
- **MCP Servers**: Allows models to connect to remote MCP servers. Find out more about using remote MCP servers as tools [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
- **File Search**: Allow models to search your knowledgebase from previously uploaded files for relevant information before generating a response. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) for more information.
- **Code Interpreter**: Allows models to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment.

### Options

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Conversation ID**: The conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.
- **Previous Response ID**: The ID of the previous response to continue from. Can't be used in conjunction with Conversation ID.
- **Reasoning**: The level of reasoning effort the model should spend to generate the response. Includes the ability to return a **Summary** of the reasoning performed by the model (for example, for debugging purposes).
- **Store**: Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API. Defaults to `true`.
- **Output Format**: Whether to return the response as **Text**, in a specified **JSON Schema** or as a **JSON Object**.
- **Background**: Whether to run the model in [background mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background). This allows executing long-running tasks more reliably.

Refer to [Responses | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create) documentation for more information.

## Classify Text for Violations

Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing:

- `flagged`: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful.
- `categories`: A list of category-specific violation flags.
- `category_scores`: Scores for each category.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Classify Text for Violations**.
- **Text Input**: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy.
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

### Options

- **Use Stable Model**: Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower.

# Cluster nodes

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

## Root nodes

Each cluster starts with one [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n).

## Sub-nodes

Each root node can have one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) attached to it.

# Root nodes

Root nodes are the foundational nodes within a group of cluster nodes.

[Cluster nodes](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

# Basic LLM Chain node

Use the Basic LLM Chain node to set the prompt that the model will use along with setting an optional parser for the response.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Basic LLM Chain node and links to more resources.

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Basic LLM Chain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/basic-llm-chain/) page.

## Node parameters

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Chat Messages

Use **Chat Messages** when you're using a chat model to set a message.

n8n ignores these options if you don't connect a chat model. Select the **Type Name or ID** you want the node to use:

#### AI

Enter a sample expected response in the **Message** field. The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.

#### System

Enter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.

Use this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.

#### User

Enter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.

Select one of these input types:

- **Text**: Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.
- **Image (Binary)**: Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.
- **Image (URL)**: Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.

For both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:

- **Auto**: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.
- **Low**: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.
- **High**: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Basic LLM Chain node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this error in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and haven't entered anything in the **Text** field.
   - To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has no field called `chatInput`.
   - The node expects the `chatInput` field. If your previous node doesn't have this field, add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.

# Summarization Chain node

Use the Summarization Chain node to summarize multiple documents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Summarization Chain node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

Choose the type of data you need to summarize in **Data to Summarize**. The data type you choose determines the other node parameters.

- **Use Node Input (JSON)** and **Use Node Input (Binary)**: summarize the data coming into the node from the workflow.
  - You can configure the **Chunking Strategy**: choose what strategy to use to define the data chunk sizes.
    - If you choose **Simple (Define Below)** you can then set **Characters Per Chunk** and **Chunk Overlap (Characters)**.
    - Choose **Advanced** if you want to connect a splitter sub-node that provides more configuration options.
- **Use Document Loader**: summarize data provided by a document loader sub-node.

## Node Options

You can configure the summarization method and prompts. Select **Add Option** > **Summarization Method and Prompts**.

Options in **Summarization Method**:

- **Map Reduce**: this is the recommended option. Learn more about [Map Reduce](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce/) in the LangChain documentation.
- **Refine**: learn more about [Refine](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/refine/) in the LangChain documentation.
- **Stuff**: learn more about [Stuff](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff/) in the LangChain documentation.

You can customize the **Individual Summary Prompts** and the **Final Prompt to Combine**. There are examples in the node. You must include the `"{text}"` placeholder.

# LangChain Code node

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

Not available on Cloud

This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.

## Node parameters

### Add Code

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

- **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
- **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

### Inputs

Choose the input types.

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

### Outputs

Choose the output types.

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

# Information Extractor node

Use the Information Extractor node to extract structured information from incoming data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Information Extractor node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

- **Text** defines the input text to extract information from. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger, or `{{ $json.text }}` if a previous node is Extract from PDF.
- Use **Schema Type** to choose how you want to describe the desired output data format. You can choose between:
  - **From Attribute Descriptions**: This option allows you to define the schema by specifying the list of attributes and their descriptions.
  - **Generate From JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values. n8n treats every field as mandatory when generating schemas from JSON examples.
  - **Define using JSON Schema**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema.

## Node options

- **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the information extraction. n8n automatically appends format specification instructions to the prompt.

## Related resources

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

# Sentiment Analysis node

Use the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.

The language model uses the [**Sentiment Categories**](#node-options) in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.

## Node parameters

- **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.

## Node options

- **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.
  - By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.
- **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.
- **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
- **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

## Usage Notes

### Model Temperature Setting

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.

### Processing Large Volumes

When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.

### Iterative Refinement

For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.

## Example Usage

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.
1. Set the "Text to Analyze" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).
1. Keep the default sentiment categories.
1. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.

### Custom Category Analysis

1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.
1. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.
1. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.

# Text Classifier node

Use the Text Classifier node to classify (categorize) incoming data. Using the categories provided in the parameters (see below), each item is passed to the model to determine its category.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Text Classifier node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

- **Input Prompt** defines the input to classify. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger. By default it references the `text` field.
- **Categories**: Add the categories that you want to classify your input as. Categories have a name and a description. Use the description to tell the model what the category means. This is important if the meaning isn't obvious. You can add as many categories as you like.

## Node options

- **Allow Multiple Classes To Be True**: You can configure the classifier to always output a single class per item (turned off), or allow the model to select multiple classes (turned on).
- **When No Clear Match**: Define what happens if the model can't find a good match for an item. There are two options:
  - **Discard Item** (the default): If the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it drops the item.
  - **Output on Extra, 'Other' Branch**: Creates a separate output branch called **Other**. When the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it outputs items in this branch.
- **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the classification. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
- **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

# Azure AI Search Vector Store node

Azure AI Search (formerly Azure Cognitive Search) is a cloud search service with vector search capabilities for RAG and semantic search applications. Use this node to store, retrieve, and query vector embeddings alongside their content and metadata.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Azure AI Search Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/azureaisearch/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Prerequisites

Before using this node, you need:

1. An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com)
1. An [Azure AI Search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
1. API key authentication configured (admin key for write operations, query key for read-only)

See [credentials documentation](../../../credentials/azureaisearch/) for setup instructions.

### Index configuration

The node automatically creates indexes if they don't exist. When auto-creating, the node configures:

- Vector fields with appropriate dimensions based on your embeddings model
- HNSW algorithm for efficient similarity search with cosine metric
- Content and metadata fields for filtering and retrieval

You can also pre-create indexes in Azure Portal for custom configurations. Example schema:

```
{
  "name": "n8n-vectorstore",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "Edm.String",
      "key": true,
      "filterable": true
    },
    {
      "name": "content",
      "type": "Edm.String",
      "searchable": true
    },
    {
      "name": "content_vector",
      "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)",
      "searchable": true,
      "vectorSearchDimensions": 1536,
      "vectorSearchProfileName": "n8n-vector-profile"
    },
    {
      "name": "metadata",
      "type": "Edm.String",
      "filterable": true
    }
  ],
  "vectorSearch": {
    "profiles": [
      {
        "name": "n8n-vector-profile",
        "algorithm": "n8n-vector-algorithm"
      }
    ],
    "algorithms": [
      {
        "name": "n8n-vector-algorithm",
        "kind": "hnsw",
        "hnswParameters": {
          "metric": "cosine",
          "m": 4,
          "efConstruction": 400,
          "efSearch": 500
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Vector dimensions

The `vectorSearchDimensions` value must match your embeddings model output.

## Node usage patterns

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

Use the node directly in workflows to insert or retrieve documents without an agent. See [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) for an example pattern (uses Supabase, but the pattern is identical).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

Connect to an [AI agent's](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) tool connector to use the vector store as a searchable knowledge base:

AI agent (tools connector) → Azure AI Search Vector Store node

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

Use with [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) and [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) for retrieval-augmented generation:

Question and Answer Chain (Retriever) → Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store) → Azure AI Search Vector Store

See [this example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/).

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool

Use [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize and answer questions:

AI agent (tools) → Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store) → Azure AI Search Vector Store

See [this example](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/).

## Node parameters

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**, and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

### Rerank Results

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

Azure AI Search semantic reranking

Azure AI Search has built-in [semantic reranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview) available when you use **Semantic Hybrid** query mode with a semantic configuration. To use it:

1. Set **Query Mode** to **Semantic Hybrid** in Options
1. Set **Semantic Configuration** to your configuration name (defaults to `semantic-search-config` if not specified)

The built-in semantic reranker uses machine learning models to improve relevance. You can chain an additional reranking node after semantic reranking for further refinement.

[Semantic reranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview) is only available if your index has a semantic configuration defined.

### Get Many parameters

- **Endpoint**: Your Azure AI Search endpoint (format: `https://your-service.search.windows.net`)
- **Index Name**: The index to query
- **Limit**: Maximum documents to return (default: 4)

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Endpoint**: Your Azure AI Search endpoint
- **Index Name**: The index to use (created automatically if it doesn't exist)
- **Batch Size**: Number of documents uploaded per batch to Azure AI Search. Adjust based on document size and your service tier limits. This controls upload batching only—embedding generation batching is configured in embedding nodes.

### Update Documents parameters

- **Endpoint**: Your Azure AI Search endpoint
- **Index Name**: The index to update

### Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

- **Endpoint**: Your Azure AI Search endpoint
- **Index Name**: The index to query

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: Tool name shown to the LLM
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. Be specific to help the LLM choose when to use this tool.
- **Endpoint**: Your Azure AI Search endpoint
- **Index Name**: The index to query
- **Limit**: Maximum results to retrieve (e.g., `10` for ten best matches)

## Node options

### Options

- **Filter**: [OData filter expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-query-odata-filter) to filter results by document fields or metadata. See filter examples below.
- **Query Mode**: Search strategy to use:
- **Vector**: Similarity search using embeddings only
- **Keyword**: Full-text search using BM25 ranking
- **Hybrid** (default): Combines vector and keyword search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
- **Semantic Hybrid**: Hybrid search with [semantic reranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview) for improved relevance
- **Semantic Configuration**: Name of the semantic configuration to use for [semantic ranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview). Defaults to `semantic-search-config` if not specified. Only required if you pre-created an index with a custom semantic configuration name.

Query mode selection

Use **Vector** for semantic similarity, **Keyword** for exact term matching, **Hybrid** for balanced results, or **Semantic Hybrid** when you've configured semantic search in your index for maximum relevance.

### OData filter examples

Azure AI Search uses [OData syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-query-odata-filter) for filtering. Metadata fields are accessed using `metadata/fieldName` format.

**Filter by document ID:**

```
id eq '3da6491a-f930-4a4e-9471-c05dcd450ba0'
```

**Filter by metadata field:**

```
metadata/source eq 'user-guide'
```

**Complex AND filter:**

```
metadata/category eq 'technology' and metadata/author eq 'John'
```

**Complex OR filter:**

```
metadata/source eq 'user-guide' or metadata/rating ge 4
```

**Numeric comparison:**

```
metadata/rating ge 4 and metadata/rating lt 10
```

**String matching with NOT:**

```
metadata/category eq 'technology' and metadata/title ne 'Deprecated'
```

**Supported OData operators:**

- Comparison: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`
- String functions: `startswith()`, `endswith()`, `contains()`
- Collection functions: `any()`, `all()`

Filter format

Filters work across all query modes (Vector, Keyword, Hybrid, Semantic Hybrid) and all operation modes (retrieve, load, retrieve-as-tool).

## Azure AI Search specific features

### Hybrid search with RRF

Azure AI Search's hybrid search uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion to merge vector and keyword results, providing better accuracy than either method alone.

### [Semantic ranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview)

Semantic Hybrid mode applies machine learning models to rerank results based on semantic understanding of your query. This requires a semantic configuration in your index.

### OData filters

Use OData syntax to filter by document fields or metadata before vector search executes. This improves performance and precision when you need results from specific sources or with certain attributes.

### HNSW algorithm

Azure AI Search uses Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs for approximate nearest neighbor search, providing fast retrieval at scale with configurable accuracy/speed tradeoffs.

## Troubleshooting

### Index issues

**Index not found**: Verify the index name is correct (case-sensitive) and exists in your Azure AI Search service. If using auto-creation, check that the index was created successfully.

**Vector dimension mismatch**: Ensure your embedding model dimensions match the index vector field dimensions. Check the index schema to confirm the `vectorSearchDimensions` setting.

**Document insert failures**:

- Verify write permissions (admin API key required)
- Check document fields match your index schema
- Ensure required fields are provided in documents
- Review batch size settings if experiencing timeouts with large document sets

### Filter issues

**Filter not working**:

- Verify OData syntax is correct
- Ensure metadata fields use `metadata/` prefix: `metadata/source eq 'value'`
- Check that filtered fields are marked as `filterable` in your index schema
- Test with simple filters first (`id eq 'value'`) before complex expressions

**Invalid OData syntax**:

- Use single quotes for string values: `metadata/source eq 'value'`
- Use proper operators: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `and`, `or`, `not`
- Refer to [OData filter documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-query-odata-filter) for syntax details

### Connection issues

**Unable to connect**:

- Verify endpoint URL format: `https://your-service.search.windows.net`
- Confirm your Azure AI Search service is running and accessible
- Check network security groups, firewall rules, and private endpoint configurations
- For Azure-hosted n8n, verify virtual network peering or service endpoint configuration if using private endpoints

### Authentication issues

For authentication troubleshooting including API key errors, refer to the [credentials documentation troubleshooting section](../../../credentials/azureaisearch/#troubleshooting).

# Simple Vector Store node

Use the Simple Vector Store node to store and retrieve [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) in n8n's in-app memory.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Simple Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

This node is different from AI memory nodes

The simple vector storage described here is different to the AI memory nodes such as [Simple Memory](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/).

This node creates a [vector database](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) in the app memory.

## Data safety limitations

Before using the Simple Vector Store node, it's important to understand its limitations and how it works.

Warning

n8n recommends using Simple Vector store for development use only.

### Vector store data isn't persistent

This node stores data in memory only. All data is lost when n8n restarts and may also be purged in low-memory conditions.

### All instance users can access vector store data

Memory keys for the Simple Vector Store node are global, not scoped to individual workflows.

This means that all users of the instance can access vector store data by adding a Simple Vector Store node and selecting the memory key, regardless of the access controls set for the original workflow. Take care not to expose sensitive information when ingesting data with the Simple Vector Store node.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Simple Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Simple Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Simple Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of in step 2 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Simple Vector Store node directly to the [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Simple Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Simple Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Simple Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Simple Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Simple Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

## Memory Management

The Simple Vector Store implements memory management to prevent excessive memory usage:

- Automatically cleans up old vector stores when memory pressure increases
- Removes inactive stores that haven't been accessed for a configurable amount of time

### Configuration Options

You can control memory usage with these environment variables:

| Variable                      | Type   | Default | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N8N_VECTOR_STORE_MAX_MEMORY` | Number | -1      | Maximum memory in MB allowed for all vector stores combined (-1 to disable limits). |
| `N8N_VECTOR_STORE_TTL_HOURS`  | Number | -1      | Hours of inactivity after which a store gets removed (-1 to disable TTL).           |

On n8n Cloud, these values are preset to 100MB (about 8,000 documents, depending on document size and metadata) and 7 days respectively. For self-hosted instances, both values default to -1(no memory limits or time-based cleanup).

## Node parameters

### Operation Mode

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Memory Key**: Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.

# MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is a feature of MongoDB Atlas that enables users to store and query vector embeddings. Use this node to interact with Vector Search indexes in your MongoDB Atlas collections. You can insert documents, retrieve documents, and use the vector store in chains or as a tool for agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mongodb/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Prerequisites

Before using this node, create a [Vector Search index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/) in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Follow these steps to create one:

1. Log in to the [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

1. Select your organization and project.

1. Find "Search & Vector Search" section.

1. Select your cluster and click "Go to search".

1. Click "Create Search Index".

1. Choose "Vector Search" mode and use the visual or JSON editors. For example:

   ```
   {
     "fields": [
       {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": "<field-name>",
         "numDimensions": 1536, // any other value
         "similarity": "<similarity-function>"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

1. Adjust the "dimensions" value according to your embedding model (For example, `1536` for OpenAI's `text-embedding-small-3`).

1. Name your index and create.

Make sure to note the following values which are required when configuring the node:

- Collection name
- Vector index name
- Field names for embeddings and metadata

## Node usage patterns

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node in the following patterns:

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use the vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node to fetch documents from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarize data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the In-Memory Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store.

## Node parameters

### Operation Mode

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

# PGVector Vector Store node

PGVector is an extension of Postgresql. Use this node to interact with the PGVector tables in your Postgresql database. You can insert documents into a vector table, get documents from a vector table, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the PGVector node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/postgres/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the PGVector Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the PGVector Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the PGVector Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the PGVector Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> PGVector Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the PGVector Vector Store node to fetch documents from the PGVector Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> PGVector Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the PGVector Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the PGVector Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the Simple Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

## Node parameters

### Operation Mode

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Table name**: Enter the name of the table you want to query.
- **Prompt**: Enter your search query.
- **Limit**: Enter a number to set how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Table name**: Enter the name of the table you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

- **Table name**: Enter the name of the table you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Table Name**: Enter the PGVector table to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options

### Collection

A way to separate datasets in PGVector. This creates a separate table and column to keep track of which collection a vector belongs to.

- **Use Collection**: Select whether to use a collection (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Collection Name**: Enter the name of the collection you want to use.
- **Collection Table Name**: Enter the name of the table to store collection information in.

### Column Names

The following options specify the names of the columns to store the vectors and corresponding information in:

- **ID Column Name**
- **Vector Column Name**
- **Content Column Name**
- **Metadata Column Name**

### Metadata Filter

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

# Redis Vector Store node

Use the Redis Vector Store node to interact with your Redis database as a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into the vector database, get documents from the vector database, retrieve documents using a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Redis Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/redis/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Prerequisites

Before using this node, you need a Redis database with the [Redis Query Engine](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) enabled. Use one of the following:

- **Redis Open Source (v8.0 and later)** : includes the Redis Query Engine by default
- **[Redis Cloud](https://cloud.redis.io/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs)** : fully managed service
- **[Redis Software](https://redis.io/software/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs)** : self-managed deployment

A new index will be created if you don't have one.

Creating your own indices in advance is only necessary if you want to use a custom index schema or reuse an existing index. Otherwise, you can skip this step and let the node create a new index for you based on the options you specify.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Redis Vector Store node in the following patterns:

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Redis Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Redis Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example in [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/10887-reduce-llm-costs-with-semantic-caching-using-redis-vector-store-and-huggingface/) where the semantic cache is stored in Redis and retrieved using the Redis Vector Store node in the start of the workflow.

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Redis Vector Store node directly to the [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Redis Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Redis Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Redis Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Redis Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Redis Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Redis Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

This [template](https://n8n.io/workflows/10837-chat-with-github-issues-using-openai-and-redis-vector-search/) shows how to use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool with the Redis Vector Store node. The connections flow in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Redis Vector store.

## Node parameters

### Operation Mode

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter).

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter).

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Include Metadata

Whether to include document metadata.

You can use this with the [Get Many](#get-many-parameters) and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) modes.

## Node options

### Metadata Filter

Metadata filters are available for the [Get Many](#get-many-parameters), [Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool-parameters), and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) operation modes. This is an `OR` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, at least one of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

### Redis Configuration Options

Available for all operation modes:

- **Metadata Key**: Enter the key for the metadata field in the Redis hash (default: `metadata`).
- **Key Prefix**: Enter the key prefix for storing documents (default: `doc:`).
- **Content Key**: Enter the key for the content field in the Redis hash (default: `content`).
- **Embedding Key**: Enter the key for the embedding field in the Redis hash (default: `embedding`).

### Insert Options

Available for the [Insert Documents](#insert-documents-parameters) operation mode:

- **Overwrite Documents**: Select whether to overwrite existing documents (turned on) or not (turned off). Also deletes the index.
- **Time-to-Live**: Enter the time-to-live for documents in seconds. Does not expire the index.

# Supabase Vector Store node

Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as vector store. You can insert documents into a vector database, get many documents from a vector database, and retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain.

Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool). You can also update an item in a vector store by its ID.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Supabase node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/supabase/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Supabase provides a [quickstart for setting up your vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql). If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Supabase Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Supabase Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Supabase Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Supabase Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Supabase Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Supabase Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Supabase Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Supabase Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Supabase Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector store.

## Node parameters

### Operation Mode

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**, and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

### Rerank Results

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.

- **ID**: The ID of an embedding entry.

Parameters for **Update Documents**

- ID

## Node options

### Query Name

The name of the matching function you set up in Supabase. If you follow the [Supabase quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql), this will be `match_documents`.

### Metadata Filter

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

When searching for data, use this to match metadata associated with documents. You can learn more about the operators and query structure in [Weaviate's conditional filters documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql/filters#filter-structure).

You can use both `AND` and `OR` with different operators. Operators are case insensitive:

```
{
  "OR": [
    {
        "path": ["source"],
        "operator": "Equal",
        "valueString": "source1"
    },
    {
        "path": ["source"],
        "operator": "Equal",
        "valueString": "source1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported operators:

# Zep Vector Store node

Deprecated

This node is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.

Use the Zep Vector Store to interact with Zep vector databases. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Zep Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/zep/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Zep Vector Store integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/zep-vector-store/) page.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store.

## Node parameters

### Operation Mode

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to store the data in.

### Get Many parameters

- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options

### Embedding Dimensions

Must be the same when embedding the data and when querying it.

This sets the size of the array of floats used to represent the semantic meaning of a text document.

### Is Auto Embedded

Available in the **Insert Documents** Operation Mode, enabled by default.

Disable this to configure your embeddings in Zep instead of in n8n.

### Metadata Filter

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

# AI Agent node

An [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself. This agent uses external [tools](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task.

Connect a tool

You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](../../sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.

Agent type

Prior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent had a setting for working as different agent types. This has now been removed and all AI Agent nodes work as a `Tools Agent` which was the recommended and most frequently used setting. If you're working with older versions of the AI Agent in workflows or templates, as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent', they should continue to behave as intended with the updated node.

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# AI Agent node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [AI Agent node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'

A full error message might look like this:

```
Internal error
Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null.
<stack-trace>
```

This error can occur if the **Prompt** input contains a null value.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
   - To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
   - To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## Error in sub-node Simple Memory

This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Simple Memory](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) sub-node.

It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Simple memory node (previously known as "Window Buffer Memory").

Try removing the Simple Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.

## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.

To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.

## No prompt specified error

This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/).

To resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text.

# Conversational AI Agent node

Feature removed

n8n removed this functionality in February 2025.

The Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

The Conversational Agent describes [tools](../../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](../tools-agent/).

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

## Node parameters

Configure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options

Refine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message

Tell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.

You must include these expressions and variable:

- `{tools}`: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.
- `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.
- `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.

Here's an example of how you might use these strings:

Example:

```
TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:

{tools}

{format_instructions}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{input}}
```

### System Message

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Max Iterations

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

Defaults to `10`.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).

# OpenAI Functions Agent node

Use the OpenAI Functions Agent node to use an [OpenAI functions model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). These are models that detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

OpenAI Chat Model required

You must use the [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/) with this agent.

## Node parameters

Configure the OpenAI Functions Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options

Refine the OpenAI Functions Agent node's behavior using these options:

### System Message

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Max Iterations

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

Defaults to `10`.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).

# Plan and Execute Agent node

The Plan and Execute Agent is like the [ReAct agent](../react-agent/) but with a focus on planning. It first creates a high-level plan to solve the given task and then executes the plan step by step. This agent is most useful for tasks that require a structured approach and careful planning.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

## Node parameters

Configure the Plan and Execute Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.

- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options

Refine the Plan and Execute Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message Template

Enter a message that n8n will send to the agent during each step execution.

Available LangChain expressions:

- `{previous_steps}`: Contains information about the previous steps the agent's already completed.
- `{current_step}`: Contains information about the current step.
- `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).

# ReAct AI Agent node

Feature removed

n8n removed this functionality in February 2025.

The ReAct Agent node implements [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) logic. ReAct (reasoning and acting) brings together the reasoning powers of chain-of-thought prompting and action plan generation.

The ReAct Agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

No memory

The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.

## Node parameters

Configure the ReAct Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options

Use the options to create a message to send to the agent at the start of the conversation. The message type depends on the model you're using:

- **Chat models**: These models have the concept of three components interacting (AI, system, and human). They can receive system messages and human messages (prompts).
- **Instruct models**: These models don't have the concept of separate AI, system, and human components. They receive one body of text, the instruct message.

### Human Message Template

Use this option to extend the user prompt. This is a way for the agent to pass information from one iteration to the next.

Available LangChain expressions:

- `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
- `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

### Prefix Message

Enter text to prefix the tools list at the start of the conversation. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Chat Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a chat model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Regular Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a regular/instruct model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

# SQL AI Agent node

Feature removed

n8n removed this functionality in February 2025.

The SQL Agent uses a SQL database as a data source. It can understand natural language questions, convert them into SQL queries, execute the queries, and present the results in a user-friendly format. This agent is valuable for building natural language interfaces to databases.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

## Node parameters

Configure the SQL Agent using the following parameters.

### Data Source

Choose the database to use as a data source for the node. Options include:

- **MySQL**: Select this option to use a MySQL database.
  - Also select the **Credential for MySQL**.
- **SQLite**: Select this option to use a SQLite database.
  - You must add a [Read/Write File From Disk](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node before the Agent to read your SQLite file.
  - Also enter the **Input Binary Field** name of your SQLite file coming from the Read/Write File From Disk node.
- **Postgres**: Select this option to use a Postgres database.
  - Also select the **Credential for Postgres**.

Postgres and MySQL Agents

If you are using [Postgres](../../../../credentials/postgres/) or [MySQL](../../../../credentials/mysql/), this agent doesn't support the credential tunnel options.

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

## Node options

Refine the SQL Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Ignored Tables

If you'd like the node to ignore any tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables you'd like it to ignore.

If left empty, the agent doesn't ignore any tables.

### Include Sample Rows

Enter the number of sample rows to include in the prompt to the agent. Default is `3`.

Sample rows help the agent understand the schema of the database, but they also increase the number of tokens used.

### Included Tables

If you'd only like to include specific tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables to include.

If left empty, the agent includes all tables.

### Prefix Prompt

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent before the **Prompt** text. This initial message can provide more context and guidance to the agent about what it can and can't do, and how to format the response.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Suffix Prompt

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent after the **Prompt** text.

Available LangChain expressions:

- `{chatHistory}`: A history of messages in this conversation, useful for maintaining context.
- `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
- `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Limit

Enter the maximum number of results to return.

Default is `10`.

# Tools AI Agent node

The Tools Agent uses external [tools](../../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.

This agent has an enhanced ability to work with tools and can ensure a standard output format.

The Tools Agent implements [Langchain's tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) interface. This interface describes available tools and their schemas. The agent also has improved output parsing capabilities, as it passes the parser to the model as a formatting tool.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

This agent supports the following chat models:

- [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/)
- [Groq Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgroq/)
- [Mistral Cloud Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatmistralcloud/)
- [Anthropic Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatanthropic/)
- [Azure OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatazureopenai/)

The Tools Agent can use the following tools...

- [Call n8n Workflow](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/)

## Node parameters

Configure the Tools Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options

Refine the Tools Agent node's behavior using these options:

### System Message

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Max Iterations

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

Defaults to `10`.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

### Automatically Passthrough Binary Images

Use this option to control whether binary images should be automatically passed through to the agent as image type messages (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Enable Streaming

When enabled, the AI Agent sends data back to the user in real-time as it generates the answer. This is useful for long-running generations. This is enabled by default.

Streaming requirements

For streaming to work, your workflow must use a trigger that supports streaming responses, such as the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) or [Webhook](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node with **Response Mode** set to **Streaming**.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Dynamic parameters for tools with `$fromAI()`

To learn how to dynamically populate parameters for app node tools, refer to [Let AI specify tool parameters with `$fromAI()`](../../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Human review for tool calls

You can require human approval before the AI Agent executes specific tools. This is useful for tools that perform sensitive actions like sending messages, modifying records, or deleting data.

To add a human review step:

1. Click the tool connector on the AI Agent node.
1. In the Tools Panel, find the **Human review** section.
1. Select your preferred approval channel (Chat, Slack, Telegram, and more) and configure it.
1. Connect the tools that require approval to the human review step.

When the AI wants to use a gated tool, the workflow pauses and sends an approval request through your chosen channel. The recipient can approve (tool executes) or deny (action canceled).

For detailed setup instructions and best practices, refer to [Human-in-the-loop for AI tool calls](../../../../../../advanced-ai/human-in-the-loop-tools/).

## Common issues

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Question and Answer Chain node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Question and Answer Chain node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
   - To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
   - Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
   - To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.
   - Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.

To resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.

## Can't produce longer responses

If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:

- **Connect a more verbose model**: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.
- **Increase the maximum number of tokens**: Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.
- **Build larger responses in stages**: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/).

# Sub nodes

Sub nodes attach to root nodes within a group of cluster nodes. They configure the overall functionality of the cluster.

[Cluster nodes](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

# Default Data Loader node

Use the Default Data Loader node to load binary data files or JSON data for [vector stores](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) or summarization.

On this page, you'll find a list of parameters the Default Data Loader node supports, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

- **Text Splitting**: Choose from:
  - **Simple**: Uses the [Recursive Character Text Splitter](../n8n-nodes-langchain.textsplitterrecursivecharactertextsplitter/) with a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200.
  - **Custom**: Allows you to connect a text splitter of your choice.
- **Type of Data**: Select **Binary** or **JSON**.
- **Mode**: Choose from:
  - **Load All Input Data**: Use all the node's input data.
  - **Load Specific Data**: Use [expressions](../../../../../code/expressions/) to define the data you want to load. You can add text as well as expressions. This means you can create a custom document from a mix of text and expressions.
- **Data Format**: Displays when you set **Type of Data** to **Binary**. Select the file MIME type for your binary data. Set to **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** if you want n8n to set the data format for you. If you set a specific data format and the incoming file MIME type doesn't match it, the node errors. If you use **Automatically Detect by MIME Type**, the node falls back to text format if it can't match the file MIME type to a supported data format.

## Node options

- **Metadata**: Set the metadata that should accompany the document in the vector store. This is what you match to using the **Metadata Filter** option when retrieving data using the vector store nodes.

# Embeddings Google PaLM node

Use the Embeddings Google PaLM node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google PaLM node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/googleai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

n8n dynamically loads models from the Google PaLM API and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Limitations

### No proxy support

The Google Gemini Chat Model node uses Google's SDK, which doesn't support proxy configuration.

If you need to proxy your connection, as a work around, you can set up a dedicated reverse proxy for Gemini requests and change the **Host** parameter in your [Google Gemini credentials](../../../credentials/googleai/) to point to your proxy address:

# Google Vertex Chat Model node

Use the Google Vertex AI Chat Model node to use Google's Vertex AI chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Google Vertex AI Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/google/service-account/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

- **Project ID**: Select the project ID from your Google Cloud account to use. n8n dynamically loads projects from the Google Cloud account, but you can also enter it manually.
- **Model Name**: Select the name of the model to use to generate the completion, for example `gemini-1.5-flash-001`, `gemini-1.5-pro-001`, etc. Refer to [Google models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) for a list of available models.

## Node options

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Thinking Budget**: Controls reasoning tokens for thinking models. Set to `0` to disable automatic thinking. Set to `-1` for dynamic thinking. Leave empty for auto mode.
- **Top K**: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.
- **Safety Settings**: Gemini supports adjustable safety settings. Refer to Google's [Gemini API safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting_gemini) for information on the available filters and levels.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one MongoDB Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

# Motorhead node

Use the Motorhead node to use Motorhead as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Motorhead node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/motorhead/).

## Node parameters

- **Session ID**: Enter the ID to use to store the memory in the workflow data.

## Node reference

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

This page covers node parameters for the Model Selector node and includes links to related resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results.

## Node parameters

### Number of Inputs

Specifies the number of input connections available for attaching language models.

### Rules

Each rule defines the model to use when specific conditions match.

The Model Selector node evaluates rules sequentially, starting from the first input, and stops evaluation as soon as it finds a match. This means that if multiple rules would match, n8n will only use the model defined by the first matching rule.

For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

- **Chunk Size**: Enter the number of characters in each chunk.
- **Chunk Overlap**: Enter how much overlap to have between chunks.

# AI Agent Tool node

The AI Agent Tool node allows a root-level [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) in your workflow to call other agents as tools to simplify multi-agent orchestration.

The [primary agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) can supervise and delegate work to AI Agent Tool nodes that specialize in different tasks and knowledge. This allows you to use multiple agents in a single workflow without the complexity of managing context and variables that sub-workflows require. You can nest AI Agent Tool nodes into multiple layers for more complex multi-tiered use cases.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the AI Agent Tool node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

Configure the AI Agent Tool node using these parameters:

- **Description**: Give a description to the LLM of this agent's purpose and scope of responsibility. A good, specific description tells the parent agent when to delegate tasks to this agent for processing.
- **Prompt (User Message)**: The prompt to the LLM explaining what actions to perform and what information to return.
- **Require Specific Output Format**: Whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of the output parsers [described on the main agent page](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/#require-specific-output-format).
- **Enable Fallback Model**: Whether to enable a fallback model. When enabled, n8n prompts you to connect a backup chat model to use in case the primary model fails or isn't available.

## Node options

Refine the AI Agent Tool node's behavior using these options:

- **System Message**: A message to send to the agent before the conversation starts.
- **Max Iterations**: The maximum number of times the model should run to generate a response before stopping.
- **Return Intermediate Steps**: Whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output.
- **Automatically Passthrough Binary Images**: Whether binary images should be automatically passed through to the agent as image type messages.
- **Batch Processing**: Whether to enable the following batch processing options for rate limiting:
  - **Batch Size**: The number of items to process in parallel. This helps with rate limiting but may impact the log output ordering.
  - **Delay Between Batches**: The number of milliseconds to wait between batches.

# HTTP Request Tool node

Legacy tool version

New instances of the HTTP Request tool node that you add to workflows use the standard [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node as a tool. This page is describes the legacy, standalone HTTP Request tool node.

You can identify which tool version is in your workflow by checking if the node has an **Add option** property when you open the node on the canvas. If that button is present, you're using the new version, not the one described on this page.

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node Options

- **Number of Results**: The number of results to retrieve. The default is 10.
- **Page Number**: The page number of the search results to retrieve. The default is 1.
- **Language**: A two-letter [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) to filter search results by language. For example: `en` for English, `fr` for French. The default is `en`.
- **Safe Search**: Enables or disables filtering explicit content in the search results. Can be None, Moderate, or Strict. The default is None.

## Running a SearXNG instance

This node requires running the SearXNG service on the same network as your n8n instance. Ensure your n8n instance has network access to the SearXNG service.

This node requires results in JSON format, which isn't enabled in the default SearXNG configuration. To enable JSON output, add `json` to the `search.formats` section of your SearXNG instance's `settings.yml` file:

```
search:
  # options available for formats: [html, csv, json, rss]
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

If the `formats` section isn't there, add it. The exact location of the `settings.yml` file depends on how you installed SearXNG. You can find more by visiting the [SearXNG configuration documentation](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation-searxng.html#configuration).

The quality and availability of search results depend on the configuration and health of the SearXNG instance you use.

### Prompting example

As an example, say you ask the agent:

> *Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we don't know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?*

The agent will do its thinking with the tool:

> *We have the following information: 1. Jack is looking at Anne. 2. Anne is looking at George. 3. Jack is married. 4. George is not married. 5. We don't know if Anne is married or not.*
>
> *We need to determine if a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Let's consider both cases for Anne:*
>
> *Case 1: Anne is married.*
>
> - *If Anne is married, then she (married) is looking at George (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George).*
>
> *Case 2: Anne is unmarried.*
>
> - *If Anne is unmarried, then Jack (married) is looking at Anne (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne).*
>
> *In both scenarios, we find that a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.*

and then afterward provide the answer:

> *Yes, a married person is looking at an unmarried person. In both possible scenarios regarding Anne's marital status, we find that a married individual (either Jack or Anne) is looking at an unmarried individual (either George or Anne).*

## Node parameters

### Description of Data

Enter a description of the data in the vector store.

### Limit

The maximum number of results to return.

## How n8n populates the tool description

n8n uses the node name (select the name to edit) and **Description of Data** parameter to populate the tool description for AI agents using the following format:

> Useful for when you need to answer questions about [node name]. Whenever you need information about [Description of Data], you should ALWAYS use this. Input should be a fully formed question.

Spaces in the node name are converted to underscores in the tool description.

Avoid special characters in node names

Using special characters in the node name will cause errors when the agent runs:

Use only alphanumeric characters, spaces, dashes, and underscores in node names.

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

# Call n8n Workflow Tool node

The Call n8n Workflow Tool node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to run another n8n workflow and fetch its output data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Call n8n Workflow Tool node, and links to more resources.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

### Description

Enter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

### Source

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

- **Database** to select the workflow from a list or enter a workflow ID.
- **Define Below** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](../../../../../workflows/export-import/).

### Workflow Inputs

When using **Database** as workflow source, once you choose a sub-workflow (and define the **Workflow Input Schema** in the sub-workflow), you can define the **Workflow Inputs**.

Select the **Refresh** button to pull in the input fields from the sub-workflow.

You can define the workflow input values using any combination of the following options:

- providing fixed values
- using expressions to reference data from the current workflow
- [letting the AI model specify the parameter](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/) by selecting the button AI button on the right side of the field
- using the [`$fromAI()` function](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/#use-the-fromai-function) in expressions to control the way the model fills in data and to mix AI generated input with other custom input

To reference data from the current workflow, drag fields from the input panel to the field with the Expressions mode selected.

To get started with the `$fromAI()` function, select the "Let the model define this parameter" button on the right side of the field and then use the **X** on the box to revert to user-defined values. The field will change to an expression field pre-populated with the `$fromAI()` expression. From here, you can customize the expression to add other static or dynamic content, or tweak the `$fromAI()` function parameters.

# Ollama Chat Model node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Chat Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Chat Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Chat Model node supports Bearer token authentication for connecting to remote Ollama instances behind authenticated proxies (such as Open WebUI).

For remote authenticated connections, configure both the remote URL and API key in your Ollama credentials.

Follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](../../../../credentials/ollama/) for more information.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

```
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies

Ollama doesn't support custom HTTP agents in its configuration. This makes it difficult to use Ollama behind custom HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Depending on your proxy configuration, it might not work at all, despite setting the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

Refer to [Ollama's FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-use-ollama-behind-a-proxy) for more information.

# OpenAI Chat Model node

Use the OpenAI Chat Model node to use OpenAI's chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenAI Chat Model node and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

### Model

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenAI, and you'll only see the models available to your account.

### Use Responses API

OpenAI provides two endpoints for generating output from a model:

- **Chat Completions**: The Chat Completions API endpoint generates a model response from a list of messages that comprise a conversation. The API requires the user to handle conversation state manually, for example by adding a [Simple Memory](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) subnode. For new projects, OpenAI recommends to use the Responses API.
- **Responses**: The Responses API is an agentic loop, allowing the model to call multiple built-in tools within the span of one API request. It also supports persistent conversations by passing a `conversation_id`.

Toggle to **Use Responses API** if you want the model to generate output using the Responses API. Otherwise, the OpenAI Chat Model node will default to using the Chat Completions API.

Refer to the OpenAI documentation for a [comparison of the Chat Completions and Responses APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/migrate-to-responses).

### Built-in Tools

The OpenAI Responses API provides a range of [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) to enrich the model's response. Toggle to **Use Responses API** if you want the model to have access to the following built-in tools:

- **Web Search**: Allows models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.
- **File Search**: Allow models to search your knowledgebase from previously uploaded files for relevant information before generating a response. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) for more information.
- **Code Interpreter**: Allows models to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment.

Use with AI Agent node

Built-in tools are only supported when using the OpenAI Chat Model node in combination with the AI Agent node. Built-in tools aren't available when using the OpenAI Chat Model node in combination with a Basic LLM Chain node, for example.

## Node options

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior. The following options are available whether you use the Responses API to generate model output or not.

### Frequency Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

### Presence Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

### Timeout

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

### Max Retries

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

### Top P

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

## Additional node options (Responses API only)

The following, additional options are available when toggling to **Use Responses API**.

### Conversation ID

The conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.

### Prompt Cache Key

Use this key for caching similar requests to optimize cache hit rates.

### Safety Identifier

Apply an identifier to track users who may violate usage policies.

### Service Tier

Select the service tier that fits your needs: Auto, Flex, Default, or Priority.

### Metadata

A set of key-value pairs for storing structured information. You can attach up to 16 pairs to an object, which is useful for adding custom data that can be used for searching by the API or in the dashboard.

### Top Logprobs

Define an integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

### Output Format

Choose a response format: Text, JSON Schema, or JSON Object. Use of JSON Schema is recommended, if you want to receive data in JSON format.

### Prompt

Configure the prompt filled with a unique ID, its version, and substitutable variables. Prompts are configured through the OpenAI dashboard.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help.

1. Use the [HTTP Request](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota

Quota issues

There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

- Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
- Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
- Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
- Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
- Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
- Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

In n8n:

- check that the [OpenAI credentials](../../../../credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
- ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](../../../../credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

This node lacks tools support, so it won't work with the [AI Agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node. Instead, connect it with the [Basic LLM Chain](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) node.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/ollama/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

- **Model**: Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from:
  - **Llama2**
  - **Llama2 13B**
  - **Llama2 70B**
  - **Llama2 Uncensored**

Refer to the Ollama [Models Library documentation](https://ollama.com/library) for more information about available models.

## Node options

- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Top K**: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

# Ollama Model node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Model node supports Bearer token authentication for connecting to remote Ollama instances behind authenticated proxies (such as Open WebUI).

For remote authenticated connections, configure both the remote URL and API key in your Ollama credentials.

Follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](../../../../credentials/ollama/) for more information.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

```
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies

Ollama doesn't support custom HTTP agents in its configuration. This makes it difficult to use Ollama behind custom HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Depending on your proxy configuration, it might not work at all, despite setting the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

Refer to [Ollama's FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-use-ollama-behind-a-proxy) for more information.

# Simple Memory node

Use the Simple Memory node to [persist](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) chat history in your workflow.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Simple Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

Don't use this node if running n8n in queue mode

If your n8n instance uses [queue mode](../../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/), this node doesn't work in an active production workflow. This is because n8n can't guarantee that every call to Simple Memory will go to the same worker.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

Configure these parameters to configure the node:

- **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
- **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

# Simple Memory node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Simple Memory node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Simple Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Managing the Session ID

In most cases, the `sessionId` is automatically retrieved from the **On Chat Message** trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase `No sessionId`.

If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a `sessionId`.

If you're not using the **On Chat Message** trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.

For testing purposes, you can use a static key like `my_test_session`. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before publishing the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.

# Structured Output Parser node

Use the Structured Output Parser node to return fields based on a JSON Schema.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Structured Output Parser node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters

- **Schema Type**: Define the output structure and validation. You have two options to provide the schema:

1. **Generate from JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values. n8n treats every field as mandatory when generating schemas from JSON examples.
1. **Define using JSON Schema**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema. Please note that we don't support references (using `$ref`) in JSON schemas.

# Structured Output Parser node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Structured Output Parser node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Structured Output Parser node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes

You can attach output parser nodes to select [AI root nodes](../../../root-nodes/).

To add the Structured Output Parser to a node, enable the **Require Specific Output Format** option in the AI root node you wish to format. Once the option is enabled, a new **output parser** attachment point is displayed. Click the **output parser** attachment point to add the Structured Output Parser node to the node.

## Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps

The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages.

To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the **System Message** for the **AI Agent**. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results.

## Structuring output from agents

Structured output parsing is often not reliable when working with [agents](../../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/).

If your workflow uses agents, n8n recommends using a separate [LLM-chain](../../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) to receive the data from the agent and parse it. This leads to better, more consistent results than parsing directly in the agent workflow.

# Core nodes library

This section provides information about n8n's core [nodes](../../../glossary/#node-n8n).

# Activation Trigger node

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

Warning

n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/) and the [Workflow Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger/). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.

Keep in mind

If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters

- Events
  - **Activation**: Run when the workflow gets published
  - **Start**: Run when n8n starts or restarts
  - **Update**: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active

# Aggregate

Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

## Node parameters

To begin using the node, select the **Aggregate** you'd like to use:

- [**Individual Fields**](#individual-fields): Aggregate individual fields separately.
- [**All Item Data**](#all-item-data): Aggregate all item data into a single list.

### Individual Fields

- **Input Field Name**: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
- **Rename Field**: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
  - **Output Field Name**: This field is displayed when you turn on **Rename Field**. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

### All Item Data

- **Put Output in Field**: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
- **Include**: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
  - **All fields**: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
  - **Specified Fields**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
  - **All Fields Except**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

## Node options

You can further configure this node using these **Options**:

- **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
- **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
- **Include Binaries**: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
- **Keep Missing And Null Values**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.

# Compare Datasets

The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.

## Node parameters

1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
1. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.
1. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:
   - **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
   - **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
   - **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.
     - Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.
     - Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
   - **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
1. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.

## Understand item comparison

Item comparison is a two stage process:

1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
1. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.

## Node options

Use the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.

### Fields to Skip Comparing

Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.

For example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.

```
	// Input 1
	[
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Stefan",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Jim",
				"language":	"en"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Hans",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		}
	]
	// Input 2
		[
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Sara",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Jane",
				"language":	"en"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Harriet",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		}
	]
```

### Disable Dot Notation

Whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).

### Multiple Matches

Choose how to handle duplicate data. The default is **Include All Matches**. You can choose **Include First Match Only**.

For example, given these two datasets:

```
	// Input 1
	[
		{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "banana",
				"color": "yellow"
			}
		}
	]
	// Input 2
	[
		{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "banana",
				"color": "yellow"
			}
		}
	]
```

n8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.

If you select **Include First Match Only**, n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.

## Understand the output

There are four output options:

- **In A only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
- **Same Branch**: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
- **Different Branch**: Contains data that's different between inputs.
- **In B only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.

# Date & Time

The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.

Timezone settings

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information.
1. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

Date and time in other nodes

You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

```
timeDifference
years : 1
months : 3
days : 13
```

If you turn on the **Output as ISO String** option, the node formats the output as a single ISO duration string, for example: `P1Y3M13D`.

ISO duration format displays a format as `P<n>Y<n>M<n>DT<n>H<n>M<n>S`. `<n>` is the number for the unit after it.

- P = period (duration). It begins all ISO duration strings.
- Y = years
- M = months
- W = weeks
- D = days
- T = delineator between dates and times, used to avoid confusion between months and minutes
- H = hours
- M = minutes
- S = seconds

Milliseconds don't get their own unit, but instead are decimal seconds. For example, 2.1 milliseconds is `0.0021S`.

# Error Trigger node

You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.

## Usage

1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
1. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
   1. Select **Options** > **Settings**.
   1. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
   1. Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

Note the following:

- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to publish the workflow.
- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

## Templates and examples

[Browse Error Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/error-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Related resources

You can use the [Stop And Error](../n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to send custom messages to the Error Trigger.

Read more about [Error workflows](../../../../flow-logic/error-handling/) in n8n workflows.

## Error data

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

```
[
	{
		"execution": {
			"id": "231",
			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231",
			"retryOf": "34",
			"error": {
				"message": "Example Error Message",
				"stack": "Stacktrace"
			},
			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error",
			"mode": "manual"
		},
		"workflow": {
			"id": "1",
			"name": "Example Workflow"
		}
	}
]
```

All information is always present, except:

- `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

```
{
  "trigger": {
    "error": {
      "context": {},
      "name": "WorkflowActivationError",
      "cause": {
        "message": "",
        "stack": ""
      },
      "timestamp": 1654609328787,
      "message": "",
      "node": {
        . . . 
      }
    },
    "mode": "trigger"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "id": "",
    "name": ""
  }
}
```

# Evaluation node

The Evaluation node performs various operations related to [evaluations](../../../../advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/) to validate your AI workflow reliability.

Use the Evaluation node in these scenarios:

- To conditionally execute logic based on whether the workflow is under evaluation
- To write evaluation outcomes back to a Google Sheet datasetor
- To log scoring metrics for your evaluation performance to n8n's evaluations tab

Credentials for Google Sheets

The Evaluation node's **Set Outputs** operation records evaluation results to data tables or Google Sheets. To use Google Sheets as a recording location, configure a [Google Sheets credential](../../credentials/google/).

## Operations

The Evaluation node offers the following operations:

- [**Set Outputs**](#set-outputs): Write the results of an evaluation back to a data table or Google Sheet dataset.
- [**Set Metrics**](#set-metrics): Record metrics scoring the evaluation performance to n8n's **Evaluations** tab.
- [**Check If Evaluating**](#check-if-evaluating): Branches the workflow execution logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation.

The parameters and options available depend on the operation you select.

### Set Outputs

The **Set Outputs** operation has the following parameters:

- **Source:** Select the location to which you want to output the evaluation results. Default value is **Data table**.

Source settings differ depending on **Source** selection.

```
* When **Source** is **Data table**:
    * **Data table:** Select a data table by name or ID
* When **Source** is **Google Sheets**:
    * **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [Google Sheets credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/index.md).
    * **Document Containing Dataset**: Choose the spreadsheet document you want to write the evaluation results to. Usually this is the same document you select in the [Evaluation Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger.md) node.
    * Select **From list** to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or **By ID** to enter the `spreadsheetId`. 
        * You can find the `spreadsheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`.
    * **Sheet Containing Dataset**: Choose the sheet you want to write the evaluation results to. Usually this is the same sheet you select in the [Evaluation Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger.md) node.
        * Select **From list** to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the sheet, **By ID** to enter the `sheetId`, or **By Name** to enter the sheet title. 
        * You can find the `sheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`.
```

You define the items to write to the data table or Google Sheet in the **Outputs** section. For each output, you set the following:

- **Name**: The Google Sheet column name to write the evaluation results to.
- **Value**: The value to write to the Google Sheet.

### Set Metrics

The **Set Metrics** operation includes a **Metrics to Return** section where you define the metrics to record and track for your evaluations. You can see the metric results in your workflow's **Evaluations** tab.

For each metric you wish to record, you set the following details:

- **Name**: The name to use for the metric.
- **Value**: The numeric value to record. Once you run your evaluation, you can drag and drop values from previous nodes here. Metric values must be numeric.

### Check If Evaluating

The **Check If Evaluating** operation doesn't have any parameters. This operation provides branching output connectors so that you can conditionally execute logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation or not.

# Execute Sub-workflow

Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

## Node parameters

### Source

Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:

- **Database**: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
  - **From list**: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
  - **Workflow ID**: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after `/workflow/`. For example, if the URL of a workflow is `https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`, the **Workflow ID** is `abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`.
- **Local File**: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow Path**: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
- **Parameter**: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow JSON**: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
- **URL**: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow URL**: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.

### Workflow Inputs

If you select a sub-workflow using the **database** and **From list** options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.

You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives `null` as the item's value. You can also enable **Attempt to convert types** to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.

Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.

### Mode

Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:

- **Run once with all items**: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
- **Run once for each item**: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.

## Node options

This node includes one option: **Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion**. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

## Set up and use a sub-workflow

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

   Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

   You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](./) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

   You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

1. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

   1. Select the **Options** menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:

   - **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](./) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
1. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/).
1. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

1. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

   Find your workflow ID

   Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

1. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
1. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

# Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node

Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.

n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:

- Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
- Break large workflows into smaller components.

## Usage

This node runs in response to a call from the [Execute Sub-workflow](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) nodes.

### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

   Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

   You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

   You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

1. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

   1. Select the **Options** menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:

   - **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
1. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/).
1. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

1. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

   Find your workflow ID

   Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

1. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## Templates and examples

[Browse Execute Sub-workflow Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/execute-workflow-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## How data passes between workflows

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
1. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

# Execution Data

Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the **Executions** list.

You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to [Custom executions data](../../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for more information.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

- Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
- Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Operations

- Save Execution Data for Search

## Data to Save

Add a **Saved Field** for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.

## Limitations

The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:

- `key`: limited to 50 characters
- `value`: limited to 512 characters

If either the `key` or `value` exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.

# Extract From File

A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from an [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) (for files you are fetching from a website), a [Webhook Node](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.

The Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the [Convert to File](../n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) node.

## Operations

Use the **Operations** drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.

- **Extract From CSV**: The "Comma Separated Values" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.
- **Extract From HTML**: Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.
- **Extract From JSON**: Extract JSON data from a binary file.
- **Extract From ICS**: Extract fields from iCalendar format files.
- **Extract From ODS**: Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.
- **Extract From PDF**: Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.
- **Extract From RTF**: Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.
- **Extract From Text File**: Extract fields from a standard text file format.
- **Extract From XLS**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).
- **Extract From XLSX**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.
- **Move File to Base64 String**: Converts binary data to a text-friendly [base64](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) format.

## Example workflow

In this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/webhook-example.json)

Set to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:

```
{
  "row": {
  "0": "apple",
  "1": "1",
  "2": "2",
  "3": "3"
  }
  ...
```

Receiving files with a webhook

Select the Webhook Node's **Add Options** button and select **Raw body**, then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.

## Node parameters

### Input Binary Field

Enter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.

### Destination Output Field

Enter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.

This parameter is only available for these operations:

- Extract From JSON
- Extract From ICS
- Extract From Text File
- Move File to Base64 String

# Filter

Filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.

## Node parameters

Create filter comparison **Conditions** to perform your filter.

- Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
- The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.

Select **Add condition** to create more conditions.

### Combining conditions

You can choose to keep items:

- When they meet all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **AND** in the dropdown between them.
- When they meet any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **OR** in the dropdown between them.

You can't create a mix of AND and OR rules.

## Node options

- **Ignore Case**: Whether to ignore letter case (turned on) or be case sensitive (turned off).
- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off). Turn this on when facing a "wrong type:" error in your node.

# n8n Form node

Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the [n8n Form Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json)

## Setting up the node

### Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the [n8n Form Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger node URL.

Only for production

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.

When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

- Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
- Fields:
  - `name`: `Jane Doe`
  - `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
```

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

### Displaying custom HTML

You can display custom HTML on your form by adding a **Custom HTML** field to your form. This provides an **HTML** box where you can insert arbitrary HTML code to display as part of the form page.

You can use the HTML field to enrich your form page by including things like links, images, videos, and more. n8n will render the content with the rest of the form fields in the normal document flow.

Because custom HTML content is read-only, these fields aren't included in the form output data by default. To include the raw HTML content in the node output, provide a name for the data using the **Element Name** field.

The HTML field doesn't support `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.

If you're using the [Form Ending](#form-ending) Page Type, you can fully customize the final page that you send users (including the use of `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<input>` elements) by selecting the **On n8n Form Submission** parameter to **Show Text**.

### Including hidden fields

It's possible to include fields in a form without displaying them to users. This is useful when you want to pass extra data to the form that doesn't require interactive user input.

To add fields that won't show up on the form, use the **Hidden Field** form element. There, you can define the **Field Name** and optionally provide a default value by filling out the **Field Value**.

When serving the form, you can pass values for hidden fields using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).

### Defining the form using JSON

Use **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](../../../../data/data-structure/). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:

- `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field on the rendered form.
- `fieldName`: The field name that is used in the output of the Form node and to reference the field in expressions.
- `fieldType`: Choose from `checkbox`, `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `hiddenField`, `html`, `number`, `password`, `radio`, `text`, or `textarea`.
  - Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
  - When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`. As an alternative, you can use `checkbox` or `radio` together with `fieldOptions` too.
  - When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
  - Use `hiddenField` to add a hidden field to your form. Refer to [Including hidden fields](#including-hidden-fields) for more information.
  - Use `html` to display custom HTML on your form. Refer to [Displaying custom HTML](#displaying-custom-html) for more information.
- `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `date`, and `file`.
- `defaultValue`: Specify a value that will be pre-filled or pre-selected in the form element. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `password`, `html`, `hiddenField` and `file`.
- `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.

An example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:

```
// Use the "requiredField" key on any field to mark it as mandatory
// Use the "placeholder" key to specify placeholder data for all fields
// except 'dropdown', 'checkbox', 'radio', 'date' and 'file'
// Use the "defaultValue" key to pre-fill a form field or pre-select a 
// value in 'checkbox', 'radio' or 'dropdown' fields

    "fieldValue": "extra form data"
  }
]
```

### Form Ending

Use the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page, redirect the user to a URL, or display custom HTML or text. Only one Form Ending page displays per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.

Choose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:

- **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.
  - Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
  - n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.
  - Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.
- **Redirect to URL**: Redirect the user to a specified URL when the form completes.
  - Fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.
- **Show Text**: Display a final page defined by arbitrary plain text and HTML.
  - Fill in the **Text** field with the HTML or plain text content you wish to show.
- **Return Binary File**: Return a binary file upon completion.
  - Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
  - n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.
  - Provide the **Input Data Field Name** containing the binary file to return to the user.

### Forms with branches

The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.

#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches

Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.

This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json)

#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches

Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](../n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](../../../../flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.

n8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.

This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json)

### Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options:

- **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.
- **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. This field supports HTML. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. The Form Description also populates the [HTML meta description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_the_html_specification) for the page.
- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.
- **Custom Form Styling**: Override the default styling of the public form interface with CSS. The field pre-populates with the default styling so you can change only what you need to.
- **Completion Page Title**: The title for the final completion page of the form.

## Running the node

### Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Execute Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

### Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then publish your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and published the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

# n8n Form Trigger node

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

You can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) node.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Execute Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then publish your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and published the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

Only for production

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.

When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

- Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
- Fields:
  - `name`: `Jane Doe`
  - `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
```

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

## Node parameters

These are the main node configuration fields:

### Authentication

- **Basic Auth**
- **None**

#### Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
- The **Password** that goes with that username.

### Form URLs

The Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

- **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Execute Step** or **Execute Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you publish the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Form Path

Set a custom slug for the form.

### Form Title

Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Description

Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.

### Form Elements

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Element** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

- **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field on the rendered form.
- **Field Name**: This name is used in the output of the Form Trigger node. Use it to reference a form field in downstream nodes.
- **Element Type**: Choose from **Checkboxes**, **Custom HTML**, **Date**, **Dropdown**, **Email**, **File**, **Hidden Field**, **Number**, **Password**, **Radio Buttons**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.
  - Select **Checkboxes** to include checkbox elements in the form. By default, there is no limit on how many checkboxes a form user can select. You can set the limit by specifying a value for the **Limit Selection** option as **Exact Number**, **Range**, or **Unlimited**.
  - Select **Custom HTML** to insert arbitrary HTML.
    - You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.
    - By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated **Element Name** field.
  - Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
  - Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**.
  - Select **Radio Buttons** to include radio button elements in the form.
  - Select **Hidden Field** to include a form element without displaying it on the form. You can set a default value using the **Field Value** parameter or pass values for the field using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).
- **Placeholder**: Define a sample text to display inside compatible form elements. Placeholders are supported in **Email**, **Number**, **Password**, **Text** and **Textarea**.
- **Default value**: Define a default value that will be pre-filled or pre-selected in compatible form elements. Default values are supported in all form elements except **Custom HTML**, **File**, **Hidden Field**, and **Password**.
- **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form.

### Respond When

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options:

- **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.
- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.
- **Form Path**: The final segment of the form's URL, for both testing and production. Replaces the automatically generated UUID as the final component.
- **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
- **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.
- **Custom Form Styling**: Override the default styling of the public form interface with CSS. The field pre-populates with the default styling so you can change only what you need to.

## Customizing Form Trigger node behavior

### Format response text with line breaks

You can use one of the following methods to add line breaks to form response text:

• Use HTML formatting instead of plain text in the formSubmittedText field • Replace newline characters (`\n`) with HTML break tags (`<br>`) before sending the response • Consider using a custom HTML response page if you need more formatting control

### Restrict form access with authentication

You can use one of the following options to add authentication to your form:

• Use the OTP (One-Time Password) field with TOTP node validation for token-based authentication • Add a Wait node with form authentication as a secondary form page • Store hashed passwords in a database and compare against form submissions for validation • Use external authentication providers like Google Forms if you need advanced authentication

# HTML

The HTML node provides operations to help you work with HTML in n8n.

HTML Extract node

The HTML node replaces the HTML Extract node from version 0.213.0 on. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [HTML Extract node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/86fe33b681621e618e3adcab9a27e8605dbc23ad/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.htmlextract.md).

Cross-site scripting

When using the HTML node to generate an HTML template you can introduce [XSS (cross-site scripting)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/). This is a security risk. Be careful with un-trusted inputs.

## Operations

- [**Generate HTML template**](#generate-html-template): Use this operation to create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.
- [**Extract HTML content**](#extract-html-content): Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).
- [**Convert to HTML Table**](#convert-to-html-table): Convert content to an HTML table.

The node parameters and options depend on the operation you select. Refer to the sections below for more details on configuring each operation.

## Generate HTML template

Create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.

You can include:

- Standard HTML
- CSS in `<style>` tags.
- JavaScript in `<script>` tags. n8n doesn't execute the JavaScript.
- Expressions, wrapped in `{{}}`.

You can use [Expressions](../../../../code/expressions/) in the template, including n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/).

## Extract HTML Content

Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).

Use these parameters:

### Source Data

Select the source type for your HTML content. Choose between:

- **JSON**: If you select this source data, enter the **JSON Property**: the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.
- **Binary**: If you select this source data, enter the **Input Binary Field**: the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.

### Extraction Values

- **Key**: Enter the key to save the extracted value under.
- **CSS Selector**: Enter the CSS selector to search for.
- **Return Value**: Select the type of data to return. Choose from:
  - **Attribute**: Return an attribute value like `class` from an element.
    - If you select this option, enter the name of the **Attribute** to return the value of.
  - **HTML**: Return the HTML that the element contains.
  - **Text**: Return the text content of the element.
    - If you choose this option, you can also enter a comma-separated list of selectors to skip in the **Skip Selectors**.
  - **Value**: Return the value of an input, select, or text area.
- **Return Array**: Choose whether to return multiple extraction values as an array (turned on) or as a single string (turned off).

### Extract HTML Content options

You can also configure this operation with these options:

- **Trim Values**: Controls whether to remove all spaces and newlines from the beginning and end of the values (turned on) or leaves them (turned off).
- **Clean Up Text**: Controls whether to remove leading whitespaces, trailing whitespaces, and line breaks (newlines) and condense multiple consecutive whitespaces into a single space (turned on) or to leave them as-is (turned off).

## Convert to HTML Table

This operation expects data from another node. It has no parameters. It includes these options:

- **Capitalize Headers**: Controls whether to capitalize the table's headers (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Custom Styling**: Controls whether to use custom styling (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Caption**: Enter a caption to add to the table.
- **Table Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the `<table>`, such as style attributes.
- **Header Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the table's headers `<th>`.

# If

Use the If node to split a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

## Add conditions

Create comparison **Conditions** for your If node.

- Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
- The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.

Select **Add condition** to create more conditions.

### Combining conditions

You can choose to keep data:

- When it meets all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **AND** in the dropdown between them.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

0.236.0 and below

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

## Related resources

Refer to [Splitting with conditionals](../../../../flow-logic/splitting/) for more information on using conditionals to create complex logic in n8n.

If you need more than two conditional outputs, use the [Switch node](../n8n-nodes-base.switch/).

# Local File Trigger node

The Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.

Security considerations

The Local File Trigger node can introduce significant security risks in environments that operate with untrusted users. Because of this, the node is [disabled](../../../../hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/#exclude-nodes) by default starting from version 2.0.

Self-hosted n8n only

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Node parameters

You can choose what event to watch for using the **Trigger On** parameter.

## Changes to a Specific File

The node triggers when the specified file changes.

Enter the path for the file to watch in **File to Watch**.

## Changes Involving a Specific Folder

The node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.

Configure these parameters:

- **Folder to Watch**: Enter the path of the folder to watch.
- **Watch for**: Select the type of change to watch for.

## Node options

Use the node **Options** to include or exclude files and folders.

- **Include Linked Files/Folders**: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
- **Ignore**: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch) syntax.
- **Max Folder Depth**: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.

### Examples for Ignore

Ignore a single file:

```
**/<fileName>.<suffix>
# For example, **/myfile.txt
```

Ignore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:

```
**/<directoryName>/**
# For example, **/myDirectory/**
```

# Manual Trigger node

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Execute Workflow** and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) firing on a set schedule.

The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.

Use this trigger:

- To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
- When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow

This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.

Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.

# Markdown

# Merge

Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.

Major changes in 0.194.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md).

Minor changes in 1.49.0

n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.

## Node parameters

You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode**:

### Append

Keep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs.

Append mode inputs and output

### Combine

Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.

#### Matching Fields

Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**.

n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:

- **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
- **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.
- **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
- **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
- **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.

Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output

#### Position

Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.

Combine by Position mode inputs and output

#### All Possible Combinations

Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.

Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output

#### Combine mode options

When merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:

- **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.
- **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `"3"` and `3` as the same.
- **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.
- **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
  - **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
  - **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
- **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.

##### Clash Handling

If multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named `language`, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if `language` has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items.

You can change this behavior by selecting **Options** > **Clash Handling**:

- **When Field Values Clash**: Choose which input to prioritize, or choose **Always Add Input Number to Field Names** to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from.
- **Merging Nested Fields**
  - **Deep Merge**: Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties.
  - **Shallow Merge**: Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties.

### SQL Query

Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data.

Example:

```
SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id
```

Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements) for a full list of supported SQL statements.

### Choose Branch

Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:

- The **Input 1 Data**
- The **Input 2 Data**
- **A Single, Empty Item**

The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items

The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

0.236.0 and below

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

## Try it out: A step by step example

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.

### Set up sample data using the Code nodes

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.

1. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:

   ```
   return [
     {
       json: {
         name: 'Stefan',
         language: 'de',
       }
     },
     {
       json: {
         name: 'Jim',
         language: 'en',
       }
     },
     {
       json: {
         name: 'Hans',
         language: 'de',
       }
     }
   ];
   ```

1. Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.

1. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:

   ```
   return [
   	  {
       json: {
         greeting: 'Hello',
         language: 'en',
       }
     },
     {
       json: {
         greeting: 'Hallo',
         language: 'de',
       }
     }
   ];
   ```

### Try out different merge modes

Add the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.

The final workflow should look like this:

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/655-merge-greetings-with-the-users-based-on-the-language/)

Now try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.

#### Append

Select **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | de           |              |
| Jim      | en           |              |
| Hans     | de           |              |
|          | en           | Hello        |
|          | de           | Hallo        |

#### Combine by Matching Fields

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.

1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.
1. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.
1. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.
1. Select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | de           | Hallo        |
| Jim      | en           | Hello        |
| Hans     | de           | Hallo        |

#### Combine by Position

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | en           | Hello        |
| Jim      | de           | Hallo        |

##### Keep unpaired items

If you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | en           | Hello        |
| Jim      | de           | Hallo        |
| Hans     | de           |              |

#### Combine by All Possible Combinations

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | en           | Hello        |
| Stefan   | de           | Hallo        |
| Jim      | en           | Hello        |
| Jim      | de           | Hallo        |
| Hans     | en           | Hello        |
| Hans     | de           | Hallo        |

## File locations

If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

This node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.

# Rename Keys

Use the Rename Keys node to rename the keys of a key-value pair in n8n.

## Node parameters

You can rename one or multiple keys using the Rename Keys node. Select the **Add new key** button to rename a key.

For each key, enter the:

- **Current Key Name**: The current name of the key you want to rename.
- **New Key Name**: The new name you want to assign to the key.

## Node options

Choose whether to use a **Regex** regular expression to identify keys to rename. To use this option, you must also enter:

- The **Regular Expression** you'd like to use.
- **Replace With**: Enter the new name you want to assign to the key(s) that match the **Regular Expression**.
- You can also choose these Regex-specific options:
  - **Case Insensitive**: Set whether the regular expression should match case (turned off) or be case insensitive (turned on).
  - **Max Depth**: Enter the maximum depth to replace keys, using `-1` for unlimited and `0` for top-level only.

Regex impacts

Using a regular expression can affect any keys that match the expression, including keys you've already renamed.

# Respond to Webhook

Use the Respond to Webhook node to control the response to incoming webhooks. This node works with the [Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.

Runs once for the first data item

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to [Return more than one data item](#return-more-than-one-data-item-deprecated) for more information.

## How to use Respond to Webhook

To use the Respond to Webhook node:

1. Add a [Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node as the trigger node for the workflow.
1. In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.
1. Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.

## Node parameters

Configure the node behavior using these parameters.

### Respond With

Choose what data to send in the webhook response.

- **All Incoming Items**: Respond with all the JSON items from the input.
- **Binary File**: Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.
- **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
- **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.
- **JWT Token**: Respond with a JSON Web Token (JWT).
- **No Data**: No response payload.
- **Redirect**: Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.
- **Text**: Respond with text set in **Response Body**. This sends HTML by default (`Content-Type: text/html`).

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view and set the options.

- **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use.
- **Response Headers**: Define the response headers to send.
- **Put Response in Field**: Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.
- **Enable Streaming**: When enabled, sends the data back to the user using streaming. Requires a trigger configured with the **Response mode** **Streaming**.

## How n8n secures HTML responses

Starting with n8n version 1.103.0, n8n automatically wraps HTML responses to webhooks in `<iframe>` tags. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

## Workflow behavior

When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:

- The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
- The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
- A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
- A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.

## Output the response sent to the webhook

By default, the Respond to Webhook node has a single output branch that contains the node's input data.

You can optionally enable a second output branch containing the response sent to the webhook. To enable this secondary output, open the Respond to Webhook node on the canvas and select the **Settings** tab. Activate the **Enable Response Output Branch** option.

The node will now have two outputs:

- **Input Data**: The original output, passing on the node's input.
- **Response**: The response object sent to the webhook.

## Return more than one data item (deprecated)

Deprecated in 1.22.0

n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](../../../../code/expressions/). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.

If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:

- Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
- Use the [Aggregate](../n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**.

# RSS Read

Use the RSS Read node to read data from RSS feeds published on the internet.

## Node parameters

- **URL**: Enter the URL for the RSS publication you want to read.

## Node options

- **Ignore SSL Issues**: Choose whether n8n should ignore SSL/TLS verification (turned on) or not (turned off).

## Related resources

n8n provides a trigger node for RSS Read. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../n8n-nodes-base.rssfeedreadtrigger/).

# RSS Feed Trigger node

The RSS Feed Trigger node allows you to start an n8n workflow when a new RSS feed item has been published.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the RSS Feed Trigger node supports, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

- **Poll Times**: Select a poll **Mode** to set how often to trigger the poll. Your **Mode** selection will add or remove relevant fields. Refer to the sections below to configure the parameters for each mode type.
- **Feed URL**: Enter the URL of the RSS feed to poll.

### Every Hour mode

Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

### Every Day mode

- Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
- Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

### Every Week mode

- Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
- Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.
- Select the **Weekday** to trigger the poll.

### Every Month mode

- Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
- Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.
- Enter the **Day of the Month** to trigger the poll, from `0` to `31`.

### Every X mode

- Enter the **Value** of measurement for how often to trigger the poll in either minutes or hours.
- Select the **Unit** for the value. Supported units are **Minutes** and **Hours**.

### Custom mode

Enter a custom **Cron Expression** to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:

- Seconds: `0` - `59`
- Minutes: `0` - `59`
- Hours: `0` - `23`
- Day of Month: `1` - `31`
- Months: `0` - `11` (Jan - Dec)
- Day of Week: `0` - `6` (Sun - Sat)

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Cron Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

```
30 8 4 * * *
```

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

```
8 4 * * *
```

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

| \*     | \*     | \*   | \*           | \*    | \*          |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| second | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week |

# Edit Fields (Set)

Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.

## Node parameters

These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.

### Mode

You can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.

### Fields to Set

If you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping**, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.

The default behavior when you drag a value is:

- n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
- The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.

If you don't want to use expressions:

1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle.
1. Select **Fixed**.

You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

### Keep Only Set Fields

Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.

### Include in Output

Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.

## Node options

Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.

### Include Binary Data

If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.

### Ignore Type Conversion Errors

Manual Mapping only.

Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.

### Support Dot Notation

By default, n8n supports dot notation.

For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:

```
{ "number": { "one": 20} }
```

You can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation**, and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:

```
{ "number.one": 20 }
```

    "notes": "Passionate sailor",
    "country": "UK",
    "created": "1950-10-16"
  }
]
```

Add the following JSON in the **JSON Output** field, with **Include in Output** set to **All Input Fields**:

```
{
  "newKey": "new value",
  "array": [{{ $json.id }},"{{ $json.name }}"],
  "object": {
    "innerKey1": "new value",
    "innerKey2": "{{ $json.id }}",
    "innerKey3": "{{ $json.name }}",
 }
}
```

# Sort

Use the Sort node to organize lists of items in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

Array sort behavior

The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) to learn more.

## Node parameters

Configure this node using the **Type** parameter.

Use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting from these options.

### Simple

Performs an ascending or descending sort using the selected fields.

When you select this **Type**:

- Use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the **Field Name**.
- Select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.

#### Simple options

When you select **Simple** as the **Type**, you have the option to **Disable Dot Notation**. By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Random

Creates a random order in the list.

### Code

Input custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation. This is a good option if a simple sort won't meet your needs.

Enter your custom JavaScript code in the **Code** input field.

# Loop Over Items

The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data when needed.

The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the **loop** output.

When the node execution completes, it combines all of the processed data and returns it through the **done** output.

## When to use the Loop Over Items node

By default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the [looping in n8n](../../../../flow-logic/looping/) page.

These links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:

- [Loop until all items are processed](../../../../flow-logic/looping/#loop-until-all-items-are-processed): describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.
- [Node exceptions](../../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions): outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.
- [Avoiding rate limiting](../../rate-limits/): demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services.

## Node parameters

### Batch Size

Enter the number of items to return with each call.

## Node options

### Reset

If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items.

For example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an [If node](../n8n-nodes-base.if/) to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not.

Include a valid termination condition

For workflows like the example described above, it's critical to include a valid termination condition for the loop. If your termination condition never matches, your workflow execution will get stuck in an infinite loop.

When enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from **Fixed** to **Expression**. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.

### Read RSS feed from two different sources

This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/) on n8n.io.

The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](../../../../try-it-out/).

The final workflow looks like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/rss-feed-example.json)

Copy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:

1. Add the manual trigger.

1. Add the Code node.

1. Copy this code into the Code node:

   ```
   return [
   	{
   		json: {
   			url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',
   		}
   	},
   	{
   		json: {
   			url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n',
   		}
   	}
   ];
   ```

1. Add the Loop Over Items node.

1. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.

1. Add the RSS Feed Read node.

1. Select **Execute Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.

1. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.

1. Select **Execute Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data.

### Check that the node has processed all items

To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: `{{$("Loop Over Items").context["noItemsLeft"]}}`. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.

### Get the current running index of the node

To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: `{{$("Loop Over Items").context["currentRunIndex"];}}`.

# Split Out

Use the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items. For example, a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.

## Node parameters

Configure this node using the following parameters.

### Field to Split Out

Enter the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.

If you're working with binary data inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.

### Include

Select whether and how you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item.

You can select:

- **No Other Fields**: No other fields will be included.
- **All Other Fields**: All other fields will be included.
- **Selected Other Fields**: Only the selected fields will be included.
  - **Fields to Include**: Enter a comma separated list of the fields you want to include.

## Node options

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Destination Field Name

Enter the field in the output where the split field contents should go.

### Include Binary

Choose whether to include binary data from the input in the new output (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Summarize

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Node parameters

### Fields to Summarize

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

- **Aggregation**: Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
  - **Append**: Append
    - If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
  - **Average**: Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
  - **Concatenate**: Combine together values in your input data.
    - If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
    - **Separator**: Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
  - **Count**: Count the total number of values in your input data.
  - **Count Unique**: Count the number of unique values in your input data.
  - **Max**: Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
  - **Min**: Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
  - **Sum**: Add together the numeric values in your input data.
- **Field**: Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

## Node options

### Continue if Field Not Found

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Output Format

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

- **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
- **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Wait

Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.

## Operations

The Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:

- [**After Time Interval**](#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.
- [**At Specified Time**](#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.
- [**On Webhook Call**](#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
- [**On Form Submitted**](#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.

Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.

### After Time Interval

Wait for a certain amount of time.

This parameter includes two more fields:

- **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.
- **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:
  - **Seconds**
  - **Minutes**
  - **Hours**
  - **Days**

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.

### At Specified Time

Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.

### On Webhook Call

This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.

The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.

When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.

For this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.

#### Authentication

Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:

- **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.
- **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.
- **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.
- **None**: Don't use authentication.

Auth reference

Refer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#supported-authentication-methods) for more information on each auth type.

#### HTTP Method

Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.

#### Response Code

Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.

#### Respond

Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:

- **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.
- **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:
  - **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:
    - **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
    - **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
    - **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
    - **No Response Body**: Return with no body.
- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Limit Wait Time

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:

- **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
  - **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
    - Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
    - Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
  - **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
    - **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Webhook Call options

- **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.
- **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.
- **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
- **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
- **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
- **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

#### On Webhook Call limitations

There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:

- Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

### On Form Submitted

Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

#### Form Title

Enter the title to display at the top of the form.

#### Form Description

Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

#### Form Fields

Set up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:

- **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.
- **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:
  - **Date**
  - **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.
    - **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)
  - **Number**
  - **Password**
  - **Text**
  - **Textarea**
- **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).

#### Respond When

Set when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.
- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.

#### Limit Wait Time

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).

If turned on, also set: * **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options: * **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time. * Enter the limit's **Amount** of time. * Select the limit's **Unit** of time. * **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume. * **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Form Response options

- **Form Response**: Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:
  - **Form Submitted Text**: The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
  - **Redirect URL**: The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
- **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

## Time-based operations

For the time-based resume operations, note that:

- For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
- The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.

# Workflow Trigger node

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

Deprecated

n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/).

Keep in mind

If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

- **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
- **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.

You can select one or both of these events.

# Chat node

Use the Chat node with the [Chat Trigger](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node to send messages into the chat and optionally wait for responses from users. This enables human-in-the-loop (HITL) use cases in chat workflows, allowing you to have multiple chat interactions within a single execution. The Chat node also works as a tool for AI Agents.

All features work with both embedded and hosted chat interfaces.

Chat Trigger node

The Chat node requires a [Chat Trigger](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node to be present in the workflow, with the [Response Mode](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/#response-mode) set to 'Using Response Nodes'.

Previous version

In previous versions, this node was called "Respond to Chat" and used a single "Wait for User Reply" toggle. The functionality has been reorganized into two distinct actions with additional response types.

## Node parameters

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

Human-in-the-loop for AI tool calls

This node can be used as a human review step for AI Agent tool calls. When configured this way, the AI Agent will pause and request human approval through this service before executing tools that require oversight. Learn more in [Human-in-the-loop for AI tool calls](../../../../advanced-ai/human-in-the-loop-tools/).

Configure this node using the following parameters.

### Operation

The Chat node supports the following operations:

- **Send Message**: Send a message to the chat. The workflow execution continues immediately after sending.
- **Send and Wait for Response**: Send a message to the chat and wait for a response from the user. This operation pauses the workflow execution until the user submits a response.

Choosing **Send and Wait for Response** activates additional parameters and options as discussed in [waiting for a response](#waiting-for-a-response).

### Message

The message to send to the chat. This parameter is available for both operations.

## Node options

Use these **Options** to further refine the node's behavior.

### Add Memory Input Connection

Choose whether you want to commit the messages from the Chat node to a connected memory. Using a shared memory between an agent or chain [root node](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/) and the Chat node attaches the same session key to these messages and lets you capture the full message history.

## Waiting for a response

By choosing the **Send and Wait for Response** operation, you can send a message and pause the workflow execution until a person responds. This enables multi-turn conversations and approval workflows within a single execution.

### Response Type

You can choose between the following types of responses:

- **Free Text**: Users can type any response in the chat. This is the same behavior as the previous "Wait for User Reply" option.
- **Approval**: Users can approve or disapprove using inline buttons in the message. You can also optionally allow users to type custom responses.

Different parameters and options are available depending on which type you choose.

### Free Text parameters and options

When using the Free Text response type, the user can type any message as their response.

**Use cases:**

- Open-ended questions
- Collecting detailed feedback
- Requesting specific information

**Options:** * **Limit Wait Time**: Whether the workflow automatically resumes execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.

### Approval parameters and options

When using the Approval response type, the message displays inline buttons that users can click to approve or disapprove. This response type follows the same pattern as other human-in-the-loop (HITL) nodes in n8n.

**Use cases:**

- Simple yes/no decisions
- Approval workflows
- Confirmations

When using the Approval response type, the following parameters are available:

- **Type of Approval**: Whether to present only an approval button or both approval and disapproval buttons.
- **Approve Only**: Displays a single approval button
- **Approve and Disapprove**: Displays both buttons (default)
- **Approve Button Label**: The text to display on the approval button. Default: `Approve`
- **Disapprove Button Label**: The text to display on the disapproval button (only shown when Type of Approval is "Approve and Disapprove"). Default: `Disapprove`
- **Block User Input**: Whether to prevent users from typing custom messages (enabled) or allow them to type responses (disabled, default).
- When **disabled** (default): Users can click buttons or type a custom message. Typed messages are treated as disapproval with a custom message.
- When **enabled**: Users can only interact using the buttons.

The Approval response type also offers the following option:

- **Limit Wait Time**: Whether the workflow automatically resumes execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.

## Common issues

- The Chat node doesn't work when used as a tool of a subagent.
- The Chat node doesn't work when used in a subworkflow. This includes usage in a subworkflow that's being used as a tool for an AI Agent.
- Make sure the Chat Trigger node's Response Mode is set to "Using Response Nodes" for the Chat node to function properly.

For common questions or issues with the Chat Trigger node, refer to [Common Chat Trigger Node Issues](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/common-issues/).

# Guardrails node

Use the Guardrails node to enforce safety, security, and content policies on text. You can use it to validate user input *before* sending it to an AI model, or to check the *output* from an AI model before using it in your workflow.

Chat Model Connection Required for LLM-based Guardrails

This node requires a Chat Model node to be connected to its Model input when using the **Check Text for Violations** operation with LLM-based guardrails. Many guardrail checks (like Jailbreak, NSFW, and Topical Alignment) are LLM-based and use this connection to evaluate the input text.

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure the Guardrails node.

### Operation

The operation mode for this node to define its behavior.

- **Check Text for Violations**: Provides a full set of guardrails. Any violation will send items to **Fail** branch.
- **Sanitize Text**: Provides a subset of guardrails that can detect URLs, regular expressions, secret keys, or personally identifiable information (PII), such as phone numbers and credit card numbers. The node replaces detected violations with placeholders.

### Text To Check

The text the guardrails evaluate. Typically, you map this text using an expression from a previous node, such as text from a user query or a response from an AI model.

### Guardrails

Select one or more guardrails to apply to the **Text To Check**. When you add a guardrail from the list, its specific configuration options appear below.

- **Keywords:** Checks if specified keywords appear in the input text.
  - **Keywords**: A comma-separated list of words to block.
- **Jailbreak:** Detects attempts to bypass AI safety measures or exploit the model.
  - **Customize Prompt**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, a text input appears with the default prompt for the jailbreak detection model. You can change this prompt to fine-tune the guardrail.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0. This represents the confidence level required from the AI model to flag the input as a jailbreak attempt. A higher threshold is stricter.
- **NSFW:** Detects attempts to generate Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content.
  - **Customize Prompt**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, a text input appears with the default prompt for the NSFW detection model. You can change this prompt to fine-tune the guardrail.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level required to flag the content as NSFW.
- **PII:** Detects personally identifiable information (PII) in the text.
  - **Type**: Choose which PII entities to scan for:
    - **All**: Scans for all available entity types.
    - **Selected**: Allows you to choose specific entities from a list.
  - **Entities**: (Appears if **Type** is **Selected**) A multi-select list of PII types to detect (for example, `CREDIT_CARD`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, and `US_SSN`).
- **Secret Keys:** Detects the presence of secret keys or API credentials in the text.
  - **Permissiveness**: How strict or permissive the detection should be when flagging secret keys:
    - **Strict**
    - **Permissive**
    - **Balanced**
- **Topical Alignment:** Ensures the conversation stays within a predefined scope or topic (also known as "business scope").
  - **Prompt**: A preset prompt that defines the *allowed* topic. The guardrail checks if the **Text To Check** aligns with this prompt.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level required to flag the input as *off-topic*.
- **URLs:** Manages URLs the node finds in the input text. It detects all URLs as violations, unless you specify them in **Block All URLs Except**.
  - **Block All URLs Except**: (Optional) A comma-separated list of URLs that you permit.
  - **Allowed Schemes**: Select the URL schemes to permit (for example, `https`, `http`, `ftp`, and `mailto`).
  - **Block userinfo**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, the node blocks URLs containing user credentials (for example, `user:pass@example.com`) to prevent credential injection.
  - **Allow subdomain**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, the node automatically allows subdomains of any URL in the **Block All URLs Except** list (for example, `sub.example.com` would be allowed if `example.com` is in the list).
- **Custom:** Define your own custom, LLM-based guardrail.
  - **Name**: A descriptive name for your custom guardrail (for example, "Check for rude language").
  - **Prompt**: A prompt that instructs the AI model what to check for.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level required to flag the input as a violation.
- **Custom Regex**: Define your own custom regular expression patterns.
  - **Name**: A name for your custom pattern. The node uses this name as a placeholder in the **Sanitize Text** mode.
  - **Regex**: Your regular expression pattern.

### Customize System Message

If you turn this on, a text input appears with a message that the guardrail uses to enforce thresholds and JSON output according to schema. Change it to modify the global guardrails behavior.

# MCP Client node

The MCP Client node is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) client that allows you to use the tools that are exposed by an external MCP server.

You can use the MCP Client node to use MCP tools as regular steps in a workflow.

If you want to use MCP tools as tools for an AI Agent, use the [MCP Client Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) instead.

Credentials

The MCP Client node supports [Bearer](../../credentials/httprequest/#using-bearer-auth), generic [header](../../credentials/httprequest/#using-header-auth), and [OAuth2](../../credentials/httprequest/#using-oauth2) authentication methods.

## Node parameters

Configure the node with the following parameters.

- **Server Transport**: The transport protocol used by the MCP Server endpoint you want to connect to.
- **MCP Endpoint URL**: The URL of the external MCP Server. For example, `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`.
- **Authentication**: The authentication method for authentication to your MCP server. The MCP Client node supports [bearer](../../credentials/httprequest/#using-bearer-auth), generic [header](../../credentials/httprequest/#using-header-auth), and [OAuth2](../../credentials/httprequest/#using-oauth2) authentication. Select **None** to attempt to connect without authentication.
- **Tool**: Select the tool to use in the node. The list of tools is automatically fetched from the external MCP server.
- **Input Mode**:
  - **Manual**: Specify each tool parameter manually.
  - **JSON**: Specify tool parameters as a JSON object. Use this mode for tools with nested parameters.

## Options

- **Convert to Binary**: Whether to convert images and audio to binary data. If false, images and audio are returned as base64 encoded strings.
- **Timeout**: Time in milliseconds to wait for tool calls to finish.

To use MCP tools with AI Agents, n8n has the [MCP Client Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/).

n8n also has an [MCP Server Trigger](../n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/) node that allows you to expose n8n tools to external AI Agents.

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) for more details about the protocol, servers, and clients.

# MCP Server Trigger node

Use the MCP Server Trigger node to allow n8n to act as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server, making n8n tools and workflows available to MCP clients.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/httprequest/).

## How the MCP Server Trigger node works

The MCP Server Trigger node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools.

Unlike conventional [trigger nodes](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n), which respond to events and pass their output to the next [connected node](../../../../workflows/components/connections/), the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work.

You can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) node.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) and streamable HTTP support

The MCP Server Trigger node supports both [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse), a long-lived transport built on top of HTTP, and [streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) for connections between clients and the server. It currently doesn't support [standard input/output (stdio)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) transport.

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### MCP URL

The MCP Server Trigger node has two **MCP URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

- **Test**: n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production**: n8n registers a production MCP URL when you publish the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Authentication

You can require authentication for clients connecting to your MCP URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Bearer auth
- Header auth

Refer to the [HTTP request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Path

By default, this field contains a randomly generated MCP URL path, to avoid conflicts with other MCP Server Trigger nodes.

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

### Integrating with Claude Desktop

You can connect to the MCP Server Trigger node from [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) by running a gateway to proxy SSE messages to stdio-based servers.

To do so, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "<MCP_URL>",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "<MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Be sure to replace the `<MCP_URL>` and `<MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>` placeholders with the values from your MCP Server Trigger node parameters and credentials.

## Limitations

### Configuring the MCP Server Trigger node with webhook replicas

The MCP Server Trigger node relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streamable HTTP, which require the same server instance to handle persistent connections. This can cause problems when running n8n in [queue mode](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) depending on your [webhook processor](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#webhook-processors) configuration:

- If you use queue mode with a **single webhook replica**, the MCP Server Trigger node works as expected.
- If you run **multiple webhook replicas**, you need to route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica. Create a separate replica set with one webhook container for MCP requests. Afterward, update your ingress or load balancer configuration to direct all `/mcp*` traffic to that instance.

Caution when running with multiple webhook replicas

If you run an MCP Server Trigger node with multiple webhook replicas and don't route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica, your SSE and streamable HTTP connections will frequently break or fail to reliably deliver events.

## Related resources

n8n also provides an [MCP Client Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) node that allows you to connect your n8n AI agents to external tools.

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) for more details about the protocol, servers, and clients.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the MCP Server Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Running the MCP Server Trigger node with a reverse proxy

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy like nginx, you may experience problems if the MCP endpoint isn't configured for SSE or streamable HTTP.

Specifically, you need to disable proxy buffering for the endpoint. Other items you might want to adjust include disabling gzip compression (n8n handles this itself), disabling chunked transfer encoding, and setting the `Connection` to an empty string to remove it from the forwarded headers. Explicitly disabling these in the MCP endpoint ensures they're not inherited from other places in your nginx configuration.

An example nginx location block for serving MCP traffic with these settings may look like this:

```
location /mcp/ {

# Code node

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

Coding in n8n

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](../../../../code/) section. It includes:

- Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/)
- Guidance on [Handling dates](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](../../../../code/cookbook/jmespath/)
- A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](../../../../code/cookbook/code-node/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.

Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

## Usage

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode

There are two modes:

- **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
- **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features

The Code node supports:

- Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
- Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

- [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
- [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python (Pyodide - legacy)

Pyodide is a legacy feature. n8n v2 no longer supports this feature.

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

- [Read/Write File From Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
- [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Python (Native)

n8n added native Python support using task runners in version 1.111.0. This feature is stable as of n8n v2.

Main differences from Pyodide:

- Native Python supports only `_items` in all-items mode and `_item` in per-item mode. It doesn't support other n8n built-in methods and variables.
- Native Python supports importing native Python modules from the standard library and from third-parties, if the `n8nio/runners` image includes them and explicitly allowlists them. See [adding extra dependencies for task runners](../../../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/#adding-extra-dependencies) for more details.
- Native Python denies insecure built-ins by default. See [task runners environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/) for more details.
- Unlike Pyodide, which accepts dot access notation, for example, `item.json.myNewField`, native Python only accepts bracket access notation, for example, `item["json"]["my_new_field"]`. There may be other minor syntax differences where Pyodide accepts constructs that aren't legal in native Python.
- On n8n cloud, the Python option for the Code node doesn't allow users to import any third-party Python libraries. Self-hosting users can find setup instructions to include external libraries [here](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/#adding-extra-dependencies). In the long term, the n8n team is committed to allowing users to securely execute arbitrary Python code with any first- and third-party libraries using task runners.

Upgrading to native Python is a breaking change, so you may need to adjust your Python scripts to use the native Python runner.

## Coding in n8n

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

- [Data structure](../../../../data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
- [Item linking](../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

- Accessing specific item data
- Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
- Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
1. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
1. Write your query.
1. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Code node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Code node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Code doesn't return items properly

This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:

```
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

To troubleshoot this error, check the following:

- Read the [data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
- Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](../../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/).

## A 'json' property isn't an object

This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.

This may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:

```
[
  {
    "json": [
	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
	]
  }
]
```

To resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:

```
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
	}
  }
]
```

## Code doesn't return an object

This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.

To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/):

```
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

This error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.

## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level

This error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.

To resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:

```
// Original code:
// import express from "express";
// New code:
const express = require("express");
```

## Cannot find module '<module>'

This error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.

Only for self-hosted

n8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](../../../../../manage-cloud/overview/) version.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/) n8n, follow these steps:

- Install the module into your n8n environment.
  - If you are running n8n with [npm](../../../../../hosting/installation/npm/), install the module in the same environment as n8n.
  - If you are running n8n with [Docker](../../../../../hosting/installation/docker/), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your module.
- Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) to allow importing modules.

## Using global variables

Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.

To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](../../../../../code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.

Use Remove Duplicates when possible

If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](../../n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.

# Data table

Use the Data Table node to permanently save data across workflow executions in a table format. It provides functionality to perform various data operations on stored data. See [Data tables](../../../../data/data-tables/).

## Node parameters

### Resource

Select the resource on which you want to operate.

- Rows

### Operations

Select the operation you want to run on the resource:

- **Delete:** Delete one or more rows.
- **Dry Run:** Simulate a deletion before finalizing it. If you switch on this option, n8n returns the rows that will be deleted by the operation. Default state is `off`.
- **Get:** Get one or more rows from your table based on defined filters.
- **Limit**: The number of rows you want to return, specified as a number. Default value is 50.
- **Return all:** Switch on to return all data. Default value is `off`.
- **If Row Exists:** Specify a set of conditions to match input items that exist in the data table.
- **If Row Does Not Exist:** Specify a set of conditions to match input items that don't exist in the data table.
- **Insert:** Insert rows into an existing table.
- **Optimize Bulk**: Optimize the speed of insertions when working with many rows. If you switch on this option, n8n won't return the data that was inserted. Default state is `off`.
- **Update:** Update one or more rows.
- **Upsert:** Upsert one or more rows. If the row exists, it's updated; otherwise, a new row is created.

# Execute Command

The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.

Security considerations

The Execute Command node can introduce significant security risks in environments that operate with untrusted users. Because of this, the node is [disabled](../../../../hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/#exclude-nodes) by default starting from version 2.0.

Which shell runs the command?

This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, `cmd` on Windows and `zsh` on macOS.

If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

If you're using [queue mode](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/), the command runs on the worker that's executing the task in production mode. When running manual executions, it runs on the main instance, unless you set `OFFLOAD_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS_TO_WORKERS` to `true`.

Not available on Cloud

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Node parameters

Configure the node using the following parameters.

### Execute Once

Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).

### Command

Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running [multiple commands](#run-multiple-commands) and [cURL commands](#run-curl-command).

#### Run multiple commands

Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:

- Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.

  ```
  cd bin && ls
  ```

- Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.

  ```
  cd bin
  ls
  ```

#### Run cURL command

You can also use the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to make a cURL request.

If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.

1. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.

   ```
   FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
   USER root
   RUN apk --update add curl
   USER node
   ```

1. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.

   ```
   docker build -t n8n-curl
   ```

1. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.

1. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Execute Command node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Execute Command node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found

This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the **Command** parameter.

To fix this error, review the following:

- Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the **Command** parameter.
- Check that the command is in the `PATH` of the user running n8n.
- If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your command.
  - If n8n is already running:

    ```
    # Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
    docker ps | grep n8n
    # Try to execute the command within the running container
    docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>
    ```

  - If n8n isn't running:

    ```
    # Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
    # Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
    docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>
    ```

## Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded

This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.

To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.

# HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) to use as a [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).

When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.

There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).

Credentials

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Node parameters

### Method

Select the method to use for the request:

- DELETE
- GET
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- PATCH
- POST
- PUT

### URL

Enter the endpoint you want to use.

### Authentication

n8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

#### Predefined credentials

Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

#### Generic credentials

Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method.

You can select one of the following methods:

- Basic auth
- Custom auth
- Digest auth
- Header auth
- OAuth1 API
- OAuth2 API
- Query auth

Refer to [HTTP request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Send Query Parameters

Query parameters act as filters on HTTP requests. If the API you're interacting with supports them and the request you're making needs a filter, turn this option on.

**Specify your query parameters** using one of the available options:

- **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Query Parameters**. To enter more query parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the name of the field you're filtering on, and the value is the filter value.
- **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your query parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Headers

Use this parameter to send headers with your request. Headers contain metadata or context about your request.

**Specify Headers** using one of the available options:

- **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Header Parameters**. To enter more header parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the header you wish to set, and the value is the value you want to pass for that header.
- **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your header parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Body

If you need to send a body with your API request, turn this option on.

Then select the **Body Content Type** that best matches the format for the body content you wish to send.

#### Form URLencoded

Use this option to send your body as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Specify Body** using one of the available options:

- **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Body Parameters**. To enter more body parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name should be the form field name, and the value is what you wish to set that field to.
- **Using Single Field**: Enter your name/value pairs in a single **Body** parameter with format `fieldname1=value1&fieldname2=value2`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### Form-Data

Use this option to send your body as `multipart/form-data`.

Configure your **Body Parameters** by selecting the **Parameter Type**:

- Choose **Form Data** to enter **Name**/**Value** pairs.
- Choose **n8n Binary File** to pull the body from a file the node has access to.
  - **Name**: Enter the ID of the field to set.
  - **Input Data Field Name**: Enter the name of the incoming field containing the binary file data you want to process.

Select **Add Parameter** to enter more parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### JSON

Use this option to send your body as JSON.

**Specify Body** using one of the available options:

- **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Body Parameters**. To enter more body parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**.
- **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your body.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### n8n Binary File

Use this option to send the contents of a file stored in n8n as the body.

Enter the name of the incoming field that contains the file as the **Input Data Field Name**.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance on how to format the file.

#### Raw

Use this option to send raw data in the body.

- **Content Type**: Enter the `Content-Type` header to use for the raw body content. Refer to the IANA [Media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) documentation for a full list of MIME content types.
- **Body**: Enter the raw body content to send.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view and select these options. Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.

### Array Format in Query Parameters

Option availability

This option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.

Use this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:

- **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.
- **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.
- **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.

### Batching

Control how to batch large numbers of input items:

- **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
- **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.

### Ignore SSL Issues

By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.

### Lowercase Headers

Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).

### Redirects

Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.

### Response

Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:

- **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
- **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
- **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
  - **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
  - **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.
  - **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
  - **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.

### Pagination

Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.

Inspect the API data first

Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.

Understand pagination

Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.

For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.

If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.

Configure the pagination settings:

- **Pagination Mode**:
  - **Off**: Turn off pagination.
  - **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
  - **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.

For example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](../../../../code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/).

n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:

| Variable     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$pageCount` | The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.                                                                                                                            |
| `$request`   | The request object sent by the HTTP node.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `$response`  | The response object from the HTTP call. Includes `$response.body`, `$response.headers`, and `$response.statusCode`. The contents of `body` and `headers` depend on the data sent by the API. |

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

- Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
- Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
- The structure of the data that the API returns.

### Proxy

Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.

Enter the **Proxy** the request should use. This takes precedence over global settings defined with the [`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/).

### Timeout

Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.

Enter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.

## Tool-only options

The following options are only available when attached to an [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) as a [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).

### Optimize Response

Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.

When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:

#### JSON

When expecting a **JSON** response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:

- **Field Containing Data**: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
- **Include Fields**: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
  - **All**: Include all fields in the response object.
  - **Selected**: Include only the fields specified below.
    - **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
  - **Exclude**: Include all fields *except* the fields specified below.
    - **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.

#### HTML

When expecting **HTML**, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:

- **Selector (CSS)**: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the `body` element by default.
- **Return Only Content**: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
  - **Elements To Omit**: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
- **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
  - **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

#### Text

When expecting a generic **Text** response, you can optimize the results with the following options:

- **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
  - **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

## Import curl command

[curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.

Import a curl command:

1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.
1. Paste your curl command into the text box.
1. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# HTTP Request node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [HTTP Request node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:

- You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.
- You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](../#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.

Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.

## The resource you are requesting could not be found

This error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.

This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.

## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON

This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.

To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:

- Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.

- If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:

  ```
  {{
      {
      "myjson":
      {
          "name1": "value1",
          "name2": "value2",
          "array1":
              ["value1","value2"]
      }
      }
  }}
  ```

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.

To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:

- Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
- Format your generic credential in a different way.
- Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.

## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](../../../rate-limits/) page.

To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:

### Batching

Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.

### Retry on Fail

Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.

1. In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.
1. Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
1. Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`.

# Remove Duplicates node

Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:

- identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution
- identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions

This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.

Major changes in 1.64.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).

## Operation modes

The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:

- **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.
- **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.
- **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input

When you set the "Operations" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters

When using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:

- **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
  - **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.
  - **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
  - **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options

If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:

- **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).
- **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions

When you set the "Operation" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:

- **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:

  - **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.
  - **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.
  - **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.

- **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:

  - When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.
  - When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.
  - When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:

- **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:
  - **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.
  - **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use "workflow" scope. n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to "node" scope independently.

When you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:

- **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.

### Clear Deduplication History

When you set the "Operation" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the "Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions" operation uses.

#### Clear Deduplication History parameters

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:

- **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:
  - **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.

#### Clear Deduplication History options

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:

- **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.
  - **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.
  - **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

## Set up sample data using the Code node

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Remove Duplicates node.

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Manual Trigger node.

1. In the Code node, set **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item** and **Language** to **JavaScript**.

1. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript** field:

   ```
   let data =[];

   return {
     data: [
       { id: 1, name: 'Taylor Swift', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z' },
       { id: 2, name: 'Ed Sheeran', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z' },
       { id: 3, name: 'Adele', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z' },
       { id: 4, name: 'Bruno Mars', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z' },
       { id: 1, name: 'Taylor Swift', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z' },  // duplicate
       { id: 5, name: 'Billie Eilish', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z' },
       { id: 6, name: 'Katy Perry', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z' },
       { id: 2, name: 'Ed Sheeran', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z' },  // duplicate
       { id: 7, name: 'Lady Gaga', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z' },
       { id: 8, name: 'Rihanna', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z' },
       { id: 3, name: 'Adele', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z' },  // duplicate
       //{ id: 9, name: 'Tom Hanks', job: 'Actor', last_updated: '2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z' },
       //{ id: 0, name: 'Madonna', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z' },
       //{ id: 15, name: 'Bob Dylan', job: 'Folk singer', last_updated: '2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z'},
       //{ id: 10, name: 'Harry Nilsson', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2020-10-17T17:11:38.493Z' },
       //{ id: 11, name: 'Kylie Minogue', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z'},
     ]
   }
   ```

1. Add a Split Out node to the canvas and connect it to the Code node.

1. In the Split Out node, enter `data` in the **Fields To Split Out** field.

## Removing duplicates from the current input

1. Add a Remove Duplicates node to the canvas and connect it to the Split Out node. Choose **Remove items repeated within current input** as the **Action** to start.
1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and ensure that the **Operation** is set to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**.
1. Choose **All fields** in the **Compare** field.
1. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items that have the same data across all fields. Your output in table view should look like this:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |
| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |
| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |

5. Open the Remove Duplicates node again and change the **Compare** parameter to **Selected Fields**.
1. In the **Fields To Compare** field, enter `job`.
1. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items in the current input that have the same `job` data. Your output in table view should look like this:

| **id** | **name**     | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran   | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |

## Keep items where the value is new

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
1. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is New**.
1. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.name }}`.
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |
| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |
| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |

Items are only compared against previous executions

The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input *and* across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the **Remove Items Repated Within Current Input** operation and the second to use the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation.

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains the one new record from the Code node:

| **id** | **name**  | **job** | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| 9      | Tom Hanks | Actor   | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the items processed by the previous execution:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
1. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is higher than any previous value

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
1. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**.
1. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.id }}`.
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Madonna" and "Bob Dylan."
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Bob Dylan." n8n keeps this item because its `id` column value (15) is higher than any previous values (the previous maximum value was 9):

| **id** | **name**  | **job**     | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 15     | Bob Dylan | Folk singer | 2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the 13 items with an `id` column value equal to or less than the previous maximum value (9). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Madonna" because its `id` value isn't larger than the previous maximum value:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Harry Nilsson" and "Kylie Minogue."

1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Kylie Minogue." n8n keeps this item because its `last_updated` column value (`2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z`) is later than any previous values (the previous latest date was `2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`):

# Schedule Trigger node

Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

You must publish the workflow

If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and publish the workflow.

Timezone settings

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information.
1. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

## Node parameters

Add **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.

Use the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:

- [Seconds trigger interval](#seconds-trigger-interval)
- [Minutes trigger interval](#minutes-trigger-interval)
- [Hours trigger interval](#hours-trigger-interval)
- [Days trigger interval](#days-trigger-interval)
- [Weeks trigger interval](#weeks-trigger-interval)
- [Months trigger interval](#months-trigger-interval)
- [Custom (Cron) interval](#custom-cron-interval)

You can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.

Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to [Templates and examples](#templates-and-examples) for further examples.

### Seconds trigger interval

- **Seconds Between Triggers**: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.

### Minutes trigger interval

- **Minutes Between Triggers**: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.

### Hours trigger interval

- **Hours Between Triggers**: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.

### Days trigger interval

- **Days Between Triggers**: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `15` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.

### Weeks trigger interval

- **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger on Weekdays**: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers**, **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays**, **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.

### Months trigger interval

- **Months Between Triggers**: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger at Day of Month**: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers**, `28` **Trigger at Day of Month**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `0` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.

### Custom (Cron) interval

Enter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples

| Type                | Cron Expression    | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Every X Seconds     | `*/10 * * * * *`   | Every 10 seconds.                                            |
| Every X Minutes     | `*/5 * * * *`      | Every 5 minutes.                                             |
| Hourly              | `0 * * * *`        | Every hour on the hour.                                      |
| Daily               | `0 6 * * *`        | At 6:00 AM every day.                                        |
| Weekly              | `0 12 * * 1`       | At noon every Monday.                                        |
| Monthly             | `0 0 1 * *`        | At midnight on the 1st of every month.                       |
| Every X Days        | `0 0 */3 * *`      | At midnight every 3rd day.                                   |
| Only Weekdays       | `0 9 * * 1-5`      | At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday.                            |
| Custom Hourly Range | `0 9-17 * * *`     | Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day.                |
| Quarterly           | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October. |

Using variables in the Cron expression

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is published. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is published, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, unpublish the workflow and then re-publish it.

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

| (\*)     | \*     | \*   | \*           | \*    | \*                   |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | ------------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| (second) | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week(Sun-Sat) |

## Templates and examples

[Browse Schedule Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/schedule-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Schedule Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Schedule Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Invalid cron expression

This error occurs when you set **Trigger Interval** to **Custom (Cron)** and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.

To debug, check that the following:

- That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](../#custom-cron-interval)
- That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](../#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)

## Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time

If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.

### Adjust the timezone globally

If you're using [n8n Cloud](../../../../../manage-cloud/overview/), follow the instructions on the [set the Cloud instance timezone](../../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.

If you're [self hosting](../../../../../hosting/), set your global timezone using the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/).

### Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow

To set the timezone for an individual workflow:

1. Open the workflow on the canvas.
1. Select the **Three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Change the **Timezone** setting.
1. Select **Save**.

### Variables not working as expected

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is published. After publishing the workflow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then publish a new version of the workflow to apply the updated variable value.

### Changing the trigger interval

You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is published. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then publish a new version of the workflow.

Also, the schedule begins from the time when you publish the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and publish a new version of the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you published it.

# Webhook node

Use the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.

You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.

The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.

## Workflow development process

n8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](workflow-development/) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Webhook URLs

The Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab

- **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you publish the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### HTTP Method

The Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):

- DELETE

- GET

- HEAD

- PATCH

- POST

- PUT

  Webhook max payload

  The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.

### Path

By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

- `/:variable`
- `/path/:variable`
- `/:variable/path`
- `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
- `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Supported authentication methods

You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Basic auth
- Header auth
- JWT auth
- None

Refer to [Webhook credentials](../../credentials/webhook/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Respond

- **Immediately**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.
- **When Last Node Finishes**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.
- **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support in the workflow (for example, the [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node).

### Response Code

Customize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.

### Response Data

Choose what data to include in the response body:

- **All Entries**: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
- **First Entry JSON**: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
- **First Entry Binary**: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
- **No Response Body**: The Webhook returns without a body.

Applies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.

- **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.
- **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
- **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
- **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IP addresses outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
- **No Response Body**: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
- **Raw Body**: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
- **Response Content-Type**: Choose the format for the webhook body.
- **Response Data**: Send custom data with the response.
- **Response Headers**: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
- **Property Name**: by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.

## How n8n secures HTML responses

Starting with n8n version 1.103.0, n8n automatically wraps HTML responses to webhooks in `<iframe>` tags. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

# Common issues and questions

Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](../) and suggested solutions.

## Listen for multiple HTTP methods

By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:

1. Open the node **Settings**.
1. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.
1. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.

The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.

## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node

The [HTTP Request](../../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.

1. Create a new workflow.
1. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
1. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
1. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.
1. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
1. Execute the HTTP Request node.

## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node

You can use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.

Note

In the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.\
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.

Make an HTTP request without any parameters:

```
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
```

Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:

```
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'
```

Make an HTTP request with header parameter:

```
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'
```

Make an HTTP request to send a file:

```
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'
```

Replace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.

## Send a response of type string

By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:

1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.
1. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.
1. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.
1. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.
1. Connect an [Edit Fields node](../../n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.
1. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.
1. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
1. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.
1. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).

When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.

## Test URL versus Production URL

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.

| **URL type**   | **How to trigger**                                                         | **Listening duration**        | **Data shown in editor UI?** |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Test URL       | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds                   |                              |
| Production URL | Publish the workflow                                                       | Until workflow is unpublished |                              |

Refer to [Workflow development](../workflow-development/) for more information.

## IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect

If you're unable to connect from IP addresses in your IP whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.

If so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.

## Only one webhook per path and method

n8n only permits registering one webhook for each path and HTTP method combination (for example, a `GET` request for `/my-request`). This avoids ambiguity over which webhook should receive requests.

If you receive a message that the path and method you chose are already in use, you can either:

- Unpublish the workflow with the conflicting webhook.
- Change the webhook path and/or method for one of the conflicting webhooks.

## Timeouts on n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud uses Cloudflare to protect against malicious traffic. If your webhook doesn't respond within 100 seconds, the incoming request will fail with a [524 status code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-524/).

Because of this, for long-running processes that might exceed this limit, you may need to introduce polling logic by configuring two separate webhooks:

- One webhook to start the long-running process and send an immediate response.
- A second webhook that you can call at intervals to query the status of the process and retrieve the result once it's complete.

# Workflow development

The [Webhook node](../) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.

Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.

When using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](../../../../../hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:

- [npm with tunnel](../../../../../hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)
- [Docker with tunnel](../../../../../hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)

[](/_video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4)

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then publish your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.

When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and published the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.

Refer to [Create a workflow](../../../../../workflows/create/) for more information on publishing workflows.

# Chat Trigger node

Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.

You must connect either an agent or chain [root node](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

Workflow execution usage

Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.

Manual Chat trigger

This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.

## Node parameters

### Make Chat Publicly Available

Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).

Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to publish the workflow and allow users to access the chat.

#### Mode

Choose how users access the chat. Select from:

- **Hosted Chat**: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the [node options](#node-options) and don't have to do any other setup.
- **Embedded Chat**: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.

#### Authentication

Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:

- **None**: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
- **Basic Auth**: The chat uses basic authentication.
  - Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
- **n8n User Auth**: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.

#### Initial Message(s)

This parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.

### Make Available in n8n Chat

Choose whether to make the agent available to Chat Hub.

#### Agent Name

The name of the agent on Chat Hub.

#### Agent description

The description of the agent on Chat Hub.

## Node options

Available options depend on the chat mode.

### Hosted chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle

Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

View screenshot

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

View screenshot

#### Response Mode

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

- **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
- **Using Response Nodes**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in a [Chat](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/) node or [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node. In this response mode, the Chat Trigger will solely show messages as defined in these nodes and not output the data from the last node executed in the workflow.

Using Response Nodes

This mode replaces the 'Using Respond to Webhook Node' mode from version 1.2 of the Chat Trigger node.

- **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support in the workflow (for example, the [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node).

#### Require Button Click to Start Chat

Set whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

View screenshot

### Embedded chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

- **Using Response Nodes**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in a [Chat](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/) node or [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node. In this response mode, the Chat Trigger will solely show messages as defined in these nodes and not output the data from the last node executed in the workflow.

Using Response Nodes

This mode replaces the 'Using Respond to Webhook Node' mode from version 1.2 of the Chat Trigger node.

- **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support enabled.

## Set the chat response manually

You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.

In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.

If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.

Chat node

When you are using a [Chat](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/) node to manually create the response sent to the user, you must set the Chat Trigger response mode to 'Using Response Nodes'.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

# Chat Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Chat Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node

When [embedding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.

To do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:

```
createChat({
	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
	metadata: {
		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
	};
});
```

The `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's [data processing features](../../../../../data/).

## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages

When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.

In Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](../#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:

1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
1. Attach a **Simple Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.
1. Attach the same **Simple Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.
1. In the **Simple Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.

One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.

If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

### Supported authentication methods

- Role Assumption

### Related resources

Refer to [AWS's IAM Role documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) and [STS AssumeRole documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) for more information about role assumption.

### Understanding AWS Role Assumption

AWS Role Assumption allows you to securely access AWS resources by temporarily assuming an IAM role, rather than using long-lived access keys. This follows AWS security best practices and enables:

- **Cross-account access:** Access resources in different AWS accounts
- **Enhanced security:** Use temporary credentials that automatically expire
- **Principle of least privilege:** Grant only the permissions needed for specific tasks
- **Audit trail:** Better tracking of who accessed what resources

### Setting up AWS Assume Role credentials

To configure this credential, you'll need:

#### Required Parameters

- **Region:** The AWS region in which to call the STS service to assume the role.
- **Role ARN:** The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role you want to assume. It has the format `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole`. This role must have a trust policy that allows your credentials to assume it.
- **External ID:** A unique identifier required by the role's trust policy to prevent the "confused deputy" problem. This should be a secret value that you generate and configure in both the role's trust policy and this credential. Treat this value as sensitive. Don't share it with other n8n users you don't trust.
- **Role Session Name:** A name for the assumed role session (used for auditing). Default values is `n8n-session`. This value appears in AWS CloudTrail logs so you can identify the session.

#### STS credentials (Choose one method)

You have two options for providing credentials to make the STS AssumeRole call:

##### Option 1: Use system credentials (recommended for server deployments)

Enable this option if your n8n server has AWS credentials configured through:

- Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`)
- EC2 instance profile
- ECS task role
- EKS pod identity

This option requires your n8n administrator to enable system credentials access by setting environment variable `N8N_AWS_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS_ACCESS_ENABLED` to `true`

##### Option 2: Manual STS Credentials

If system credentials aren't available, provide these manually:

- **STS Access Key ID:** Access Key ID for an IAM user or role that has permission to assume the target role.
- **STS Secret Access Key:** Secret Access Key corresponding to the STS Access Key ID.
- **STS Session Token** (optional): Session token if using temporary credentials for the STS call.

#### Optional Parameters

- **Custom Endpoints:** If using Amazon VPC, you can specify custom endpoints for AWS services:

  - Rekognition Endpoint
  - Lambda Endpoint
  - SNS Endpoint
  - SES Endpoint
  - SQS Endpoint
  - S3 Endpoint
  - SSM Endpoint

### Setup Steps

1. Create the IAM Role in the target AWS account.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::SOURCE-ACCOUNT:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "your-unique-external-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Configure the credential in n8n. * Select your AWS **Region** * Enter the **Role ARN** of the role you created * Set a unique **External ID** (same as in the trust policy) * Choose your **STS credentials method** * Enter the **Role Session Name** (or use default)
1. **Test the credential** using the built-in test function to verify the role assumption works.

### Security Best Practices

- Use unique External IDs for each credential to prevent unauthorized access.
- Rotate the STS credentials used for role assumption.
- Apply the principle of least privilege to both the assuming credentials and the target role.

1. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) documentation for more information about these and other scopes.
1. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) node:
   - Manage Roles
   - Manage Channels
   - Read Messages/View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Create Public Threads
   - Create Private Threads
   - Send Messages in Threads
   - Send TTS Messages
   - Manage Messages
   - Manage Threads
   - Embed Links
   - Attach Files
   - Read Message History
   - Add Reactions
1. Add the app to your server or test server:
   1. Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.
   1. Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.
   1. Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.
   1. Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.

These steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app) guide for more information on creating an app, especially:

- [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials) for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.
- [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity) for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.

## Using OAuth2

Use this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**
- Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**
- A **Bot Token**

For details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in [Using bot](#using-bot) above.

Then:

1. Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.
1. Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.
1. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.

## Using webhook

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Webhook URL**: Generated once you create a webhook.

To get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:

1. Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.
1. Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.
1. Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.
1. Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.
1. In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.
1. Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for more information.

## Choose an authentication method

The simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.

A **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.

**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server.

- App access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

- An app **Access Token**
- An optional **App Secret**: Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload.

There are five steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.
1. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.
1. [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).
1. Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).
1. [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
1. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
1. Select **Business** and **Next**.
1. Complete the essential information:
   - Add an **App name**.
   - Add an **App contact email**.
   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.
1. The **Webhooks** product opens.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).

1. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.

1. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.

1. Select **Generate Access Token**.

1. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

   App unavailable

   You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.

1. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.

1. Save your n8n credential.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

### Configure the Facebook Trigger

Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:

1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.
1. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
1. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.
1. Select **Execute step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.
1. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.
1. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
   1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.
   1. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.
   1. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
   1. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
   1. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.

Refer to the [Facebook Trigger node](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.

### Optional: Add an App Secret

For added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.

To generate an App Secret:

1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.
1. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
1. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.
1. **Save** your n8n credential.

Refer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret) for more information.

### App review

App Review requires Business Verification.

Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:

- Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
- Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.

If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.

As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.

Refer to Meta's [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review) and [Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels#advanced-access) documentation for more information.

## Common issues

### Unverified apps limit

Facebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.

Refer to [Limitations | Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app#limitations) if you're over that limit.

# Facebook Graph API credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Facebook Graph API](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi/)

Facebook Trigger credentials

If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) node, follow the instructions mentioned in the [Facebook App credentials](../facebookapp/) documentation.

## Supported authentication methods

- App access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

- An app **Access Token**

There are two steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the products you need to access.
1. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
1. Select the **Use case** that aligns with how you wish to use the Facebook Graph API. For example, for products in Meta's **Business** suite (like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Marketing API, App Events, Audience Network, Commerce API, Fundraisers, Jobs, Threat Exchange, and Webhooks), select **Other**, then select **Next**.
1. Select **Business** and **Next**.
1. Complete the essential information:
   - Add an **App name**.
   - Add an **App contact email**.
   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select the products that make sense for your app and configure them.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to use with your n8n credential and the products you selected:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).

1. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.

1. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.

1. Select **Generate Access Token**.

1. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

   App unavailable

   You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.

1. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

# Facebook Lead Ads credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To get both, [create a Meta app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) with either the Facebook Login product or the Facebook Login for Business product.

To create your app and set up the credential with **Facebook Login for Business**:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
1. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
1. Select **Business** and **Next**.
1. Complete the essential information:
   - Add an **App name**.
   - Add an **App contact email**.
   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **Facebook Login for Business**. The **Settings** page for this product opens.
1. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential.
1. In your Meta app settings in **Client OAuth settings**, paste that URL as the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Copy the **App ID** and enter it as the **Client ID** within your n8n credential.
1. Copy the **App Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** within your n8n credential.

Your credential should successfully connect now, but you'll need to go through the steps to take your Meta app live before you can use it with the [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger/). Here's a summary of what you'll need to do:

1. In your Meta app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. Facebook Login for Business requires Advanced Access for `public_profile`. To add it, go to **App Review > Permissions and Features**.
1. Search for `public_profile` and select **Request advanced access**.
1. Complete the steps for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-verified-for-business/).
1. Use the [Lead Ads Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) to trigger some demo form submissions and test your workflow.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

- OAuth2 (generic credential type)
- Query auth (generic credential type)

Refer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) for more information relating to generic credential types.

Predefined credential types

n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

You can use [Predefined credential types](../../../custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using predefined credential type

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
1. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
1. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
   1. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using basic auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
- The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using digest auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
- The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using header auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
- The **Value** for the header

Read more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication)

## Using bearer auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports bearer authentication. This authentication type is actually just header authentication with the `Name` set to `Authorization` and the `Value` set to `Bearer <token>`.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The **Bearer Token** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting

Read more about [bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).

## Using OAuth1

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.
- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.
- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.
- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.
- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:
  - **HMAC-SHA1**
  - **HMAC-SHA256**
  - **HMAC-SHA512**

For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html).

## Using OAuth2

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.

For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

### Authorization Code grant type

Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### Client Credentials grant type

Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.
- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### PKCE grant type

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

To configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

## Using query auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)

To configure this credential, enter:

- A query parameter key or **Name**
- A query parameter **Value**

## Using custom auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.

The **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.

### Sending two headers

```
{
	"headers": {
		"X-AUTH-USERNAME": "username",
		"X-AUTH-PASSWORD": "password"
	}
}
```

### Body

```
{
	 "body" : {
		"user": "username",
		"pass": "password"
	}
}
```

### Query string

```
{
	"qs": { 
		"appid": "123456",
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
```

### Sending header and query string

```
{
	"headers": {
		"api-version": "202404"
	},
	"qs": {
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
```

## Provide an SSL certificate

You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:

1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.
1. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.

To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:

- The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle
- The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
- The **Private Key** (KEY)
- *Optional:* If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.

If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:

- Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**
- Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on a [Microsoft SQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-is-sql-server) database.

## Supported authentication methods

- SQL database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/connect-to-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=sqldb#connect-to-sql-server) for more information about connecting to the service.

## Using SQL database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Server** name
- The **Database** name
- Your **User** account/ID
- Your **Password**
- The **Port** to use for the connection
- The **Domain** name
- Whether to use **TLS**
- Whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**
- The **Connect Timeout**
- The **Request Timeout**
- The **TDS Version** the connection should use

To set up the database connection:

1. Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:

   - In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.
   - In the footer of a query window.
   - Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.
   - Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server) for more information. You can also find the information in the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server).

1. Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the **Database** name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.

   - If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.

1. Enter your **User** account name or ID.

1. Enter your **Password**.

1. For the **Port**:

   - SQL Server defaults to `1433`.
   - If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server) for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.

1. You only need to enter the **Domain** name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:

   ```
   SELECT DEFAULT_DOMAIN()[DomainName];
   ```

1. Select whether to use **TLS**.

1. Select whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

1. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the **Connect Timeout**. Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout) for more information.

   - SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.

1. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation) for more information.

1. Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a) for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:

   - **7_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)**: TDS version 7.4.
   - **7_3_B (SQL Server 2008R2)**: TDS version 7.3.B.
   - **7_3_A (SQL Server 2008)**: TDS version 7.3.A.
   - **7_2 (SQL Server 2005)**: TDS version 7.2.
   - **7_1 (SQL Server 2000)**: TDS version 7.1.

For the n8n credentials to function with this setting enabled, add all the [n8n IP addresses](../../../../manage-cloud/cloud-ip/) as whitelisted IPs in MSG91. You can add them in one of two places, depending on your desired security level:

- To allow any/all authkeys in the account to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Company's whitelisted IPs** section of the **Authkey** page.
- To allow only specific authkeys to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Whitelisted IPs** section of an authkey's details.

# MySQL credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MySQL](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)
- [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)

Agent node users

The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server database.

## Supported authentication methods

- Database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The server **Host**: The database's host name or IP address.
- The **Database** name.
- A **User** name.
- A **Password** for that user.
- The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.
- **Connect Timeout**: The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.
- **SSL**: If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.
- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.

To set up your database connection credential:

1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:

   ```
   SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';
   ```

1. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:

   ```
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

1. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.

1. Enter the **Password** for that user.

1. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:

   ```
   SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';
   ```

1. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `10000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 1000 before entering it in n8n:

   ```
   SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';
   ```

1. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:

   1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.
   1. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.
   1. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.

1. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:

   1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
      - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
      - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.
   1. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   1. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   1. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   1. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.

Refer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Internal vs. public integrations

**Internal** integrations are:

- Specific to a single workspace.
- Accessible only to members of that workspace.
- Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.

Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

- Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
- Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
- Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.

For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations).

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [OracleDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.oracledb/)
- [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)

Note

These nodes do not support SSH tunnels. They require Oracle Database **19c or later**. For advanced Oracle Database features like Transparent Application Continuity (TAC) and Sharding, they also require Oracle Client Libraries **19c or later**.

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on an [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-F0246961-558F-480B-AC0F-14B50134621C) server.

## Supported authentication methods

- Database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [Oracle Database documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** name.
- A **Password** for that user.
- **Connection String**: The Oracle Database instance to connect to. The string can be an Easy Connect string, or a TNS Alias from a tnsnames.ora file, or the Oracle Database instance.
- **Use Optional Oracle Client Libraries**: If you want to work with Oracle Database advanced features, turn this on. This option internally uses node-oracledb Thick mode. Additional settings to enable node-oracledb Thick mode are required. Refer to [Enabling Thick mode documentation](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/initialization.html#enabling-node-oracledb-thick-mode) for more information. This option is not available in the official n8n docker images.
- **Use SSL**: If your Connection String is using SSL, turn this on and configure additional details for the SSL Authentication.
- **Wallet Password**: The password to decrypt the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)-encoded private certificate, if it is encrypted.
- **Wallet Content**: The security credentials required to establish a mutual TLS (mTLS) connection to Oracle Database.
- **Distinguished Name**: The distinguished name (DN) that should be matched with the certificate DN.
- **Match Distinguished Name**: Whether the server certificate DN should be matched in addition to the regular certificate verification that is performed.
- **Allow Weak Distinguished Name Match**: Whether the secure DN matching behavior which checks both the listener and server certificates has to be performed.
- **Pool Min**: The number of connections established to the database when a pool is created.
- **Pool Max**: The maximum number of connections to which a connection pool can grow.
- **Pool Increment**: The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds the number of currently open connections.
- **Pool Maximum Session Life Time**: The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds the number of currently open connections.
- **Pool Connection Idle Timeout**: The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds the number of currently open connections.
- **Connection Class Name**: DRCP/PRCP Connection Class. Refer to [Enabling DRCP](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/admin/managing-processes.html#GUID-BB76E57C-3F16-4C85-AEF6-BA14FC1B4777) for more information.
- **Connection Timeout**: The timeout duration in seconds for an application to establish an Oracle Net connection.
- **Transport Connection Timeout**: The maximum number of seconds to wait to establish a connection to the database host.
- **Keepalive Probe Interval**: The number of minutes between the sending of keepalive probes.

To set up your database connection credential:

1. Enter your database's username as the **User** in your n8n credential.

1. Enter the user's **Password**.

1. Enter your database's connection string as the **Connection String** in your n8n credential.

1. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to configure **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information of your Oracle Database SSL certificate in these fields:

   1. Enter the wallet password, if any, in the **Wallet Password** field.
   1. Enter PEM-encoded wallet file, **ewallet.pem** contents in the 'Expanded' layout of the **Wallet Content** field. This will ensure that all the whitespaces from the PEM-encoded wallet file are retained. Direct copy-paste into the **Wallet Content** field will strip out the whitespaces and lead to connection errors.

## guest user issues

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:

```
[error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost
```

This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

- Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
- Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to ["guest" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information.

# Salesforce credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Salesforce](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/)
- [Salesforce trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforcetrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods

- JWT
- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Salesforce's developer documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm) for more information about the service.

## Using JWT

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account and:

- Your **Environment Type** (Production or Sandbox)
- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a connected app.
- Your Salesforce **Username**
- A **Private Key** for a self-signed digital certificate

To set things up, first you'll create a private key and certificate, then a connected app:

1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
1. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
1. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
1. You'll need a private key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Use your own key/cert or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate. Refer to the Salesforce [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm) for instructions on creating your own key and certificate.
1. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
1. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
1. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) documentation for more information.
1. Check the box to **Enable OAuth Settings**.
1. For the **Callback URL**, enter `http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`.
1. Check the box to **Use digital signatures**.
1. Select **Choose File** and upload the file that contains your digital certificate, such as `server.crt`.
1. Add these **OAuth scopes**:
   - **Full access (full)**
   - **Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
1. Select **Save**, then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
1. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
1. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
1. Enter the contents of the private key file in n8n as **Private Key**.
   - Use the multi-line editor in n8n.

   - Enter the private key in standard PEM key format:

     ```
     -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
     KEY DATA GOES HERE
     -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
     ```

These steps are what's required on the n8n side. Salesforce recommends setting refresh token policies, session policies, and OAuth policies too:

14. In Salesforce, select **Back to Manage Connected Apps**.
01. Select **Manage**.
01. Select **Edit Policies**.
01. Review the **Refresh Token Policy** field. Salesforce recommends using expire refresh token after 90 days.
01. In the **Session Policies** section, Salesforce recommends setting **Timeout Value** to 15 minutes.
01. In the **OAuth Policies** section, select **Admin approved users are pre-authorized for permitted users** for **Permitted Users**, and select **OK**.
01. Select **Save**.
01. Select **Manage Profiles**, select the profiles that are pre-authorized to use this connected app, and select **Save**.
01. Select **Manage Permission Sets** to select the permission sets. Create permission sets if necessary.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Cloud and hosted users will need to select your **Environment Type**. Choose between **Production** and **Sandbox**.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a connected app:

1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
1. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
1. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
1. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
1. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
1. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) documentation for more information.

   - **Require Secret for Refresh Token Flow**
1. Select **Save**, then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
1. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
1. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
1. Copy the **Consumer Secret** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client Secret**.

These steps are what's required on the n8n side. Salesforce recommends setting refresh token policies and session policies, too:

14. In Salesforce, select **Back to Manage Connected Apps**.
01. Select **Manage**.
01. Select **Edit Policies**.
01. Review the **Refresh Token Policy** field. Salesforce recommends using expire refresh token after 90 days.

## Common issues

### Connection issues when authenticating with Salesforce from n8n Cloud

If you encounter connection issues when authenticating with Salesforce from n8n Cloud, you might need to enable a specific system permission in your Salesforce user profiles:

1. In Salesforce, go to **Setup**.
1. In the **Quick Find** box, search for `Profiles`.
1. Select the profile used by the user connecting to n8n (for example, System Administrator or the relevant profile).
1. Click **Edit** or use the new **Profile** interface if it's available.
1. Locate the **Administrative Permissions** section.
1. Enable the checkbox for **Approve Connected Apps for Non-Admins**. This checkbox might also appear as **Approve apps connected not installed** depending on your Salesforce language or translation.
1. Click **Save**.

This permission is not enabled by default, even for administrator profiles, and must be manually activated. Without this permission, you might experience authentication failures when trying to connect n8n to Salesforce.

## Common issues

Here are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Enable custom app development

If you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.

To enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:

1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).
1. Select **Develop apps**.
1. Select **Allow custom app development**.
1. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.

### Forbidden credentials error

If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.

1. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for a list of recommended scopes.
1. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
1. Select **Allow**.
1. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
1. If you're using this credential for the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/), follow the steps in [Slack Trigger configuration](#slack-trigger-configuration) to finish setting up your app.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information.

### Slack Trigger configuration

To use your Slack app with the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node:

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps/) in Slack and select the app you want to use.

1. Go to **Features** > **Event Subscriptions**.

1. Turn on the **Enable Events** control.

1. In n8n, copy the **Webhook URL** and enter it as the **Request URL** in your Slack app.

   Request URL

   Slack only allows one request URL per app. If you want to test your workflow, you'll need to do one of the following:

   - Test with your **Test URL** first, then change your Slack app to use the **Production URL** once you've verified everything's working
   - Use the **Production URL** with execution logging.

1. Once verified, select the bot events to subscribe to. Use the **Trigger on** field in n8n to filter these requests.

   - To use an event not in the list, add it as a bot event and select **Any Event** in the n8n node.

Refer to [Quickstart | Configuring the app for event listening](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#listening) for more information.

n8n recommends enabling request signature verification for your Slack Trigger for additional security:

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps/) in Slack and select the app you want to use.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Basic Information**.
1. Copy the value of **Signing**.
1. In n8n, Paste this value into the **Signature Secret** field for the credential.

## Using OAuth2

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](../../../../hosting/) and need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To get both, create a Slack app:

1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
1. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
1. Enter an **App Name**.
1. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
1. Select **Create App**. The app details open.
1. In **Settings > Basic Information**, open the **App Credentials** section.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste these into the corresponding fields in n8n.
1. In the left menu under **Features**, select **OAuth & Permissions**.
1. In the **Redirect URLs** section, select **Add New Redirect URL**.
1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the new Redirect URL in Slack.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Save URLs**.
1. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for a list of scopes.
1. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
1. Select **Allow**.
1. At this point, you should be able to select the OAuth button in your n8n credential to connect.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information. Refer to the Slack [Installing with OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) documentation for more details on the OAuth flow itself.

## Scopes

Scopes determine what permissions an app has.

- If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
- If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section.

Here's the list of scopes the OAuth credential requires, which are a good starting point:

| **Scope name**        | **Notes**                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `channels:read`       |                                    |
| `channels:write`      | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `channels:history`    |                                    |
| `chat:write`          |                                    |
| `files:read`          |                                    |
| `files:write`         |                                    |
| `groups:read`         |                                    |
| `groups:history`      |                                    |
| `im:read`             |                                    |
| `im:history`          |                                    |
| `mpim:read`           |                                    |
| `mpim:history`        |                                    |
| `reactions:read`      |                                    |
| `reactions:write`     |                                    |

| `stars:write`         | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `usergroups:read`     |                                    |
| `usergroups:write`    |                                    |
| `users.profile:read`  |                                    |
| `users.profile:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `users:read`          |                                    |
| `search:read`         |                                    |

## Common issues

### Token expired

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

# seven credentials

## Related resources

Refer to [seven's API documentation](https://docs.seven.io/en) for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API key**: Go to **Account > Developer >** [**API Keys**](https://app.seven.io/developer#create-api-key) to create an API key. Refer to [API First Steps](https://docs.seven.io/en/rest-api/first-steps) for more information.

# Snowflake credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Snowflake](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.snowflake/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- [Password](#using-password-authentication)
- [Key-pair](#using-key-pair-authentication)

## Related resources

Refer to [Snowflake's API documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/api-reference) and [SQL Command Reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference-commands) for more information about the service.

## Common configuration fields

Both authentication methods require the following fields:

- An **Account** name: Your account name is the string of characters located between `https://` and `snowflakecomputing.com` in your Snowflake URL. For example, if the URL of your Snowflake account is `https://abc.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com` then the name of your account is `abc.eu-central-1`.
- A **Database**: Enter the name of the [database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-database) the credential should connect to.
- A **Warehouse**: Enter the name of the default virtual [warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-warehouse) to use for the session after connecting. n8n uses this warehouse for performing queries, loading data, and so on.
- A **Schema**: Enter the [schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-schema) you want to use after connecting.
- A **Role**: Enter the security [role](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-role) you want to use after connecting.
- **Client Session Keep Alive**: By default, client connections typically time out three or four hours after the most recent query execution. Turning this setting on sets the `clientSessionKeepAlive` parameter to true: the server will keep the client's connection alive indefinitely, even if the connection doesn't execute any queries.

Refer to [Session Commands](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/commands-session) for more information on these settings.

## Using password authentication

In addition to the [common configuration fields](#common-configuration-fields), password authentication requires:

- A **Username**
- A **Password**

## Using key-pair authentication

Key-pair authentication provides enhanced security as an alternative to password-based authentication. This method uses a public-private key pair for authentication.

In addition to the [common configuration fields](#common-configuration-fields), key-pair authentication requires:

- A **Username**: The Snowflake user that has the public key assigned to it.
- A **Private Key**: The private key in PEM format (PKCS#8). This should be the full content of your private key file, including the `-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----` delimiters (or `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` for unencrypted keys).
- A **Passphrase** (optional): If your private key is encrypted, enter the passphrase used to encrypt it. Leave this field empty if you're using an unencrypted private key.

Refer to [Snowflake's key-pair authentication documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) for more information about generating and configuring key pairs.

In Strapi, the configuration involves two steps:

1. [Configure a role](#configure-a-role).
1. [Create a user account](#create-a-user-account).

Refer to the more detailed instructions below for each step.

### Configure a role

For API access, use the Users & Permissions Plugin in **Settings > Users & Permissions Plugin**.

Refer to [Configuring Users & Permissions Plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings) for more information on the plugin. Refer to [Configuring end-user roles](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles) for more information on roles.

For the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:

- Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions) for more information.
- Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role) for more information.

For either option, once you open the role:

1. Go to the **Permissions** section.
1. Open the section for the relevant collection type.
1. Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:
   - `create` (POST)
   - `find` and `findone` (GET)
   - `update` (PUT)
   - `delete` (DELETE)
1. Repeat for all relevant collection types.
1. Save the role.

Refer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints) for more information on the permission options.

### Create a user account

Now that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:

1. Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.
1. Select **Add new entry**.
1. Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:
   - **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.
   - **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.
   - **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.
   - **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.

Refer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users) for more information.

## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token) for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.

  API tokens permission

  If you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.

- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.

  - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`

- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:

  - **Version 3**
  - **Version 4**

## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key.

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode aren’t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

n8n credentials for both modes

If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.

## Key prefixes

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

- Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
- Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

Publishable keys

Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.

- [Create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app) and configure a valid OAuth Redirect URL. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Twist's API documentation](https://developer.twist.com/v3/#authorization) for more information about authenticating with the service.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create a general integration.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create a general integration.

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret, [create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app).

Use these settings for your integration's **OAuth Authentication**:

- Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.

  OAuth Redirect URL for self-hosted n8n

  Twist doesn't accept a `localhost` Redirect URL. The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. If your n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** contains localhost, refer below to [Local environment redirect URL](#local-environment-redirect-url) for generating a URL that Twist will allow.

- Select **Update OAuth settings** to save those changes.

- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n.

### Local environment redirect URL

Twist doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. These steps should allow you to configure the OAuth credentials for the local environment:

1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```
   ngrok http 5678
   ```

1. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.

   ```
   export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
   ```

1. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.

# X (formerly Twitter) credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [X (formerly Twitter)](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twitter/)

## Prerequisites

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

Deprecation warning

n8n used to support an **OAuth** authentication method, which used X's [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version [0.236.0](../../../../release-notes/0-x/#n8n02360).

## Related resources

Refer to [X's API documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api) for more information about the service. Refer to [X's API authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/overview) for more information about authenticating with the service.

Refer to [Application-only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) for more information about app-only authentication.

## Using OAuth2

Use this method if you're using n8n version 0.236.0 or later.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. In the Twitter [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard), open your project.
1. On the project's **Overview** tab, find the **Apps** section and select **Add App**.
1. Give your app a **Name** and select **Next**.
1. Go to the **App Settings**.
1. In the **User authentication settings**, select **Set Up**.
1. Set the **App permissions**. Choose **Read and write and Direct message** if you want to use all functions of the n8n X node.
1. In the **Type of app** section, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
1. In your X app, find the **App Info** section and paste that URL in as the **Callback URI / Redirect URL**.
1. Add a **Website URL**.
1. Save your changes.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.

Refer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) for more information on working with this authentication method.

X rate limits

This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to [X rate limits](#x-rate-limits) below for more information.

## X rate limits

X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.

Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:

- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.

Refer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth) for more information about these rate limit types.

# Wise credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Wise](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise/)
- [Wise Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wisetrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Wise](https://wise.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API token

## Related resources

Refer to [Wise's API documentation](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference) for more information about the service.

## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Go to your **user menu > Settings > API tokens** to generate an API token. Enter the generated API key in your n8n credential. Refer to [Getting started with the API](https://wise.com/help/articles/2958107/getting-started-with-the-api) for more information.
- Your **Environment**: Select the environment that best matches your Wise account environment.
  - If you're using a Wise test sandbox account, select **Test**.
  - Otherwise, select **Live**.
- **Private Key (Optional)**: For live endpoints requiring Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), generate a public and private key. Enter the private key here. Refer to [Add a private key](#add-a-private-key) for more information.
  - If you're using a **Test** environment, you'll only need to enter a Private Key if you've enabled Strong Customer Authentication on the [public keys management page](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/public-keys).

## Add a private key

Wise protects some live endpoints and operations with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Refer to [Strong Customer Authentication & 2FA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/features/strong-customer-authentication-2fa) for details.

If you make a request to an endpoint that requires SCA, Wise returns a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. The error returned will look like this:

> This request requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Please add a key pair to your account and n8n credentials. See https://api-docs.transferwise.com/#strong-customer-authentication-personal-token

To use endpoints requiring SCA, generate an RSA key pair and add the relevant key information to both Wise and n8n:

1. Generate an RSA key pair:

   ```
   $ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 
   $ openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
   ```

1. Add the content of the public key `public.pem` to your Wise **user menu > Settings > API tokens > Manage public keys**.

1. Add the content of the private key `private.pem` in n8n to the **Private Key (Optional)**.

Refer to [Personal Token SCA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/guides/strong-customer-authentication-2fa/personal-token-sca) for more information.

Gmail and Service Accounts

Google technically supports Service Accounts for use with Gmail, but it requires enabling domain-wide delegation, which Google discourages, and its behavior can be inconsistent.

n8n recommends using OAuth2 with the Gmail node.

# Google: OAuth2 generic

This document contains instructions for creating a generic OAuth2 Google credential for use with [custom operations](../../../../custom-operations/).

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

- [Google Calendar](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
- [Google Contacts](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)
- [Google Mail](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)
- [Google Sheets](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)
- [Google Sheets Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/)
- [Google Tasks](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googletasks/)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the [next section](#enable-apis):

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.

1. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.

1. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.

1. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.

1. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

   - Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
   - Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

   Google Drive API required

   The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

   - Google Docs
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Slides

   Google Vertex AI API

   In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

1. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**. Google will redirect you to the Google Auth Platform overview page.

1. Select **Get started** on the **Overview** tab to begin configuring OAuth consent.

1. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen. Select **Next** to continue.

1. For the **Audience**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy. Select **Continue** and then select **Create**.

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.

1. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain**:

   - If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
   - If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.

1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Make sure you're in the correct project.
1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Select **+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
1. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
1. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
1. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
1. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.

1. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.

1. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:

   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose
   ```

1. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.

1. **Save** your new credentials.

## Video

The following video demonstrates the steps described above:

## Scopes

Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of scopes for all services.

n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

Supported scopes

## Troubleshooting

### Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this:

- If your app **User Type** is **Internal**, create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
- If your app **User Type** is **External**, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app: go to the [**Audience**](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of **Test users**.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

# Google: OAuth2 single service

This document contains instructions for creating a Google credential for a single service. They're also available as a [video](#video).

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

- [Google Calendar](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
- [Google Contacts](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)
- [Google Mail](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)
- [Google Sheets](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)
- [Google Sheets Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/)
- [Google Tasks](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googletasks/)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the [next section](#enable-apis):

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.

1. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.

1. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.

1. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.

1. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

   - Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
   - Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

   Google Drive API required

   The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

   - Google Docs
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Slides

   Google Vertex AI API

   In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

1. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

   Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**. Google will redirect you to the Google Auth Platform overview page.

1. Select **Get started** on the **Overview** tab to begin configuring OAuth consent.

1. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen. Select **Next** to continue.

1. For the **Audience**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy. Select **Continue** and then select **Create**.

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.

1. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain**:

   - If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
   - If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.

1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Make sure you're in the correct project.
1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Select **+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
1. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
1. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
1. **If you're self-hosting:** From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console. If you're using **n8n cloud**, you can leave this field empty as the OAuth setup is pre-configured, and the callback URL is fixed for that configuration.
1. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

- If **self-hosted:**

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
1. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
   - **If n8n cloud:**
1. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
1. **Save** your new credentials.

# Google: Service Account

Using service accounts is more complex than OAuth2. Before you begin:

- Check if your node is [compatible](../#compatible-nodes) with Service Account.
- Make sure you need to use Service Account. For most use cases, [OAuth2](../oauth-single-service/) is a better option.
- Read the Google documentation on [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up Service Account

There are four steps to connecting your n8n credential to a Google Service Account:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Set up Google Cloud Service Account](#set-up-google-cloud-service-account).

1. Select **Create and continue**.

1. Based on your use-case, you may want to **Select a role** and **Grant users access to this service account** using the corresponding sections.

1. Select **Done**.

1. Select your newly created service account under the **Service Accounts** section. Open the **Keys** tab.

1. Select **Add key > Create new key**.

1. In the modal that appears, select **JSON**, then select **CREATE**. Google saves the file to your computer.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. Open the downloaded JSON file.

1. Copy the `client_email` and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Service Account Email**.

1. Copy the `private_key`. Don't include the surrounding `"` marks. Enter this as the **Private Key** in your n8n credential.

   Older versions of n8n

   If you're running an n8n version older than 0.156.0, replace all instances of `\n` in the JSON file with new lines.

1. **Optional**: Choose if you want to [**Impersonate a User**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority) (turned on).

   1. To use this option, you must [Enable domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation) for the service account as a Google Workspace super admin.
   1. Enter the **Email** of the user you want to impersonate.

1. If you plan to use this credential with the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, turn on **Set up for use in HTTP Request node**.

   1. With this setting turned on, you'll need to add **Scope(s)** for the node. n8n prepopulates some scopes. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for more information.

1. **Save** your credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Service Account can't access Google Drive files

No access to my drive

Google no longer allows Service Accounts created after April 15, 2025 to access `my drive`. Service Accounts now only have access to shared drives.

While not recommended, if you need to use a Service Account to access `my drive`, you can do so by [enabling domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation). You can learn more in [this post in the community](https://community.n8n.io/t/please-please-help-upload-file-google-drive-node-with-service-account-not-working/147750/15).

A Service Account can't access Google Drive files and folders that weren't shared with its associated user email.

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and copy your Service Account email.
1. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) and go to the designated file or folder.
1. Right-click on the file or folder and select **Share**.
1. Paste your Service Account email into **Add People and groups**.
1. Select **Editor** for read-write access or **Viewer** for read-only access.

### Enable domain-wide delegation

To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

Not recommended

Google recommends you [avoid using domain-wide delegation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#domain-wide-delegation), as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk.

To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then:

1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/), select the hamburger menu, then select **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.
1. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
1. Select **Add new**.
1. In the **Client ID** field, enter the service account's **Client ID**. To get the Client ID:
   - Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.
   - Copy the **OAuth 2 Client ID** and use this as the **Client ID** for the **Domain Wide Delegation**.
1. In the **OAuth scopes** field, enter a list of comma-separate scopes to grant your application access. For example, if your application needs domain-wide full access to the Google Drive API and the Google Calendar API, enter: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
1. Select **Authorize**.

It can take from 5 minutes up to 24 hours before you can impersonate all users in your Workspace.

# IMAP credentials

# Send Email credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Send Email](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/)

## Prerequisites

- Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.
- Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.

## Supported authentication methods

- SMTP account

## Related resources

Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.

## Using SMTP account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** email address
- A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
- The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The port depends on the encryption method:
- Port `465` for SSL/TLS (implicit encryption)
- Port `587` for STARTTLS (explicit encryption)
- Port `25` for no encryption (not recommended) Check with your email provider for their specific requirements.
- **SSL/TLS**: This toggle controls the encryption method:
- Turn **ON** for port `465` (uses implicit SSL/TLS encryption)
- Turn **OFF** for port `587` (uses STARTTLS explicit encryption)
- Turn **OFF** for port `25` (no encryption)
- **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
- **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.

### Provider instructions

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Facebook Lead Ads Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Facebook Lead Ads only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Facebook Lead Ads overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. From the workflow settings dropdown, click **Unpublish** to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, click **Publish**. The production webhook URL should resume working.

- **Watch Whole Workspace**: Whether the node should watch for the selected **Events** in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default).

  Caution

  This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution!

- **Channel to Watch**: Select the channel your node should watch for the selected **Events**. This parameter only appears if you don't turn on **Watch Whole Workspace**. You can select a channel:

  - **From list**: The node uses your credential to look up a list of channels in the workspace so you can select the channel you want.
  - **By ID**: Enter the ID of a channel you want to watch. Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button.
  - **By URL**: Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as `https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address>`.

- **Download Files**: Whether to download files and use them in the node's output (turned on) or not (turned off, default). Use this parameter with the **File Made Public** and **File Shared** events.

n8n provides an app node for Slack. You can find the node docs [here](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/).

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack-trigger/) on n8n's website.

Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for details about their API.

## Required scopes

To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.

You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.

The node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list) methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](../../credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.

## Verify the webhook

From version `1.106.0`, you can set a [Slack Signing Secret](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack#signing_secrets_admin_page) when configuring your [Slack credentials](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration). When set, the Slack trigger node automatically verifies that requests are from Slack and include a trusted signature. n8n recommends setting this to ensure you only process requests sent from Slack.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
1. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

### Token expired

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

# Google Drive Trigger node

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. It allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/google/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Google Drive Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-drive-trigger/) page.

Manual Executions vs. Activation

On manual executions this node will return the last event matching its search criteria. If no event matches the criteria (for example because you are watching for files to be created but no files have been created so far), an error is thrown. Once saved and activated, the node will regularly check for any matching events and will trigger your workflow for each event found.

## Common issues

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

# Google Drive Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## 401 unauthorized error

The full text of the error looks like this:

```
401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}
```

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

1. For [OAuth2](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Google Drive API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
1. For [Service Account](../../../credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
   1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
   1. Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Handling more than one file change

The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default).

If multiple changes to the **Watch For** criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item.

You can use an [if node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or a [switch node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

# Google Sheets Trigger node

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets) is a web-based spreadsheet program that's part of Google's office software suite within its Google Drive service.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/google/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Google Sheets Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-sheets-trigger/) page.

## Events

- Row added
- Row updated
- Row added or updated

## Related resources

Refer to [Google Sheet's API documentation](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) for more information about the service.

n8n provides an app node for Google Sheets. You can find the node docs [here](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).

# Google Sheets Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers

Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.

The [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).

To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added**:

1. Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
1. Select **Add option**.
1. Select **DateTime Render**.
1. Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.

The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.

The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value.

# Telegram Trigger node

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is a cloud-based instant messaging and voice over IP service. Users can send messages and exchange photos, videos, stickers, audio, and files of any type. On this page, you'll find a list of events the Telegram Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/telegram/).

# Telegram Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook

This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.

To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.

## Workflow only works in testing or production

Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.

To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.

To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# n8n community node blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

- The node is intentionally malicious
- It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)

If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact \[hello@n8n.io\](mailto: hello@n8n.io).

# Building community nodes

Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

- n8n recommends using the [`n8n-node` CLI tool](../../creating-nodes/build/n8n-node/) to build and test your node. In particular, this is important if you plan on [submitting your node for verification](../../creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n). This ensures that your node has the correct structure and follows community node requirements. It also simplifies linting and testing.
- View [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for examples of patterns you can use in your nodes.
- Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](../../creating-nodes/overview/).
- Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

## Standards

Developing with the [`n8n-node` tool](../../creating-nodes/build/n8n-node/) ensures that your node adheres to the following standards required to make your node available in the n8n community node repository:

- Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
- Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
- Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute.
- Check your node using the linter (`npm run lint`) and test it locally (`npm run dev`) to ensure it works.
- Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

## Submit your node for verification by n8n

n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.

Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:

- Start from the [`n8n-node` tool](../../creating-nodes/build/n8n-node/) generated scaffolding. While this isn't strictly required, n8n strongly suggests using the `n8n-node` CLI tool for any community node you plan to submit for verification. Using the tool ensures that your node follows the expected conventions and adheres to the community node requirements.
- Make sure that your node follows the [technical guidelines for verified community nodes](../../creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines/) and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
- Ensure that your node follows the [UX guidelines](../../creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
- Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files) or a related public repository.
- Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.

## Ready to submit?

If your node meets all the above requirements, sign up or log in to the [n8n Creator Portal](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes) and submit your node for verification. Note that n8n reserves the right to reject nodes that compete with any of n8n's paid features, especially enterprise functionality.

# Risks when using community nodes

Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

- System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
- Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
- Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

n8n vets verified community nodes

In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](../installation/verified-install/). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.

## Report bad community nodes

You can report bad community nodes to \[security@n8n.io\](mailto: security@n8n.io)

## Disable community nodes

If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`. On n8n cloud, visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) and disable community nodes from there. See [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) for more information.

# Troubleshooting and errors

## Error: Missing packages

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

- Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](../../../hosting/installation/docker/) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
- Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.

## Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud

If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) > **Manage** and toggle **Disable all community nodes** to **`true`**. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.

# Using community nodes

To use community nodes, you first need to [install](../installation/) them.

## Adding community nodes to your workflow

After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel. n8n marks community nodes with a **Package** icon in the nodes panel.

## Community nodes with duplicate names

It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.

# Install and manage community nodes

There are three ways to install community nodes:

- Within n8n using the [nodes panel](verified-install/) (for verified community nodes only).
- Within n8n [using the GUI](gui-install/): Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
- [Manually from the command line](manual-install/): use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.

Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances

Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](../../../hosting/) n8n.

# Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app

Owner and Admin users only

Only users with an Owner or Admin role can install and manage community nodes from npm on a self-hosted n8n instance. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.

## Install a community node

To install a community node from npm:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**.
1. Select **Install**.
1. Find the node you want to install:
   1. Select **Browse**. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword `n8n-community-node-package`.
   1. Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
   1. Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
   1. Return to n8n.
1. Enter the npm package name, and version number if required. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.
   - To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter `n8n-nodes-storms` in **Enter npm package name**.
   - To install version 2.3: enter `n8n-node-storms@2.3` in **Enter npm package name**.
1. Agree to the [risks](../../risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.**
1. Select **Install**. n8n installs the node, and returns to the **Community Nodes** list in **Settings**.

Nodes on the blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to [n8n community node blocklist](../../blocklist/) for more information.

## Uninstall a community node

To uninstall a community node:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community nodes**.
1. On the node you want to install, select **Options** .
1. Select **Uninstall package**.
1. Select **Uninstall Package** in the confirmation modal.

## Upgrade a community node

Breaking changes in versions

Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](#downgrade-a-community-node).

### Upgrade to the latest version

You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in **Settings** > **community nodes**.

When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an **Update** button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.

### Upgrade to a specific version

To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the [Installation](#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

## Downgrade a community node

If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.

To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the [Installation](#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

# Manually install community nodes from npm

You can manually install community nodes from the npm registry on self-hosted n8n.

You need to manually install community nodes in the following circumstances:

- Your n8n instance runs in queue mode.
- You want to install [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-private-packages).

## Install a community node

Access your Docker shell:

```
docker exec -it n8n sh
```

Create `~/.n8n/nodes` if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:

```
mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
```

Install the node:

```
npm i n8n-nodes-nodeName
```

Then restart n8n.

## Uninstall a community node

Access your Docker shell:

```
docker exec -it n8n sh
```

Run npm uninstall:

```
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName
```

## Upgrade a community node

Breaking changes in versions

Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](#upgrade-or-downgrade-to-a-specific-version).

### Upgrade to the latest version

Access your Docker shell:

```
docker exec -it n8n sh
```

Run npm update:

```
npm update n8n-nodes-nodeName
```

### Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version

Access your Docker shell:

```
docker exec -it n8n sh
```

Run npm uninstall to remove the current version:

```
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName
```

Run npm install with the version specified:

```
# Replace 2.1.0 with your version number
npm install n8n-nodes-nodeName@2.1.0
```

# Install verified community nodes in the n8n app

Limited to n8n instance owners

Only the n8n instance owner can install and manage verified community nodes. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management. All members of an n8n instance can use already installed community nodes in their workflows.

Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.

## Install a community node

To install a [verified community node](../../../creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n):

1. Go to the **Canvas** and open the **nodes panel** (either by selecting '+' or pressing `Tab`).
1. **Search** for the node that you're looking for. If there is a matching verified community node, you will see a **More from the community** section at the bottom of the nodes panel.
1. Select the node you want to install. This takes you to a detailed view of the node, showing all the supported actions.
1. Select **install**. This will install the node for your instance and enable all members to use it in their workflows.
1. You can now add the node to your workflows.

Enable installation of verified community nodes

Some users may not want to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel of their instances. On n8n cloud, instance owners can toggle this in the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/). Self-hosted users can use [environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) to control the availability of this feature.

## Uninstall a community node

To uninstall a community node:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community nodes**.
1. On the node you want to install, select **Options** .
1. Select **Uninstall package**.
1. Select **Uninstall Package** in the confirmation modal.

# Build a declarative-style node

This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git

## Build your node

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.

Existing node

n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.

1. Clone your new repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
   cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
   ```

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

- `nodes/ExampleNode`
- `nodes/HTTPBin`
- `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
- `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/NasaPics`\
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`\
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`\
`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg) as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Create the node

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](../reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.

```
export class NasaPics implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
		// Resources and operations will go here
		]
	};
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:

```
displayName: 'NASA Pics',
name: 'nasaPics',
icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
group: ['transform'],
version: 1,
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',
description: 'Get data from NASAs API',
defaults: {
	name: 'NASA Pics',
},
inputs: ['main'],
outputs: ['main'],
credentials: [
	{
		name: 'NasaPicsApi',
		required: true,
	},
],
requestDefaults: {
	baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
	headers: {
		Accept: 'application/json',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
},
```

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

#### Step 3.4: Add resources

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

```
properties: [
	{
		displayName: 'Resource',
		name: 'resource',
		type: 'options',
		noDataExpression: true,
		options: [
			{
				name: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day',
				value: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			},
			{
				name: 'Mars Rover Photos',
				value: 'marsRoverPhotos',
			},
		],
		default: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
	},
	// Operations will go here

]
```

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

```
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	noDataExpression: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Get',
			value: 'get',
			action: 'Get the APOD',
			description: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day',
			routing: {
				request: {
					method: 'GET',
					url: '/planetary/apod',
				},
			},
		},
	],
	default: 'get',
},
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	noDataExpression: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Get',
			value: 'get',
			action: 'Get Mars Rover photos',
			description: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover',
			routing: {
				request: {
					method: 'GET',
				},
			},
		},
	],
	default: 'get',
},
{
	displayName: 'Rover name',
	description: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from',
	required: true,
	name: 'roverName',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'},
		{name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'},
		{name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'},
		{name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'},
	],
	routing: {
		request: {
			url: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos',
		},
	},
	default: 'curiosity',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
},
{
	displayName: 'Date',
	description: 'Earth date',
	required: true,
	name: 'marsRoverDate',
	type: 'dateTime',
	default:'',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
	routing: {
		request: {
			// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
			qs: {
				earth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
			},
		},
	},
},
// Optional/additional fields will go here
```

This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.

#### Step 3.6: Optional fields

Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:

```
{
	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
	name: 'additionalFields',
	type: 'collection',
	default: {},
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			],
			operation: [
				'get',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'Date',
			name: 'apodDate',
			type: 'dateTime',
			default: '',
			routing: {
				request: {
					// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
					qs: {
						date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],									
}
```

### Step 4: Set up authentication

The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:

```
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'NasaPicsApi';
	displayName = 'NASA Pics API';
	// Uses the link to this tutorial as an example
	// Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes
	documentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
	authenticate = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			qs: {
				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'
			}
		},
	} as IAuthenticateGeneric;
}
```

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](../reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 5: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

```
{
	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics",
	"nodeVersion": "1.0",
	"codexVersion": "1.0",
	"categories": [
		"Miscellaneous"
	],
	"resources": {
		"credentialDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		],
		"primaryDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		]
	}
}
```

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](../reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 6: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

```
{
	// All node names must start with "n8n-nodes-"
	"name": "n8n-nodes-nasapics",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"description": "n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services.",
	"keywords": [
		// This keyword is required for community nodes
		"n8n-community-node-package"
	],
	"license": "MIT",
	"homepage": "https://n8n.io",
	"author": {
		"name": "Test",
		"email": "test@example.com"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		// Change the git remote to your own repository
		// Add the new URL here
		"url": "git+<your-repo-url>"
	},
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		// don't change
	},
	"files": [
		"dist"
	],
	// Link the credentials and node
	"n8n": {
		"n8nNodesApiVersion": 1,
		"credentials": [
			"dist/credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.js"
		],
		"nodes": [
			"dist/nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.js"
		]
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		// don't change
	},
	"peerDependencies": {
		// don't change
	}
}
```

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Test your node

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:

   ```
   npm install n8n -g
   ```

1. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

   ```
   # In your node directory
   npm run build
   npm link
   ```

1. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

   ```
   # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
   # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
   npm link <node-package-name>
   ```

   Check your directory

   Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

   - `~/.n8n/custom/`
   - `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

1. Start n8n:

   ```
   n8n start
   ```

1. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

   Node names

   Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting

If there's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation, you have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`:

```
# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir custom 
cd custom 
npm init
```

## Next steps

- [Deploy your node](../../deploy/).
- View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo). Note that the main node is declarative, while the trigger node is in programmatic style.
- Learn about [node versioning](../reference/node-versioning/).

# Using the n8n-node tool

The `n8n-node` tool is the official CLI for developing community nodes for n8n. You can use it to scaffold out new nodes, build your projects, and run your node as you develop it.

Using `n8n-node`, you can create nodes that adhere to the [guidelines for verified community nodes](../reference/verification-guidelines/).

## Get n8n-node

### Run n8n-node without installing

You can create an `n8n-node` project directly without installing by using the [`@n8n/create-node` initializer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/create-node) with your package manager:

```
npm create @n8n/node@latest
```

This sets up the initial project files locally (an alternative to installing `n8n-node` locally and explicitly running the [`new` command](#new)). Afterward, you run the rest of the `n8n-node` commands through your package manager's script runner inside the project directory (for example, `npm run dev`).

### Install n8n-node globally

You can install `n8n-node` globally with `npm`:

```
npm install --global @n8n/node-cli
```

Verify access to the command by typing:

```
n8n-node --version
```

## Command overview

The `n8n-node` tool provides the following commands:

### new

The `new` command creates the file system structure and metadata for a new node. This command initializes the same structure as outlined in [run n8n-node without installing](#run-n8n-node-without-installing).

When called, it interactively prompts for details about your project to customize your starting code. You'll provide the project name, choose a node type, and select the starting template that best matches your needs. The `n8n-node` tool will create your project file structure and optionally install your initial project dependencies.

Learn more about how to use the `new` command in the [creating a new node section](#creating-a-new-node).

### build

The `build` command compiles your node and copies all the required assets.

Learn more about how to use the `build` command in the [building your node section](#building-your-node).

### dev

The `dev` command runs n8n with your node. It monitors your project directory and automatically rebuilds the live preview when it detects changes.

Learn more about how to use the `dev` command in the [testing your node in n8n section](#testing-your-node-in-n8n).

### lint

The `lint` command checks the code for the node in the current directory. You can optionally use with the `--fix` option to attempt to automatically fix any issues it identifies.

Learn more about how to use the `lint` command in the [lint your node section](#lint-your-node).

### release

The `release` command publishes your community node package to npm. It uses [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to clean, check and cleanly build your package before publishing it to npm.

Learn more about how to use the `release` command in the [release your node section](#release-your-node).

## Creating a new node

To create a new node with `n8n-node`, call `n8n-node new`. You can call this command entirely interactively or provide details on the command line.

Create new node without installing

You can optionally create an `n8n-node` project directly without installing `n8n-node` by using the [`@n8n/create-node` initializer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/create-node) with your package manager.

In the commands below, substitute `n8n-node new` with `npm create @n8n/node@latest`. When using this form, you must add a double dash (`--`) before including any options (like `--template`). For example:

```
npm create @n8n/node@latest n8n-nodes-mynode -- --template declarative/custom
```

The command will prompt for any missing information about your node and then generate a project structure to get you started. By default, it will follow up by installing the initial project dependencies (you can disable this by passing the `--skip-install` flag).

### Setting node details interactively

When called without arguments, `n8n-node new` prompts you for details about your new node interactively:

```
n8n-node new
```

This will start an interactive prompt where you can define the details of your project:

- **What is your node called?** The name of your node. This impacts the name of your project directory, package name, and the n8n node itself. The name must use one of the following formats:
  - `n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`
  - `@<YOUR_ORG>/n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`
- **What kind of node are you building?** The [node type](../../plan/choose-node-method/) you want to build:
  - **HTTP API**: A low-code, declarative node structure that's designed for faster approval for n8n Cloud.
  - **Other**: A programmatic style node with full flexibility.
- **What template do you want to use?** When using the HTTP API, you can choose the template to start from:
  - **GitHub Issues API**: A demo node that includes multiple operations and credentials. This can help you get familiar with the node structure and conventions.
  - **Start from scratch**: A blank template that will guide you through your custom setup with some further prompts.

When choosing HTTP API > Start from scratch, `n8n-node` will ask you the following:

- **What's the base URL of the API?** The root URL for the API you plan to integrate with.
- **What type of authentication does your API use?** The authentication your node should provide:
  - **API Key**: Send a secret key using headers, query parameters, or the request body.
  - **Bearer Token**: Send a token using the Authorization header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
  - **OAuth2**: Use an OAuth 2.0 flow to get access tokens on behalf of a user or app.
  - **Basic Auth**: Send the base64-encoded username and password through Authorization headers.
  - **Custom**: Create your own credential logic. This will create an empty credential class that you can customize according to your needs.
  - **None**: No authentication necessary. Don't create a credential class for the node.

Once you've made your selections, `n8n-node` will create a new project directory for your node in the current directory. By default, it will also install the initial project dependencies (you can disable this by passing the `--skip-install` flag).

### Providing node details on the command line

You can provide some of your node details on the command line to avoid prompts.

You can include the name you want to use for your node an argument:

```
n8n-node new n8n-nodes-myproject
```

Node name format

Node names must use one of the following formats:

- `@<YOUR_ORG>/n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`
- `n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`

If you know the template you want to use ahead of time, you can also pass the value using the `--template` flag:

```
n8n-node new --template declarative/custom
```

The template must be one of the following:

- `declarative/github-issues`: A demo node that includes multiple operations and credentials. This can help you get familiar with the node structure and conventions.
- `declarative/custom`: A blank template that will guide you through your custom setup with some further prompts.
- `programmatic/example`: A programmatic style node with full flexibility.

## Building your node

You can build your node by running the `build` command in your project's root directory:

```
n8n-node build
```

`n8n-node` will compile your TypeScript files and bundle your other project assets. You can also call the `build` script from your package manager. For instance, if you're using `npm`, this works the same:

```
npm run build
```

## Lint your node

The `n8n-node` tool automatically creates a `lint` script for your project as well. You can run with your package manager. For example:

```
n8n-node lint
```

You can also run through your package manager's script runner:

```
npm run lint
```

If you include the `--fix` option (also callable with `npm run lint:fix`), `n8n-node` will attempt to fix the issues that it identifies:

```
n8n-node lint --fix
```

## Testing your node in n8n

To test your node in n8n, you run the `dev` command in your project's root directory:

```
n8n-node dev
```

As with the `build` command, you can also run this through your package manager. For example:

```
npm run dev
```

`n8n-node` will compile your project and then start up a local n8n instance through `npm` with your node loaded.

Visit your `localhost:5678` to sign in to your n8n instance. If you open a workflow, your node appears in the nodes panel:

From there, you can add it to your workflow and test the node's functionality as you develop.

## Release your node

To publish your node, run the `release` command in your project directory. This command uses [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to build and publish your node.

Log in to npm

To use the `release` command, you must log in to npm using `npm login` command. Without this, `n8n-node` won't have authorization to publish your project files.

```
n8n-node release
```

To run with `npm`, type:

```
npm run release
```

When you run the `release` command, `n8n-node` will perform the following actions:

- build the node
- run lint checks against your files
- update the changelog
- create git tags
- create a GitHub release
- publish the package to npm

# Set up your development environment

This document lists the essential dependencies for developing a node, as well as guidance on setting up your editor.

## Requirements

To build and test a node, you need:

- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).
- A local instance of n8n. You can install n8n with `npm install n8n -g`, then follow the steps in [Run your node locally](../../test/run-node-locally/) to test your node.
- When [building verified community nodes](../../../community-nodes/build-community-nodes/), you must use the [`n8n-node` tool](../n8n-node/) to create and test your node.

You should also have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. This allows you to clone and use the [n8n-node-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter).

## Editor setup

n8n recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor.

Install these extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

By using VS Code and these extensions, you get access to the n8n node linter's warnings as you code.

# Build a programmatic-style node

This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git
- [Expressions](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) in n8n

## Build your node

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.

Existing node

n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.

1. Clone your new repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid
   cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid
   ```

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

- `nodes/ExampleNode`
- `nodes/HTTPBin`
- `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
- `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/FriendGrid`\
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`\
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`\
`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg) as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Define the node in the base file

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](../reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
} from 'n8n-core';

import {
	IDataObject,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
    NodeConnectionType
} from 'n8n-workflow';

import {
	OptionsWithUri,
} from 'request';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.

```
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations will go here
		],
	};
	// The execute method will go here
	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
	}
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:

```
displayName: 'FriendGrid',
name: 'friendGrid',
icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg',
group: ['transform'],
version: 1,
description: 'Consume SendGrid API',
defaults: {
	name: 'FriendGrid',
},
inputs: [NodeConnectionType.Main],
outputs: [NodeConnectionType.Main],
credentials: [
	{
		name: 'friendGridApi',
		required: true,
	},
],
```

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.

#### Step 3.4: Add the resource

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

```
{
	displayName: 'Resource',
	name: 'resource',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Contact',
			value: 'contact',
		},
	],
	default: 'contact',
	noDataExpression: true,
	required: true,
	description: 'Create a new contact',
},
```

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

```
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Create',
			value: 'create',
			description: 'Create a contact',
			action: 'Create a contact',
		},
	],
	default: 'create',
	noDataExpression: true,
},
{
	displayName: 'Email',
	name: 'email',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			operation: [
				'create',
			],
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
		},
	},
	default:'',
	placeholder: 'name@email.com',
	description:'Primary email for the contact',
},
```

#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields

Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:

```
{
	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
	name: 'additionalFields',
	type: 'collection',
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	default: {},
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
			operation: [
				'create',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'First Name',
			name: 'firstName',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
		{
			displayName: 'Last Name',
			name: 'lastName',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	],
},
```

### Step 4: Add the execute method

You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.

The `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.

Add the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:

```
// Handle data coming from previous nodes
const items = this.getInputData();
let responseData;
const returnData = [];
const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;

// For each item, make an API call to create a contact
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	if (resource === 'contact') {
		if (operation === 'create') {
			// Get email input
			const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
			// Get additional fields input
			const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject;
			const data: IDataObject = {
				email,
			};

			Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

			// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
			const options: OptionsWithUri = {
				headers: {
					'Accept': 'application/json',
				},
				method: 'PUT',
				body: {
					contacts: [
						data,
					],
				},
				uri: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
				json: true,
			};
			responseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options);
			returnData.push(responseData);
		}
	}
}
// Map data to n8n data structure
return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];
```

Note the following lines of this code:

```
const items = this.getInputData();
... 
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	...
	const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
	...
}
```

Users can provide data in two ways:

- Entered directly in the node fields
- By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow

`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.

### Step 5: Set up authentication

The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

```
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialTestRequest,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'friendGridApi';
	displayName = 'FriendGrid API';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];

	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			headers: {
				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}',
			},
		},
	};

	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3',
			url: '/marketing/contacts',
		},
	};
}
```

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](../reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 6: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

```
{
	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid",
	"nodeVersion": "1.0",
	"codexVersion": "1.0",
	"categories": [
		"Miscellaneous"
	],
	"resources": {
		"credentialDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		],
		"primaryDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		]
	}
}
```

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](../reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 7: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

```
{
	// All node names must start with "n8n-nodes-"
	"name": "n8n-nodes-friendgrid",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"description": "n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid",
	"keywords": [
		// This keyword is required for community nodes
		"n8n-community-node-package"
	],
	"license": "MIT",
	"homepage": "https://n8n.io",
	"author": {
		"name": "Test",
		"email": "test@example.com"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		// Change the git remote to your own repository
		// Add the new URL here
		"url": "git+<your-repo-url>"
	},
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		// don't change
	},
	"files": [
		"dist"
	],
	// Link the credentials and node
	"n8n": {
		"n8nNodesApiVersion": 1,
		"credentials": [
			"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js"
		],
		"nodes": [
			"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js"
		]
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		// don't change
	},
	"peerDependencies": {
		// don't change
	}
}
```

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Test your node

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:

   ```
   npm install n8n -g
   ```

1. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

   ```
   # In your node directory
   npm run build
   npm link
   ```

1. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

   ```
   # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
   # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
   npm link <node-package-name>
   ```

   Check your directory

   Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

   - `~/.n8n/custom/`
   - `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

1. Start n8n:

   ```
   n8n start
   ```

1. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

   Node names

   Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting

If there's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation, you have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`:

```
# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir custom 
cd custom 
npm init
```

## Next steps

- [Deploy your node](../../deploy/).
- View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost). This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure.
- Learn about [node versioning](../reference/node-versioning/).
- Make sure you understand key concepts: [item linking](../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) and [data structures](../../../../data/data-structure/).

# Node building reference

This section contains reference information, including details about:

- [Organizing your node files](node-file-structure/)
- Key parameters in your node's [base file](node-base-files/) and [credentials file](credentials-files/).
- [UX guidelines](ux-guidelines/) and [verification guidelines](verification-guidelines/) for submitting your node for [verification by n8n](../../../community-nodes/installation/verified-install/).

# Code standards

Following defined code standards when building your node makes your code more readable and maintainable, and helps avoid errors. This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to [Node UI design](../../../plan/node-ui-design/).

## Use the linter

The n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the [n8n node linter](../../../test/node-linter/) documentation for more information.

## Use the starter

The n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the [starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter).

## Write in TypeScript

All n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a node

These guidelines apply to any node you build.

### Resources and operations

If your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation `Operation`. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a `Resource` parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:

```
export const ExampleNode implements INodeType {
    description: {
        displayName: 'Example Node',
        ...
        properties: [
            {
                displayName: 'Resource',
                name: 'resource',
                type: 'options',
                options: [
                    {
                        name: 'Resource One',
                        value: 'resourceOne'
                    },
                    {
                        name: 'Resource Two',
                        value: 'resourceTwo'
                    }
                ],
                default: 'resourceOne'
            },
            {
                displayName: 'Operation',
                name: 'operation',
                type: 'options',
                // Only show these operations for Resource One
                displayOptions: {
                    show: {
                        resource: [
                            'resourceOne'
                        ]
                    }
                },
                options: [
                    {
                        name: 'Create',
                        value: 'create',
                        description: 'Create an instance of Resource One'
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Reuse internal parameter names

All resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the `name` parameter, and an internal name, set using the `value` parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations.

For example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in `value`) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.

When reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using `displayOptions`.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node

These guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/).

### Don't change incoming data

Never change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.

It's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.

### Use the built in request library

Some third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:

```
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

This uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

Refer to [HTTP helpers](../http-helpers/) for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed `this.helpers.request`.

# Credentials file

The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.

In the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](../ui-elements/). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.

## Structure of the credentials file

The credentials file follows this basic structure:

1. Import statements
1. Create a class for the credentials
1. Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

### Outline structure

```
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialTestRequest,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'exampleNodeApi';
	displayName = 'Example Node API';
	documentationUrl = '';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
    		// Can be body, header, qs or auth
			qs: {
        		// Use the value from `apiKey` above
				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'
			}

		},
	};
	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}',
			url: '/bearer',
		},
	};
}
```

## Parameters

### `name`

String. The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

### `displayName`

String. The name n8n uses in the GUI.

### `documentationUrl`

String. URL to your credentials documentation.

### `properties`

Each object contains:

- `displayName`: the name n8n uses in the GUI.
- `name`: the internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
- `type`: the data type expected, such as `string`.
- `default`: the URL that n8n should use to test credentials.

### `authenticate`

- `authenticate`: Object. Contains objects that tell n8n how to inject the authentication data as part of the API request.

#### `type`

String. If you're using an authentication method that sends data in the header, body, or query string, set this to `'generic'`.

#### `properties`

Object. Defines the authentication methods. Options are:

- `body`: Object. Sends authentication data in the request body. Can contain nested objects.

  ```
  authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
  	type: 'generic',
  	properties: {
  		body: {
  			username: '={{$credentials.username}}',
  			password: '={{$credentials.password}}',
  		},
  	},
  };
  ```

- `header`: Object. Send authentication data in the request header.

  ```
  authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
  	type: 'generic',
  	properties: {
  		header: {
  			Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.authToken}}',
  		},
  	},
  };
  ```

- `qs`: Object. Stands for "query string." Send authentication data in the request query string.

  ```
  authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
  	type: 'generic',
  	properties: {
  		qs: {
  			token: '={{$credentials.token}}',
  		},
  	},
  };
  ```

- `auth`: Object. Used for Basic Auth. Requires `username` and `password` as the key names.

  ```
  authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
  	type: 'generic',
  	properties: {
  		auth: {
  			username: '={{$credentials.username}}',
  			password: '={{$credentials.password}}',
  		},
  	},
  };
  ```

### `test`

Provide a `request` object containing a URL and authentication type that n8n can use to test the credential.

```
test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}',
			url: '/bearer',
		},
	};
```

# Error handling in n8n nodes

Proper error handling is crucial for creating robust n8n nodes that provide clear feedback to users when things go wrong. n8n provides two specialized error classes to handle different types of failures in node implementations:

- [**`NodeApiError`**](#nodeapierror): For API-related errors and external service failures
- [**`NodeOperationError`**](#nodeoperationerror): For operational errors, validation failures, and configuration issues

## NodeApiError

Use `NodeApiError` when dealing with external API calls and HTTP requests. This error class is specifically designed to handle API response errors and provides enhanced features for parsing and presenting API-related failures such as:

- HTTP request failures
- external API errors
- authentication/authorization failures
- rate limiting errors
- service unavailable errors

Initialize new `NodeApiError` instances using the following pattern:

```
new NodeApiError(node: INode, errorResponse: JsonObject, options?: NodeApiErrorOptions)
```

### Common usage patterns

For basic API request failures, catch the error and wrap it in `NodeApiError`:

```
try {
	const response = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(
		this,
		credentialType,
		options
	);
	return response;
} catch (error) {
	throw new NodeApiError(this.getNode(), error as JsonObject);
}
```

Handle specific HTTP status codes with custom messages:

```
try {
	const response = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(
		this,
		credentialType,
		options
	);
	return response;
} catch (error) {
	if (error.httpCode === "404") {
		const resource = this.getNodeParameter("resource", 0) as string;
		const errorOptions = {
			message: `${
				resource.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + resource.slice(1)
			} not found`,
			description:
				"The requested resource could not be found. Please check your input parameters.",
		};
		throw new NodeApiError(
			this.getNode(),
			error as JsonObject,
			errorOptions
		);
	}

	if (error.httpCode === "401") {
		throw new NodeApiError(this.getNode(), error as JsonObject, {
			message: "Authentication failed",
			description: "Please check your credentials and try again.",
		});
	}

	throw new NodeApiError(this.getNode(), error as JsonObject);
}
```

## NodeOperationError

Use `NodeOperationError` for:

- operational errors
- validation failures
- configuration issues that aren't related to external API calls
- input validation errors
- missing required parameters
- data transformation errors
- workflow logic errors

Initialize new `NodeOperationError` instances using the following pattern:

```
new NodeOperationError(node: INode, error: Error | string | JsonObject, options?: NodeOperationErrorOptions)
```

### Common usage patterns

Use `NodeOperationError` for validating user inputs:

```
const email = this.getNodeParameter("email", itemIndex) as string;

if (email.indexOf("@") === -1) {
	const description = `The email address '${email}' in the 'email' field isn't valid`;
	throw new NodeOperationError(this.getNode(), "Invalid email address", {
		description,
		itemIndex, // for multiple items, this will link the error to the specific item
	});
}
```

When processing multiple items, include the item index for better error context:

```
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	try {
		// Process item
		const result = await processItem(items[i]);
		returnData.push(result);
	} catch (error) {
		if (this.continueOnFail()) {
			returnData.push({
				json: { error: error.message },
				pairedItem: { item: i },
			});
			continue;
		}

		throw new NodeOperationError(this.getNode(), error as Error, {
			description: error.description,
			itemIndex: i,
		});
	}
}
```

# HTTP request helper for node builders

n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.

Programmatic style only

The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.

## Usage

Call the helper inside the `execute` function.

```
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

`options` is an object:

```
{
	url: string;
	headers?: object;
	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD';
	body?: FormData | Array | string | number | object | Buffer | URLSearchParams;
	qs?: object;
	arrayFormat?: 'indices' | 'brackets' | 'repeat' | 'comma';
	auth?: {
		username: string,
		password: string,
	};
	disableFollowRedirect?: boolean;
	encoding?: 'arraybuffer' | 'blob' | 'document' | 'json' | 'text' | 'stream';
	skipSslCertificateValidation?: boolean;
	returnFullResponse?: boolean;
	proxy?: {
		host: string;
		port: string | number;
		auth?: {
			username: string;
			password: string;
		},
		protocol?: string;
	};
	timeout?: number;
	json?: boolean;
}	
```

`url` is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.

Some notes about the possible fields:

- `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- `headers`: a key-value pair.
  - If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.
  - If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  - To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.
- `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.
  - `indices` (default): `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`
  - `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`
  - `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`
  - `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`
- `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.
- `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
- `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
- `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`
- `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.

## Example

For an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts).

## Deprecation of the previous helper

The previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.

To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.

If you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues).

## Migration guide to the new helper

The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.

New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:

- Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.
- `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.
- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`
- Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.
- `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior

# Node codex files

The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json) file in the n8n starter.

The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex would be named `MyNode.node.json`.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`         | Includes the node name. Must start with `n8n-nodes-base.`. For example, `n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi`.                                                        |
| `nodeVersion`  | The node version. This should have the same value as the `version` parameter in your main node file. For example, `"1.0"`.                                      |
| `codexVersion` | The codex file version. The current version is `"1.0"`.                                                                                                         |
| `categories`   | The settings in the `categories` array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See [Node categories](#node-categories) for more information. |
| `resources`    | The `resources` object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI.                        |

## Node categories

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

- Data & Storage
- Finance & Accounting
- Marketing & Content
- Productivity
- Miscellaneous
- Sales
- Development
- Analytics
- Communication
- Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`.

# Node file structure

Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.

The file and directory structure of your node depends on:

- Your node's complexity.
- Whether you use node versioning.
- How many nodes you include in the npm package.

n8n recommends using the [`n8n-node` tool](../../n8n-node/) to create the expected node file structure. You can customize the generated scaffolding as required to meet more complex needs.

## Required files and directories

Your node must include:

- A `package.json` file at the root of the project. Every npm module requires this.
- A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:
  - This directory must contain the [base file](../node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.
  - n8n recommends including a [codex file](../node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.
  - The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
- A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](../credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.

## Modular structure

You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.

A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin) for an example of this.

For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook) as examples.

- `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
  - Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:
  - An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`)
  - Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.
- `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.
- `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.

## Versioning

If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](../node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.

## Decide how many nodes to include in a package

There are two possible setups when building a node:

- One node in one npm package.
- More than one node in a single npm package.

n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.

## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes

n8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.

# Node versioning

n8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:

- If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
- When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

Versioning type restricted by node style

If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.

## Light versioning

This is available for all node types.

One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature:

1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version.
1. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](../../declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:

```
{
    displayName: 'NASA Pics',
    name: 'NasaPics',
    icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
    // List the available versions
    version: [1,2,3],
    // More basic parameters here
    properties: [
        // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2
        {
            displayName: 'Resource name',
            // More resource parameters
            displayOptions: {
                show: {
                    '@version': 2,
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

## Full versioning

This isn't available for declarative-style nodes.

As an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost).

Full versioning summary:

- The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.
- The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.
- n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names.

# Item linking

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](../../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

```
// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};
```

# Node user interface elements

n8n provides a set of predefined UI components (based on a JSON file) that allows users to input all sorts of data types. The following UI elements are available in n8n.

## String

Basic configuration:

```
{
	displayName: Name, // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: name, // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: string,
	required: true, // Whether the field is required or not
	default: 'n8n',
	description: 'The name of the user',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

String field for inputting passwords:

```
{
	displayName: 'Password',
	name: 'password',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		password: true,
	},
	default: '',
	description: `User's password`,
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

String field with more than one row:

```
{
	displayName: 'Description',
	name: 'description',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		rows: 4,
	},
	default: '',
	description: 'Description',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

### Support drag and drop for data keys

Users can drag and drop data values to map them to fields. Dragging and dropping creates an [expression](../../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to load the data value. n8n supports this automatically.

You need to add an extra configuration option to support dragging and dropping data keys:

- `requiresDataPath: 'single'`: for fields that require a single string.
- `requiresDataPath: 'multiple'`: for fields that can accept a comma-separated list of string.

The [Compare Datasets node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/CompareDatasets/CompareDatasets.node.ts) has examples.

## Number

Number field with decimal points:

```
{
	displayName: 'Amount',
	name: 'amount',
	type: 'number',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		maxValue: 10,
		minValue: 0,
		numberPrecision: 2,
	},
	default: 10.00,
	description: 'Your current amount',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Collection

Use the `collection` type when you need to display optional fields.

```
{
	displayName: 'Filters',
	name: 'filters',
	type: 'collection',
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	default: {},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'Type',
			name: 'type',
			type: 'options',
			options: [
				{
					name: 'Automated',
					value: 'automated',
				},
				{
					name: 'Past',
					value: 'past',
				},
				{
					name: 'Upcoming',
					value: 'upcoming',
				},
			],
			default: '',
		},
	],
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## DateTime

The `dateTime` type provides a date picker.

```
{
	displayName: 'Modified Since',
	name: 'modified_since',
	type: 'dateTime',
	default: '',
	description: 'The date and time when the file was last modified',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Boolean

The `boolean` type adds a toggle for entering true or false.

```
{
	displayName: 'Wait for Image',
	name: 'waitForImage',
	type: 'boolean',
	default: true, // Initial state of the toggle
	description: 'Whether to wait for the image or not',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Color

The `color` type provides a color selector.

```
{
	displayName: 'Background Color',
	name: 'backgroundColor',
	type: 'color',
	default: '', // Initially selected color
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Options

The `options` type adds an options list. Users can select a single value.

```
{
	displayName: 'Resource',
	name: 'resource',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Image',
			value: 'image',
		},
		{
			name: 'Template',
			value: 'template',
		},
	],
	default: 'image', // The initially selected option
	description: 'Resource to consume',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Multi-options

The `multiOptions` type adds an options list. Users can select more than one value.

```
{
	displayName: 'Events',
	name: 'events',
	type: 'multiOptions',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Plan Created',
			value: 'planCreated',
		},
		{
			name: 'Plan Deleted',
			value: 'planDeleted',
		},
	],
	default: [], // Initially selected options
	description: 'The events to be monitored',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Filter

Use this component to evaluate, match, or filter incoming data.

This is the code from n8n's own If node. It shows a filter component working with a [collection](#collection) component where users can configure the filter's behavior.

```
{
	displayName: 'Conditions',
	name: 'conditions',
	placeholder: 'Add Condition',
	type: 'filter',
	default: {},
	typeOptions: {
		filter: {
			// Use the user options (below) to determine filter behavior
			caseSensitive: '={{!$parameter.options.ignoreCase}}',
			typeValidation: '={{$parameter.options.looseTypeValidation ? "loose" : "strict"}}',
		},
	},
},
{
displayName: 'Options',
name: 'options',
type: 'collection',
placeholder: 'Add option',
default: {},
options: [
	{
		displayName: 'Ignore Case',
		description: 'Whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions',
		name: 'ignoreCase',
		type: 'boolean',
		default: true,
	},
	{
		displayName: 'Less Strict Type Validation',
		description: 'Whether to try casting value types based on the selected operator',
		name: 'looseTypeValidation',
		type: 'boolean',
		default: true,
	},
],
},
```

## Assignment collection (drag and drop)

Use the drag and drop component when you want users to pre-fill name and value parameters with a single drag interaction.

```
{
	displayName: 'Fields to Set',
	name: 'assignments',
	type: 'assignmentCollection',
	default: {},
},
```

You can see an example in n8n's [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/0faeab1228e26d69a2a93bdb2f89523cca1e4036/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Set/v2):

## Fixed collection

Use the `fixedCollection` type to group fields that are semantically related.

```
{
	displayName: 'Metadata',
	name: 'metadataUi',
	placeholder: 'Add Metadata',
	type: 'fixedCollection',
	default: '',
	typeOptions: {
		multipleValues: true,
	},
	description: '',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'metadataValues',
			displayName: 'Metadata',
			values: [
				{
					displayName: 'Name',
					name: 'name',
					type: 'string',
					default: 'Name of the metadata key to add.',
				},
				{
					displayName: 'Value',
					name: 'value',
					type: 'string',
					default: '',
					description: 'Value to set for the metadata key.',
				},
			],
		},
	],
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## Resource locator

The resource locator element helps users find a specific resource in an external service, such as a card or label in Trello.

The following options are available:

- ID
- URL
- List: allows users to select or search from a prepopulated list. This option requires more coding, as you must populate the list, and handle searching if you choose to support it.

You can choose which types to include.

Example:

```
{
	displayName: 'Card',
	name: 'cardID',
	type: 'resourceLocator',
	default: '',
	description: 'Get a card',
	modes: [
		{
			displayName: 'ID',
			name: 'id',
			type: 'string',
			hint: 'Enter an ID',
			validation: [
				{
					type: 'regex',
					properties: {
						regex: '^[0-9]',
						errorMessage: 'The ID must start with a number',
					},
				},
			],
			placeholder: '12example',
			// How to use the ID in API call
			url: '=http://api-base-url.com/?id={{$value}}',
		},
		{
			displayName: 'URL',
			name: 'url',
			type: 'string',
			hint: 'Enter a URL',
			validation: [
				{
					type: 'regex',
					properties: {
						regex: '^http',
						errorMessage: 'Invalid URL',
					},
				},
			],
			placeholder: 'https://example.com/card/12example/',
			// How to get the ID from the URL
			extractValue: {
				type: 'regex',
				regex: 'example.com/card/([0-9]*.*)/',
			},
		},
		{
			displayName: 'List',
			name: 'list',
			type: 'list',
			typeOptions: {
				// You must always provide a search method
				// Write this method within the methods object in your base file
				// The method must populate the list, and handle searching if searchable: true
				searchListMethod: 'searchMethod',
				// If you want users to be able to search the list
				searchable: true,
				// Set to true if you want to force users to search
				// When true, users can't browse the list
				// Or false if users can browse a list
				searchFilterRequired: true,
			},
		},
	],
	displayOptions: {
		// the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			],
		},
	},
},
```

Refer to the following for live examples:

- Refer to [`CardDescription.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/CardDescription.ts) and [`Trello.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/Trello.node.ts) in n8n's Trello node for an example of a list with search that includes `searchFilterRequired: true`.
- Refer to [`GoogleDrive.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Drive/GoogleDrive.node.ts) for an example where users can browse the list or search.

## Resource mapper

If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.

Mapping and matching

Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update.

```
{
	displayName: 'Columns',
	name: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type
	default: {
		// mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow')
		// or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData')
		mappingMode: 'defineBelow',
		// Important: always set default value to null
		value: null,
	},
	required: true,
	// See "Resource mapper type options interface" below for the full typeOptions specification
	typeOptions: {
		resourceMapper: {
			resourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns',
			mode: 'update',
			fieldWords: {
				singular: 'column',
				plural: 'columns',
			},
			addAllFields: true, 
			multiKeyMatch: true,
			supportAutoMap: true,
			matchingFieldsLabels: {
				title: 'Custom matching columns title',
				description: 'Help text for custom matching columns',
				hint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns',
			},
		},
	},
},
```

Refer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2) for a live example using a database schema.

Refer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2) for a live example using a schema-less service.

### Resource mapper type options interface

The `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:

```
export interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions {
	// The name of the method where you fetch the schema
	// Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail
	resourceMapperMethod: string;
	// Choose the mode for your operation
	// Supported modes: add, update, upsert
	mode: 'add' | 'update' | 'upsert';
	// Specify labels for fields in the UI
	fieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string };
	// Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow
	// Default is true
	addAllFields?: boolean;
	// Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service 
	// (the call is successful but the response is empty)
	noFieldsError?: string;
	// Whether to support multi-key column matching
	// multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only
	// Default is false
	// If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector
	multiKeyMatch?: boolean;
	// Whether to support automatic mapping
	// If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow
	supportAutoMap?: boolean;
	// Custom labels for the matching columns selector
	matchingFieldsLabels?: {
		title?: string;
		description?: string;
		hint?: string;
	};
}
```

### Resource mapper method

This method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema. Every node must implement its own logic for fetching the schema, and setting up each UI field according to the schema.

It must return a value that implements the `ResourceMapperFields` interface:

```
interface ResourceMapperField {
	// Field ID as in the service
	id: string;
	// Field label
	displayName: string;
	// Whether n8n should pre-select the field as a matching field
	// A matching field is a column used to identify the rows to modify
	defaultMatch: boolean;
	// Whether the field can be used as a matching field
	canBeUsedToMatch?: boolean;
	// Whether the field is required by the schema
	required: boolean;
	// Whether to display the field in the UI
	// If false, can't be used for matching or mapping
	display: boolean;
	// The data type for the field
	// These correspond to UI element types
	// Supported types: string, number, dateTime, boolean, time, array, object, options
	type?: FieldType;
	// Added at runtime if the field is removed from mapping by the user
	removed?: boolean;
	// Specify options for enumerated types
	options?: INodePropertyOptions[];
}
```

Refer to the [Postgres resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts) and [Google Sheets resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts) for live examples.

## JSON

```
{
	displayName: 'Content (JSON)',
	name: 'content',
	type: 'json',
	default: '',
	description: '',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

## HTML

The HTML editor allows users to create HTML templates in their workflows. The editor supports standard HTML, CSS in `<style>` tags, and expressions wrapped in `{{}}`. Users can add `<script>` tags to pull in additional JavaScript. n8n doesn't run this JavaScript during workflow execution.

```
{
	displayName: 'HTML Template', // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: 'html', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: 'string',
	typeOptions: {
		editor: 'htmlEditor',
	},
	default: placeholder, // Loads n8n's placeholder HTML template
	noDataExpression: true, // Prevent using an expression for the field
	description: 'HTML template to render',
},
```

Refer to [`Html.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Html/Html.node.ts) for a live example.

## Notice

Display a yellow box with a hint or extra info. Refer to [Node UI design](../../../plan/node-ui-design/) for guidance on writing good hints and info text.

```
{
  displayName: 'Your text here',
  name: 'notice',
  type: 'notice',
  default: '',
},
```

## Hints

There are two types of hints: parameter hints and node hints:

- Parameter hints are small lines of text below a user input field.
- Node hints are a more powerful and flexible option than [Notice](#notice). Use them to display longer hints, in the input panel, output panel, or node details view.

### Add a parameter hint

Add the `hint` parameter to a UI element:

```
{
	displayName: 'URL',
	name: 'url',
	type: 'string',
	hint: 'Enter a URL',
	...
}
```

### Add a node hint

Define the node's hints in the `hints` property within the node `description`:

```
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
	...
	hints: [
		{
			// The hint message. You can use HTML.
			message: "This node has many input items. Consider enabling <b>Execute Once</b> in the node\'s settings.",
			// Choose from: info, warning, danger. The default is 'info'.
			// Changes the color. info (grey), warning (yellow), danger (red)
			type: 'info',
			// Choose from: inputPane, outputPane, ndv. By default n8n displays the hint in both the input and output panels.
			location: 'outputPane',
			// Choose from: always, beforeExecution, afterExecution. The default is 'always'
			whenToDisplay: 'beforeExecution',
			// Optional. An expression. If it resolves to true, n8n displays the message. Defaults to true.
			displayCondition: '={{ $parameter["operation"] === "select" && $input.all().length > 1 }}'
		}
	]
	...
}
```

### Add a dynamic hint to a programmatic-style node

In programmatic-style nodes you can create a dynamic message that includes information from the node execution. As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.

```
if (operation === 'select' && items.length > 1 && !node.executeOnce) {
    // Expects two parameters: NodeExecutionData and an array of hints
	return new NodeExecutionOutput(
		[returnData],
		[
			{
				message: `This node ran ${items.length} times, once for each input item. To run for the first item only, enable <b>Execute once</b> in the node settings.`,
				location: 'outputPane',
			},
		],
	);
}
return [returnData];
```

For a live example of a dynamic hint in a programmatic-style node, view the [Split Out node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Transform/SplitOut/SplitOut.node.ts#L266).

# UX guidelines for community nodes

Your node's UI must conform to these guidelines to be a [verified community node](../../../deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n) candidate.

## Credentials

API key and sensitive credentials should always be password fields.

### OAuth

Always include the OAuth credential if available.

## Node structure

### Operations to include

Try to include **CRUD** operations for each resource type.

Try to include common operations in nodes for each resource. n8n uses some CRUD operations to keep the experience consistent and allow users to perform basic operations on the resource. The suggested operations are:

- **Create**
- **Create or Update (Upsert)**
- **Delete**
- **Get**
- **Get Many:** also used when some filtering or search is available
- **Update**

Notes:

1. These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the **name of the entity** in the operations name.
1. The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.

### Resource Locator

- Use a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.
- The default option for the Resource Locator Component should be `From list` (if available).

### Consistency with other nodes

- Maintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.
- Check similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.

### Sorting options

- You can enhance certain "Get Many" operations by providing users with sorting options.
- Add sorting in a dedicated collection (below the "Options" collection). Follow the example of [Airtable Record:Search](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/92e2a8e61a4189025e5d4bac8be81576b624fe85/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable/v2/actions/record/search.operation.ts#L85-L135).

## Node functionality

### Deleting operations output

When deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: `{"deleted": true}`. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.

### Simplifying output fields

#### Normal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the "Simplify" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.

- One of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.
- Select the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.
- In the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields
- Display Name: `Simplify`
- Description: `Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data`

#### AI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.

In AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.

Options:

- **Simplified:** Works the same as the "Simplify" parameter described above.
- **Raw:** Returns all the available fields.
- **Selected fields:** Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.

## Copy

### Text Case

Use **Title Case** for the node `name`, `parameters display names` (labels), `dropdown titles`. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.

Use **Sentence case** for node `action` names, node `descriptions`, `parameters descriptions` (tooltips), `hints`, `dropdown descriptions`.

### Terminology

- **Use the third-party service terminology:** Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').
- **Use the terminology used in the UI:** Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you "archive" cards, but in the API they show up as "closed". In this case, you might want to use "archive").
- **No tech jargon:** Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use "field" instead of "key".
- **Consistent naming:** Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix "directory" and "folder".

### Placeholders

It's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with "e.g." and use **camel case** for the demo content in fields.

Placeholder examples to copy:

- image: `e.g. https://example.com/image.png`
- video: `e.g. https://example.com/video.mp4`
- search term: `e.g. automation`
- email: `e.g. nathan@example.com`
- Twitter user (or similar): `e.g. n8n`
- Name and last name: `e.g. Nathan Smith`
- First name: `e.g. Nathan`
- Last name: `e.g. Smith`

### Operations name, action, and description

- **Name:** This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, "Delete").
- **Action:** This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, "Delete record").
- **Description:** This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, "Retrieve a list of users").
- If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, "Delete Row").

As a general rule, is important to understand what the **object** of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, `Sheet:Delete` to delete a Sheet).

In other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, `Table:Delete rows`, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).

#### Naming `name`

This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.

- Parameter: `name`
- Case: Title Case

Naming guidelines:

- **Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above):** The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).
  - For example: `Sheet:Delete` → No need to repeat `Sheet` in `Delete`, because n8n displays `Sheet` in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.
- **Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above:** In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.
  - For example: `Delete Records` → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.
- **Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource:** Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.
  - For example: `Table:Get Columns` → Specify `Columns` because the resource is `Table`, while the object of the operation is `Columns`.

#### Naming `action`

This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. * Parameter: `action` * Case: Sentence case

Naming guidelines:

- **Omit articles:** To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).
  - **correct**: `Update row in sheet`
  - **incorrect**: `Update a row in a sheet`
- **Repeat the resource:** In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.
- **Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource:** Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.
  - For example: `Append Rows` → You have to specify `Rows` because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (`Sheet`) since you aren't appending to the resource.

#### Naming `description`

This is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.

- Parameter: `description`
- Case: Sentence case

Naming guidelines:

- If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation `name`
- Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.

#### Vocabulary

n8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).

The general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:

- **Clear**
  - Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).
  - Description: `Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>`
- **Create**
  - Create a new instance of the resource.
  - Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE>`
- **Create or Update**
  - Create or update an existing instance of the resource.
  - Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)`
- **Delete**
  - You can use "Delete" in two different ways:
    1. Delete a resource:
       - Description: `Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently` (use "permanently" only if that's the case)
    1. Delete something **inside** of the resource (for example, a row):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Delete Rows` or `Delete Records`.
       - Description: `Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently`
- **Get**
  - You can use "Get" in two different ways:
    1. Get a resource:
       - Description: `Retrieve a <RESOURCE>`
    1. Get an item **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Row` or `Get Record`.
       - Description: `Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>`
- **Get Many**
  - You can use "Get Many" in two different ways:
    1. Get a list of resources (without filtering):
       - Description: `Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s`
    1. Get a list of items **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Many Rows` or `Get Many Records`.
       - You can omit `Many`: `Get Many Rows` can be `Get Rows`.
       - Description: `List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>`
- **Insert** or **Append**
  - Add something inside of a resource.
  - Use `insert` for database nodes.
  - Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>`
- **Insert or Update** or **Append or Update**
  - Add or update something inside of a resource.
  - Use `insert` for database nodes.
  - Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)`
- **Update**
  - You can use "Update" in two different ways:
    1. Update a resource:
       - Description: `Update one or more <RESOURCE>s`
    1. Update something **inside** of a resource (for example, a row):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Update Rows` or `Update Records`.
       - Description: `Update <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) inside a <RESOURCE>`

### Referring to parameter and field name

When you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, "Please fill the `'name'` parameter).

### Boolean description

Start the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'

## Errors

### General philosophy

Errors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:

- **What happened**: a description of the error and what went wrong.
- **How to solve the problem**: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.

### Error structure in the Output panel

#### Error Message - What happened

This message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.

- If you have the `displayName` of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).
- Item index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append `[Item X]` to the error message. For example, `The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2]`.
- Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

#### Error Description - How to solve or get unstuck

The description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.

Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

# Community node verification guidelines

Do you want n8n to verify your node?

Consider following these guidelines while building your node if you want to submit it for verification by n8n. Any user with verified community nodes enabled can discover and install verified nodes from n8n's nodes panel across all deployment types (self-hosted and n8n Cloud).

## Use the n8n-node tool

All verified community node authors should strongly consider using the [`n8n-node` tool](../../n8n-node/) to create and check their package. This helps n8n ensure quality and consistency by:

- Generating the expected package file structure
- Adding the required metadata and configuration to the `package.json` file
- Making it easy to lint your code against n8n's standards
- Allowing you to load your node in a local n8n instance for testing

## Package source verification

- Verify that your npm package repository URL matches the expected GitHub (or other platform) repository.
- Confirm that the package author / maintainer matches between npm and the repository.
- Confirm that the git link in npm works and that the repository is public.
- Make sure your package has proper documentation (README, usage examples, etc.).
- Make sure your package license is MIT.

## No external dependencies

- Ensure that your package does **not** include any external dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Proper documentation

- Provide clear documentation, whether it’s a **README** on GitHub or links to relevant **API documentation**.
- Include usage instructions, example workflows, and any necessary authentication details.

## No access to environment variables or file system

- The code **must not** interact with environment variables or attempt to read/write files.
- Pass all necessary data through node parameters.

## Follow n8n best practices

- Maintain a clear and consistent coding style.
- Use **TypeScript** and follow n8n's [**node development guidelines**](../../../overview/).
- Ensure proper error handling and validation.
- Make sure the linter passes (in other words, make sure running `npx @n8n/scan-community-package n8n-nodes-PACKAGE` passes).

## Use English language only

- Both the node interface and all documentation must be in **English** only.
- This includes parameter names, descriptions, help text, error messages and **README** content.

# Node base file

The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/).

These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](../../declarative-style-node/) or [Build a programmatic-style node](../../programmatic-style-node/).

You can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.

For all nodes, refer to the:

- [Structure of the node base file](structure/)
- [Standard parameters](standard-parameters/)

For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:

- [Declarative-style parameters](declarative-style-parameters/)

For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:

- [Programmatic-style parameters](programmatic-style-parameters/)
- [Programmatic-style execute() method](programmatic-style-execute-method/)

# Declarative-style parameters

These are the parameters available for [node base file](../) of declarative-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](../../../declarative-style-node/).

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

*Object* | *Optional*

`methods` contains the `loadOptions` object. You can use `loadOptions` to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

```
methods : {
	loadOptions: {
		routing: {
			request: {
				url: '/webhook/example-option-parameters',
				method: 'GET',
			},
			output: {
				postReceive: [
					{
						// When the returned data is nested under another property
						// Specify that property key
						type: 'rootProperty',
						properties: {
							property: 'responseData',
						},
					},
					{
						type: 'setKeyValue',
						properties: {
							name: '={{$responseItem.key}} ({{$responseItem.value}})',
							value: '={{$responseItem.value}}',
						},
					},
					{
						// If incoming data is an array of objects, sort alphabetically by key
						type: 'sort',
						properties: {
							key: 'name',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		},
	}
},
```

## `routing`

*Object* | *Required*

`routing` is an object used within an `options` array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.

The code example below comes from the [Declarative-style tutorial](../../../declarative-style-node/). It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use `requestDefaults` to set up the basic API call details, and `routing` to add information for each operation.

```
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
  // Other node info here
  requestDefaults: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
			url: '',
			headers: {
				Accept: 'application/json',
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
		},
    properties: [
      // Resources here
      {
        displayName: 'Operation'
        // Other operation details
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Get'
            value: 'get',
            description: '',
            routing: {
              request: {
                method: 'GET',
                url: '/planetary/apod'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

## `version`

*Number* or *Array* | *Optional*

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

# Programmatic-style execute() method

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.

The `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.

Paired items

You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to [Paired items](../../paired-items/).

# Programmatic-style parameters

These are the parameters available for [node base file](../) of programmatic-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a programmatic-style node](../../../programmatic-style-node/).

Programmatic-style nodes also use the `execute()` method. Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](../programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information.

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `defaultVersion`

*Number* | *Optional*

Use `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

*Object* | *Optional*

Contains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.

For example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:

```
	methods = {
		loadOptions: {
			// Get all the labels and display them
			async getLabels(
				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions,
			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {
				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(
					this,
					'labels',
					'GET',
					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',
				);
				for (const label of labels) {
					const labelName = label.name;
					const labelId = label.id;
					returnData.push({
						name: labelName,
						value: labelId,
					});
				}
				return returnData;
			},
		},
	};
```

## `version`

*Number* or *Array* | *Optional*

Use `version` when using the light versioning approach.

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

# Standard parameters

These are the standard parameters for the [node base file](../). They're the same for all node types.

## `displayName`

*String* | *Required*

This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.

## `name`

*String* | *Required*

The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

## `icon`

*String* or *Object* | *Required*

Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file.

You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes. If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:

```
icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'
```

To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:

```
icon: { 
  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', 
  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' 
}
```

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

## `group`

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:

- `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.
- `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.
- `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.
- An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.

## `description`

*String* | *Required*

A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.

## `defaults`

*Object* | *Required*

Contains essential brand and name settings.

The object can include:

- `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.
- `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.

## `forceInputNodeExecution`

*Boolean* | *Optional*

When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).

## `inputs`

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.

## `outputs`

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.

## `requiredInputs`

*Integer* or *Array* | *Optional*

Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.

## `credentials`

*Array of objects* | *Required*

This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.

The object must include:

- `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'` in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts) links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).
- `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.

## `requestDefaults`

*Object* | *Required*

Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.

This object must include:

- `baseURL`: The API base URL.

You can also add:

- `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
- `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.

## `properties`

*Array of objects* | *Required*

This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.

### Resource objects

A resource object includes the following parameters:

- `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.
- `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.
- `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../../ui-elements/) for more information.
- `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`.

### Operations objects

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

- `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.
- `name`: String. This should always be `option`.
- `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](../../ui-elements/) for more information.
- `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.
- `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:
  - `name`. String.
  - `value`. String.
  - `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `"Card"` and an operation `"Get all"`, your action is `"Get all cards"`.
  - `description`: String.
  - `routing`: Object containing request details.

### Additional fields objects

These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

The objects must include:

```
displayName: 'Additional Fields',
name: 'additionalFields',
// The UI element type
type: ''
placeholder: 'Add Field',
default: {},
displayOptions: {
  // Set which resources and operations this field is available for
  show: {
    resource: [
      // Resource names
    ],
    operation: [
      // Operation names
    ]
  },
}
```

For more information about UI element types, refer to [UI elements](../../ui-elements/).

# Structure of the node base file

The node base file follows this basic structure:

1. Add import statements.
1. Create a class for the node.
1. Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.

A programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `properties` object, within `descriptions`.

## Outline structure for a declarative-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure.

```
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations here
		]
	};
}
```

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Declarative-style parameters](../declarative-style-parameters/) for the parameters available for declarative-style nodes.

## Outline structure for a programmatic-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure.

```
import { IExecuteFunctions } from 'n8n-core';
import { INodeExecutionData, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    // Basic node details here
    properties: [
      // Resources and operations here
    ]
  };

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    // Process data and return
  }
};
```

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Programmatic-style parameters](../programmatic-style-parameters/) and [Programmatic-style execute method](../programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information on working with programmatic-style nodes.

# Deploy a node

This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.

You can choose to:

- [Submit your node to the community node repository](submit-community-nodes/). This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to [install and use it](../../community-nodes/installation/) like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
- Install the node into your n8n instance as a [private node](install-private-nodes/).

# Install private nodes

You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.

## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance

If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n.

1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).

   Your Dockerfile should look like this:

   ```
   FROM node:16-alpine

   ARG N8N_VERSION

   RUN if [ -z "$N8N_VERSION" ] ; then echo "The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!" ; exit 1; fi

   # Update everything and install needed dependencies
   RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec

   # Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root
   USER root

   # Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.
   RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \
   	npm config set python "$(which python3)" && \
   	npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \
   	apk del build-dependencies \
   	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;


   # Install fonts
   RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \
   	update-ms-fonts && \
   	fc-cache -f && \
   	apk del fonts && \
   	find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \
   	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root

   ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu

   WORKDIR /data

   COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
   ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

   EXPOSE 5678/tcp
   ```

1. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.

1. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

1. Build your Docker image:

   ```
   # Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number. 
   # For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
   docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .
   ```

You can now use your node in Docker.

## Install your node in a global n8n instance

If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.

# Submit community nodes

Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

- n8n recommends using the [`n8n-node` CLI tool](../../build/n8n-node/) to build and test your node. In particular, this is important if you plan on [submitting your node for verification](./#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n). This ensures that your node has the correct structure and follows community node requirements. It also simplifies linting and testing.
- View [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for examples of patterns you can use in your nodes.
- Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](../../overview/).
- Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

## Standards

Developing with the [`n8n-node` tool](../../build/n8n-node/) ensures that your node adheres to the following standards required to make your node available in the n8n community node repository:

- Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
- Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
- Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute.
- Check your node using the linter (`npm run lint`) and test it locally (`npm run dev`) to ensure it works.
- Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

## Submit your node for verification by n8n

n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.

Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:

- Start from the [`n8n-node` tool](../../build/n8n-node/) generated scaffolding. While this isn't strictly required, n8n strongly suggests using the `n8n-node` CLI tool for any community node you plan to submit for verification. Using the tool ensures that your node follows the expected conventions and adheres to the community node requirements.
- Make sure that your node follows the [technical guidelines for verified community nodes](../../build/reference/verification-guidelines/) and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
- Ensure that your node follows the [UX guidelines](../../build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
- Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files) or a related public repository.
- Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.

## Ready to submit?

If your node meets all the above requirements, sign up or log in to the [n8n Creator Portal](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes) and submit your node for verification. Note that n8n reserves the right to reject nodes that compete with any of n8n's paid features, especially enterprise functionality.

# Plan a node

This section provides guidance on designing your node, including key technical decisions such as choosing your node building style.

When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:

- Which [node type](node-types/) you need to build.
- Which [node building style](choose-node-method/) to use.
- Your [UI design and UX principles](node-ui-design/)
- Your node's [file structure](../build/reference/node-file-structure/).

# Choose your node building approach

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

- Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
- Is more future-proof.
- Supports integration with REST APIs.

The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:

- Trigger nodes
- Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
- Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
- Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](../../build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on types of versioning.

## Data handling differences

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](../../build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.

## Syntax differences

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

In programmatic style:

```
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
	IRequestOptions,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Create the FriendGrid class
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',
    . . .
    properties: [
      {
        displayName: 'Resource',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Operation',
        name: 'operation',
        type: 'options',
        displayOptions: {
          show: {
              resource: [
              'contact',
              ],
          },
        },
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Create',
            value: 'create',
            description: 'Create a contact',
          },
        ],
        default: 'create',
        description: 'The operation to perform.',
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Email',
        name: 'email',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Additional Fields',
        // Sets up optional fields
      },
    ],
};

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    let responseData;
    const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
    const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;
    //Get credentials the user provided for this node
    const credentials = await this.getCredentials('friendGridApi') as IDataObject;

    if (resource === 'contact') {
      if (operation === 'create') {
      // Get email input
      const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', 0) as string;
      // Get additional fields input
      const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', 0) as IDataObject;
      const data: IDataObject = {
          email,
      };

      Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

      // Make HTTP request as defined in https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
      const options: IRequestOptions = {
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${credentials.apiKey}`,
        },
        method: 'PUT',
        body: {
            contacts: [
            data,
            ],
        },
        url: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
        json: true,
      };
      responseData = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);
      }
    }
    // Map data to n8n data
    return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(responseData)];
  }
}
```

In declarative style:

```
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

// Create the FriendGrid class
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',
    . . .
    // Set up the basic request configuration
    requestDefaults: {
      baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing'
    },
    properties: [
      {
        displayName: 'Resource',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Operation',
        name: 'operation',
        type: 'options',
        displayOptions: {
          show: {
            resource: [
              'contact',
            ],
          },
        },
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Create',
            value: 'create',
            description: 'Create a contact',
            // Add the routing object
            routing: {
              request: {
                method: 'POST',
                url: '=/contacts',
                send: {
                  type: 'body',
                  properties: {
                    email: {{$parameter["email"]}}
                  }
                }
              }
            },
            // Handle the response to contact creation
            output: {
              postReceive: [
                {
                  type: 'set',
                  properties: {
                    value: '={{ { "success": $response } }}'
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          },
        ],
        default: 'create',
        description: 'The operation to perform.',
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Email',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Additional Fields',
        // Sets up optional fields
      },
    ],
  }
  // No execute method needed
}
```

# Node types: Trigger and Action

There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.

Both types provide integrations with external services.

## Trigger nodes

[Trigger nodes](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.

There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n:

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                 | Example Nodes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Webhook | Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time.                                 | [Zendesk Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Zendesk), [Telegram Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Telegram), [Brevo Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo)                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Polling | Nodes for services that don't support webhooks.

## Action nodes

Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems.

# Design your node's user interface

Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.

This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.

## Design guidance

All node's use n8n's [node UI elements](../../build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:

- Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
  - What can you leave out?
  - What can you simplify?
  - Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
- Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).

## Standards

### UI text style

| Element         | Style                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Drop-down value | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hint            | Sentence case                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Info box        | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |
| Node name       | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Parameter name  | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Subtitle        | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tooltip         | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.    |

### UI text terminology

- Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).
- Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
- Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
- Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it.

### Node naming conventions

| Convention                                                                                             | Correct         | Incorrect                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| If a node is a trigger node, the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |
| Don't include 'node' in the name.                                                                      | Asana           | Asana Node, Asana node          |

### Showing and hiding fields

Fields can either be:

- Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
- Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.

Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.

### Conventions by field type

#### Credentials

n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.

#### Resources and operations

APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.

When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.

#### Required fields

Order fields by:

- Most important to least important.
- Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.

#### Optional fields

- Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.
- If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.
- Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
- If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.

#### Help

There are five types of help built in to the GUI:

- Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](../../build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.
- Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
- Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
- Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](../../build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.
- Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon . Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
- You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.
- When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
- Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.

Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.

#### Errors

Make it clear which fields are required.

Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.

When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.

Refer to [Node Error Handling](../../build/reference/error-handling/) for more information.

#### Toggles

- Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . .** .
- You may need a list rather than a toggle:
  - Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
  - Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).

#### Lists

- Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
- Sort list options alphabetically.
- You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
- If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like **\***.

#### Trigger node inputs

When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:

- Name the parameter **Trigger on**.
- Don't include a tooltip.

#### Subtitles

Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:

```
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',
```

#### IDs

When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.

- Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
  - By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](../../build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information.
  - By entering an ID.
- Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's [Expressions](../../../../code/expressions/) documentation.
- Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
  - If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
  - If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.

#### Dates and timestamps

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

#### JSON

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

- Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
- Using an expression that returns JSON.

#### Node icons

### Common patterns and exceptions

This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.

#### Simplify responses

APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:

- Name: **Simplify Response**
- Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**

#### Upsert operations

This should always be a separate operation with:

- Name: **Create or Update**
- Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**

#### Boolean operators

n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.

For example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All**, as separate options.

#### Source keys or binary properties

Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**.

# Test a node

This section contains information about testing your node.

There are two ways to test your node:

- Manually, by [running it on your own machine](run-node-locally/) within a local n8n instance.
- Automatically, using the [linter](node-linter/).

You should use both methods before publishing your node.

# n8n node linter

n8n's node linter, [`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base), statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.

`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.

## Setup

If using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.

If using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.

Don't edit the configuration file

[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.

## Usage

You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.

### Linting

In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.

In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.

You can also run the linter manually:

- Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console.
- Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).

Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.

### Exceptions

Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.

To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).

To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance.

# Run your node locally

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:

   ```
   npm install n8n -g
   ```

1. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

   ```
   # In your node directory
   npm run build
   npm link
   ```

1. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

   ```
   # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
   # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
   npm link <node-package-name>
   ```

   Check your directory

   Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

   - `~/.n8n/custom/`
   - `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

1. Start n8n:

   ```
   n8n start
   ```

1. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

   Node names

   Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting

If there's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation, you have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`:

```
# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir custom 
cd custom 
npm init
```

# Troubleshooting

## Credentials

### Error message: 'Credentials of type "\*" aren't known'

Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

## Editor UI

### Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'

- Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to `packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
- Check that the names used in the `displayOptions` property are names used by UI elements in the node.

### Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI

- Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
- Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
- When the `icon` property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (`.png` or `.svg`) and that it prefixes it with `file:`. For example, `file:friendGrid.png` or `file:friendGrid.svg`.

### Node icon doesn't fit

- If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
- If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.

### Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing

Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (`ctrl` + `c`) and run it again. You may also need to re-run `npm link`.

### Linter incorrectly warning about file name case

The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a [known Windows issue](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-renaming-when-changing-case-doesnt-work/aa15ff7c-dd2d-4ed3-bcce-799ca90d4e58) with changing case when renaming files.

## Change instance ownership

You can change the ownership of an instance by navigating to the **Settings > Personal** page in the owner's account and editing the **Email** field. After making the changes, scroll down and press **Save**. Note that for the change to be effective, the new email address must not be associated with any other n8n account, as each instance can have only one **unique owner email**. If the intended email is already linked to an existing user, that user must be deleted before proceeding.

Changing emails will change the owner of the instance, the email you log in with, and the email your invoices and general communication gets sent to.

If the workspace is deactivated, there will be no **Settings** page and no possibility to change the email address or the owner info.

## Change instance username

It's not currently possible to change usernames.

If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it. [The import/export documentation](../../workflows/export-import/) explains how you can transfer your work to a new n8n instance.

# Cloud admin dashboard

Instance owners can access the admin dashboard to manage their Cloud instance. This is where you can upgrade your n8n version and set the timezone.

## Access the dashboard from the app

1. [Log in to n8n](https://app.n8n.cloud/magic-link)
1. Select **Admin Dashboard**. n8n opens the dashboard.

## Access the dashboard if the app is offline

If your instance is down, you can still access the admin dashboard. When you log in to the app, n8n will ask you if you want a magic link to access your dashboard. Select **Send magic link**, then check your email for the link.

# Cloud data management

There are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:

- Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.
- Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data

## Memory limits on each Cloud plan

Current plans:

- Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
- Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

Legacy plans:

- Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

n8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.

## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow

The way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.

- Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
- Avoid using the Code node where possible.
- Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
- Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

Note that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.

Interactions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.

## How to manage execution data on Cloud

Execution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.

Binary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.

If a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.

There are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:

In the admin dashboard:

1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.
1. Select **Manage**.
1. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.

In your workflow settings:

1. Select the **Options** menu.
1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
1. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.

## Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention

### Automatic data pruning

n8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:

- Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;
- Pro plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;
- Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.

### Manual data pruning

Heavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.

1. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.
1. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.

Due to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up.

# Cloud free trial

When you create a new n8n cloud trial, you have 14 days to try all the features of the [Pro plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/), including:

- Global variables
- Insights dashboard
- Execution search
- 5 days workflow history to rollback

The trial gives you Pro plan features with limits of 1000 executions and the same computing power as the [Starter plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

## Upgrade to a paid account

You can upgrade to a paid n8n account at any time. To upgrade:

1. Log in to your account.
1. Click the **Upgrade** button in the upper-right corner.

Click the **Contact** button on the [n8n website](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

# Cloud IP addresses

Cloud IP addresses change without warning

n8n can't guarantee static source IPs, as Cloud operates in a dynamic cloud provider environment and scales its infrastructure to meet demand. You should use strong authentication and secure transport protocols when connecting into and out of n8n.

Outbound traffic may appear to originate from any of:

- 20.79.227.226/32
- 20.113.47.122/32
- 20.218.202.73/32
- 98.67.233.91/32
- 4.182.111.50/32
- 4.182.129.20/32
- 4.182.88.118/32

# Cloud concurrency

Only for n8n Cloud

This document discusses concurrency in n8n Cloud. Read [self-hosted n8n concurrency control](../../hosting/scaling/concurrency-control/) to learn how concurrency works with self-hosted n8n instances.

Too many concurrent executions can cause performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode.

Any executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.

## Concurrency limits

n8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.

You can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.

## Details

Some other details about concurrency to keep in mind:

- Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.
- [Test evaluations](../../glossary/#evaluation-n8n) don't count towards concurrency limits. Your test evaluation concurrency limit is equal to, but separate from, your plan's regular concurrency limit.
- You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.
- On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.

## Comparison to queue mode

Feature availability

Queue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

Concurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance.

# Download workflows

n8n Cloud instance owners can download workflows from the most recent backup.

You can do this with the [Cloud admin dashboard](../cloud-admin-dashboard/).

## How to download workflows

1. [Log in to n8n](https://app.n8n.cloud/magic-link).
1. Select **Admin Dashboard** to open the dashboard.
1. In the **Manage** section, select the **Export** tab.
1. Select **Download Workflows**.

## Accessing workflows after your free trial

You have **90 days** to download your workflows after your free trial ends. After that, all workflows will be **permanently deleted** and are unrecoverable.

# n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud is n8n's hosted solution. It provides:

- No technical set up or maintenance for your n8n instance
- Continual uptime monitoring
- Managed OAuth for authentication
- One-click upgrades to the newest n8n versions

[Sign up for n8n Cloud](https://www.n8n.io/)

## GDPR

### Data processing agreement

For Cloud versions of n8n, n8n is considered both a Controller and a Processor as defined by the GDPR. As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Processing Agreement](https://n8n.io/legal/#data) as part of the company's standard [Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms).

The n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en). These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.

You can find a list of n8n sub-processors [here](#sub-processors).

Self-hosted n8n

For self-hosted versions, n8n is neither a Controller nor a Processor, as we don't manage your data

### GDPR for self-hosted users

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

## Data collection

n8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy).

The data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.

### Data collection in self-hosted n8n

n8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data.

#### What n8n collects

- Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)
- Error reports for app crashes and API issues
- The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)
- From node parameters:
  - The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)
  - For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)
- Data around workflow executions:
  - Status
  - The user ID of the user who ran the execution
  - The first time a workflow loads data from an external source
  - The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution
- The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).
- Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)
- Diagnostic information:
  - n8n version
  - Selected settings:
    - DB_TYPE
    - N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED
    - N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS
    - [Execution variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions/)
  - OS, RAM, and CPUs
  - Anonymous instance ID
- IP address

#### What n8n doesn't collect

n8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:

- Personally identifiable information (except IP address)
- Credential information
- Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')
- Execution data
- Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)
- Error payloads

#### How collection works

Most data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).

#### Opting out of telemetry

Telemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.

To opt out of telemetry events:

```
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
```

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:

```
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

To disable the templates feature (prevents background health check calls):

```
export N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false
```

See [configuration](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.

### Data collection in n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud collects everything listed in [Data collection in self-hosted n8n](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n).

Additionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.

### AI in n8n

To provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).

#### How n8n uses AI

To assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.

#### When n8n shares data

Data is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.

#### What n8n shares

- **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.
- **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.
- **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.
- **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.

#### What n8n doesn't share

- **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.
- **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.
- **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

### Documentation telemetry

n8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better. You can control cookie consent using the cookie widget.

## Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data

PID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.

### n8n Cloud

#### PID retention

n8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service.

For n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account.

n8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.

#### PID deletion

If you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.

### Self-hosted

Self-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](../what-you-can-do/) for more information.

## Payment processor

n8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method.

# What you can do

It's also your responsibility as a customer to ensure you are securing your code and data. This document lists some steps you can take.

## All users

- Report security issues and [terms of service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms) violations to security@n8n.io.
- If more than one person uses your n8n instance, set up [User management](../../user-management/) and follow the [Best practices](../../user-management/best-practices/).
- Use OAuth to connect integrations whenever possible.

## Self-hosted users

If you self-host n8n, there are additional steps you can take:

- Set up a reverse proxy to handle TLS, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.
- Ensure data is encrypted at rest by using encrypted partitions, or encryption at the hardware level, and ensuring n8n and its database is written to that location.
- Run a [Security audit](../../hosting/securing/security-audit/).
- Be aware of the [Risks](../../integrations/community-nodes/risks/) when installing community nodes, or choose to disable them.
- Make sure users can't import external modules in the Code node. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.
- Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.
- For maximum privacy, you can [Isolate n8n](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

### GDPR for self-hosted users

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

### New features

Notable new features.

#### Resource mapper UI component

This release includes a new UI component, the resource mapper. This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.

Refer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](../../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.

## n8n@0.222.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.221.2...n8n@0.222.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2023-03-30

This release contains new features, including custom filters for the executions list, and a new node to filter items in your workflows.

Upgrade to 0.222.1

Upgrade directly to 0.222.1.

### New features

This release introduces improvements to the execution lists. You can now save [Custom execution data](../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/), and use it to filter both the [All executions](../../workflows/executions/all-executions/) and [Single workflow executions](../../workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) lists.

- Add test overrides.
- Core: Improve LDAP/SAML toggle and tests.
- Core: Limit user invites when SAML is enabled.
- Core: Make OAuth2 error handling consistent with success handling.
- Editor: Fix ResourceLocator dropdown style.

### New nodes

This release introduces the [Filter](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filter/) node. The node allows you to filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.

## n8n@0.187.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.1...n8n@0.187.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2022-07-20

This release includes several major new features, including:

- The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.
- Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.

### New features

#### Community nodes repository

This release introduces the [community node repository](../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/). This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.

#### Data pinning

[Data pinning](../../data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.

#### Data mapping

This release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](../../data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.

#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators

This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request. n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `"generic"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.

You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.

For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).

```
// in AsanaApi.credentials.ts
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class AsanaApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'asanaApi';
	displayName = 'Asana API';
	documentationUrl = 'asana';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'Access Token',
			name: 'accessToken',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];

	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			headers: {
				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.accessToken}}',
			},
		},
	};
}
```

#### Other new features

- Added a `preAuthentication` method to credentials.
- Added more credentials tests.
- Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.

### Node enhancements

- [ERPNext node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext/): add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.
- [Google Drive node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/): add support for move to trash.

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.177.0...n8n@0.178.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2022-05-24

This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.

The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.

### New features

#### Credential reuse for custom API operations

n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.

For more information, refer to [Custom API operations](../../integrations/custom-operations/).

#### Node details view

An improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.

### Node enhancements

[Salesforce Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/): Add the **Country** field.

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.174.0...n8n@0.175.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2022-05-02

This release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.

### New features

#### Node versioning

0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays).

## n8n@0.167.0

For a comprehensive list of changes, view the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n%400.166.0...n8n@0.167.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2022-03-13

### Highlights

#### Luxon and JMESPath

0.167.0 adds support for two new libraries:

- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/): a JavaScript library for working with date and time
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/): a query language for JSON

You can use Luxon and JMESPath in the code editor and in expressions.

#### New expressions variables

We've added two new variables to simplify working with date and time in expressions:

- `$now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
- `$today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).

#### Negative operations in If and Switch nodes

Made it easier to perform negative operations on strings.

This release adds one new operation for numbers:

- Is Not Empty

And the following new operations for strings:

- Not Ends With
- Regex Not Match
- Not Starts With
- Is Not Empty

Additionally, Regex is now labelled Regex Match.

#### New node: Redis Trigger

Added a Redis Trigger node, so you can now start workflows based on a Redis event.

- [Redis Trigger:](../../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redistrigger/) Added a Redis Trigger node.

### Core functionality

- Added support for [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) and [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/).

**Release date:** 2025-11-24

This release contains bug fixes and features.

### MCP Client node

The **MCP Client node** allows you to connect to and use tools exposed by remote MCP servers directly within your workflow.

Previously, this functionality was only available through AI Agents using the **MCP Client Tool**. With this standalone node, you can now call MCP servers *from any step* in your workflow without relying on an Agent - providing greater flexibility and control over how and where you integrate external tools.

### Custom project roles

**What's new**\
You can now define **custom project roles** that precisely control what a user can do **inside a project**.

- Three **system roles** remain built‑in and non-editable (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- You can **create your own roles** (e.g. “Workflow Builder”, “Credential Manager”, “Read‑only Analyst”) with granular permissions per resource:
- Project
- Folders
- Workflows
- Credentials
- Data tables / Variables
- Pushing changes via source control\
  Example: a “Workflow Builder” role that can:
- View everything in the project
- Create and edit workflows and folders
- Use existing credentials but not create or edit credentials

Project roles is now available in the settings of your n8n Enterprise instance.

**How it works**

1. Go to the new Project roles section (instance admins only).
1. Start from a preset (Admin, Editor, Viewer) or from scratch.
1. Configure CRUD‑style permissions.
1. Save the role. It now becomes available in the project member picker alongside system roles.
1. Assign these roles to project members.

Custom project roles let you assign permissions that match your organization's needs, improving governance and security in a clear, transparent, and manageable way.

Custom project roles is only available on **n8n enterprise**.

### User provisioning via SSO

If you’re using SAML or OIDC, your Identity Provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.) can now automatically assign each user’s instance role and project roles when they log in.

When enabled, administrators can map a group or individual on their SSO identity provider to an instance role and one or more project roles.

This allows you to manage access centrally from your IdP with automated onboarding and off-boarding, eliminating manual access updates inside the n8n UI

Learn more in our dedicated documentation pages.

For [OIDC](../../user-management/oidc/setup/#instance-and-project-access-provisioning) For [SAML](../../user-management/saml/setup/#instance-and-project-access-provisioning)

Notes: User provisioning is not real-time and updates apply on the user’s next login.

User provisioning is only available on n8n Enterprise.

- The AI Workflow Builder now uses improved internal best-practice instructions, which helps it generate higher quality workflows for users.
- Core updates allow creating data tables from CSV files, configurable workflow statistics, and improved user role provisioning for enterprise, including SSO settings integration.
- Enterprise customers using Single Sign On via SAML or OIDC can now provision the instance role and project role of each user in their organisation from their Identity Provider.
- See the [new SAML documentation](../../user-management/saml/setup/#instance-and-project-access-provisioning)
- See the [new OIDC documentation](../../user-management/oidc/setup/#instance-and-project-access-provisioning)
- The editor features a dismissable callout for scaling mode, CSV download for data tables, custom project roles (Beta), and enhanced data table visibility.
- Additional improvements include Stripe billing meter events, and updates to binary data handling and workflow search.

### Critical security update

This release contains a critical security update. For more information, see [Security Advisory: Security Vulnerability in n8n Versions 1.65-1.120.4](https://blog.n8n.io/security-advisory-20260108/).

### Instance-level MCP connections (beta)

You can now enable MCP connections at the instance level, giving MCP-compatible AI platforms access to all selected workflows through a single oAuth-secured connection.

Once connected, these platforms can discover and interact with your workflows directly from their own interfaces, so you can observe, query, and trigger n8n workflows without switching contexts. As you add new MCP-enabled workflows to your instance, they automatically become available through the same connection without additional setup.

🛠️ How to: To enable workflows through an instance-level MCP connection, both your instance and each workflow must be opted in.

- To turn this feature on in your n8n instance, go the settings page for the instance and switch the Enable MCP Access toggle to on.
- To allow access to individual workflows, go to the settings in each workflow and switch the Available in MCP toggle to on.

🧠 Keep in mind:

- To keep access organized and auditable, consider using a workspace or team account when connecting on behalf of an organization.
- All platforms connected to your instance MCP will have access to each of the workflows you have enabled. At this time, you cannot limit access of individual workflows to particular platforms.

This feature simplifies integration and improves visibility across AI platforms that support MCP, helping you use your n8n workflows directly in the tools where you already work and experiment. [Learn more in documentation.](../../advanced-ai/accessing-n8n-mcp-server/)

### Guardrails Node

The Guardrails node provides a set of rules and policies that control an AI agent's behavior by filtering its inputs and outputs. This helps safeguard from malicious input and from generating unsafe or undesirable responses. There are two operations:

- Check Text for Violations: Validate text against a set of policies (e.g. NSFW, prompt injection).
- Sanitize Text: Detects and replaces specific data such as PII, URLs, or secrets with placeholders.

The default presets and prompts are adapted from the open-source [guardrails package](https://github.com/openai/openai-guardrails-js) made available by OpenAI.

For more info, see [Guardrails documentation](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.guardrails/)

### OAuth for MCP Client Tool node

The MCP Client Tool now supports OAuth authentication, enabling secure connections to APIs that implement delegated access flows. [Learn more](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) about the MCP Client Tool node.

### Project-level variables

You can now create variables at either the global or project level.

- Project-level variables are only visible and usable by members of that project.
- Global variables can be overridden at the project level for more specific configurations.
- The maximum character limit has been increased to 1,000 to support longer values.

This update improves security and flexibility as part of our ongoing effort to isolate data and settings per project.

### Improvements to Environments

We’ve made several updates to improve reliability, consistency, and control across environments.

- **Projects are now fully synchronized across environments.** When a workflow is pushed within a project, it’s automatically created and synced in all environments where it’s pulled. Moving, renaming, or deleting projects is now reflected everywhere, keeping instances aligned.
- **Improved protection for read-only environments.** Read-only instances now block all changes, including folder moves and workflow ownership updates, ensuring production environments stay stable and isolated.
- **Bug fix: tag mapping synchronization.** Fixed an issue where tag mappings only updated when tags changed. They now sync on every commit for consistent tagging across environments.

### Custom date ranges for Insights

You can now define custom date ranges instead of using fixed ones, giving you more control over the data you analyze.

### Data migration tool

You can now easily migrate n8n data between different database types. This new tooling currently supports SQLite and Postgres, making the transition to a scaling database choice simpler, allowing you to take your data with you.

The tooling comes in the form of two new CLI commands, `export:entities` and `import:entities`

**`Export`** The new export command lets you export data from your existing n8n database (SQLite / Postgres), producing a set of encrypted files within a compressed directory for you to move around and use with the import commands.

For details, see [Export entities](../../hosting/cli-commands/#export-entities)

**`Import`** The new import command allows you to read from a compressed and encrypted set of files generated from the new export command, and import them in to your new database of choice (SQLite / Postgres) to be used with your n8n instance.

For details, see [Import entities](../../hosting/cli-commands/#import-entities)

### AI Workflow Builder (Beta)

**AI Workflow Builder** turns your natural language prompts into working automations. Describe what you want to build, and n8n will generate a draft workflow by adding and configuring nodes and wiring up the logic for you. From there, you can refine, expand, or adjust the workflow directly in the editor.

This feature helps you move from idea to implementation faster and without losing technical control. It’s especially helpful when starting from a blank canvas, validating an approach, or exploring new nodes and capabilities. Multi-turn interaction lets you iterate in conversation, turning your ideas into structured, production-ready workflows step by step.

Learn more about how we we’re building this feature in our [forum post](https://community.n8n.io/t/ai-powered-workflow-building-coming-soon/196499).

[](/_video/release-notes/AI_Workflow_Builder.webm)

**Availability:**

- This feature is initially going to be available for Cloud users on the 14-day Trial, Starter and Pro plans.
- Availability for Enterprise users on Cloud will follow in a future update.
- We are actively exploring the best way to bring this feature to self-hosted users.

**Rollout timing:**

- To ensure the smoothest experience for all users, this feature will be rolled out to users on version 1.115.0 over the course of a week so you may not have access to the feature immediately when you upgrade to 1.115.0.

**Credit limits by plan:** This feature will have monthly credit limits [by plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

- Each prompt/interaction with the AI Workflow Builder consumes one credit.

### Python task runner

This version introduces the **Python task runner** as a beta feature. This feature secures n8n's Python sandbox and enables users to run real Python modules in n8n workflows. The original Pyodide-based implementation will be phased out.

This is a **breaking change** that replaces Pyodide - see [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/#python-native-beta) for a list of differences. Any Code node set to the legacy `python` parameter will need to be manually updated to use the new `pythonNative` parameter. Any Code node script set to `python` and relying on Pyodide syntax is likely to need to be manually adjusted to account for breaking changes.

- For self-hosting users, see [here](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/#setting-up-external-mode) for deployment instructions for task runners going forward and how to install extra dependencies.
- On n8n Cloud, this will be a gradual transition. If in your n8n Cloud instance the Code node offers an option named "Python (Native) (Beta)", then your instance has been transitioned to native Python and you will need to look out for any breaking changes. Imports are disabled for security reasons at this time.

The native Python runner is currently in beta and is subject to change as we find a balance between security and usability. Your feedback is welcome.

### Data tables

We’re excited to introduce **data tables**, bringing built-in data storage to n8n. You can now store and query structured data directly inside the platform, without relying on external databases for many common automation scenarios. Track workflow state between runs, store tokens or session data, keep product or customer reference tables, or stage intermediate results for multi-step processes.

Previously, persisting data meant provisioning and connecting to an external store such as Redis or Google Sheets. That added credential setup, infrastructure overhead, latency, and constant context switching. **Data tables** eliminate that friction and keeps your data easily editable and close to your workflows.

Data tables are available today on all plans. They currently support numbers, strings, and datetimes with JSON support coming soon. On Cloud, each instance can store up to 50 MB. On self-hosted setups, the default is also 50 MB, but this limit can be adjusted if your infrastructure allows.

[Overview of data tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkiIkt6lZ4)

🛠️ **How to:**

**Create a data table**

- From the canvas, open the **Create workflow** dropdown and select **Create Data table**.
- Or, go to the **Overview** panel on the left-side navigation bar and open the **Data tables** tab.

**Use a data table in your workflow**

- Add the **Data table node** to your workflow to get, update, insert, upsert, or delete rows.

**Adjust the storage limit** (self-hosted only)

- Change the default 50 MB limit with the environment variable: `N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`. [See configuration docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

🧠**Keep in mind**

- Data tables don’t currently support foreign keys or default values.
- For now, all data tables are accessible to everyone in a project. More granular permissions and sharing options are planned.

Learn more about [**data tables**](../../data/data-tables/) and the [**Data table node**](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datatable/).

This release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.

### SSO improvements

We’ve made updates to strengthen Single Sign-On (SSO) reliability and security, especially for enterprise and multi-instance setups.

- OIDC and SAML sync in multi-main setups \[version: 1.113.0\]: In multi-main deployments, updates to SSO settings are now synchronized across all instances, ensuring consistent login behavior everywhere.
- Enhanced OIDC integration \[version 1.111.0\]: n8n now supports OIDC providers that enforce state and nonce parameters. These are validated during login, providing smoother and more secure Single Sign-On.

### Filter insights by project

We've added project filtering to insights, enabling more granular reporting and visibility into individual project performance.

- Retry execution endpoint: Added new public API endpoints to retry failed executions.
- Additional filters: You can now filter executions by running or canceled status.

### Enhancements to workflow diff

We added a several updates on workflows diffs as well:

- Better view in Code nodes and Stickies: Workflow diffs now highlight changes per line instead of per block, making edits easier to review and understand.
- Enable/Disable sync: You can now enable or disable sync in the viewport, letting you compare a workflow change in one view without affecting the other.

### Workflow Diff

For teams working across different environments, deployments often involve multiple people making changes at different times. Without a clear view of those changes, it’s easy to miss something important.

[Workflow Diff](../../source-control-environments/using/compare-changes/) gives you an easy and visual way to review workflow changes before you deploy them between environments.

With it, you can:

- Quickly see what’s been added, changed, or deleted, with clear colour highlights.
- Easily see important settings changes on a workflow.
- Check changes inside each node, and spot connector updates, with a side-by-side view of its settings.
- Get a quick count of all changes to understand the size of a deployment.

Workflow Diff

Workflow Diff eases the review and approval of changes before deployment, enabling teams to collaborate on workflows without breaking existing automations or disrupting production. It’s one step further in integrating DevOps best practices in n8n.

Now available for Enterprise customers using Environments.

### **No more limit of active workflows and new self-hosted Business Plan**

We have rolled out a new pricing model to make it easier for builders of all sizes to adopt and scale automation with n8n.

***What’s new***

**No more limit of active workflows.**

All n8n plans, from Starter to Enterprise, now include unlimited users, workflows, and steps. Our pricing is based on the volume of executions. Meaning you can build and test as many workflows as you want, including complex, data-heavy, or long-running automations, without worrying about quotas.

**New self-hosted Business Plan for growing teams**

Designed for SMBs and mid-sized companies, the Business Plan includes features such as:

- 6 shared projects
- SSO, SAML and LDAP
- Different environments
- Global variables
- Version control using Git
- 30 days of Insights

Please note that this plan only includes support from our community forum. For dedicated support we recommend upgrading to our Enterprise plan.

**Enterprise pricing now scales with executions**

Enterprise plans no longer use workflow-based pricing, and is now also based on the volume of executions.

***What you need to do***

To ensure these changes apply to your account, update your n8n instance to the latest version.

[Read the blog](https://blog.n8n.io/build-without-limits-everything-you-need-to-know-about-n8ns-new-pricing/) for full details.

### **Respond to Chat node**

With the [\*\*Respond to Chat](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/) node\*\*, you can now access Human-in-the-Loop functionality natively in n8n Chat.

Enable conversational experiences where you can ask for clarification, request approval before taking further action, and get back intermediate results — all within a single workflow execution.

This unlocks multi-turn interactions that feel more natural and reduce the number of executions required. It is ideal for building interactive AI use cases like conversational forms, branched workflows based on user replies, and step-by-step approvals.

🛠️ **How to:**

- Add a **Chat Trigger** node and select **Using Respond Nodes** for the **Response mode**
- Place the **Respond to Chat** node anywhere in your workflow to send a message into the Chat and optionally wait for the user to input a response before continuing execution of the workflow steps.

### **Chat streaming**

No more waiting for full responses to load when using the n8n chat interface. **Streaming** now delivers AI-generated text replies word by word so users can read messages as they’re being generated. It feels faster, smoother, and more like what people expect from chat experiences.

Streaming is available in public chat views (hosted or embedded) and can be used in custom apps via webhook.

🛠️ How-to

Configure streaming in the Node Details View of these nodes:

- Chat Trigger node: Options>Add Field>Response Mode>Streaming
- Webhook node: Respond>Streaming
- AI Agent node: Add option> Enable streaming

[](/_video/release-notes/streaming.webm)

### Improved instance user list with more visibility

The instance user list has been updated with a new table layout and additional details to help admins manage access more easily.

You can now:

- See total users and filter by name or email
- View which projects each user has access to
- Whether a user has enabled 2FA and sort based on that
- See the last active date for each user

This makes it easier to audit user activity, identify inactive accounts, and understand how access is distributed across your instance.

### Webhook HTML responses

Starting with this release, if your workflow sends an HTML response to a webhook, n8n automatically wraps the content in an `<iframe>`. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

### Built-in Metrics for AI Evaluations

Using evaluations is a best practice for any AI solution, and a must if reliability and predictability are business-critical. With this release, we’ve made it easier to set up evaluations in n8n by introducing a set of built-in metrics. These metrics can review AI responses and assign scores based on factors like correctness, helpfulness, and more.

You can run regular evaluations and review scores over time as a way to monitor your AI workflow's performance. You can also compare results across different models to help guide model selection, or run evaluations before and after a prompt change to support data-driven, iterative building.

As with all evaluations in n8n, you’ll need a dataset that includes the inputs you want to test. For some evaluations, the dataset must also include expected outputs (ground truth) to compare against. The evaluation workflow runs each input through the portion you're testing to generate a response. The built-in metric scores each response based on the aspect you're measuring, allowing you to compare results before and after changes or track trends over time in the Evaluations tab.

You can still define your own custom metrics, but for common use cases, the built-in options make it much faster to implement.

🛠️ **How to:**

1. Set up your evaluation as described [here](../../advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations/#how-it-works), using an **Evaluation** node as the trigger and another with the **Set Metrics** operation.
1. In the **Set Metrics** node, choose a metric from the dropdown list.
1. Define any additional parameters required for your selected metric. In most cases, this includes mapping the dataset columns to the appropriate fields.

📏 **Available built-in metrics:**

- **Correctness (AI-based):** Compares AI workflow-generated responses to expected answers. Another LLM acts as a judge, scoring the responses based on guidance you provide in the prompt.
- **Helpfulness (AI-based):** Evaluates how helpful a response is in relation to a user query, using an LLM and prompt-defined scoring criteria.
- **String Similarity:** Measures how closely the response matches the expected output by comparing strings. Useful for command generation or when output needs to follow a specific structure.
- **Categorization:** Checks whether a response matches an expected label, such as assigning items to the correct category.
- **Tools Used:** Verifies whether the AI agent called the tools you specified in your dataset. To enable this, make sure **Return Intermediate Steps** is turned on in your agent so the evaluation can access the tools it actually called.

🧠 Keep in mind

- Registered Community Edition enables analysis of one evaluation in the **Evaluations** tab which allows easy comparison of evaluation runs over time. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations in the **Evaluations** tab.

### AI Agent Tool node

With the **AI Agent Tool** node we are introducing a simplified pattern for multi-agent orchestration that can be run in a single execution and stay entirely on one canvas. You can now connect multiple **AI Agent Tool** nodes to a primary **AI Agent** node, allowing it to supervise and delegate work across other specialized agents.

This setup is especially useful for building complex systems that function like real-world teams, where a lead agent assigns parts of a task to specialists. You can even add multiple layers of agents directing other agents, just like you would have in a real multi-tiered organizational structure. It also helps with prompt management by letting you split long, complex instructions into smaller, focused tasks across multiple agents. While similar orchestration was already possible using sub-workflows, AI Agent Tool nodes are a good choice when you want the interaction to happen within a single execution or prefer to manage and debug everything from a single canvas.

🛠️ **How to:**

- Add an **AI Agent** node to your workflow and click **+** to create a Tools connection.
- Search for and select the **AI Agent Tool** node from the Nodes Panel.
- Name the node clearly so the primary agent can reference it, then add a short description and prompt.
- Connect any LLMs, memory, and tools the agent needs to perform its role.
- Instruct the primary **AI Agent** on when to use the **AI Agent Tool** and to pass along relevant context in its prompt.

🧠 **Keep in mind:**

- The orchestrating agent does not pass full execution context by default. Any necessary context must be included in the prompt.

**AI Agent Tool** nodes makes it easier to build layered, agent-to-agent workflows without relying on sub-workflows, helping you move faster when building and debugging multi-agent systems.

### Enforce 2FA across your instance

Enterprise Instance owners can now enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users in their instance.

Once enabled, any user who hasn’t set up 2FA will be redirected to complete the setup before they can continue using n8n. This helps organizations meet internal security policies and ensures stronger protection across the workspace.

This feature is available only on the Enterprise plan.

### Model Selector node

The [Model Selector node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.modelselector/) gives you more control when working with multiple LLMs in your workflows.

Use it to determine which connected model should handle a given input, based on conditions like expressions or global variables. This makes it easier to implement model routing strategies, such as switching models based on performance, task type, cost, or availability.

🛠️ **How to:** Connect multiple model nodes to the Model Selector node, then configure routing conditions in the node’s settings.

🧠 **Keep in mind:**

- Rules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule determines which model is used even if others would also match.
- As a sub-node, expressions behave differently here: they always resolves to the first item rather than resolving for each item in turn.

The Model Selector node is especially useful in evaluation or production scenarios where routing logic between models needs to adapt based on performance, cost, availability, or dataset-specific needs.

Model Selector node

### Support for OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication

You can now use OIDC (OpenID Connect) as an authentication method for Single Sign-On (SSO).

This gives enterprise teams more flexibility to integrate n8n with their existing identity providers using a widely adopted and easy-to-manage standard. OIDC is now available alongside SAML, giving Enterprises the choice to select what best fits their internal needs.

### Project admins can now commit to Git within environments

Project admins now have the ability to commit workflow and credential changes directly to Git through the environments feature. This update streamlines the workflow deployment process by giving project-level admins direct control over committing their changes. It also ensures that the those who know their workflows best can review and commit updates themselves, without needing to involve instance-level admins.

### Automatically name nodes

Default node names now update automatically based on the resource and operation selected, so you’ll always know what a node does at a glance.

This adds clarity to your canvas and saves time renaming nodes manually.

Don’t worry, automatic naming won’t break references. And, and if you’ve renamed a node yourself, we’ll leave it just the way you wrote it.

[](/_video/release-notes/automatic_node_naming.mp4)

### Support for RAG extended with built-in templates

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve AI responses by providing language models access to data sources with up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this data efficiently.

To get the benefits of using vector stores, such as returning results based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches, you need a way to upload your data to the vector store and a way to query it.

In n8n, uploading and querying vectors stores happens in two workflows. Now, you have an example to get your started and make implementation easier with the **RAG starter template**.

- The **Load Data** workflow shows how to add data with the appropriate embedding model, split it into chunks with the [Default Data Loader](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/), and add metadata as desired.
- The **Retriever** workflow for querying data, shows how agents and vector stores work together to help you define highly relevant results and save tokens using the **Question and Answer** tool.

Enable semantic search and the retrieval of unstructured data for increased quality and relevance of AI responses.

🛠️ **How to:**

- Search for **RAG starter template** in the search bar of the Nodes panel to insert it into your workflow.

### Convert to sub-workflow

Large, monolithic workflows can slow things down. They’re harder to maintain, tougher to debug, and more difficult to scale. With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.

Until now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. **Convert to sub-workflow** allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.

[](/_video/release-notes/convert_to_sub-workflow.mp4)

**How it works**

1. Highlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:
   - Be fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them
   - Start from a single starting node
   - End with a single node
1. Right-click to open the context menu and select **Convert to sub-workflow**
   - Or use the shortcut: `Alt + X`
1. n8n will:
   - Open a new tab containing the selected nodes
   - Preserve all node parameters as-is
   - Replace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a **Call My Sub-workflow** node

*Note*: You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.

This makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.

### API support for assigning users to projects

You can now use the API to add and update users within projects. This includes:

- Assigning existing or pending users to a project with a specific role
- Updating a user’s role within a project
- Removing users from one or more projects

This update now allows you to use the API to add users to both the instance and specific projects, removing the need to manually assign them in the UI.

### Add pending users to project member assignment

You can now add **pending users,** those who have been invited but haven't completed sign-up, to projects as members.

This change lets you configure a user's project access upfront, without waiting for them to finish setting up their account. It eliminates the back-and-forth of managing access post-sign-up, ensuring users have the right project roles immediately upon joining.

### Evaluations for AI workflows

We’ve added a feature to help you iterate, test, and compare changes to your AI automations before pushing them to production so you can achieve more predictability and make better decisions.

When you're building with AI, a small prompt tweak or model swap might improve results with some inputs, while quietly degrading performance with others. But without a way to evaluate performance across many inputs, you’re left guessing whether your AI is actually getting better when you make a change.

By implementing **Evaluations for AI workflows** in n8n, you can assess how your AI performs across a range of inputs by adding a dedicated path in your workflow for running test cases and applying custom metrics to track results. This helps you build viable proof-of-concepts quickly, iterate more effectively, catch regressions early, and make more confident decisions when your AI is in production.

#### Evaluation node and tab

The **Evaluation node** includes several operations that, when used together, enable end-to-end AI evaluation.

Evaluation node

Use this node to:

- Run your AI logic against a wide range of test cases in the same execution
- Capture the outputs of those test cases
- Score the results using your own metrics or LLM-as-judge logic
- Isolate a testing path to only include the nodes and logic you want to evaluate

The **Evaluations tab** enables you to review test results in the n8n UI, perfect for comparing runs, spotting regressions, and viewing performance over time.

#### 🛠 How evaluations work

The evaluation path runs alongside your normal execution logic and only activates when you want—making it ideal for testing and iteration.

Get started by selecting an AI workflow you want to evaluate that includes one or more LLM or Agent nodes.

1. Add an **Evaluation** node with the **On new Evaluation event** operation. This node will act as an additional trigger you’ll run only when testing. Configure it to read your dataset from Google Sheets, with each row representing a test input.

   > 💡 Better datasets mean better evaluations. Craft your dataset from a variety of test cases, including edge cases and typical inputs, to get meaningful feedback on how your AI performs. Learn more and access sample datasets [here](../../advanced-ai/evaluations/light-evaluations/#1-create-a-dataset).

1. Add a second **Evaluation** node using the **Set Outputs** operation after the part of the workflow you're testing—typically after an LLM or Agent node. This captures the response and writes it back to your dataset in Google Sheets.

1. To evaluate output quality, add a third **Evaluation** node with the **Set Metrics** operation at a point after you’ve generated the outputs. You can develop workflow logic, custom calculations, or add an LLM-as-Judge to score the outputs. Map these metrics to your dataset in the node’s parameters.

   > 💡 Well-defined metrics = smarter decisions. Scoring your outputs based on similarity, correctness, or categorization can help you track whether changes are actually improving performance. Learn more and get links to example templates [here](../../advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations/#2-add-metrics-to-workflow).

Evaluation workflow

When the Evaluation trigger node is executed, it runs each input in our dataset through your AI logic. This continues until all test cases are processed, a limit is reached, or you manually stop the execution. Once your evaluation path is set up, you can update your prompt, model, or workflow logic—and re-run the Evaluation trigger node to compare results. If you’ve added metrics, they’ll appear in the Evaluations tab.

In some instances, you may want to isolate your testing path to make iteration faster or to avoid executing downstream logic. In this case, you can add an Evaluation node with the `Check If Evaluating` operation to ensure only the expected nodes run when performing evaluations.

#### Things to keep in mind

Evaluations for AI Workflows are designed to fit into your development flow, with more enhancements on the way. For now, here are a few things to note:

- Test datasets are currently managed through Google Sheets. You’ll need a Google Sheets credential to run evaluations.
- Each workflow supports one evaluation at a time. If you’d like to test multiple segments, consider splitting them into sub-workflows for more flexibility.
- Community Edition supports one single evaluation. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations.
- AI Evaluations are not enabled for instances in scaling mode at this time.

You can find details, tips, and common troubleshooting info [here](../../advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/).

## n8n@1.94.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.93.0...n8n@1.94.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2025-05-19

This release contains editor improvements, an API update, node updates, new nodes, and bug fixes.

### Verified community nodes on Cloud

We’ve expanded the n8n ecosystem and unlocked a new level of flexibility for all users including those on n8n Cloud! Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in.

This update focuses on three major improvements:

- **Cloud availability**: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud.
- **Built-in discovery**: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm.
- **Trust and verification**: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark.

We’re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don’t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout.

This is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.

Learn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our [blog](https://blog.n8n.io/community-nodes-available-on-n8n-cloud/) post.

💻 **Use a verified node**

Make sure you're on **n8n version 1.94.0** or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to [documentation](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/). In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default.

- Open the **Nodes panel** from the editor
- Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield 🛡️
- Select the node and click **Install**

[](/_video/release-notes/Community-nodes-node-panel.mp4)

Once an Owner installs a node, everyone on the instance can start using it—just drag, drop, and connect like any other node in your workflow.

🛠️ **Build a node and get it verified**

Want your node to be verified and discoverable from the editor? Here’s how to get involved:

1. Review the [community node verification guidelines](../../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines/).
1. If you’re building something new, follow the recommendations for [creating nodes](../../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/).
1. Check your design against the [UX guidelines](../../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
1. [Submit your node](../../integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/) to npm.
1. Request verification by filling out [this form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b).

**Already built a node? Raise your hand!**

If you’ve already published a community node and want it considered for verification, make sure it meets the requirements noted above, then let us know by submitting the interest [form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b). We’re actively curating the next batch and would love to include your work.

### Extended logs view

When workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended **Logs View** comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views.

This update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.

You can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.

⚙️**What it does**

- Adds a **Logs view** to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed. (Chat also appears here if your workflow uses it).
- Displays a **hierarchical list of nodes** in the order they were executed—including expanded views of sub-workflows.
- Allows you to **click a node in hierarchy** to preview inputs and outputs directly, or jump into the full Node Details view with a link.
- Provides ability to **toggle** input and output data on and off.
- Highlights each node **live as it runs**, showing when it starts, completes, or fails.
- Includes **execution history** view to explore past execution data in a similar way.
- Shows **roll-up stats** like total execution time and total AI tokens used (for AI-enabled workflows).
- Includes a **“pop out”** button to open the logs as a floating window—perfect for dragging to another screen while debugging.

🛠️**How to**

To access the expanded logs view, click on the Logs bar at the bottom of the canvas. The view is also opens up when you open the chat window on the bottom of the page.

## n8n@1.93.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.92.0...n8n@1.93.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2025-05-12

This release contains core updates, editor improvements, new nodes, node updates, and bug fixes.

### Faster ways to open sub-workflows

We’ve added several new ways to navigate your multi-workflow automations faster.

From any workflow with a sub-workflow node:

🖱️ Right-click on a sub-workflow node and select `Open sub-workflow` from the context menu

⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts

- **Windows:** `CTRL + SHIFT + O` or `CTRL + Double Click`
- **Mac:** `CMD + SHIFT + O` or `CMD + Double Click`

These options will bring your sub-workflow up in a new tab.

### Archive workflows

If you’ve ever accidentally removed a workflow, you’ll appreciate the new archiving feature. Instead of permanently deleting workflows with the Remove action, workflows are now archived by default. This allows you to recover them if needed.

**How to:**

- **Archive a workflow** - Select **Archive** from the Editor UI menu. It has replaced the **Remove** action.
- **Find archived workflows** - Archived workflows are hidden by default. To find your archived workflows, select the option for **Show archived workflows** in the workflow filter menu.
- **Permanently delete a workflow** - Once a workflow is archived, you can **Delete** it from the options menu.
- **Recover a workflow** - Select **Unarchive** from the options menu.

**Keep in mind:**

- Workflows archival requires the same permissions as required previously for removal.
- You cannot select archived workflows as sub-workflows to execute
- Active workflows are deactivated when they are archived
- Archived workflows can not be edited

### Partial Execution for AI Tools

We’ve made it easier to build and iterate on AI agents in n8n. You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.

Partial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.

Partial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.

[](/_video/release-notes/AI-agent-partial-execution.mp4)

**How to:**

To use this feature you can either:

- Click the **Play** button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.
- Open the tool’s **Node Details View** and select **"Execute Step"** to run it from there.

If you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution. A pop-up form will open where you can manually fill in the parameters before executing your test.

### Extended logs view

When workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended **Logs View** comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views.

This update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.

You can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.

⚙️**What it does**

### Insights enhancements for Enterprise

Two weeks after the launch of [Insights](../../insights/), we’re releasing some enhancements designed for enterprise users.

- **Expanded time ranges**. You can now filter insights over a variety of time periods, from the last 24 hours up to 1 year. Pro users are limited to 7 day and 14 day views.
- **Hourly granularity**. Drill down into the last 24 hours of production executions with hourly granularity, making it easier to analyze workflows and quickly identify issues.

These updates provide deeper visibility into workflow history, helping you uncover trends over longer periods and detect problems sooner with more precise reporting.

### Extended HTTP Request tool functionality

We’ve brought the full power of the HTTP Request node to the HTTP Request tool in AI workflows. That means your AI Agents now have access to all the advanced configuration options—like Pagination, Batching, Timeout, Redirects, Proxy support, and even cURL import.

[](/_video/release-notes/http-request-tool.mp4)

This update also includes support for the `$fromAI` function to dynamically generate the right parameters based on the context of your prompt — making API calls smarter, faster, and more flexible than ever.

**How to:**

- Open your AI Agent node in the canvas.
- Click the **‘+’ icon** to add a new tool connection.
- In the **Tools panel**, select HTTP **Request Tool.**
- Configure it just like you would a regular **HTTP Request node** — including advanced options

👉 Learn more about configuring the [HTTP Request tool](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/).

### Scoped API keys

Users on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.

Scoped API keys

Previously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases. Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.

**What’s new**

When creating a new API key, you can now:

- Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.
- Specify which resources the key can interact with.

Supported scopes include:

- Variables — list, create, delete
- Security audit — generate reports
- Projects — list, create, update, delete
- Executions — list, read, delete
- Credentials — list, create, update, delete, move
- Workflows — list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags

Scoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what’s needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.

### Drag and Drop in Folders

Folders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now **drag and drop workflows and folders** — making it even easier to keep things tidy.

Need to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It’s a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.

[](/_video/release-notes/Drag-and-drop-folders.mp4)

📁 Folders are available to all [registered](../../hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users—jump in and get your workspace in order!

### Insights

We're rolling out [Insights](../../insights/), a new dashboard to monitor how your workflows are performing over time. It's designed to give admins (and owners) better visibility of their most important workflow metrics and help troubleshoot potential issues and improvements.

In this first release, we’re introducing a summary banner, the insights dashboard, and time saved per execution.

#### 1. Summary banner

A new banner on the overview page that gives instance admins and owners a birds eye view of key metrics over the last 7 days.

Insights summary banner

Available metrics:

- Total production executions
- Total failed executions
- Failure rate
- Average runtime of all workflows
- Estimated time saved

This overview is designed to help you stay on top of workflow activity at a glance. It is available for all plans and editions.

#### 2. Insights dashboard

On Pro and Enterprise plans, a new dashboard offers a deeper view into workflow performance and activity.

Insights dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- Total production executions over time, including a comparison of successful and failed executions
- Per-workflow breakdowns of key metrics
- Comparisons with previous periods to help spot changes in usage or behavior
- Runtime average and failure rate over time

#### 3. Time saved per execution

Within workflow settings, you can now assign a “time saved per execution” value to any workflow. This makes it possible to track the impact of your workflows and make it easier to share this visually with other teams and stakeholders.

This is just the beginning for Insights: the next phase will introduce more advanced filtering and comparisons, custom date ranges, and additional monitoring capabilities.

### Node updates

- We added a credential check for the Salesforce node
- We added SearXNG as a tool for AI agents

You can now search within subfolders, making it easier to find workflows across all folder levels. Just type in the search bar and go.

## n8n@1.88.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.87.0...n8n@1.88.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2025-04-10

This release contains new features, new nodes, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes

MCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system.

While it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker.

We are adding two new nodes:

- a MCP [Server Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/) for any workflow
- a MCP [Client Tool](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) for the AI Agent

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface.

Max from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started:

[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/45WPU7P-1QQ?feature=shared)

### MCP Server Trigger

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.

MCP Server Trigger

[Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/)

### MCP Client Tool

The MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.

### Folders

What can we say about folders? Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.

**How to use it:**

Create and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.

It's a folder alright

Folders are available for all [registered](../../hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.

### Enhancements to Form Trigger Node

Recent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.

- **HTML customization:** Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.
- **Custom CSS support**: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.
- **Form previews:** Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.
- **Hidden fields:** Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.
- **New responses options:** Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.

Form with custom CSS applied

These improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.

### Schema Preview

Schema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.

- **See expected node outputs instantly.** View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.
- **Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later.** Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.
- **Avoid unwanted executions when building.** Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.

**How to use it:**

- Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.
- Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.
- Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.

[](/_video/release-notes/Schema_preview.mp4)

Don’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.

### Tidy up

Tidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows. Whether you're preparing to share a workflow or just want to improve readability, this feature saves you time and makes your logic easier to follow. Clean, well-organized workflows aren't just nicer to look at—they’re also quicker to understand.

**How to:**

Open the workflow you want to tidy, then choose one of these options:

- Click the **Tidy up** button in the bottom-left corner of the canvas (it looks like a broom 🧹)
- Press **Shift + Alt + T** on your keyboard
- Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select **Tidy up workflow**

Want to tidy up just part of your workflow? Select the specific nodes you want to clean up first - Tidy up will only adjust those, along with any stickies behind them.

[](/_video/release-notes/tidy_up.mp4)

### Multiple API keys

n8n now supports multiple API keys, allowing users to generate and manage separate keys for different workflows or integrations. This improves security by enabling easier key rotation and isolation of credentials. Future updates will introduce more granular controls.

**Release date:** 2025-02-24

This release contains bug fixes, a core update, editor improvements, and a node update.

### Improved partial executions

The new execution engine for partial executions ensures that testing parts of a workflow in the builder closely mirrors production behaviour. This makes iterating with updated run-data faster and more reliable, particularly for complex workflows.

Before, user would test parts of a workflow in the builder that didn't consistently reflect production behaviour, leading to unexpected results during development.

This update aligns workflow execution in the builder with production behavior.

Here is an example for loops:

### Improved consistency across environments

We added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances.

Previously, users faced issues like:

- Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes
- Incomplete synchronization, where changes — such as deletions — weren’t always applied across environments
- Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled

We addressed these by:

- Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes
- Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments
- Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what’s being pushed

**Release date:** 2025-01-08

This release contains new features, a new node, node updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Overhauled Code node editing experience

We added a ton of new helpers to the Code node, making edits of your code much faster and more comfortable. You get:

- TypeScript autocomplete
- TypeScript linting
- TypeScript hover tips
- Search and replace
- New keyboard shortcuts based on the VSCode keymap
- Auto-formatting using prettier (Alt+Shift+F)
- Remember folded regions and history after refresh
- Multi cursor
- Type function in the Code node using JSDoc types
- Drag and drop for all Code node modes
- Indentation markers

We build this on a web worker architecture so you won't have to suffer from performance degradation while typing.

To get the full picture, check out our Studio update with Max and Elias, where they discuss and demo the new editing experience. 👇

[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/De1E58MPaMQ?t=645)

### New node: Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) is used for cloud-based identity and access management. [The new node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftentra/) supports a wide range of Microsoft Entra ID features, which includes creating, getting, updating, and deleting users and groups, as well as adding users to and removing them from groups.

### Node updates

- [AI Agent](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Vector stores can now be directly used as tools for the agent
- [Code](../../code/builtin/overview/): Tons of new speed and convenience features, see above for details
- [Google Vertex Chat](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgooglevertex/): Added option to specify the GCP region for the Google API credentials
- [HighLevel](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.highlevel/): Added support for calendar items

We also added a custom [projects](../../user-management/rbac/projects/) icon selector on top of the available emojis. Pretty!

### Task runners for the Code node in public beta

We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.

Task runners overview

Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.

The Task runner comes in two modes:

- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes
- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.

To start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/).

### Node updates

- [AI Transform node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data
- [Code node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped

### New canvas in beta

The new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.

We're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well.

### Node updates

- We added credential support for [Zabbix](../../integrations/builtin/credentials/zabbix/) to the HTTP request node
- We added new OAuth2 credentials for [Microsoft SharePoint](../../integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)
- The [Slack node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/#operations) now uses markdown for the approval message when using the `Send and Wait for Approval` operation

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

What changed? Queue polling via the environment variable `QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL` has been removed.

When is action necessary? If you have set `QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL`, you can remove it as it no longer has any effect.

This release contains a new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

### New node: n8n Form

Use the [n8n Form node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

A multi-page form with branching

Additionally you can:

- Set default selections with query parameters
- Define the form with a JSON array of objects
- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL

### Node updates

New nodes:

- [Google Business Profile](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows

Enhanced nodes:

- [AI Agent](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool
- [GitHub](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation
- [Structured Output Parser](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages

For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.

For better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.

**Release date:** 2024-10-16

This release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates

The [Remove Duplicates node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:

- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates
- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.

### New node: Gong

The new node for [Gong](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

**Release date:** 2024-10-09

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

What changed?

- The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.
- The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.

When is action necessary?

- If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.
- If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

### Node updates

- [OpenAI](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID
- [Gmail](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and [Slack](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow

We have also optimized the [worker health checks](../../hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/) (see breaking change above).

Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.

Skipped 1.62.0

We skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.

#### Additional nodes as tools

We have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

[](/_video/release-notes/nodes-as-tools.mp4)

Additionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.

Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.

### Node updates

Breaking change

Calling `$(...).last()` (or `(...).first()` or `$(...).all()`) without arguments now returns the last item (or first or all items) of the output that connects two nodes. Previously, it returned the item/items of the first output of that node. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1470) for details.

This release contains bug fixes, feature enhancements, a new node, node enhancements and performance improvements.

For full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.

#### New node: HTTP request tool

This release adds the HTTP request tool. You can use it with an AI agent as a tool to collect information from a website or API. Refer to the [HTTP request tool](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/) for details.

Backup recommended

Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.

Credential sharing required for manual executions

Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](../../credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.

#### New feature: Projects

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.

Refer to the [RBAC](../../user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.

The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.

[](/_video/release-notes/rbac-glimpse.mp4)

#### New node: Slack Trigger

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](../../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.

### Other highlights

- Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/).

### Rolling back to a previous version

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

Self-hosted n8n:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
1. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

Cloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

Breaking change

Please note that this version contains a breaking change for instances using a Postgres database. The default value for the DB_POSTGRESDB_USER environment variable was switched from `root` to `postgres`. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1400) for details.

This release contains new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
1. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
1. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/)

#### New node: Groq Chat Model

This release adds the [Groq Chat Model node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgroq/).

- [Extract From File](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) and [XML](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

#### New node: Qdrant vector store

This release adds support for [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) with the Qdrant vector store node.

## LangChain in n8n (beta)

**Release date:** 2023-10-04

This release introduces support for building with LangChain in n8n.

With n8n's LangChain nodes you can build AI-powered functionality within your workflows. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and other components. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.

Read more:

- This is a beta release, and not yet available in the main product. Follow the instructions in [Access LangChain in n8n](../../advanced-ai/langchain/overview/) to try it out. Self-hosted and Cloud options are available.
- Learn how LangChain concepts map to n8n nodes in [LangChain concepts in n8n](../../advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-n8n/).
- Browse n8n's new [Cluster nodes](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/). This is a new set of node types that allows for multiple nodes to work together to configure each other.

#### Tournament

This releases replaces RiotTmpl, the templating language used in expressions, with n8n's own templating language, [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament). You can now use arrow functions in expressions.

#### `N8N_BINARY_DATA_TTL` and `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_TIMEOUT` removed

The environment variables `N8N_BINARY_DATA_TTL` and `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_TIMEOUT` no longer have any effect and can be removed. Instead of relying on a TTL system for binary data, n8n cleans up binary data together with executions during pruning.

# Tutorial: Create environments with source control

Feature availability

- Available on Enterprise.
- You must be an n8n instance owner or instance admin to enable and configure source control.
- Instance owners and instance admins can push changes to and pull changes from the connected repository.
- Project admins can push changes to the connected repository. They can't pull changes from the repository.

This tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:

- [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.
- [Git and n8n](../understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.

## Choose your source control pattern

Before setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

### Multiple instances, multiple branches

The advantages of this pattern are:

- An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
- It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

### Multiple instances, one branch

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

- If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](./#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
- Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

## Set up your repository

Once you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.

1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
   - Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
   - Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.
1. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for guidance.

[Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

- Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
- Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.

## Connect your n8n instances to your repository

Create two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.

### Configure Git in n8n

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
1. Choose your connection method:
   - **SSH**: In **Git repository URL**, enter the SSH URL for your repository (for example, `git@github.com:username/repo.git`).
   - **HTTPS**: In **Git repository URL** enter the HTTPS URL for your repository (for example, `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
1. Configure authentication based on your connection method:
   - **For SSH**: n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA. Copy the SSH key.
   - **For HTTPS**: Enter your credentials:
     - **Username**: Your Git provider username.
     - **Token**: Your Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Git provider.

### Set up a deploy key

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys) for guidance.

### Connect n8n and configure your instance

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.

1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.

1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.

1. Select **Save settings**.

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**.

1. Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.

1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.

1. Select **Save settings**.

## Push work from development

In your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.

To push work to Git:

1. Select **Push** in the main menu.

   View screenshot

   Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

   Pull and push buttons when menu is open

1. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n pushes the current saved version, not the published version, of the workflow. You need to then separately publish versions on the remote server.

1. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.
1. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## Pull work to production

Your work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.

1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.
1. Merge the pull request.
1. In your production instance, select **Pull** in the main menu.

In your production instance, select **Pull** in the main menu.

View screenshot

### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls

If you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and the [n8n API](../../api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.

A GitHub Action example:

```
name: CI
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "production" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  run-pull:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PULL
				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information
        run: >
          curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header
          'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'
```

- [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/) and [Git and n8n](../understand/git/)
- [Source control patterns](../understand/patterns/)

# Set up source control for environments

Link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

n8n uses source control to provide environments. Refer to [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/) for more information.

## Prerequisites

To use source control with n8n, you need a Git repository with either:

- SSH access (using deploy keys), or
- HTTPS access (using Personal Access Tokens)

This document assumes you are familiar with Git and your Git provider.

## Step 1: Set up your repository and branches

For a new setup:

1. Create a new repository for use with n8n.
1. Create the branches you need. For example, if you plan to have different environments for test and production, set up a branch for each.

To help decide what branches you need for your use case, refer to [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/).

## Step 2: Configure Git in n8n

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
1. Choose your connection method:
   - **SSH**: In **Git repository URL**, enter the SSH URL for your repository (for example, `git@github.com:username/repo.git`).
   - **HTTPS**: In **Git repository URL** enter the HTTPS URL for your repository (for example, `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
1. Configure authentication based on your connection method:
   - **For SSH**: n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA. Copy the SSH key.
   - **For HTTPS**: Enter your credentials:
     - **Username**: Your Git provider username.
     - **Token**: Your Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Git provider.

## Step 3: Set up authentication

Configure authentication based on your chosen connection method.

### SSH authentication (using deploy keys)

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access.

The steps depend on your Git provider. Help links for common providers:

- [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)
- [GitLab | Deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)

### HTTPS authentication (using Personal Access Tokens)

Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with repository access permissions.

Help links for creating PATs with common providers:

- [GitHub | Managing personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
- [GitLab | Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
- [Bitbucket | App passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/)

Required permissions for your token:

- Repository read/write access
- Contents read/write (for GitHub)
- Source code pull/push (for GitLab)

## Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance.
1. **Optional**: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. This is useful for protecting production instances.
1. **Optional**: choose a custom color for the instance. This will appear in the menu next to the source control push and pull buttons. It helps users know which instance they're in.
1. Select **Save settings**.

# Environments in n8n

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. This document helps you understand:

- The purpose of environments.
- How environments work in n8n.

## Environments: What and why

In software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments).

Low-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.

There are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:

- Development: do work and make changes.
- Production: the live environment.

A setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.

## Environments in n8n

In n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:

- The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.
- The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](../../using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed).

How you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:

- Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.
- Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](../../using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.

For detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](../../using/push-pull/).

Refer to [Set up source control](../../setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](../../create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations.

# Git and n8n

n8n uses Git to provide source control. To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.

New to Git and source control?

If you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.

Familiar with Git and source control?

If you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.

This page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](../../setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.

This is a brief introduction

Git is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources).

## Git overview

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## Branches: Multiple copies of a project

Git uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.

## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider

A common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.

n8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.

## Push, pull, and commit

n8n uses three key Git processes:

- **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.

- **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items.

  Pulling overwrites your work

  If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.

- **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.

Refer to [Push and pull](../../using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git.

# Branch patterns

The relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Multiple instances, multiple branches

This pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.

The advantages of this pattern are:

- An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
- It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

## Multiple instances, one branch

Use this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.

This pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

- If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](../../create-environments/#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
- Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

## One instance, multiple branches

The instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.

This is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.

No cleanup

n8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.

## One instance, one branch

This is the simplest pattern.

# Using source control and environments

Feature availability

- Available on Enterprise.

- You must be an n8n instance owner or instance admin to enable and configure source control.

- Instance owners and instance admins can push changes to and pull changes from the connected repository.

- Project admins can push changes to the connected repository. They can't pull changes from the repository.

- [Push and pull](push-pull/): Send work to Git, and fetch work from Git to your instance. Understand what gets committed, and how n8n handles merge conflicts.

- [Copy work between environments](copy-work/): How to copy work between different n8n instances.

# Compare changes with workflow diffs

Workflow diffs allow you to visually compare changes between the workflow you have on an instance and the most recent version saved in your connected Git repository. This helps you understand the exact changes to the workflow before you decide to either push or pull it across different environments.

Feature availability

- Available on Enterprise
- Workflow diffs are only available when you [enable the environments features](../../setup/) on an instance

## Accessing workflow diffs

You can access workflow diffs from two locations:

1. **When pushing changes**: Click the workflow diff icon in the commit modal alongside the workflow you want to review
1. **When pulling changes**: Click the workflow diff icon in the modified changes modal alongside the workflow you want to review

## Understanding the workflow diff view

When you open a workflow diff, n8n displays two workflows stacked vertically:

### When pushing

- **Top panel** (Remote branch): Latest version in your Git repository
- **Bottom panel** (Local): Current locally saved version of the workflow

### When pulling

- **Top panel** (Local): Current version on your n8n instance
- **Bottom panel** (Remote branch): Version you're pulling from the Git repository

In both cases, the top panel always displays the workflow that will update with changes.

The diff view highlights three types of changes:

- **Added nodes and connectors**: New node additions or connectors will show as green along with an "N" icon
- **Modified nodes and connectors**: Modifications to existing nodes or connectors will show as orange along with a "M" icon
- **Deleted nodes and connectors**: Node or connector deletions will show as red along with a "D" icon

## Reviewing node changes

For modified nodes, you can also compare the specific changes. Click modified nodes to show a JSON diff of the changes. You can review the exact configuration for that node before and after the given change.

## Viewing the summary of changes

In the top-right corner, the **changes** button shows the number of changes. This represents the total number of changes across node and node connectors, as well as general workflow settings updates.

## Navigating through each change

You can use the **next** and **previous** arrows in the upper-right corner to cycle through your changes in a logical order. Use the **back** button in the top-left corner to return to the commit or pull modal to select a different workflow to review changes on.

## Who can use workflow diffs

Only users who can push or pull commits for an instance can access workflow diffs:

- instance owners
- instance admins
- project admins

# Copy work between environments

The steps to send work from one n8n instance to another are different depending on whether you use a single Git branch or multiple branches.

## Single branch

If you have a single Git branch the steps to copy work are:

1. Push work from one instance to the Git branch.
1. Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Multiple branches

If you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n.

A common pattern is:

1. Do work in your developments instance.
1. Push the work to the development branch in Git.
1. Merge your development branch into your production branch. Refer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:
   - [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   - [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
   - [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
1. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Automatically send changes to n8n

You can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:

```
curl --request POST \
	--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
	--data '{"force": true}'
```

This means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.

A GitHub Action example:

```
name: CI
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "production" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  run-pull:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PULL
				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information
        run: >
          curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header
          'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'
```

# Push and pull

If your n8n instance connects to a Git repository, you need to keep your work in sync with Git.

This document assumes some familiarity with Git concepts and terminology. Refer to [Git and n8n](../../understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Fetch other people's work

n8n roles control which users can pull (fetch) changes

You must be an instance owner or instance admin to pull changes from git.

To pull work from Git, select **Pull** in the main menu.

View screenshot

Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

Pull and push buttons when menu is open

n8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.

When the changes include new variable or credential stubs, n8n notifies you that you need to populate the values for the items before using them.

How deleted resources are handled

When workflows, credentials, variables, and tags are deleted from the repository, your local versions of these resources aren't deleted automatically. Instead, when you pull repository changes, n8n notifies you about any outdated resources and asks if you'd like to delete them.

### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull

When you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.

If the original owner is a user:

If the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.

If the original owner is a [project](../../../user-management/rbac/):

n8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.

### Pulling may cause brief service interruption

If you pull changes to a published workflow, n8n unpublishes the workflow while pulling, then republishes it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.

## Send your work to Git

n8n roles control which users can push changes

You must be an instance owner, instance admin, or project admin to push changes to git.

To push work to Git:

1. Select **Push** in the main menu.

   View screenshot

   Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

   Pull and push buttons when menu is open

1. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n pushes the current saved version, not the published version, of the workflow. You need to then separately publish versions on the remote server.

1. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.
1. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## What gets committed

n8n commits the following to Git:

- Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.
- Credential stubs - ID, name and type. Any other fields are included only if they are [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/). You can choose which credentials to push.
- Variable stubs (ID and name)
- Projects
- Folders

## Merge behaviors and conflicts

n8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.

### Workflows

You have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.

When pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.

When you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.

To prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.

To avoid losing data:

- Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.
- Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.
- Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.

### Credentials, variables and workflow tags

Credentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.

On pull:

- If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.
- If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:
  - You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.
  - The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.
  - The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.

On push:

- n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.
- If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.

Manage credentials with an external secrets vault

If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [external secrets](../../../external-secrets/).

# Try it out

The best way to learn n8n is by using our tutorials to get familiar with the user interface and the many different types of nodes and integrations available. Here is a selection of material to get you started:

- Looking for a quick introduction? Check out the ["First Workflow" tutorial](tutorial-first-workflow/).
- Interested in what you could do with AI? Find out [how to build an AI chat agent with n8n](../advanced-ai/intro-tutorial/).
- Prefer to work through extensive examples? Maybe the [courses](../courses/) are for you.

# The very quick quickstart

This quickstart gets you started using n8n as quickly as possible. Its allows you to try out the UI and introduces two key features: [workflow templates](../../glossary/#template-n8n) and [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n). It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts in-depth.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Load a [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) from the workflow templates library
- Add a node and configure it using expressions
- Run your first workflow

## Step one: Open a workflow template and sign up for n8n Cloud

n8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. You can use this to work with fake data and avoid setting up [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n).

This quickstart uses [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/). A free trial is available for new users.

1. Go to [Templates | Very quick quickstart](https://n8n.io/workflows/1700-very-quick-quickstart/).
1. Select **Use for free** to view the options for using the template.
1. Select **Get started free with n8n cloud** to sign up for a new Cloud instance.

This workflow:

1. Gets example data from the [Customer Datastore](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrainingcustomerdatastore/) node.
1. Uses the [Edit Fields](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to extract only the desired data and assigns that data to variables. In this example, you map the customer name, ID, and description.

The individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called [nodes](../../glossary/#node-n8n). Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.

## Step two: Run the workflow

Select **Execute Workflow**. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.

## Step three: Add a node

Add a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the Edit Fields node.
1. Search for **Customer Messenger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Customer Messenger (n8n training)** to add the node to the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n). n8n opens the node automatically.
1. Use [expressions](../../code/expressions/) to map in the **Customer ID** and create the **Message**:
   1. In the **INPUT** panel select the **Schema** tab.

   1. Drag **Edit Fields1** > **customer_id** into the **Customer ID** field in the node settings.

   1. Hover over **Message**. Select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor.

   1. Copy this expression into the editor:

      ```
      Hi {{ $json.customer_name }}. Your description is: {{ $json.customer_description }}
      ```
1. Close the expressions editor, then close the **Customer Messenger** node by clicking outside the node or selecting **Back to canvas**.
1. Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow.

The complete workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows/try-it-out/quickstart/very-quick-quickstart-workflow.json)

## Next steps

- Read n8n's [longer try it out tutorial](../tutorial-first-workflow/) for a more complex workflow, and an introduction to more features and n8n concepts.
- Take the [text courses](../../courses/) or [video courses](../../video-courses/).

# Your first workflow

This guide will show you how to construct a [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:

- Create a workflow from scratch.
- Understand key concepts and skills, including:
  - Starting workflows with trigger nodes
  - Configuring [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n)
  - Processing data
  - Representing logic in an n8n workflow
  - Using [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n)

This quickstart uses [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/), which is recommended for new users. A free trial is available - if you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://app.n8n.cloud/register) for an account now.

## Step one: Create a new workflow

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

- A window with a welcome message and two large buttons: Choose **Start from Scratch** to create a new workflow.
- The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the **Create Workflow** to create a new workflow.

## Step two: Add a trigger node

n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:

- Manually, by selecting **Execute Workflow**.
- Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.

For this tutorial, we'll use the [Schedule trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:

1. Select **Add first step**.
1. Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. For **Trigger Interval**, select **Weeks**.
1. For **Weeks Between Triggers**, enter `1`.
1. Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays**, select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour**, and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.
1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.

## Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials

The [NASA node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) interacts with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.

Credentials

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the Schedule Trigger node.

1. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

1. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.

1. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.

1. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:

   1. Select the **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.
   1. Select **Create new credential**. n8n opens the credentials view.
   1. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and fill out the form from the **Generate API Key** link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.
   1. Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.
   1. Select **Save**.
   1. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.

1. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:

   1. Select **Add field**.

   1. Select **Start date**.

   1. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor.

   1. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:

      ```
      {{ $today.minus(7, 'days') }}
      ```

      This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date. Date and time formats in n8n...

   n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](../../code/cookbook/luxon/).

1. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.

1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.

1. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.

## Step four: Add logic with the If node

n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the [If node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.

Add the If node:

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the NASA node.

1. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

1. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.

1. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:

   1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.

      Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section

      If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.

   1. Change the comparison operation to **String > Contains**.

   1. In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.

   1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.

   Weeks without large solar flares

   In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**.

1. Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.

## Step five: Output data from your workflow

The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/). Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.

1. On the If node, select the **Add node** connector labeled **true**.

1. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

1. Select **PostBin**.

1. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.

1. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/) and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.

1. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.

1. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.

1. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab (you will need to mouse-over the **Bin Content** for the tab to appear), then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor.

1. You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.

1. Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: `{{$json["classType"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:

   ```
   There was a solar flare of class {{$json["classType"]}}
   ```

1. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.

1. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.

1. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:

   1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.
   1. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.

## Step six: Test the workflow

1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
1. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
1. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to publish it by clicking **Publish**.

Time limit

Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.

## Congratulations

You now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this:

# User management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

- Login and password management
- Adding and removing users
- Three [account types](account-types/): **Owner** and **Member** (and **Admin** for Pro & Enterprise plans)

Privacy

The user management feature doesn't send personal information, such as email or username, to n8n.

## Setup guides

This section contains most usage information for user management, and the [Cloud setup guide](cloud-setup/). If you self-host n8n, there are extra steps to configure your n8n instance. Refer to the [Self-hosted guide](../hosting/configuration/user-management-self-hosted/).

This section includes guides to configuring [LDAP](ldap/) and [SAML](saml/) in n8n.

# Account types

There are three account types: owner, admin, and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.

Feature availability

To use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.

Account types and role types

Account types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](../rbac/).

Every account has one type. The account can have different [role types](../rbac/role-types/) for different [projects](../rbac/projects/).

Create a member-level account for the owner

n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

| Permission                                                          | Owner | Admin | Member |

# Best practices for user management

This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.

## All platforms

- n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
- Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
- To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
- Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
  - The path works for the first workflow that's run or published.
  - Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

## Self-hosted

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:

- `N8N_HOST`
- `N8N_PORT`
- `N8N_PROTOCOL`
- `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`

More information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

# Set up user management on n8n Cloud

To access user management, upgrade to version 0.195.0 or newer.

Irreversible upgrade

Once you upgrade your Cloud instance to an n8n version with user management, you can't downgrade your version.

## Step one: In-app setup

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
1. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
1. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.

## Step two: Invite users

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.

1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)
1. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
1. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
1. Click **Invite**.
1. Enter the new user's email address.
1. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

Feature availability

- Available on Self-hosted Business and Enterprise, and Cloud Enterprise plans.
- You need access to the n8n instance owner account.

This page tells you how to enable LDAP in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with LDAP, and have an existing LDAP server set up.

LDAP allows users to sign in to n8n with their organization credentials, instead of an n8n login.

## Enable LDAP

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
1. Select **Settings** > **LDAP**.
1. Toggle on **Enable LDAP Login**.
1. Complete the fields with details from your LDAP server.
1. Select **Test connection** to check your connection setup, or **Save connection** to create the connection.

After enabling LDAP, anyone on your LDAP server can sign in to the n8n instance, unless you exclude them using the **User Filter** setting.

You can still create non-LDAP users (email users) on the **Settings** > **Users** page.

## Merging n8n and LDAP accounts

If n8n finds matching accounts (matching emails) for email users and LDAP users, the user must sign in with their LDAP account. n8n instance owner accounts are excluded from this: n8n never converts owner accounts to LDAP users.

## LDAP user accounts in n8n

On first sign in, n8n creates a user account in n8n for the LDAP user.

You must manage user details on the LDAP server, not in n8n. If you update or delete a user on your LDAP server, the n8n account updates at the next scheduled sync, or when the user next tries to log in, whichever happens first.

User deletion

If you remove a user from your LDAP server, they lose n8n access on the next sync.

## Turn LDAP off

To turn LDAP off:

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
1. Select **Settings** > **LDAP**.
1. Toggle off **Enable LDAP Login**.

If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password.

# Manage users

The **Settings** > **Users** page shows all users, including ones with pending invitations.

## Delete a user

1. Open the **three-dot menu** for the user you want to delete and select **Delete user**.
1. Confirm you want to delete them.
1. If they're an active user, choose whether to copy their workflow data and credentials to a new user, or permanently delete their workflows and credentials.

## Resend an invitation to a pending user

Click the menu icon by the user, then click **Resend invite**.

# Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.

## Enable 2FA

You need an authenticator app on your phone.

To enable 2FA in n8n:

1. Go to you **Settings** > **Personal**.
1. Select **Enable 2FA**. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
1. Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
1. Enter the code from your app in **Code from authenticator app**.
1. Select **Continue**. n8n displays recovery codes.
1. Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.

## Disable 2FA for your instance

Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting `N8N_MFA_ENABLED` to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to [Configuration methods](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.

# OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Feature availability

- Available on Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure OIDC.

This section covers how to enable and manage OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single sign-on (SSO). You can learn more about how OIDC works by visiting [what is OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) by the OpenID Foundation.

- [Set up OIDC](setup/): a general guide to setting up OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO in n8n.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/): a list of things to check if you encounter issues with OIDC.

# Set up OIDC

Feature availability

- Available on Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure OIDC.

## Setting up and enabling OIDC

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **SSO**.

1. Under **Select Authentication Protocol**, choose **OIDC** from the dropdown.

1. Copy the **redirect URL** shown (for example, `https://yourworkspace.app.n8n.cloud/rest/sso/oidc/callback`).

   Extra configuration for load balancers or proxies

   If you are running n8n behind a load balancer, make sure you set the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` environment variable](../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/).

1. Set up OIDC with your identity provider (IdP). You'll need to:

   - Create a new OIDC client/application in your IdP.
   - Configure the redirect URL from the previous step.
   - Note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** provided by your IdP.

1. In your IdP, locate the **Discovery Endpoint** (also called the well-known configuration endpoint). It typically has the following format:

   ```
   https://your-idp-domain/.well-known/openid-configuration
   ```

1. In n8n, complete the OIDC configuration:

   - **Discovery Endpoint**: Enter the discovery endpoint URL from your IdP.
   - **Client ID**: Enter the client ID you received when registering your application with your IdP.
   - **Client Secret**: Enter the client secret you received when registering your application with your IdP.

1. Select **Save settings**.

1. Set OIDC to **Activated**.

### Instance and project access provisioning

From version `1.122.2` upwards, n8n supports provisioning the instance role and project roles from your IdP.

You need to add a an additional scope called `n8n` to your OIDC authorization server.

On this `n8n` scope, you need to add these two claims:

| **Name**          | **Data type** | **Scope** | **Token type** |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| n8n_instance_role | string        | n8n       | ID             |
| n8n_projects      | string array  | n8n       | ID             |

These two need to always be included in the "ID Token" from your authorization server.

Ensure that these two attributes are configured in the user groups of your identity provider that have access to n8n.

Inside the form on the **Settings** > **SSO** page in n8n, you will find a dropdown labeled "User role provisioning" in the form.

By default this is set to "Manged in n8n".

You can choose to set it to:

- Instance role
  - Only the instance role of each provisioned user will be read from the `n8n_instance_role` attribute from the SAML response. Project access will still be managed inside n8n only.
  - If there is no value for `n8n_instance_role` configured on your IdP, the `global:member` role is used as fallback.
- Instance and project roles
  - Both the instance role and project access of each provisioned user will be read from the `n8n_instance_role` and `n8n_projects` attributes from the SAML response.

Existing access will be overwritten

Once you enable "User role provisioning", the next time any user logs in using SAML, any access they've been granted inside n8n, which isn't reflected in the n8n_instance_role and n8n_projects will be removed from that user.

When activating this feature, you are required to download two CSV files before you can save this change. These files contain all your current access settings should you need to reference them.

**Configuring n8n_instance_role attribute**

The n8n_instance_role attribute is a simple string configured for a group or user on your IdP.

Supported instance roles are:

- global:member
- global:admin

**Configuring n8n_projects attribute**

The n8n_projects attribute is a string array configured for a group or user on your IdP.

Each element in this array needs to follow this format: :

For example:

- bHsykgeFirmIhezz:viewer
- 4K3zrg3DvlMFFTB7:editor
- dCjnYuEpYOUBVaNe:admin

For existing access settings at the time of enabling project access provisioning using your IdP, you can find the project IDs in the downloaded CSV file.

When creating a project from scratch, get the project ID from the URL when viewing the project in your browser:

In the URL `<your-domain>/projects/VVRWZaq5DRxaf9O1/workflows` for example, the project ID is `VVRWZaq5DRxaf9O1`.

## Provider-specific OIDC setup

### Okta

The steps to setup OIDC in Okta are similar as with Auth0 described below.

For Okta, you can download a visual step-by-step guide as PDF:

[n8n-oidc-with-okta.pdf](../n8n-oidc-with-okta.pdf)

### Auth0

1. **Create an application in Auth0**:
   - Log in to your Auth0 Dashboard.
   - Go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
   - Click **Create Application**.
   - Enter a name (for example, "n8n SSO") and select **Regular Web Applications**.
   - Click **Create**.
1. **Configure the application**:
   - Go to the **Settings** tab of your new application.
   - **Allowed Callback URLs**: Add your n8n redirect URL from **Settings** > **SSO** > **OIDC**.
   - **Allowed Web Origins**: Add your n8n base URL (for example, `https://yourworkspace.app.n8n.cloud`).
   - Click **Save Changes**.
1. **Get your credentials**:
   - **Client ID**: Found in the **Settings** tab.
   - **Client Secret**: Found in the **Settings** tab.
   - **Discovery Endpoint**: `https://{your-auth0-domain}.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
1. **In n8n, complete the OIDC configuration:**
   - **Discovery Endpoint**: Enter the discovery endpoint URL from Auth0.
   - **Client ID**: Enter the client ID you found in your Auth0 settings.
   - **Client Secret**: Enter the client secret you found in your Auth0 settings.
1. Select **Save settings**.
1. Set OIDC to **Activated**.

## Discovery endpoints reference

# Troubleshooting OIDC SSO

## Known issues

### State parameter not supported

When using OIDC providers that enforce the use of the `state` CSRF token parameter, authentication fails with the error:

```
{"code":0,"message":"authorization response from the server is an error"}
```

n8n's current OIDC implementation doesn't handle the `state` parameter that some OIDC providers send as a security measure against CSRF attacks.

For now, the only work around is to configure your OIDC provider to disable the `state` parameter if possible.

n8n is working on adding full support for the OIDC `state` parameter in a future release.

### PKCE not supported

OIDC providers that require PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) may fail authentication or reject n8n's authorization requests. n8n's current OIDC implementation doesn't support PKCE.

The only work around is to configure your OIDC provider to not require PKCE for the n8n client if this option is available in your providers settings.

n8n plans on adding PKCE support in a future release

# Role-based access control (RBAC)

Feature availability

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](projects/).

RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.

- [Role types](/user-management/rbac/role-types/)
- [Projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/)
- [Custom roles](/user-management/rbac/custom-roles/)

# Custom project roles

Feature availability

Custom roles are available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

**Available from:** n8n version 1.122.0 (released November 24, 2025)

Instance roles vs project roles

n8n has two types of roles: * **Instance roles** ([account types](../../account-types/)): Owner, Admin, and Member roles that span the entire n8n instance and all projects * **Project roles**: Roles that apply within a specific project (Admin, Editor, Viewer, and custom roles)

Custom roles are project-level roles. They define permissions within individual projects, not across the entire instance.

Custom project roles allow you to create roles with specific permissions tailored to your team's needs. Unlike the built-in project roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), custom roles let you define granular access to workflows, credentials, and other project resources.

## Create a custom role

Instance owners and instance admins can create custom roles.

To create a custom role:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Project roles**.
1. Select **Create role**.
1. Enter a role name and optional description.
1. Select the permissions (scopes) for this role:
   - **Workflow permissions**: Create, read, update, publish, delete, list, execute, move, or share workflows
   - **Credential permissions**: Create, read, update, delete, list, move, or share credentials
   - **Project permissions**: List, read, update, or delete projects
   - **Folder permissions**: Create, read, update, delete, list, or move folders
   - **Data table permissions**: Create, read, update, delete, list project tables, read/write rows
   - **Project variable permissions**: Create, read, update, delete, or list project variables
   - **Source control**: Push to source control
1. Select **Create role**.

## Assign a custom role to users

Project admins can assign custom roles to project members. Custom roles apply only within the specific project where they're assigned. A user can have different roles in different projects.

To assign a custom role:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Under **Project members**, browse or search for users.
1. Select the user and choose the custom role from the dropdown.
1. Select **Save**.

Project-level permissions

Custom role permissions only apply within the project where the role is assigned. To grant the same permissions across multiple projects, assign the custom role in each project individually.

## Edit a custom role

To modify an existing custom role:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Project roles**.
1. Find the custom role you want to edit.
1. Select the **three-dot menu** > **Edit**.
1. Update the role name, description, or permissions.
1. Select **Save changes**.

Editing affects all assigned users

Changes to a custom role immediately affect all users assigned to that role in any project. If the role is used across multiple projects, the permission changes apply everywhere the role is assigned.

## Duplicate a custom role

To create a new role based on an existing one:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Project roles**.
1. Find the role you want to duplicate.
1. Select the **three-dot menu** > **Duplicate**.
1. Modify the role name and permissions as needed.
1. Select **Create role**.

## Delete a custom role

To delete a custom role:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Project roles**.
1. Find the role you want to delete.
1. Select the **three-dot menu** > **Delete**.
1. Confirm the deletion.

Reassign users before deletion

If users are assigned to this role, you must first reassign them to a different role before deleting it.

## Permission scopes reference

Custom roles use permission scopes to define what users can do within a project. Here are the available scopes by resource:

### Workflow scopes

- `workflow:create` - Create new workflows
- `workflow:read` - View workflow details
- `workflow:update` - Edit workflows
- `workflow:publish` - Publish and unpublish workflows
- `workflow:delete` - Delete workflows
- `workflow:list` - View workflows in project

- `credential:read` - View credential details
- `credential:update` - Edit credentials
- `credential:delete` - Delete credentials
- `credential:list` - View credentials in project
- `credential:move` - Move credentials between projects
- `credential:share` - Share credentials with other users

### Project scopes

- `project:list` - View available projects

- `projectVariable:read` - View variable values
- `projectVariable:create` - Create new variables
- `projectVariable:update` - Edit variable values
- `projectVariable:delete` - Delete variables

### Source control scopes

- `sourceControl:push` - Push changes to source control

## Common custom role examples

These are example custom project roles you can create for common use cases. Remember that these roles apply within individual projects, not across your entire n8n instance.

### Workflow Developer

A role for users who work only with workflows: * `workflow:create`, `workflow:read`, `workflow:update`, `workflow:delete`, `workflow:list`, `workflow:execute` * `credential:read`, `credential:list` (view credentials but not modify) * `project:list`, `project:read`

### Credential Manager

A role for users who manage credentials: * `credential:create`, `credential:read`, `credential:update`, `credential:delete`, `credential:list`, `credential:share` * `workflow:read`, `workflow:list` (view workflows to understand credential usage) * `project:list`, `project:read`

### Workflow Publisher

A role for users who can publish workflows without full edit access: * `workflow:read`, `workflow:list`, `workflow:publish` * `credential:read`, `credential:list` * `project:list`, `project:read`

### Read-Only with Execute

A role for users who can view and run workflows but not modify them: * `workflow:read`, `workflow:list`, `workflow:execute` * `credential:read`, `credential:list` * `project:list`, `project:read`

Combining scopes

You can combine any scopes to create roles that match your specific needs. Consider the principle of least privilege: grant only the permissions users need to perform their tasks.

Feature availability

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

n8n uses projects to group workflows and [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), and assigns [roles](../role-types/) to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access.

## Create a project

Instance owners and instance admins can create projects.

To create a project:

1. Select **Add project**.
1. Fill out the project settings.
1. Select **Save**.

## Add and remove users in a project

Project admins can add and remove users.

To add a user to a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Under **Project members**, browse for users or search by username or email address.
1. Select the user you want to add.
1. Check the [role type](../role-types/) and change it if needed.
1. Select **Save**.

To remove a user from a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. In the **three-dot menu** for the user you want to remove, select **Remove user**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Delete a project

To delete a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Delete project**.
1. Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
   - **Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project**: n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
   - **Delete its workflows and credentials**: n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.

## Move workflows and credentials between projects or users

Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.

Moving revokes sharing

Moving workflows or credentials removes all existing sharing. Be aware that this could impact other workflows currently sharing these resources.

1. Select **Workflow menu** or **Credential menu** > **Move**.

   Moving workflows with credentials

   When moving a workflow with credentials you have permission to share, you can choose to share the credentials as well. This ensures that the workflow continues to have access to the credentials it needs to execute. n8n will note any credentials that can't be moved (credentials you don't have permission to share).

1. Select the project or user you want to move to.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.

1. Select **Confirm move to new project**.

## Using external secrets in projects

To use [external secrets](../../../external-secrets/) in a project, you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](../../account-types/) as a member of the project.

# RBAC role types

Feature availability

- The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
- The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.

Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.

## Project Admin

A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:

- Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
- Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
- View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

## Project Editor

A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

## Project Viewer

A Project Viewer is effectively a `read-only` role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.

Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](../projects/).

| Permission                      | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| View workflows in the project   |       |        |        |
| View credentials in the project |       |        |        |
| View executions                 |       |        |        |
| Edit credentials and workflows  |       |        |        |
| Add workflows and credentials   |       |        |        |
| Execute workflows               |       |        |        |
| Manage members                  |       |        |        |
| Modify the project              |       |        |        |

[Variables](../../../code/variables/) and [tags](../../../workflows/tags/) aren't affected by RBAC: they're global across the n8n instance.

# Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

Feature availability

- Available on Business and Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure SAML.

This section tells you how to enable SAML SSO (single sign-on) in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with SAML. If you're not, [SAML Explained in Plain English](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml) can help you understand how SAML works, and its benefits.

- [Set up SAML](setup/): a general guide to setting up SAML in n8n, and links to resources for common IdPs.
- [Okta Workforce Identity SAML setup](okta/): step-by-step guidance to configuring Okta.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/): a list of things to check if you encounter issues.
- [Managing users with SAML](managing/): performing user management tasks with SAML enabled.

# Manage users with SAML

Feature availability

- Available on Business and Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure SAML.

There are some user management tasks that are affected by SAML.

## Exempt users from SAML

You can allow users to log in without using SAML. To do this:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Users**.
1. Select the menu icon by the user you want to exempt from SAML.
1. Select **Allow Manual Login**.

## Deleting users

If you remove a user from your IdP, they remain logged in to n8n. You need to manually remove them from n8n as well. Refer to [Manage users](../../manage-users/) for guidance on deleting users.

# Okta Workforce Identity SAML setup

Set up SAML SSO in n8n with Okta.

Workforce Identity and Customer Identity

This guide covers setting up Workforce Identity. This is the original Okta product. Customer Identity is Okta's name for Auth0, which they've acquired.

## Prerequisites

You need an Okta Workforce Identity account, and the redirect URL and entity ID from n8n's SAML settings.

Okta Workforce may enforce two factor authentication for users, depending on your Okta configuration.

Read the [Set up SAML](../setup/) guide first.

## Setup

In addition to the following instructions, [this PDF](../n8n-saml-with-okta.pdf) provides visual step-by-step guide on how to setup SAML in n8n with Okta.

1. In your Okta admin panel, select **Applications** > **Applications**.

1. Select **Create App Integration**. Okta opens the app creation modal.

1. Select **SAML 2.0**, then select **Next**.

1. On the **General Settings** tab, enter `n8n` as the **App name**.

1. Select **Next** .

1. On the **Configure SAML** tab, complete the following **General** fields:

   - **Single sign-on URL**: the **Redirect URL** from n8n.
   - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: the **Entity ID** from n8n.
   - **Default RelayState**: leave this empty.
   - **Name ID format**: `EmailAddress`.
   - **Application username**: `Okta username`.
   - **Update application username on**: `Create and update`.

1. Create **Attribute Statements**:

   | **Name**                                                             | **Name format** | **Value**      |
   | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
   | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/firstname`    | URI Reference   | user.firstName |
   | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/lastname`     | URI Reference   | user.lastName  |
   | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn`          | URI Reference   | user.login     |
   | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` | URI Reference   | user.email     |

1. Select **Next**. Okta may prompt you to complete a marketing form, or may take you directly to your new n8n Okta app.

1. Assign the n8n app to people:

   1. On the n8n app dashboard in Okta, select **Assignments**.
   1. Select **Assign** > **Assign to People**. Okta displays a modal with a list of available people.
   1. Select **Assign** next to the person you want to add. Okta displays a prompt to confirm the username.
   1. Leave the username as email address. Select **Save and Go Back**.
   1. Select **Done**.

1. Get the metadata XML: on the **Sign On** tab, copy the Metadata URL. Navigate to it, and copy the XML. Paste this into **Identity Provider Settings** in n8n.

1. Select **Save settings**.

1. Select **Test settings**. n8n opens a new tab. If you're not currently logged in, Okta prompts you to sign in. n8n then displays a success message confirming the attributes returned by Okta.

### Instance and project access provisioning

See the [Set up SAML page](../setup/#instance-and-project-access-provisioning) for additional information of this feature.

**Adding the required attributes**

1. In your Okta admin panel, select **Applications** > **Applications**.

1. Go to the configuration of your n8n application

1. On the **General** tab, click **Edit** next to **SAML Settings**

1. In the page that opens, continue to step 2: **Configure SAML**

1. Add the following two **Attribute Statements**:

   | **Name**          | **Name format** | **Value**                 |
   | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
   | n8n_instance_role | Basic           | appuser.n8n_instance_role |
   | n8n_projects      | Basic           | appuser.n8n_projects      |

1. Click **Next**

1. Click **Finish**

**Updating the app profile**

1. In your Okta admin panel, select **Directory** > **Profile Editor**.
1. Go to the profile of your n8n application
1. Click **Add Attribute**
1. Add the **n8n_instance_role** attribute
   - **Data type**: string
   - **Display name**: n8n_instance_role
   - **Variable name**: n8n_instance_role
   - **Attribute type**: Group
1. Add the **n8n_projects** attribute
   - **Data type**: string array
   - **Display name**: n8n_projects
   - **Variable name**: n8n_projects
   - **Attribute type**: Group
   - **Group priority**: Combine values across groups

Now when you go to **Directory** > **Groups** and edit the assigned n8n application, you can configure the **n8n_instance_role** and **n8n_projects** to be sent to n8n upon logging in via SAML.

# Set up SAML

Feature availability

- Available on Business and Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure SAML.

## Enable SAML

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **SSO**.
1. Make a note of the n8n **Redirect URL** and **Entity ID**.
   - **Optional**: If your IdP allows you to set up SAML from imported metadata, navigate to the **Entity ID** URL and save the XML.
   - **Optional**: If you are running n8n behind a load balancer make sure you have `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` configured.
1. Set up SAML with your identity provider (IdP). You need the **Redirect URL** and **Entity ID**. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.
1. After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:
   - **Metadata URL**: Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the **Identity Provider Settings** field in n8n.
   - **Raw XML**: Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle **Identiy Provider Settings** to **XML**, and then copy the raw XML into **Identity Provider Settings**.
1. Select **Save settings**.
1. Select **Test settings** to check your SAML setup is working.
1. Set SAML 2.0 to **Activated**.

SAML Request Type

n8n doesn't support `POST` binding. Configure your IdP to use `HTTP` request binding instead.

## Generic IdP setup

The steps to configure the IdP vary depending on your chosen IdP. These are some common setup tasks:

- Create an app for n8n in your IdP.
- Map n8n attributes to IdP attributes:

| Value (IdP side) | Name format   | Name                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User email       | URI Reference | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` |
| User First Name  | URI Reference | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/firstname`    |
| User Last Name   | URI Reference | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/lastname`     |
| User Email       | URI Reference | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn`          |

### Instance and project access provisioning

From version `1.122.2` upwards, n8n supports provisioning the instance role and project roles from your IdP.

You need to configure these attributes on the groups or individual users in your IdP:

| Value (IdP side)    | Data type | Name                |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| `n8n_instance_role` | string    | `n8n_instance_role` |
| `n8n_projects`      | array     | `n8n_projects`      |

On the form on the **Settings** > **SSO** page, located the dropdown labeled **User role provisioning**. n8n sets the default value of this dropdown to **Managed in n8n**.

You can choose to set it to one of these values:

- **Instance role**
  - Only the instance role of each provisioned user is read from the `n8n_instance_role` attribute from the SAML response. Project access is still managed inside n8n only.
  - If there is no value for `n8n_instance_role` configured on your IdP, the `global:member` role is used as fallback.
- **Instance and project roles**
  - Both the instance role and project access of each provisioned user are read from the `n8n_instance_role` and `n8n_projects` attributes from the SAML response.

Existing access will be overwritten

Once you enable "User role provisioning", the next time any user logs in via SAML, any access they've been granted inside n8n, which isn't reflected in the n8n_instance_role and n8n_projects will be removed from that user.

When activating this feature, you are required to download two CSV files before you can save this change. These files contain all your current access settings should you need to reference them.

#### Configuring n8n_instance_role attribute

The `n8n_instance_role` attribute is a string configured for a group or user on your IdP.

Supported instance roles are:

- `global:member`
- `global:admin`

#### Configuring n8n_projects attribute

The `n8n_projects` attribute is a string array configured for a group or user on your IdP.

Each element in this array needs to follow this format: `<project-id>:<role>`

For example:

- `bHsykgeFirmIhezz:viewer`
- `4K3zrg3DvlMFFTB7:editor`
- `dCjnYuEpYOUBVaNe:admin`

For existing access settings at the time of enabling project access provisioning through your IdP, you can find the project IDs in the downloaded CSV file.

When creating a project from scratch, get the project ID from the URL when viewing the project in your browser:

In the URL `<your-domain>/projects/VVRWZaq5DRxaf9O1/workflows` for example, the project ID is `VVRWZaq5DRxaf9O1`.

# Troubleshooting SAML SSO

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

- Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
- Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
- Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.

For more support, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/), or contact your support representative if you have a paid support plan.

# Workflows

A [workflow](../glossary/#workflow-n8n) is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process.

- [Create](create/) a workflow.
- Use [Workflow templates](templates/) to help you get started.
- Learn about the key [components](components/) of an automation in n8n.
- Debug using the [Executions](executions/) list.
- [Share](sharing/) workflows between users.

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](../try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

# Create a workflow

A [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the [workflow canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n).

## Create a workflow

1. Select the **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
1. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
1. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

Or:

1. Select the **create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.
1. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
1. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](../../try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

## Run workflows manually

You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.

To run manually, select **Execute Workflow**.

## Run workflows automatically

All new workflows are unpublished by default. See [Publishing and saving workflows](../publish/).

You need to publish workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.

To publish your workflow, open your workflow and click **Publish**. The option to unpublish is in the workflow settings menu.

Published workflows run whenever its trigger conditions are met.

# Export and import workflows

n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. You can export and import workflows in several ways.

Sharing credentials

Exported workflow JSON files include [credential](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.

## Copy-Paste

You can copy and paste a workflow or parts of it by selecting the nodes you want to copy to the clipboard (`Ctrl + c` or `cmd +c`) and pasting it (`Ctrl + v` or `cmd + v`) into the Editor UI.

To select all nodes or a group of nodes, click and drag:

## From the Editor UI menu

From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right to see the following options:

*Import & Export workflows menu*

- **Download**: Downloads your current workflow as a JSON file to your computer.
- **Import from URL**: Imports workflow JSON from a URL, for example, [this workflow JSON file on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit/refs/heads/main/n8n/demo-data/workflows/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb.json).
- **Import from File**: Imports a workflow as a JSON file from your computer.

## From the command line

- Export: See the [full list of commands](../../hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) for exporting workflows or credentials.
- Import: See the [full list of commands](../../hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials) for importing workflows or credentials.

# Workflow history

Feature availability

- Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
- Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
- Versions from the last 24 hours are available for all users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

## Understand workflow history

n8n creates a new version when you:

- Save your workflow.
- Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
- Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](../../source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

Changes to workflow settings do not create a new version.

Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](../executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history

To view a workflow's history:

1. Open the workflow.
1. Select **Workflow history** . n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** .
1. Choose what you want to do:
   - **Restore this version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
   - **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.
   - **Open version in new tab**: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
   - **Download**: download the version as JSON.

# Saving and publishing workflows

n8n automatically saves your workflow changes every 5 seconds while you're editing. When you're ready to put the workflow into production, publish your workflow. This approach prevents accidental production changes while enabling safe iteration and review.

## How saving works

Changes save automatically every 5 seconds while you edit. No manual save button is required, though you can still use Ctrl+S or Cmd+S if preferred. All edits remain in draft until you publish.

## How publishing works

Publishing makes your workflow live and locks it to a specific version. Production executions will use this published version, not your latest edits. When you publish, your workflow will enable the following:

- Webhook and form triggers will use their production URLs
- Schedules will run at the times you've defined
- Events from connected apps will trigger this workflow

**Initial state: You open the workflow**

**Changed state: Autosaved changes yet to be published**

**Published state: All changes published**

**Changed state: New changes yet to be published**

## How collaboration works

Only one person can edit a workflow at a time. If someone else is currently editing:

- You see the workflow in read-only mode
- The edit lock releases when they stop editing or become inactive
- You can then take over editing with the latest changes

## Checking publishing status

On the **Workflows** page, each workflow displays an indicator showing whether it is **Published** or **Not Published**. You will also be able to see the same indicator on the canvas header.

## Publishing a workflow

The **Publish** button in the canvas header is enabled whenever there are unpublished changes.

Each time you make a change to a workflow, n8n autosaves those changes to a new version of the workflow. These saved versions go live in production only when you publish the workflow after the changes.

1. Click the **Publish** button to open the publishing modal
1. The version name defaults to a UUID. Customize the name if you'd like and add a description of the version.
1. Click **Publish** to make your changes live in production. Production executions always point to the currently published version.

If you only update workflow settings, n8n will re-publish the version without requiring you to take any action.

## Managing version history

View and manage version history by clicking the history icon in the header. In the version history view, you can perform these actions:

- Unpublish the workflow to remove it from production
- Restore a previous version. Restoring lets you work on a version without affecting the production execution.
- Publish another version of the workflow

## Unpublishing a Workflow

Unpublish a workflow from either:

- The workflow settings menu
- The version history page (unpublish action on published versions)

# Workflow settings

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

## Access workflow settings

To open the settings:

1. Open your workflow.
1. Select the **three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.

## Available settings

The following settings are available:

### Execution order

Choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows:

**v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

**v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.

### Error Workflow (to notify when this one errors)

Select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [error workflows](../../flow-logic/error-handling/) for more details.

### This workflow can be called by

Choose which other workflows can call this workflow.

### Timezone

Sets the timezone for this workflow. The timezone setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node.

You can set your n8n instance's timezone to configure the default timezone workflows use:

- [Set a n8n Cloud instance timezone](../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/)
- [Configure the timezone for self-hosted instances](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/)

If you don't configure the workflow or instance timezone, n8n defaults to the EDT (New York) timezone.

### Save failed production executions

Whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.

### Save successful production executions

Whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.

### Save manual executions

Whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.

### Save execution progress

Whether n8n should save execution data for each node.

If set to **Save**, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This may increase latency.

### Timeout Workflow

Whether n8n should cancel the current workflow execution after a certain amount of time elapses.

When enabled, the **Timeout After** option appears. Here, you can set the time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users, n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.

### Estimated time saved

An estimate of the number of minutes each of execution of this workflow saves you.

Setting this lets n8n calculate the amount of time saved for [insights](../../insights/).

# Workflow sharing

Feature availability

Available on Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.

Workflow sharing allows you to share workflows between users of the same n8n instance.

Users can share workflows they created. Instance owners, and users with the admin role, can view and share all workflows in the instance. Refer to [Account types](../../user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

## Share a workflow

1. Open the workflow you want to share.
1. Select **Share**.
1. In **Add users**, find and select the users you want to share with.
1. Select **Save**.

**Note:** This option is only available when sharing a workflow that is inside a **Personal** workspace. When trying to use the "Add users" option for a workflow that's **inside a project**, you'll get this pop-up instead:

This is intended behavior, and it means that the workflow is shared with everyone inside that specific project. Instead of adding the user directly to the workflow, you need to add the user to the project in which the workflow is located.

## View shared workflows

You can browse and search workflows on the **Workflows** list. The workflows in the list depend on the project:

- **Overview** lists all workflows you can access. This includes:
  - Your own workflows.
  - Workflows shared with you.
  - Workflows in projects you're a member of.
  - If you log in as the instance owner or admin: all workflows in the instance.
- Other projects: all workflows in the project.

## Workflow roles and permissions

There are two workflow roles: creator and editor. The creator is the user who created the workflow. Editors are other users with access to the workflow.

You can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.

Credentials

Workflow sharing allows editors to use all [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](../../credentials/credential-sharing/).

### Permissions

| Permissions               | Creator | Editor |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| View workflow (read-only) |         |        |
| View executions           |         |        |
| Update (including tags)   |         |        |
| Run                       |         |        |
| Share                     |         |        |
| Export                    |         |        |
| Delete                    |         |        |

## Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials

Sharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.

Refer to [Credential sharing](../../credentials/credential-sharing/) for guidance on sharing credentials.

# Streaming responses

Feature availability

Available on all plans.

Streaming responses let you send data back to users as an AI Agent node generates it. This is useful for chatbots, where you want to show the user the answer as it's generated to provide a better user experience.

You can enable streaming using either:

- The [Chat Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/)
- The [Webhook node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/)

In both cases, set the node's **Response Mode** to **Streaming**.

## Configure nodes for streaming

To stream data, you need to add nodes to the workflow that support streaming output. Not all nodes support this feature.

1. Choose a node that supports streaming, such as:
   - [AI agent](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)
   - [Respond to Webhook](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/)
1. You can disable streaming in the options of these nodes. By default, they stream data whenever the executed trigger has its `Response Mode` set to `Streaming response`.

## Important information

Keep in mind the following details when configuring streaming responses:

- **Trigger**: Your trigger node must support streaming and have streaming configured. Without this, the workflow behaves according to your response mode settings.
- **Node configuration**: Even with streaming enabled on the trigger, you need at least one node configured to stream data. Otherwise, your workflow will send no data.

# Sub-workflow conversion

Feature availability

Available on all plans from n8n version 1.97.0.

Use sub-workflow conversion to refactor your workflows into reusable parts. Expressions referencing other nodes are automatically updated and added as parameters in the [Execute Workflow Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) node.

See [sub-workflows](../../flow-logic/subworkflows/) for a general introduction to the concept.

## Selecting nodes for a sub-workflow

To convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow, you must select the nodes in the original workflow that you want to convert.

Do this by selecting a group of valid nodes. The selection must be continuous and must connect to the rest of the workflow from at most one start node and one end node. The selection must fulfill these conditions:

- Must not include trigger nodes.
- Only a single node in the selection can have incoming connections from nodes *outside* of the selection.
  - That node can have multiple incoming connections, but only a single input *branch* (which means it can't be a [Merge node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) for example).
  - That node can't have incoming connections from other nodes in the selection.
- Only a single node in the selection can have outgoing connections to nodes *outside* of the selection.
  - That node can have multiple outgoing connections, but only a single output branch (it can't be an [If node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) for example).
  - That node can't have outgoing connections to other nodes in the selection.
- The selection must include all nodes between the input and output nodes.

## How to convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow

Select the desired nodes on the canvas. Right-click the canvas background and select **Convert to sub-workflow**.

## Things to keep in mind

Most sub-workflow conversions work without issues, but there are some caveats and limitations to keep in mind:

- **You must set type constraints for input and output manually**: By default, sub-workflow input and output allow all types. You can set expected types in sub-workflow's [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) and [Edit Fields (set) node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) (labeled as **Return** and only included if the sub-workflow has outputs).

- **Limited support for AI nodes**: When dealing with sub-nodes like AI tools, you must select them all and may need to duplicate any nodes shared with other AI Agents before conversion.

- **Uses v1 execution ordering:** New workflows use [`v1` execution ordering](../../flow-logic/execution-order/) regardless of the parent workflow's settings - you can change this back in the settings.

- **Accessor functions like `first()`, `last()`, and `all()` require extra care**: Expressions using these functions don't always translate cleanly to a sub-workflow context. n8n may transform them to try to preserve their functionality, but you should check that they work as intended in their new context.

  Sub-node parameter suffixes

  n8n adds suffixes like `_firstItem`, `_lastItem`, and `_allItems` to variable names accessed by these functions. This helps preserve information about the original expression, since item ordering may be different in the sub-workflow context.

- **The `itemMatching` function requires a fixed index**: You can't use expressions for the index value when using the [`itemMatching` function](../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/). You must pass it a fixed number.

# Tags

Workflow tags allow you to label your workflows. You can then filter workflows by tag.

Tags are global. This means when you create a tag, it's available to all users on your n8n instance.

## Add a tag to a workflow

To add a tag to your workflow:

1. In your workflow, select **+ Add tag**.
1. Select an existing tag, or enter a new tag name.
1. Once you select a tag and click away from the tag modal, n8n displays the tag next to the workflow name.

You can add more than one tag.

## Filter by tag

When browsing the workflows on your instance, you can filter by tag.

1. On the **Workflows** page, select **Filters**.
1. Select **Tags**.
1. Select the tag or tags you want to filter by. n8n lists the workflows with that tag.

## Manage tags

You can edit existing tags. Instance owners can delete tags.

1. Select **Manage tags**. This is available from **Filters** > **Tags** on the **Workflows** page, or in the **+ Add tag** modal in your workflow.
1. Hover over the tag you want to change.
1. Select **Edit** to rename it, or **Delete** to delete it.

Global tags

Tags are global. If you edit or delete a tag, this affects all users of your n8n instance.

# Workflow templates

When creating a new workflow, you can choose whether to start with an empty workflow, or use an existing [template](../../glossary/#template-n8n).

Templates provide:

- Help getting started: n8n might already have a template that does what you need.
- Examples of what you can build
- Best practices for creating your own workflows

## Access templates

Select **Templates** to view the templates library.

If you use n8n's template library, this takes you to browse [Workflows on the n8n website](https://n8n.io/workflows/). If you use a custom library provided by your organization, you'll be able to search and browse the templates within the app.

## Add your workflow to the n8n library

You can submit your workflows to n8n's template library.

n8n is working on a creator program, and developing a marketplace of templates. This is an ongoing project, and details are likely to change.

Refer to [n8n Creator hub](https://www.notion.so/n8n/n8n-Creator-hub-7bd2cbe0fce0449198ecb23ff4a2f76f) for information on how to submit templates and become a creator.

## Self-hosted n8n: Use your own library

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` to the base URL of your API.

### Endpoints

Your API must provide the same endpoints and data structure as n8n's.

The endpoints are:

| Method | Path                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | /templates/workflows/`<id>`   |
| GET    | /templates/search             |
| GET    | /templates/collections/`<id>` |
| GET    | /templates/collections        |
| GET    | /templates/categories         |
| GET    | /health                       |

### Query parameters

The `/templates/search` endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

| Parameter  | Type                                         | Description                                      |

# Find your workflow ID

Your workflow ID is available in:

- The URL of the open workflow.
- The workflow settings title.

# Workflow components

This section contains:

- [Nodes](nodes/): integrations and operations.
- [Connections](connections/): node connectors.
- [Sticky notes](sticky-notes/): document your workflows.

# Connections

A connection establishes a link between nodes to route data through the workflow. A connection between two nodes passes data from one node's output to another node's input.

## Create a connection

To create a connection between two nodes, select the grey dot or **Add node** on the right side of a node and slide the arrow to the grey rectangle on the left side of the following node.

## Delete a connection

Hover over the connection, then select **Delete** .

# Nodes

[Nodes](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) are the key building blocks of a [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n). They perform a range of actions, including:

- Starting the workflow.
- Fetching and sending data.
- Processing and manipulating data.

n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

- [Built-in integrations](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
- [Community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
- [Creating nodes](../../../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.

## Add a node to your workflow

### Add a node to an empty workflow

1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n).

1. Select the trigger you want to use.

   Choose the correct app event

   If you select **On App Event**, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.

   For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

### Add a node to an existing workflow

Select the **Add node** connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

- Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
- Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Node controls

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

- **Execute step** : Run the node.
- **Deactivate** : Deactivate the node.
- **Delete** : Delete the node.
- **Node context menu** : Select node actions. Available actions:
  - Open node
  - Execute step
  - Rename node
  - Deactivate node
  - Pin node
  - Copy node
  - Duplicate node
  - Tidy up workflow
  - Convert node to sub-workflow
  - Select all
  - Clear selection
  - Delete node

## Node settings

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

- **Always Output Data**: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
- **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
- **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.
- **On Error**:
  - **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
  - **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
  - **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.

You can document your workflow using node notes:

- **Notes**: Note to save with the node.
- **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.

# Sticky Notes

Sticky Notes allow you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

n8n recommends using Sticky Notes heavily, especially on [template workflows](../../../glossary/#template-n8n), to help other users understand your workflow.

## Create a Sticky Note

Sticky Notes are a core node. To add a new Sticky Note:

1. Open the nodes panel.
1. Search for `note`.
1. Click the **Sticky Note** node. n8n adds a new Sticky Note to the canvas.

## Edit a Sticky Note

1. Double click the Sticky Note you want to edit.
1. Write your note. [This guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) explains how to format your text with Markdown. n8n uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), which implements the CommonMark specification.
1. Click away from the note, or press `Esc`, to stop editing.

## Change the color

To change the Sticky Note color:

1. Hover over the Sticky Note
1. Select **Change color**

## Sticky Note positioning

You can:

- Drag a Sticky Note anywhere on the canvas.
- Drag Sticky Notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
- Resize Sticky Notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.
- Change the color: select **Options** to open the color selector.

## Writing in Markdown

Sticky Notes support Markdown formatting. This section describes some common options.

```
The text in double asterisks will be **bold**

The text in single asterisks will be *italic*

Use # to indicate headings:
# This is a top-level heading
## This is a sub-heading
### This is a smaller sub-heading

You can add links:
[Example](https://example.com/)

Create lists with asterisks:

* Item one
* Item two

Or created ordered lists with numbers:

1. Item one
2. Item two
```

For a more detailed guide, refer to [CommonMark's help](https://commonmark.org/help/). n8n uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), which implements the CommonMark specification.

## Make images full width

You can force images to be 100% width of the sticky note by appending `#full-width` to the filename:

```
![Source example](https://<IMAGE-URL>/<IMAGE-NAME>.png#full-width)
```

## Embed a YouTube video

To display a YouTube video in a note, use the `@[youtube](<video-id>)` directive with the video's ID. For this to work, the video's creator must allow embedding.

For example:

```
@[youtube](ZCuL2e4zC_4)
```

To embed your own video, copy the above syntax, replacing `ZCuL2e4zC_4` with your video ID. The YouTube video ID is the string that follows `v=` in the YouTube URL.

# Executions

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

## Execution modes

There are two execution modes:

- Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Execute Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
- Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.

## Execution lists

n8n provides two execution lists:

- [Workflow-level executions](single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
- [All executions](all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](custom-executions-data/).

# All executions

To view **all executions** from an n8n instance, navigate to the **Overview** page and then click into the Executions tab. This will show you all executions from the workflows you have access to.

If your n8n instance supports **projects**, you'll also be able to view the executions tab within projects you have access to. This will show you executions only from the workflows within the specified project.

Deleted workflows

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

## Filter executions

You can filter the executions list:

1. Select the **Executions** tab either from within the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list.
1. Select **Filters**.
1. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
   - **Workflows**: choose all workflows, or a specific workflow name.
   - **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.
   - **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.
   - **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

- Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
- Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Retry failed workflows

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

1. Select the **Executions** tab from within either the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list.
1. On the execution you want to retry, select **Retry execution** .
1. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
   - **Retry with currently saved workflow**: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
   - **Retry with original workflow**: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.

## Load data from previous executions into your current workflow

You can load data from a previous workflow back into the canvas. Refer to [Debug executions](../debug/) for more information.

# Custom executions data

You can set custom data on your workflow using the Code node or the [Execution Data node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/). n8n records this with each execution. You can then use this data when filtering the executions list, or fetch it in your workflows using the Code node.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

- Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
- Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Set and access custom data using the Code node

This section describes how to set and access data using the Code node. Refer to [Execution Data node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) for information on using the Execution Data node to set data. You can't retrieve custom data using the Execution Data node.

### Set custom executions data

Set a single piece of extra data:

```
$execution.customData.set("key", "value");
```

```
_execution.customData.set("key", "value");
```

Set all extra data. This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:

```
$execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})
```

```
_execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})
```

There are limitations:

- They must be strings
- `key` has a maximum length of 50 characters
- `value` has a maximum length of 255 characters
- n8n supports a maximum of 10 items of custom data

### Access the custom data object during execution

You can retrieve the custom data object, or a specific value in it, during an execution:

```
// Access the current state of the object during the execution
const customData = $execution.customData.getAll();

// Access a specific value set during this execution
const customData = $execution.customData.get("key");
```

```
# Access the current state of the object during the execution
customData = _execution.customData.getAll();

# Access a specific value set during this execution
customData = _execution.customData.get("key");
```

# Debug and re-run past executions

Feature availability

Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.

## Load data

To load data from a previous execution:

1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.
1. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
   - For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.
   - For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.
1. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](../../../data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.

Check which executions you save

The executions available on the **Executions** list depends on your [Workflow settings](../../settings/).

# Dirty nodes

A **dirty node** is a node that executed successfully in the past, but whose output n8n now considers stale or unreliable. They're labeled like this to indicate that if the node executes again, the output may be different. It may also be the point where a [partial execution](../manual-partial-and-production-executions/#partial-executions) starts from.

## How to recognize dirty node data

In the canvas of the workflow editor, you can identify dirty notes by their different-colored border and a yellow triangle in place of the previous green tick symbol. For example:

In the node editor view, the output panel also displays a yellow triangle on the output panel. If you hover over the triangle, a tooltip appears with more information about why n8n considers the data stale:

## Why n8n marks nodes dirty

There are several reasons why n8n might flag execution data as stale. For example:

- Inserting or deleting a node: labels the first node that follows the inserted node dirty.
- Modifying node parameters: labels the modified node dirty.
- Adding a connector: labels the destination node of the new connector dirty.
- Deactivating a node: labels the first node that follows the deactivated node dirty.

Other reasons n8n marks nodes dirty

- Unpinning a node: labels the unpinned node dirty.
- Modifying pinned data: labels the node that comes after the pinned data dirty.
- If any of the above actions occur inside a loop, also labels the first node of the loop dirty.

For sub-nodes, also labels any executed parent nodes (up to and including the root) when:

- Editing an executed sub-node

- Adding a new sub-node

- Disconnecting or deleting a sub-node

- Deactivating a sub-node

- Activating a sub-node

- When deleting a connected node in a workflow:

- The next node in the sequence becomes dirty:

When using loops (with the [Loop over Items](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node), when any node within the loop is dirty, the initial node of the loop is also considered dirty:

## Resolving dirty nodes

Executing a node again clears its dirty status. You can do this manually by triggering the whole workflow, or by running a [partial execution](../manual-partial-and-production-executions/#partial-executions) with **Execute step** on the individual node or any node which follows it.

# Manual, partial, and production executions

There are some important differences in how n8n executes workflows manually (by clicking the **Execute Workflow** button) and automatically (when the workflow is **Active** and triggered by an event or schedule).

## Manual executions

Manual executions allow you to run workflows directly from the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) to test your workflow logic. These executions are "ad-hoc": they run only when you manually select the **Execute workflow** button.

Manual executions make building workflows easier by allowing you to iteratively test as you go, following the flow logic and seeing data transformations. You can test conditional branching, data formatting changes, and loop behavior by providing different input items and modifying node options.

Pinning execution data

When performing manual executions, you can use [data pinning](../../../data/data-pinning/) to "pin" or "freeze" the output data of a node. You can optionally [edit the pinned data](../../../data/data-editing/) as well.

On future runs, instead of executing the pinned node, n8n will substitute the pinned data and continue following the flow logic. This allows you to iterate without operating on variable data or repeating queries to external services. Production executions ignore all pinned data.

## Partial executions

Clicking the **Execute workflow** button at the bottom of the workflow in the **Editor** tab manually runs the entire workflow. You can also perform partial executions to run specific steps in your workflow. Partial executions are manual executions that only run a subset of your workflow nodes.

To perform a partial execution, select a node, open its detail view, and select **Execute step**. This executes the specific node and any preceding nodes required to fill in its input data. You can also temporarily disable specific nodes in the workflow chain to avoid interacting with those services while building.

In particular, partial executions are useful when updating the logic of a specific node since they allow you to re-execute the node with the same input data.

### Troubleshooting partial executions

Some common issues you might come across when running partial executions include the following:

> The destination node is not connected to any trigger. Partial executions need a trigger.

This error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute.

To work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a [manual trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) is the simplest option.

> Please execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.)

This error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages.

To work around this, consider using the [limit node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.limit/) to limit node output while running partial executions. Once the workflow is running as intended, you can disable or delete the limit node before enabling production execution.

## Production executions

Production executions occur when a triggering event or schedule automatically runs a workflow.

To configure production executions, you must attach a [trigger node](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) (any trigger other than the [manual trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) works) and switch workflow's toggle to **Active**. Once published, the workflow automatically executes whenever the trigger condition occurs.

The execution flow for production executions doesn't display in the Editor tab of the workflow as with manual executions. Instead, you can see executions in the workflow's **Executions** tab according to your [workflow settings](../../settings/). From there, you can explore and troubleshoot problems using the [debug in editor feature](../debug/).

# Workflow-level executions list

The **Executions** list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.

Deleted workflows

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

Execution history and workflow history

Don't confuse the execution list with [Workflow history](../../history/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View executions for a single workflow

In the workflow, select the **Executions** tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.

## Filter executions

You can filter the executions list.

1. In your workflow, select **Executions**.
1. Select **Filters**.
1. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
   - **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.

   - **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.

   - **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

     Feature availability

     Custom executions data is available on:

     - Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
     - Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Retry failed workflows

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

1. Open the **Executions** list.
1. For the workflow execution you want to retry, select **Refresh** .
1. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
   - **Retry with currently saved workflow**: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
   - **Retry with original workflow**: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.
