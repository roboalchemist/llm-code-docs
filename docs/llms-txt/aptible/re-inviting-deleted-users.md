# How to Re-invite Deleted Users

Users can be part of multiple organizations in Aptible. If you remove them from your specific organization, they will still exist in Aptible and can be members of other orgs.
This is why they will see “email is in use” when trying to create themselves as a new user.

Please re-send your invite to this user but instead of having them create a new user, have them log in using the link you sent. Please have them follow these steps exactly:

* Click on the link to accept the invite
* Instead of creating a new user, used the “sign in here” option
* If your organization uses SSO, please have them sign in with password authentication because SSO will not work for them until they are a part of the organization. If they have 2FA set up and don’t have access to their device, please have them follow the steps [here](https://www.aptible.com/docs/how-to-guides/platform-guides/reset-aptible-2fa).

Once these steps are completed, they should appear as a Member in the Members page in the Org Settings. If your organization uses SSO, please share the [SSO login link](https://www.aptible.com/docs/core-concepts/security-compliance/authentication/sso#organization-login-id) from with the new user and have them attempt to login via SSO.
