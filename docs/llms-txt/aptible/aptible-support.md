## **Best practices when opening a ticket**

* **Add Detail:** Please provide as much detail as possible to help us resolve your issue quickly. When appropriate, please include the following:

  * Relevant handles (App, Database, Environment, etc.)

  * Logs or error messages

  * The UTC timestamp when you experienced the issue

  * Any commands or configurations you have tried so far

* **Sanitize any sensitive information:** This includes [Database Credentials](/core-concepts/managed-databases/connecting-databases/database-credentials), SSH keys, passwords, tokens, and any confidential [Configuration](/core-concepts/apps/deploying-apps/configuration) variables you may use.

* **Format your support requests:** To make it easier to parse important information, use backticks for monospacing or triple backticks for code blocks. We suggest using [private GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) for long code blocks or stack traces.

* **Set the appropriate priority:** This makes it easier for us to respond within the appropriate time frame.

## Ticket Priority

> 🏳️ High and Urgent Priority Support are only available on the [Premium & Enterprise Support plans.](https://www.aptible.com/pricing)

Users have the option to assign a priority level to their ticket submission, which is based on their [support plan](https://www.aptible.com/support-plans). The available priority levels include:

* **Low** (You have a general development question, or you want to request a feature)

* **Normal** (Non-critical functions of your application are behaving abnormally, or you have a time-sensitive development question)

* **High** (Important functions of your production application are impaired or degraded)

* **Urgent** (Your business is significantly impacted. Important functions your production application are unavailable)
