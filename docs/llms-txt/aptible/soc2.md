# Overview

Aptible’s platform is engineered to help businesses meet the rigorous standards of security and compliance required by SOC 2. As a platform with a strong foundation in supporting high-security industries, Aptible automates and enforces the essential infrastructure security and compliance controls necessary for SOC 2 compliance, providing the infrastructure to fast-track your own SOC 2 attestation.

# Achieving SOC 2 on Aptible

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provision a Dedicated Stack to run your resources">
    <Info>Dedicated Stacks are available on [Production and Enterprise plans](https://www.aptible.com/pricing).</Info>
    [Dedicated Stacks](https://www.aptible.com/docs/core-concepts/architecture/stacks#stacks) operate on isolated infrastructure and are designed to support deploying resources with stringent requirements like SOC 2. Aptible provides the infrastructure necessary to implement the required security and compliance controls, which must be independently assessed by an auditor to achieve SOC 2 compliance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Aptible’s SOC 2 Attestation">
    Aptible is SOC 2 attested, with documentation available upon request through [trust.aptible.com](https://trust.aptible.com). This attestation provides detailed evidence of the controls Aptible has implemented to meet SOC 2 requirements, enabling you to demonstrate to your Auditor how these controls align with your compliance needs and streamline your process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Leverage Aptible for your SOC 2 Compliance">
    Aptible supports your journey toward achieving **SOC 2 compliance**. Whether collaborating with an external Auditor or implementing necessary controls, Aptible ensures that critical security measures—such as logging, access control, vulnerability management, and encryption—are actively managed. Additionally, our platform assists in the evidence collection process required for your audit through our [Security & Compliance Dashboard](http://localhost:3000/core-concepts/security-compliance/security-compliance-dashboard/overview).
