# Database Backups

> Learn more about Aptible's database backup solution with automatic backups, default encryption, with flexible customization

# Overview

Database Backups are essential because they provide a way to recover important data in case of disasters or data loss. They also provide a historical record of changes to data, which can be required for auditing and compliance purposes.

Aptible provides Automatic Backups of your Databases every 24 hours, along with a range of other backup options. All Backups are compressed and encrypted for maximum security and efficiency. Additionally, all Backups are automatically stored across multiple Availability Zones for high-availability.

# Automatic Backups

By default, Aptible provides automatic backups of all Databases. The retention period for Automated Backups is determined by the Backup Retention Policy for the Environment in which the Database resides. The configuration options are as follows:

* `DAILY BACKUPS RETAINED` - Number of daily backups retained
* `MONTHLY BACKUPS RETAINED` - Number of monthly backups retained (the last backup of each month)
* `YEARLY BACKUPS RETAINED` - Number of yearly backups retained (the last backup of each year)
* `COPY BACKUPS TO ANOTHER REGION: TRUE/FALSE` - When enabled, Aptible will copy all the backups within that Environment to another region. See: Cross-region Copy Backups
* `KEEP FINAL BACKUP: TRUE/FALSE` - When enabled, Aptible will create and retain one final backup of a Database when you deprovision it. See: Final Backups

<Tip>
  **Recommended Backup Retention Policies**

  **Production environments:** Daily: 14-30, Monthly: 12, Yearly: 5, Copy backups to another region: TRUE (depending on DR needs), Keep final backups: TRUE

  **Non-production environments:** Daily: 1-14, Monthly: 0, Yearly: 0, Copy backups to another region: FALSE, Keep final backups: FALSE
</Tip>

### Cross-region Copy Backups

When `COPY BACKUPS TO ANOTHER REGION` is enabled on an Environment, Aptible will copy all the backups within that Environment to another region. For example, if your Stack is in the US East Coast, then Backups will be copied to the US West Coast.

<Tip>
  Cross-region Copy Backups are useful for creating redundancy for disaster recovery purposes. To further improve your recovery time objective (RTO), it’s recommended to have a secondary Stack in the region of your Cross-region Copy Backups to enable quick restoration in the event of a regional outage.
</Tip>

The exact mapping of Cross-region Copy Backups is as follows:

<Note>
  Aptible guarantees that data processing and storage occur only within the US for US Stacks and EU for EU Stacks.
</Note>

| Originating region | Destination region(s)          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- |
| us-east-1          | us-west-1, us-west-2           |
| us-east-2          | us-west-1, us-west-2           |
| us-west-1          | us-east-1                      |
| us-west-2          | us-east-1                      |
| sa-east-1          | us-east-2                      |
| ca-central-1       | ca-west-1 (formerly us-east-2) |
| eu-west-1          | eu-central-1                   |
| eu-west-2          | eu-central-1                   |
| eu-west-3          | eu-central-1                   |
| eu-central-1       | eu-west-1                      |
| ap-northeast-1     | ap-northeast-2                 |
| ap-northeast-2     | ap-northeast-1                 |
| ap-southeast-1     | ap-northeast-2, ap-southeast-2 |
| ap-southeast-2     | ap-southeast-4                 |
| ap-south-1         | ap-southeast-2                 |

### Final Backups

When `KEEP FINAL BACKUP` is enabled on an Environment, Aptible will create and retain a backup of the Database when you deprovision it. Final Backups are kept indefinitely as long as the Environment has this setting enabled.

<Tip>
  We highly recommend enabling this setting for production Environments.
</Tip>

### Point-in-time Recovery for PostgreSQL

<Info>
  Point-in-time Recovery is available for PostgreSQL 13 and newer.
</Info>

Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is a database backup feature that allows you to restore your database to any specific moment in time, rather than just to a pre-defined backup snapshot. Using write-ahead log (WAL) files generated by the database, you can recover your database from accidental data deletions, corruptions, or other errors by rolling back to the exact state of your database just before the problem occurred.

When enabled, Aptible will automatically archive WAL files generated by your database. WAL archiving occurs whenever a segment fills (typically 16MB) or at least once per minute if there's minimal write activity.

The retention period for these WAL file archives is determined by the Backup Retention Policy of the Environment where the Database resides. The configuration options are as follows:

* `POINT-IN-TIME RECOVERY DATA RETAINED` - Number of days to retain archived WAL files.

<Tip>
  We recommend enabling Point-in-Time Recovery for all production databases. At this time, only 1 day of WAL archive retention is supported. If you need longer retention periods, contact [Aptible Support](/how-to-guides/troubleshooting/aptible-support).
</Tip>

Point-in-time recovery on a database is managed through two operations:

* Enabling and disabling [point-in-time recovery](/core-concepts/managed-databases/managing-databases/database-backups#how-can-i-enable-point-in-time-recoveries-for-a-database)
* Performing a [point-in-time recovery](/core-concepts/managed-databases/managing-databases/database-backups#how-do-i-perform-a-point-in-time-recovery)

#### Automatic Enablement for New Databases

When you provision a new Database that supports Point-in-Time Recovery (PostgreSQL 13+), Aptible automatically enables PITR if your Environment's `POINT-IN-TIME RECOVERY DATA RETAINED` setting is 1 or more days.

If this setting is 0 days, a warning banner appears when creating a Database. To enable automatic PITR, update your Environment's [backup retention policy](/core-concepts/managed-databases/managing-databases/database-backups#managing-backup-retention-policy) to retain at least 1 day of recovery data.

<Note>
  Automatic PITR enablement only applies to Databases created through the Dashboard. Databases provisioned via the CLI or Terraform have PITR disabled by default—use the Dashboard to enable it after the database is created.
</Note>

# Manual Backups

Manual Backups can be created anytime and are retained indefinitely (even after the Database is deprovisioned).

# Managing Backup Retention Policy

The retention period for Automated Backups and Write-ahead-log File archiving is determined by the Backup Retention Policy for the Environment in which the Database resides.

The default Backup Retention Policy for an Environment is 30 Automatic Daily Backups, 12 Monthly Backups, 6 Yearly Backups, 1 day for write-ahead log archive retention, Keep Final Backup: Enabled, Cross-region Copy Backup: Disabled.

All Backup Retention Policies can be modified within the Aptible Dashboard:

* Select the desired Environment
* Select the **Backups** tab

Additionaly, backup retention polcies for automatic backups can be modified using one these methods:

* Using the [`aptible backup_retention_policy:set CLI command`](/reference/aptible-cli/cli-commands/cli-backup-retention-policy-set).
* Using the Aptible [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aptible/aptible/latest/docs)

<Warning>
  Reducing the number of retained backups, including disabling copies or final backups, will automatically delete existing, automated backups that do not match the new policy. This may result in the permanent loss of backup data and could violate your organization's internal compliance controls.
</Warning>

<Tip>

### Excluding a Database from new Automatic Backups

<Frame>
    <img src="https://mintcdn.com/aptible/MtH_goy23rOUOZd7/images/DisablingDatabaseBackups.gif?s=ab77a92c98cc0f60041e8a2eccdedb55" alt="Disabling Backups" data-og-width="904" width="904" data-og-height="720" height="720" data-path="images/DisablingDatabaseBackups.gif" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" />
</Frame>

A Database can be excluded from the backup retention policy preventing new Automatic Backups from being taken. This can be done within the Aptible Dashboard from the Database Settings, or via the [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aptible/aptible/latest/docs).

Once this is selected, there will be no new automatic backups taken of this database, including preventing a final backup of the database during deprovision, even if the environment's policy specifies it. Please note: making this change on an existing database does not automatically delete previously taken backups. Purging the previously taken backups can be achieved in the following ways:

* Using the [`aptible backup:list DB_HANDLE`](/reference/aptible-cli/cli-commands/cli-backup-list) to provide input into the [`aptible backup:purge BACKUP_ID`](/reference/aptible-cli/cli-commands/cli-backup-purge) command
* Setting the output format to JSON, like so:

```jsx  theme={null}
APTIBLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT=json aptible backup:list DB_HANDLE 
```

# Purging Backups

Automatic Backups are automatically and permanently deleted when the associated database is deprovisioned. Final Backups and Cross-region Copy Backups that do not match the Backup Retention Policy are also automatically and permanently deleted. This purging process can take up to 1 hour.

All Backups can be manually and individually deleted.

# Restoring from a Backup

Restoring a Backup creates a new Database from the backed-up data. It does not replace or modify the Database the Backup was initially created from. By default, all newly restored Databases are created as a 1GB [General Purpose Container Profile](/core-concepts/scaling/container-profiles#default-container-profile), however you can specify both container size and profile using the [`backup:restore`](/reference/aptible-cli/cli-commands/cli-backup-restore.mdx) command.

<Info>
  Deep dive: Databases Backups are stored as volume EBS Snapshots. As such, Databases restored from a Backup will initially have degraded disk performance, as described in the ["Restoring from an Amazon EBS snapshot"
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/backup-recovery/restore.html). If you are using a restored Database for performance testing, the performance test should be run twice: once to ensure all of the required data has been synced to disk and the second time to get an accurate result. Disk initialization time can be minimized by restoring the backup in the same region the Database is being restored to. Generally, this means the original Backup should be restored, not a copy.
</Info>

<Tip>
  If you have special retention needs (such as for a litigation hold), please contact [Aptible Support.](/how-to-guides/troubleshooting/aptible-support)
</Tip>

# Restoring using Point-in-time Recovery

If supported by the database and enabled, restoring with Point-in-time Recovery creates a new Database and then applies all archived write-ahead-log files up to the specified time.

<Note>
  The database must have automatic backups enabled and the environment's write-head-log archive retention must be greater than zero days before it can enable point-in-time recovery backups.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If there are insufficient write-ahead-log files archived, a point-in-time recovery can potentially fail and the new database will fail to start. To resolve this failure, a second point-in-time recovery can be retried with a different time specified.
</Warning>

# Encryption

Aptible provides built-in, automatic [Database Encryption](/core-concepts/managed-databases/managing-databases/database-encryption/overview). The encryption key and algorithm used for Database Encryption are automatically applied to all Backups of a given Database.

  <Accordion title="How should I set my Backup Retention Policy for Production Environments?">
    For critical production data, maintaining a substantial backup repository is crucial. While compliance frameworks like HIPAA don't mandate a specific duration for data retention, our practice has been to keep backups for up to six years. The introduction of Yearly backups now makes this practice more cost-effective. Aptible provides a robust default backup retention policy, but in most cases, a custom retention policy is best for tailoring to specific needs. Aptible backup retention policies are customizable at the Environment level, which applies to all databases within that environment.

    A well-balanced backup retention policy for production environments might look something like this:

    * Yearly Backups Retained: 0-6
    * Monthly Backups Retained: 3-12
    * Daily Backups Retained: 15-60
    * Point-in-time Recovery Data Retained: 1 (recommended for all production databases; only 1 day supported at this time)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How should I set my Backup Retention Policy for Non-production Environments?">
    When it comes to non-production environments, the backup requirements tend to be less stringent compared to production environments. In these cases, Aptible recommends the establishment of custom retention policies tailored to the specific needs and cost considerations of non-production environments. An effective backup retention policy for a non-production environment might include a more conservative approach:

    * Yearly Backups Retained: 0
    * Monthly Backups Retained: 0-1
    * Daily Backups Retained: 1-7
    * Point-in-time Recovery Data Retained: 0

    To optimize costs, it’s best to disable Cross-region Copy Backups and Keep Final Backups in non-production environments — as these settings are designed for critical production resources.
