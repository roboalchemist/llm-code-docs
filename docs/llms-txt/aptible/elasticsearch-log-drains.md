# Elasticsearch Log Drains

# Overview

Aptible can deliver your logs to an [Elasticsearch](/core-concepts/managed-databases/supported-databases/elasticsearch) database hosted in the same Aptible [Environment](/core-concepts/architecture/environments).

# Ingest Pipelines

Elasticsearch Ingest Pipelines are supported on Aptible but not currently exposed in the UI. To set up an Ingest Pipeline, please contact [Aptible Support](/how-to-guides/troubleshooting/aptible-support).
