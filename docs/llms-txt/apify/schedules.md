# Schedules - Introduction

This section describes API endpoints for managing schedules.

Schedules are used to automatically start your Actors at certain times. Each schedule can be associated with a number of Actors and Actor tasks. It is also possible to override the settings of each Actor (task) similarly to when invoking the Actor (task) using the API. For more information, see https://docs.apify.com/platform/schedules.

Each schedule is assigned actions for it to perform. Actions can be of two types

* `RUN_ACTOR` and `RUN_ACTOR_TASK`.

For details, see the documentation of the  endpoint.
