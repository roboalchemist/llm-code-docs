## Apify Scraper for AI Crawling

Apify Scraper for AI Crawling from [Apify](https://apify.com/) lets you extract text content from websites to feed AI models, LLM applications, vector databases, or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It supports rich formatting using Markdown, cleans the HTML of irrelevant elements, downloads linked files, and integrates with AI ecosystems like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and other LLM frameworks.

To use these modules, you need an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com) and an [API token](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api#api-token). You can find your token in the [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/) under **Settings > Integrations**. After connecting, you can automate content extraction at scale and incorporate the results into your AI workflows.

## Connect Apify Scraper for AI Crawling

1. Create an account at [Apify](https://console.apify.com/). You can sign up using your email, Gmail, or GitHub account.

Once connected, you can build workflows to automate website extraction and integrate results into your AI applications.

## Apify Scraper for Website Content modules

After connecting the app, you can use one of the two modules as native scrapers to extract website content.

### Standard Settings Module

The Standard Settings module is a streamlined component of the Website Content Crawler that allows you to quickly extract content from websites using optimized default settings. This module is perfect for extracting content from blogs, documentation sites, knowledge bases, or any text-rich website to feed into AI models.

#### How it works

The crawler starts with one or more **Start URLs** you provide, typically the top-level URL of a documentation site, blog, or knowledge base. It then:

* Crawls these start URLs
* Finds links to other pages on the site
* Recursively crawls those pages as long as their URL is under the start URL
* Respects URL patterns for inclusion/exclusion
* Automatically skips duplicate pages with the same canonical URL
* Provides various settings to customize crawling behavior (crawler type, max pages, depth, concurrency, etc.)

Once a web page is loaded, the Actor processes its HTML to ensure quality content extraction:

* Waits for dynamic content to load if using a headless browser
* Can scroll to a certain height to ensure all page content is loaded
* Can expand clickable elements to reveal hidden content
* Removes DOM nodes matching specific CSS selectors (like navigation, headers, footers)
* Optionally keeps only content matching specific CSS selectors
* Removes cookie warnings using browser extensions
* Transforms the page using the selected HTML transformer to extract the main content

#### Output data

For each crawled web page, you'll receive:

* *Page metadata*: URL, title, description, canonical URL
* *Cleaned text content*: The main article content with irrelevant elements removed
* *Markdown formatting*: Structured content with headers, lists, links, and other formatting preserved
* *Crawl information*: Loaded URL, referrer URL, timestamp, HTTP status
* *Optional file downloads*: PDFs, DOCs, and other linked documents

### Advanced Settings Module

The Advanced Settings module provides complete control over the content extraction process, allowing you to fine-tune every aspect of the crawling and transformation pipeline. This module is ideal for complex websites, JavaScript-heavy applications, or when you need precise control over content extraction.

#### Key features

* *Multiple Crawler Options*: Choose between headless browsers (Playwright) or faster HTTP clients (Cheerio)
* *Custom Content Selection*: Specify exactly which elements to keep or remove
* *Advanced Navigation Control*: Set crawling depth, scope, and URL patterns
* *Dynamic Content Handling*: Wait for JavaScript-rendered content to load
* *Interactive Element Support*: Click expandable sections to reveal hidden content
* *Multiple Output Formats*: Save content as Markdown, HTML, or plain text
* *Proxy Configuration*: Use proxies to handle geo-restrictions or avoid IP blocks
* *Content Transformation Options*: Multiple algorithms for optimal content extraction

#### How it works

The Advanced Settings module provides granular control over the entire crawling process:

1. *Crawler Selection*: Choose from Playwright (Firefox/Chrome), or Cheerio based on website complexity
2. *URL Management*: Define precise scoping with include/exclude URL patterns
3. *DOM Manipulation*: Control which HTML elements to keep or remove
4. *Content Transformation*: Apply specialized algorithms for content extraction
5. *Output Formatting*: Select from multiple formats for AI model compatibility

#### Configuration options

Advanced Settings offers numerous configuration options, including:

* *Crawler Type*: Select the rendering engine (browser or HTTP client)
* *Content Extraction Algorithm*: Choose from multiple HTML transformers
* *Element Selectors*: Specify which elements to keep, remove, or click
* *URL Patterns*: Define URL inclusion/exclusion patterns with glob syntax
* *Crawling Parameters*: Set concurrency, depth, timeouts, and retries
