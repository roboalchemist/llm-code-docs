# IFTTT integration

**Connect Apify Actors with IFTTT to automate workflows using Actor run events, data queries, and task actions.**

***

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) is a service that helps you create automated workflows called Applets. With the [Apify integration for IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/apify), you can connect your Apify Actors to hundreds of services like Twitter, Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, and more.

This guide shows you how to integrate Apify Actors with IFTTT to build automated workflows. You'll learn how to create IFTTT Applets that can be triggered by Apify events or that can execute Apify tasks.

An IFTTT Applet consists of three key parts:

* A *trigger* that starts the workflow
* Optional *queries* that retrieve data
* One or more *actions* that execute when the Applet runs

The Apify integration lets you trigger workflows when an Actor or task run finishes, start Actor or task runs from other triggers, or retrieve data from datasets and key-value stores.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Apify integration with IFTTT, you need:

* An [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/)
* An [IFTTT account](https://ifttt.com/)

## Connect Apify with IFTTT

To connect your Apify account to IFTTT:

1. Visit the [Apify service page](https://ifttt.com/apify) on IFTTT.
2. Click the **Connect** button.
3. When redirected to the Apify login page, sign in to your Apify account.

## Create an Applet with Apify

### Create an Applet

To create an Applet that starts when Apify event occurs:

1. Go to the [Explore](https://ifttt.com/explore) section on IFTTT.
2. Click the **Create** button.
3. In the **If this** section, click **Add**.
4. Search for and select **Apify** in the service list.

1. Select a trigger from the available options:

* **Actor Run Finished**: Triggers when a selected Actor run completes

![Apify Choose Trigger](/assets/images/ifttt-choose-trigger-216126271840adfba2cfd3b8e52d3631.png)

1. Configure the trigger by selecting the specific Actor or task.
2. Click **Create trigger** to continue.

In case you didn't connect to the Apify account, you will be prompted to do so when you select a trigger.

### Set up an Apify Action

To use Apify as an action in your Applet:

1. In the **Then That** section of your Applet, click **Add**.
2. Search for and select **Apify**.
3. Choose an action:

* **Run Actor**: Starts an Actor run
* **Run Task**: Starts an Actor Task run

![Apify Choose Action](/assets/images/ifttt-choose-action-336bd3d53b384f90739460cb649e5d6b.png)

1. Select the Actor or task you want to use from the dropdown menu.

note

IFTTT displays up to 50 recent items in a dropdown. If your Actor or task isn't visible, try using it at least once via API or in the Apify Console to make it appear in the list.

   | **Build**                   | Specifies the Actor build to run. Can be a build tag or build number. See [Builds](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds.md#builds) for more information. | `0.2.10`, `version-0` |
   | **Memory**                  | Memory limit for the run in megabytes. See [Memory](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources.md#memory) for more information.                            | `256`                 |
