# User-Agent Switcher

**Learn how to switch your User-Agent header to different values in order to monitor how a certain site responds to the changes.**

***

**User-Agent Switcher** is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly change your **User-Agent** and see how a certain website would behave with different user agents. After adding it to Chrome, you'll see a **Chrome UA Spoofer** button in the extension icons area. Clicking on it will open up a list of various **User-Agent** groups.

Clicking on a group will display a list of possible User-Agents to set.

After setting the **User-Agent**, the page will be refreshed.

## Configuration

The extension configuration page allows you to edit the **User-Agent** list in case you want to add a specific User-Agent that isn't already provided. You can find some other options, but most likely you will never need to modify those.
