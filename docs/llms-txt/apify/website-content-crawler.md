# n8n - Website Content Crawler by Apify

Website Content Crawler from [Apify](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) lets you extract text content from websites to feed AI models, LLM applications, vector databases, or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It supports rich formatting using Markdown, cleans the HTML of irrelevant elements, downloads linked files, and integrates with AI ecosystems like Langchain, LlamaIndex, and other LLM frameworks.

To use these modules, you need an [API token](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api#api-token). You can find your token in the [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/) under **Settings > Integrations**. After connecting, you can automate content extraction at scale and incorporate the results into your AI workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* An [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/)
* An [n8n instance](https://docs.n8n.io/learning-path/) (self‑hosted or cloud)

## n8n Cloud setup

This section explains how to install and connect the Apify node when using n8n Cloud.

### Install

For n8n Cloud users, installation is even simpler and doesn't require manual package entry. Just search and add the node from the canvas.

1. Go to the **Canvas** and open the **nodes panel**
2. Search for **Website Content Crawler by Apify** in the community node registry
3. Click **Install node** to add the Apify node to your instance

Verified community nodes visibility

On n8n Cloud, instance owners can toggle visibility of verified community nodes in the Cloud Admin Panel. Ensure this setting is enabled to install the Website Content Crawler by Apify node.

### Connect

1. In n8n Cloud, select **Create Credential**.
2. Search for Apify OAuth2 API and select **Continue**.
3. Select **Connect my account** and authorize with your Apify account.
4. n8n automatically retrieves and stores the OAuth2 tokens.

Cloud API Key management

On n8n Cloud, you can use the API key method if you prefer to manage your credentials manually. See the  for detailed API configuration instructions.

With authentication set up, you can now create workflows that incorporate the Apify node.

## n8n self-hosted setup

This section explains how to install and connect the Apify node when running your own n8n instance.

### Install

If you're running a self-hosted n8n instance, you can install the Apify community node directly from the editor. This process adds the node to your available tools, enabling Apify operations in workflows.

1. Open your n8n instance.
2. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
3. Select **Install**.
4. Enter the npm package name: `@apify/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler` (for latest version). To install a specific [version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apify/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler?activeTab=versions) enter e.g `@apify/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler@0.0.1`.
5. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes and select **Install**.
6. You can now use the node in your workflows.

2. To connect your Apify account to n8n, you can use an OAuth connection (recommended) or an Apify API token. To get the Apify API token, navigate to **[Settings > API & Integrations](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations)** in the Apify Console.

   ![Apify Console token for n8n](/assets/images/apify-console-token-for-make-cf75dbeb5effdcab9bc204cee94cdb6a.png)

3. Find your token under **Personal API tokens** section. You can also create a new API token with multiple customizable permissions by clicking on **+ Create a new token**.

4. Click the **Copy** icon next to your API token to copy it to your clipboard. Then, return to your n8n workflow interface.

   ![Apify token on n8n](/assets/images/Apify_token_on_Make-78f67b559503d92cffb17e5abffd18d2.png)

5. In n8n, click **Create new credential** of the chosen Apify Scraper module.

6. In the **API key** field, paste the API token you copied from Apify and click **Save**.

## Website Content Crawler by Apify module

This module provides complete control over the content extraction process, allowing you to fine-tune every aspect of the crawling and transformation pipeline. This module is ideal for complex websites, JavaScript-heavy applications, or when you need precise control over content extraction.

### Key features

* *Multiple Crawler Options*: Choose between headless browsers (Playwright) or faster HTTP clients (Cheerio)
* *Custom Content Selection*: Specify exactly which elements to keep or remove
* *Advanced Navigation Control*: Set crawling depth, scope, and URL patterns
* *Dynamic Content Handling*: Wait for JavaScript-rendered content to load
* *Interactive Element Support*: Click expandable sections to reveal hidden content
* *Multiple Output Formats*: Save content as Markdown, HTML, or plain text
* *Proxy Configuration*: Use proxies to handle geo-restrictions or avoid IP blocks
* *Content Transformation Options*: Multiple algorithms for optimal content extraction

### How it works

the Website Content Crawler by Apify module provides granular control over the entire crawling process. For *Crawler selection*, you can choose from Playwright (Firefox/Chrome) or Cheerio, depending on the complexity of the target website. *URL management* allows you to define the crawling scope with include and exclude URL patterns. You can also exercise precise *DOM manipulation* by controlling which HTML elements to keep or remove. To ensure the best results, you can apply specialized algorithms for *Content transformation* and select from various *Output formatting* options for better AI model compatibility.

### Output data

For each crawled web page, you'll receive:

* *Page metadata*: URL, title, description, canonical URL
* *Cleaned text content*: The main article content with irrelevant elements removed
* *Markdown formatting*: Structured content with headers, lists, links, and other formatting preserved
* *Crawl information*: Loaded URL, referrer URL, timestamp, HTTP status
* *Optional file downloads*: PDFs, DOCs, and other linked documents
* *Multiple format options*: Content in Markdown, HTML, or plain text
* *Debug information*: Detailed extraction diagnostics and snapshots
* *HTML transformations*: Results from different content extraction algorithms
* *File storage options*: Flexible storage for HTML, screenshots, or downloaded files

You can access any of thousands of our scrapers on Apify Store by using the [general Apify app](https://n8n.io/integrations/apify).

### Configuration options

You can select the *Crawler type* by choosing the rendering engine (browser or HTTP client) and the *Content extraction algorithm* from multiple HTML transformers. *Element selectors* allow you to specify which elements to keep, remove, or click, while *URL patterns* let you define inclusion and exclusion rules with glob syntax. You can also set *Crawling parameters* like concurrency, depth, timeouts, and retries. For robust crawling, you can configure *Proxy configuration* settings and select from various *Output options* for content formats and storage.

## Usage as an AI Agent Tool

You can setup Apify's Scraper for AI Crawling node as a tool for your AI Agents.

![Setup AI Agent](/assets/images/setup-c67795aefce11d57a319d2e72cdac87f.png)

### Dynamic URL crawling

In the Website Content Crawler module you can set the **Start URLs** to be filled in by your AI Agent dynamically. This allows the Agent to decide on which pages to scrape off the internet.

Two key parameters to configure for optimized AI Agent usage are **Max crawling depth** and **Max pages**. Remember that the scraping results are passed into the AI Agent’s context, so using smaller values helps stay within context limits.

![Apify Configuration](/assets/images/config-2d8b33a308453697a55da08176e0d478.png)

### Example usage

Here, the agent was used to find information about Apify's latest blog post. It correctly filled in the URL for the blog and summarized its content.
