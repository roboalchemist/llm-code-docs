# Actor development quick start

**Create your first Actor using the Apify Web IDE or locally in your IDE.**

***

Before you build

Before you start building your own Actor, try out a couple of existing Actors from https://apify.com/store. See the https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running.md section for more information on running existing Actors.

## Technology stack

Any code that can run inside of a Docker container can be turned into Apify https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors.md. This gives you freedom in choosing your technical stack, including programming language and technologies.

But to fully benefit from running on top of the Apify platform, we recommend you choose either JavaScript/Node.js or Python, where Apify provides first-level support regarding its SDK, API clients, and learning materials.

For these languages, you can also https://apify.com/templates that help you to kickstart your project quickly.

## Development paths

You can develop Actor in two ways:

### Local development

Develop your Actor locally in your IDE and only deploy to the Apify platform when it is production ready.

This way, you benefit from your local setup for a better development and debugging experience. After you are done with the development, you can https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment.md your Actor to the Apify platform.

### Web IDE

Using the Web IDE in https://console.apify.com.

This is the fastest way to kick-start your Actor development and try out the Apify platform.
