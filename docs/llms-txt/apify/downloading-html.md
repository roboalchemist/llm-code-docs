# Downloading HTML with Node.js

**In this lesson we'll start building a Node.js application for watching prices. As a first step, we'll use the Fetch API to download HTML code of a product listing page.**

***

Using browser tools for developers is crucial for understanding the structure of a particular page, but it's a manual task. Let's start building our first automation, a JavaScript program which downloads HTML code of the product listing.

## Starting a Node.js project

Before we start coding, we need to set up a Node.js project. Let's create new directory and let's name it `product-scraper`. Inside the directory, we'll initialize new project:


```
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
...

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (product-scraper)
version: (1.0.0)
description: Product scraper
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
type: (commonjs) module
About to write to /Users/.../product-scraper/package.json:

{
  "name": "product-scraper",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Product scraper",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "type": "module"
}
```


The above creates a `package.json` file with configuration of our project. While most of the values are arbitrary, it's important that the project's type is set to `module`. Now let's test that all works. Inside the project directory we'll create a new file called `index.js` with the following code:


```
import process from 'node:process';

console.log(`All is OK, ${process.argv[2]}`);
```


Running it as a Node.js program will verify that our setup is okay and we've correctly set the type to `module`. The program takes a single word as an argument and will address us with it, so let's pass it "mate", for example:


```
$ node index.js mate
All is OK, mate
```


Troubleshooting

If you see errors or are otherwise unable to run the code above, it likely means your environment isn't set up correctly. Unfortunately, diagnosing the issue is out of scope for this course.

Make sure that in your `package.json` the type property is set to `module`, otherwise you'll get the following warning:


```
[MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/.../product-scraper/index.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/.../product-scraper/package.json.
```


In older versions of Node.js, you may even encounter this error:


```
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```


## Downloading product listing

Now onto coding! Let's change our code so it downloads HTML of the product listing instead of printing `All is OK`. The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch provides us with examples how to use it. Inspired by those, our code will look like this:


```
const url = "https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/collections/sales";
const response = await fetch(url);
console.log(await response.text());
```


Asynchronous flow

First time you see `await`? It's a modern syntax for working with promises. See the https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/javascript-asynchronous-programming-and-callbacks and https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/discover-promises-in-nodejs tutorials in the official Node.js documentation for more.

If we run the program now, it should print the downloaded HTML:


```
$ node index.js
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#00badb">
    <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
    <title>Sales</title>
  ...
  </body>
</html>
```


Running `await fetch(url)`, we made a HTTP request and received a response. It's not particularly useful yet, but it's a good start of our scraper.

Client and server, request and response

HTTP is a network protocol powering the internet. Understanding it well is an important foundation for successful scraping, but for this course, it's enough to know just the basic flow and terminology:

* HTTP is an exchange between two participants.
* The *client* sends a *request* to the *server*, which replies with a *response*.
* In our case, `index.js` is the client, and the technology running at `warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com` replies to our request as the server.

## Handling errors

Websites can return various errors, such as when the server is temporarily down, applying anti-scraping protections, or simply being buggy. In HTTP, each response has a three-digit *status code* that indicates whether it is an error or a success.

All status codes

If you've never worked with HTTP response status codes before, briefly scan their https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status to get at least a basic idea of what you might encounter. For further education on the topic, we recommend https://http.cat/ as a highly professional resource.

A robust scraper skips or retries requests on errors. Given the complexity of this task, it's best to use libraries or frameworks. For now, we'll at least make sure that our program visibly crashes and prints what happened in case there's an error.

First, let's ask for trouble. We'll change the URL in our code to a page that doesn't exist, so that we get a response with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404. This could happen, for example, when the product we are scraping is no longer available:


```
https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/does/not/exist
```


We could check the value of `response.status` against a list of allowed numbers, but the Fetch API already provides `response.ok`, a property which returns `false` if our request wasn't successful:


```
const url = "https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/does/not/exist";
const response = await fetch(url);

if (response.ok) {
  console.log(await response.text());
} else {
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
}
```


If you run the code above, the program should crash:


```
$ node index.js
file:///Users/.../index.js:7
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
        ^

Error: HTTP 404
    at file:///Users/.../index.js:7:9
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)
```


Letting our program visibly crash on error is enough for our purposes. Now, let's return to our primary goal. In the next lesson, we'll be looking for a way to extract information about products from the downloaded HTML.

## Exercises

These challenges are here to help you test what you’ve learned in this lesson. Try to resist the urge to peek at the solutions right away. Remember, the best learning happens when you dive in and do it yourself!

Real world

You're about to touch the real web, which is practical and exciting! But websites change, so some exercises might break. If you run into any issues, please leave a comment below or https://github.com/apify/apify-docs/issues.

### Scrape AliExpress

Download HTML of a product listing page, but this time from a real world e-commerce website. For example this page with AliExpress search results:


```
https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-darth-vader.html
```


Solution


```
const url = "https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-darth-vader.html";
const response = await fetch(url);

if (response.ok) {
  console.log(await response.text());
} else {
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
}
```


### Save downloaded HTML as a file

Download HTML, then save it on your disk as a `products.html` file. You can use the URL we've been already playing with:


```
https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/collections/sales
```


Solution

Right in your Terminal or Command Prompt, you can create files by *redirecting output* of command line programs:


```
node index.js > products.html
```


If you want to use Node.js instead, it offers several ways how to create files. The solution below uses the https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promises-api:


```
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const url = "https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/collections/sales";
const response = await fetch(url);

if (response.ok) {
  const html = await response.text();
  await writeFile('products.html', html);
} else {
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
}
```


### Download an image as a file

Download a product image, then save it on your disk as a file. While HTML is *textual* content, images are *binary*. You may want to scan through the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#reading_the_response_body and the https://nodejs.org/en/learn/manipulating-files/writing-files-with-nodejs tutorial for guidance. Especially check `Response.arrayBuffer()`. You can use this URL pointing to an image of a TV:


```
https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sonyxbr55front_f72cc8ff-fcd6-4141-b9cc-e1320f867785.jpg
```


Solution

Node.js offers several ways how to create files. The solution below uses https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promises-api:


```
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const url = "https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/products/sonyxbr55front_f72cc8ff-fcd6-4141-b9cc-e1320f867785.jpg";
const response = await fetch(url);

if (response.ok) {
  const buffer = Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer());
  await writeFile('tv.jpg', buffer);
} else {
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
}
```
