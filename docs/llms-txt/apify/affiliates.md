# Affiliates

The Apify Affiliate Program offers you a way to earn recurring commissions while helping others discover automation and web scraping solutions. Whether you promote Apify Store or refer customers to Apify's professional services, you can monetize your expertise and network.

The program rewards collaboration with up to 30% recurring commission and up to $2,500 per customer for professional services referrals. With no time limits on commissions, transparent tracking, and flexible payout options, it's built for long-term partnerships.

## How the program works

The Apify Affiliate Program lets you promote three main offerings:

1. *Apify Store*: recommend Actors from the marketplace that help businesses automate lead generation, pricing intelligence, content aggregation, and more.
2. *Apify platform*: promote the platform's features, including scheduling, monitoring, data export options, proxies, and integrations.
3. *Professional services*: refer customers who need custom web scraping solutions to Apify's Professional Services team and earn up to $2,500 per closed deal.

### Commission structure

* *20% commission* for the first 3 months of each customer's subscription
* *30% commission* from month 4 onwards for as long as they remain customers
* *Up to $2,500 per customer* for professional services referrals
* *No time limits on commissions* - you earn as long as your referrals stay active

### Free trial advantage

Apify offers a $5 free trial that renews monthly, giving your referrals time to test the tools before subscribing. This increases conversion rates and helps you earn more consistent commissions.

## How to succeed as an affiliate

### Use word of mouth

Tell clients, business contacts, or colleagues how Apify solves their lead generation, data collection, and automation challenges. Personal recommendations carry weight, especially when you can speak to real use cases.

### Create educational content

Use your platform to demonstrate value:

* Blog posts: write tutorials, case studies, or problem-solving guides that feature Apify tools
* Video content: record demos, walkthroughs, or quick tips showing how Actors work
* Podcasts: discuss automation workflows and mention specific Actors that solve common problems
* Social media: share favorite Actors, tools, or workflows with your audience

### Engage your community

If you run a forum, Discord server, or an online group, position Apify as a resource for solving automation and data collection challenges. Answer questions and recommend relevant Actors when they fit the problem.

### Teach and inspire

If you teach AI automation, engineering, marketing, or lead generation, include Apify in your curriculum. Show students how to use Actors in webinars, online courses, or workshops.
