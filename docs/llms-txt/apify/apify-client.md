# Apify client

**Interact with the Apify API in your code by using the apify-client package, which is available for both JavaScript and Python.**

***

Now that you've gotten your toes wet with interacting with the Apify API through raw HTTP requests, you're ready to become familiar with the **Apify client**, which is a package available for both JavaScript and Python that allows you to interact with the API in your code without explicitly needing to make any GET or POST requests.

This lesson will provide code examples for both Node.js and Python, so regardless of the language you are using, you can follow along!

## Examples

You can access `apify-client` examples in the Console Actor detail page. Click the **API** button and then the **API Client** dropdown button.

## Installing and importing

If you are going to use the client in Node.js, use this command within one of your projects to install the package through npm:


```
npm install apify-client
```


In Python, you can install it from PyPI with this command:


```
pip install apify-client
```


After installing the package, let's make a file named `client.js` (or `client.py` for Python) and import the Apify client like so:

* Node.js
* Python


```
// client.js
import { ApifyClient } from 'apify-client';
```



```
# client.py
from apify_client import ApifyClient
```


## Running an Actor

In the last lesson, we ran the **adding-actor** and retrieved its dataset items. That's exactly what we're going to do now; however, by using the Apify client instead.

Before we can use the client though, we must create a new instance of the `ApifyClient` class and pass it our API token from the https://console.apify.com/account?tab=integrations&asrc=developers_portal on the Apify Console:

* Node.js
* Python


```
const client = new ApifyClient({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
});
```



```
client = ApifyClient(token='YOUR_TOKEN')
```


Environment variables

If you are planning on publishing your code to a public GitHub/Gitlab repository or anywhere else online, be sure to set your API token as en environment variable, and never hardcode it directly into your script.

Now that we've got our instance, we can point to an Actor using the https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js/reference/class/ApifyClient#actor function, then call the Actor with some input with the https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js/reference/class/ApifyClient#actor function - the first parameter of which is the input for the Actor.

* Node.js
* Python


```
const run = await client.actor('YOUR_USERNAME/adding-actor').call({
    num1: 4,
    num2: 2,
});
```



```
run = client.actor('YOUR_USERNAME/adding-actor').call(run_input={
    'num1': 4,
    'num2': 2
})
```

Learn more about the `.call()` function in our https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js/reference/class/ApifyClient#actor.

## Downloading dataset items

Once an Actor's run has completed, it will return a **run info** object that looks something like this:

![Run info object](/assets/images/run-info-5744283cdcb67851aa05d10ef782d69d.jpg)

The `run` variable we created in the last section points to the **run info** object of the run we created with the `.call()` function, which means that through this variable, we can access the run's `defaultDatasetId`. This ID can then be passed into the `client.dataset()` function.

* Node.js
* Python


```
const dataset = client.dataset(run.defaultDatasetId);
```



```
dataset = client.dataset(run['defaultDatasetId'])
```


Finally, we can download the items in the dataset by using the **list items** function, then log them to the console.

* Node.js
* Python


```
const { items } = await dataset.listItems();

console.log(items);
```



```
items = dataset.list_items().items

print(items)
```


The final code for running the Actor and fetching its dataset items looks like this:

* Node.js
* Python


```
// client.js
import { ApifyClient } from 'apify-client';

const client = new ApifyClient({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
});

const run = await client.actor('YOUR_USERNAME/adding-actor').call({
    num1: 4,
    num2: 2,
});

const dataset = client.dataset(run.defaultDatasetId);

const { items } = await dataset.listItems();

console.log(items);
```



```
# client.py
from apify_client import ApifyClient

client = ApifyClient(token='YOUR_TOKEN')

actor = client.actor('YOUR_USERNAME/adding-actor').call(run_input={
    'num1': 4,
    'num2': 2
})

dataset = client.dataset(run['defaultDatasetId'])

items = dataset.list_items().items

print(items)
```


## Updating an Actor

If you check the **Settings** tab within your **adding-actor**, you'll notice that the default timeout being set to the Actor is **360 seconds**. This is a bit overkill considering the fact that the Actor is only adding two numbers together - the run should never take more than 20 seconds (even this is a generous number). The default memory being allocated to the Actor is **256 MB**, which is reasonable for our purposes.

Let's change these two Actor settings via the Apify client using the https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js/reference/class/ActorClient#update function. This function will call the **update Actor** endpoint, which can take `defaultRunOptions` as an input property. You can find the shape of the `defaultRunOptions` in the https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/act-put.md. Perfect!

First, we'll create a pointer to our Actor, similar to before (except this time, we won't be using `.call()` at the end):

* Node.js
* Python


```
const actor = client.actor('YOUR_USERNAME/adding-actor');
```



```
actor = client.actor('YOUR_USERNAME/adding-actor')
```


Then, we'll call the `.update()` method on the `actor` variable we created and pass in our new **default run options**:

* Node.js
* Python


```
await actor.update({
    defaultRunOptions: {
        build: 'latest',
        memoryMbytes: 256,
        timeoutSecs: 20,
    },
});
```



```
actor.update(default_run_build='latest', default_run_memory_mbytes=256, default_run_timeout_secs=20)
```


After running the code, go back to the **Settings** page of **adding-actor**. If your default options now look like this, then it worked!:

## Overview

You can do so much more with the Apify client than running Actors, updating Actors, and downloading dataset items. The purpose of this lesson was to get you comfortable using the client in your own projects, as it's the absolute best developer tool for integrating the Apify platform with an external system.

For a more in-depth understanding of the Apify API client, give these a quick lookover:
