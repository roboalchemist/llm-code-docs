# Locating HTML elements on a web page with browser DevTools

**In this lesson we'll use the browser tools for developers to manually find products on an e-commerce website.**

***

Inspecting Wikipedia and tweaking its subtitle is fun, but let's shift gears and focus on building an app to track prices on an e-commerce site. As part of the groundwork, let's check out the site we'll be working with.

## Meeting the Warehouse store

Instead of artificial scraping playgrounds or sandboxes, we'll scrape a real e-commerce site. Shopify, a major e-commerce platform, has a demo store at https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/. It strikes a good balance between being realistic and stable enough for a tutorial. Our scraper will track prices for all products listed on the https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/collections/sales.

Balancing authenticity and stability

Live sites like Amazon are complex, loaded with promotions, frequently changing, and equipped with anti-scraping measures. While those challenges are manageable, they're advanced topics. For this beginner course, we're sticking to a lightweight, stable environment.

That said, we designed all the additional exercises to work with live websites. This means occasional updates might be needed, but we think it's worth it for a more authentic learning experience.

## Finding a product card

As mentioned in the previous lesson, before building a scraper, we need to understand structure of the target page and identify the specific elements our program should extract. Let's figure out how to select details for each product on the https://warehouse-theme-metal.myshopify.com/collections/sales.

![Warehouse store with DevTools open](/assets/images/devtools-warehouse-193f0152a0cd14df5068bc13512c31ee.png)

The page displays a grid of product cards, each showing a product's title and picture. Let's open DevTools and locate the title of the **Sony SACS9 Active Subwoofer**. We'll highlight it in the **Elements** tab by clicking on it.

![Selecting an element with DevTools](/assets/images/devtools-product-title-29537d86966f0c3ae781b4cf8d53ef7e.png)

Next, let's find all the elements containing details about this subwoofer—its price, number of reviews, image, and more.

In the **Elements** tab, we'll move our cursor up from the `a` element containing the subwoofer's title. On the way, we'll hover over each element until we highlight the entire product card. Alternatively, we can use the arrow-up key. The `div` element we land on is the **parent element**, and all nested elements are its **child elements**.

![Selecting an element with hover](/assets/images/devtools-hover-product-72db0f66037c498f4b84e2405cc5e80c.png)

At this stage, we could use the **Store as global variable** option to send the element to the **Console**. While helpful for manual inspection, this isn't something a program can do.

Scrapers typically rely on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors to locate elements on a page, and these selectors often target elements based on their `class` attributes. The product card we highlighted has markup like this:


```
<div class="product-item product-item--vertical 1/3--tablet-and-up 1/4--desk">
  ...
</div>
```


The `class` attribute can hold multiple values separated by whitespace. This particular element has four classes. Let's move to the **Console** and experiment with CSS selectors to locate this element.

## Programmatically locating a product card

Let's jump into the **Console** and write some code. In browsers, JavaScript represents the current page as the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document object, accessible via `document`. This object offers many useful methods, including https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector. This method takes a CSS selector as a string and returns the first HTML element that matches. We'll try typing this into the **Console**:


```
document.querySelector('.product-item');
```


It will return the HTML element for the first product card in the listing:

![Using querySelector() in DevTools Console](/assets/images/devtools-queryselector-803d0a68e972691c71ad6551e8ab27d6.webp)

CSS selectors can get quite complex, but the basics are enough to scrape most of the Warehouse store. Let's cover two simple types and how they can combine.

The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors matches elements by tag name. For example, `h1` would match the highlighted element:


```
<article>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Paragraph.</p>
</article>
```


The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors matches elements based on their class attribute. For instance, `.heading` (note the dot) would match the following:


```
<article>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <h2 class="heading">Subtitle</h2>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
  <p>
    <strong class="heading">Heading</strong>
  </p>
</article>
```


You can combine selectors to narrow results. For example, `p.lead` matches `p` elements with the `lead` class, but not `p` elements without the class or elements with the class but a different tag name:


```
<article>
  <p class="lead">Lead paragraph.</p>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
  <section class="lead"><p>Paragraph</p></section>
</article>
```


How did we know `.product-item` selects a product card? By inspecting the markup of the product card element. After checking its classes, we chose the one that best fit our purpose. Testing in the **Console** confirmed it—selecting by the most descriptive class worked.

## Choosing good selectors

Multiple approaches often exist for creating a CSS selector that targets the element we want. We should pick selectors that are simple, readable, unique, and semantically tied to the data. These are **resilient selectors**. They're the most reliable and likely to survive website updates. We better avoid randomly generated attributes like `class="F4jsL8"`, as they tend to change without warning.

The product card has four classes: `product-item`, `product-item--vertical`, `1/3--tablet-and-up`, and `1/4--desk`. Only the first one checks all the boxes. A product card *is* a product item, after all. The others seem more about styling—defining how the element looks on the screen—and are probably tied to CSS rules.

This class is also unique enough in the page's context. If it were something generic like `item`, there would be a higher risk that developers of the website might use it for unrelated elements. In the **Elements** tab, we can see a parent element `product-list` that contains all the product cards marked as `product-item`. This structure aligns with the data we're after.

![Overview of all the product cards in DevTools](/assets/images/devtools-product-list-9ebeb190d65fc7f7ae765caaa6eb128b.png)

## Locating all product cards

In the **Console**, hovering our cursor over objects representing HTML elements highlights the corresponding elements on the page. This way we can verify that when we query `.product-item`, the result represents the JBL Flip speaker—the first product card in the list.

![Highlighting a querySelector() result](/assets/images/devtools-hover-queryselector-747bedb6133e1d9919c10bdb0e6cc599.png)

But what if we want to scrape details about the Sony subwoofer we inspected earlier? For that, we need a method that selects more than just the first match: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll. As the name suggests, it takes a CSS selector string and returns all matching HTML elements. Let's type this into the **Console**:


```
document.querySelectorAll('.product-item');
```


The returned value is a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList, a collection of nodes. Browsers understand an HTML document as a tree of nodes. Most nodes are HTML elements, but there are also text nodes for plain text, and others.

We'll expand the result by clicking the small arrow, then hover our cursor over the third element in the list. Indexing starts at 0, so the third element is at index 2. There it is—the product card for the subwoofer!

![Highlighting a querySelectorAll() result](/assets/images/devtools-hover-queryselectorall-b2c49b9d01f9bf3a25ee797b0e652896.png)

To save the subwoofer in a variable for further inspection, we can use index access with brackets, just like with regular JavaScript arrays:


```
products = document.querySelectorAll('.product-item');
subwoofer = products[2];
```


Even though we're just playing in the browser's **Console**, we're inching closer to figuring out what our Node.js program will need to do. In the next lesson, we'll dive into accessing child elements and extracting product details.

## Exercises

These challenges are here to help you test what you’ve learned in this lesson. Try to resist the urge to peek at the solutions right away. Remember, the best learning happens when you dive in and do it yourself!

Real world

You're about to touch the real web, which is practical and exciting! But websites change, so some exercises might break. If you run into any issues, please leave a comment below or https://github.com/apify/apify-docs/issues.

### Locate headings on Wikipedia's Main Page

On English Wikipedia's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page, use CSS selectors in the **Console** to list the HTML elements representing headings of the colored boxes (including the grey ones).

![Wikipedia\&#39;s Main Page headings](/assets/images/devtools-exercise-wikipedia-5d47de5c50985ec7cc87b3a220f9d14c.png)

Solution

1. Open the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page.
2. Activate the element selection tool in your DevTools.
3. Click on several headings to examine the markup.
4. Notice that all headings are `h2` elements with the `mp-h2` class.
5. In the **Console**, execute `document.querySelectorAll('h2')`.
6. At the time of writing, this selector returns 8 headings. Each corresponds to a box, and there are no other `h2` elements on the page. Thus, the selector is sufficient as is.

### Locate products on Shein

Go to Shein's https://shein.com/RecommendSelection/Jewelry-Accessories-sc-017291431.html category. In the **Console**, use CSS selectors to list all HTML elements representing the products.

![Products in Shein\&#39;s Jewelry \&amp; Accessories category](/assets/images/devtools-exercise-shein-e289fb63ac18c6aa8ea8ed48e6ffd805.png)

Solution

1. Visit the https://shein.com/RecommendSelection/Jewelry-Accessories-sc-017291431.html page. Close any pop-ups or promotions.
2. Activate the element selection tool in your DevTools.
3. Click on the first product to inspect its markup. Repeat with a few others.
4. Observe that all products are `section` elements with multiple classes, including `product-card`.
5. Since `section` is a generic wrapper, focus on the `product-card` class.
6. In the **Console**, execute `document.querySelectorAll('.product-card')`.
7. At the time of writing, this selector returns 120 results, all representing products. No further narrowing is necessary.

### Locate articles on Guardian

Go to Guardian's https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone. Use the **Console** to find all HTML elements representing the articles.

Need a nudge?

Learn about the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator.

![Articles on Guardian\&#39;s page about F1](/assets/images/devtools-exercise-guardian1-f3587204f6314c9a25a1955f94420ebc.png)

Solution

1. Open the https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone.
2. Activate the element selection tool in your DevTools.
3. Click on an article to inspect its structure. Check several articles, including the ones with smaller cards.
4. Note that all articles are `li` elements, but their classes (e.g., `dcr-1qmyfxi`) are dynamically generated and unreliable.
5. Using `document.querySelectorAll('li')` returns too many results, including unrelated items like navigation links.
6. Inspect the page structure. The `main` element contains the primary content, including articles. Use the descendant combinator to target `li` elements within `main`.
7. In the **Console**, execute `document.querySelectorAll('main li')`.
8. At the time of writing, this selector returns 21 results. All appear to represent articles, so the solution works!
