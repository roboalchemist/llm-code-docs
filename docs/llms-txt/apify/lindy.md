# Lindy integration

**Learn how to integrate your Apify Actors with Lindy.**

***

[Lindy](https://www.lindy.ai/) is an AI-powered automation platform that lets you create intelligent workflows and automate complex tasks. By integrating Apify with Lindy, you can leverage Apify's web scraping capabilities within Lindy's AI-driven automation workflows to extract data, monitor websites, and trigger actions based on scraped information.

## Prerequisites

To use the Apify integration with Lindy, you need:

* A Lindy account with access to premium actions (required for certain integrations or higher usage limits).

## How to Run an Apify Actor from Lindy

This section demonstrates how to integrate Apify's data extraction capabilities into Lindy's AI automation.

1. Start a new Lindy workflow by clicking the **+ New Lindy** button.

   Select **Start from scratch** to build a custom workflow.

2. Choose a trigger that will initiate your automation. For this demonstration, we will select **Chat with Lindy/Message received**. This allows you to trigger the Apify Actor simply by sending a message to Lindy.

3. After setting the trigger, select **Perform an Action**.

   In the action search box, search for "Apify" or navigate to the **Scrapers** category and choose **Run Actor**.

4. Configure the Apify "Run Actor" Module. In the Apify "Run Actor" configuration, choose the Actor you want to execute. For example, select the **Instagram profile scraper**.

Actor Availability

You have access to thousands of Actors available on the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store). Please note that Actors using the *rental pricing model* are not available for use with this integration. For details on Actor pricing models, refer to our [Pricing Documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize.md#rental-pricing-model).

This establishes the fundamental workflow:<br />*Chatting with Lindy can now trigger the Apify Instagram Profile Scraper.*

### Extending Your Workflow

Lindy offers different triggers (e.g., *email received*, *Slack message received*, etc.) and actions beyond running an Actor.

After the Apify Actor run is initiated, you can define what happens next, depending on your needs:

* **When Actor Run Starts:**

  * You might want to send a notification.
  * Log the start time.
  * Run a pre-processing step.

* **After Results Are Available:** Once the Apify Actor completes and its results are ready, you can:

  <!-- -->

  * Retrieve the Actor's output data from its dataset.
  * Pass the extracted data to Lindy's AI for summarization, analysis, content generation, or other AI-driven tasks.
  * Route the data to other services (e.g., Google Sheets, databases, email notifications) using Lindy's action modules.

## Available Actions in Lindy for Apify

While Lindy's specific module names may evolve, the core Apify functionalities typically exposed are:

* **Run Actor:** Initiates a specific Apify Actor and can optionally wait for its completion.
