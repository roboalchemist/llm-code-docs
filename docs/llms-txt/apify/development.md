This section will guide you through the whole story of https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors.md development.

You can follow chapters sequentially from https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/quick-start.md, where you learn how to create your first Actor in just a few minutes, through the more technical sections describing the whole Actor model, up to the https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/performance.md section, where you learn how to fine-tune your Actor to get the most out of the Apify platform.

If your Actor allows for integration with external services, or performs some post-processing of datasets generated by other Actors, check out the section https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/actors/integration-ready-actors.md.

After your development, you can jump to the section https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing.md to learn about how to publish your Actor in https://apify.com/store and monetize it by renting it out to users of the platform.
