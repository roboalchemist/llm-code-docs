# Keboola integration

**Integrate your Apify Actors with Keboola, a cloud-based data integration platform that consolidates data from various sources into a centralized storage.**

***

With Apify integration for https://www.keboola.com/, you can extract data from various sources using your Apify Actors and load it into Keboola for further processing, transformation, and integration with other platforms.

The Keboola integration allows you to run your Actors, fetch items from datasets, and retrieve results, all within the Keboola platform.

## Connect Apify with Keboola

To use the Apify integration on Keboola, you will need to:

* Have an https://console.apify.com/.

#### Choose an action

In the next step, you can choose the action you want to perform:

* **Run Actor**: This action runs the selected Actor, waits until it finishes, and then pushes all items from the default dataset to Keboola Storage.
* **Retrieve dataset items from the last Actor run** - This action takes the dataset of a specific Actor's last run.
* **Run Task** - This action runs the selected task, waits until it finishes, and then pushes all items from the default dataset to Keboola Storage.
* **Retrieve items from the last task run** - This action takes the dataset of a specific task last run.
* **Retrieve items from Dataset**: This action takes the dataset ID or dataset name and retrieves all items from that dataset.

## Next steps

With your data now in Keboola, you can integrate it with dozens of other services that Keboola supports. Check out the https://www.keboola.com/product/integrations to explore your options.

You can set up a writer for a selected service using Keboola Writer or create https://help.keboola.com/orchestrator/ to transform, merge, or split your data.

Keboola Helper

In Apify Store, you'll find the https://apify.com/drobnikj/keboola-input-mapping, designed to streamline the integration between Apify and Keboola. This helper Actor parses the input table received from the Apify <> Keboola Data Source and maps the data into the required input format for another task or Actor within the Keboola platform.
