Integrations allow you to combine separate applications and take advantage of their combined capabilities. Automation of these online processes increases your productivity. That's why we made Apify in a way that allows you to connect it with practically any cloud service or web app and make it part of your larger projects.

If you are building a service and your users could benefit from integrating with Apify or vice-versa then read the [integrate with Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/integrate.md).

## Built-in integrations

Apify‘s RESTful API allows you to interact with the platform programmatically. HTTP webhooks notify you and your services when important events happen. By using the API, you can start Actors, retrieve their results, or basically do anything you can do on a platform UI

#### [API](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api.md)

[Control the Apify platform programmatically from your code.](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api.md)

#### [Actors and tasks](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/actors.md)

[Trigger other Actors or tasks when your Actor run fails or succeeds.](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/actors.md)

#### [Webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks.md)

[Trigger external events when your Actor run fails or succeeds.](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks.md)

<br />

Apify offers easy-to-set-up solutions for common scenarios, like uploading your datasets to Google Drive when the run succeeds or creating an issue on GitHub when it fails.

## Data pipelines, ETLs, and AI/LLM tools

The Apify platform integrates with popular ETL and data pipeline services, enabling you to integrate Apify Actors directly into your data integration processes.
