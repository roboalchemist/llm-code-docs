# Docker Not Installed or Running

> This issue can occur if Docker is not installed or if the user is not added to the Docker group. Here's how to troubleshoot:

1. **Check if Docker is installed.** Run the following command:

   ```
   docker info
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```
   Client:
    Context: default
    Debug mode: false
    Servers:
     default:
       Host: localhost
       Engine:
         Version: 20.10.14
         API version: 1.44
         Go version: go1.17.15
         Git commit: 8668127
         Built: Thu Apr 1 06:02:55 2021
         OS/Arch: linux/amd64
         Experimental: false
       Kernel: 5.15.0-52-generic
       Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
       Total Memory: 31.8GiB
       CPUs: 8
   ```

   If you see this output, **Docker is installed,** but the user may not be added to the Docker group.

2. **Check if the user is in the Docker group.** Run the following command:

   ```
   grep -i docker /etc/group
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```
   docker:x:999:root,$USER1,$USER2,etc
   ```

   Verify if your username is listed. If not, add the user to the Docker group:

3. **Add user to the Docker group:**

   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker Michael
   ```

4. **Verify the user is added.** Re-run the group check:

   ```
   grep -i docker /etc/group
   ```

   The output should now include your username, e.g.:

   ```
   docker:x:999:root,michael
   ```

5. **Reboot the server:**
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

6. Once logged back in, **restart Docker**:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

7. If no output is shown when running **docker info**, suggest downloading and [installing Docker properly](/guides/workers/install-on-ubuntu).
