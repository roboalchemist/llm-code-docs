# Device Object Reference

> Defines the structure, attributes, and metrics of a Device within the IO Network. Includes details on hardware specs, network performance, compliance, and job history used for monitoring and rewards calculation.

### Device Object

The **Device Object** represents a compute node within the IO Network, typically a machine or worker running one or more GPUs. It provides the foundational schema for describing devices that contribute compute power to the distributed network.

Each device entry captures details about its hardware, performance metrics, network characteristics, geographic location, and SOC 2 compliance. This object also tracks job-level details such as compute minutes, uptime, and earnings, this allows for transparent performance analytics, availability tracking, and compensation calculation.

***

## Structure Overview

A **Device** includes:

* **Identification** – Unique ID, hardware name, and quantity
* **Performance Metrics** – Uptime, speed, and availability stats
* **Geographic Info** – Location name, ISO code, and country icon
* **Compliance** – SOC 2 certification flag
* **Job History** – Records of compute jobs, earnings, and status
