# Overview

> The R2R Chunks API defines how processed document segments, called chunks, are created, managed, and searched. It provides endpoints for semantic retrieval, knowledge graph extraction, and metadata-driven filtering to power advanced AI and RAG workflows.

A **Chunk** in R2R represents a processed segment of content derived from a parent **Document**. Chunks are the **core unit of retrieval** within the system, serving as the foundation for **semantic search**, **knowledge graph construction**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows.

Each chunk includes the following components:

* **Text content** — the extracted or generated portion of the source document.
* **Metadata** — contextual information such as source, timestamp, or author.
* **Optional vector embeddings** — numerical representations used for similarity search and reasoning.

Chunks are automatically generated during document ingestion and are optimized for:

* Semantic search and retrieval
* Knowledge graph relationship extraction
* Vector similarity comparison
* Metadata-based filtering and organization
