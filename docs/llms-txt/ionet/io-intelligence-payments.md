# Overview

> Overview of io.net’s AI access plans and model rates.

At **io.net**, we believe AI access should be **simple, transparent, and scalable**. Whether you are experimenting with ideas, running daily creative workflows, or deploying large-scale automation.

Our platform connects every capability, this includes **text, images, code, data, and voice**, all in one workspace.

You can start free, upgrade as your usage grows, and scale on demand without worrying about token tracking or hidden fees.

Each plan provides access to the same advanced models and tools. Usage is measured in credits, which refresh automatically. **Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)** is available when you exceed your daily credits quota.

* **Standard (default):** Explore and learn with free, light daily access. **Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)** pricing is applied for usage beyond the daily limit.
* **Professional:** Includes \$15 in monthly usage credits, refreshed daily to provide steady, predictable access for light coding projects and applications.
* **Developer:** Includes \$150 in monthly usage credits, refreshed every 8 hours to support continuous development and production workloads.

## Plan Overview

Each plan includes a **fixed daily or hourly allowance** that refreshes automatically, so you can focus on your work instead of tracking tokens or costs.

| Plan           | Usage                               | Refresh cycle                            | Ideal for                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| *Standard*     | Continuous access with **PAYG**.    | No refreshes, pay only for what you use. | Teams that need flexible scaling.      |
| *Professional* | **\$15** in monthly usage credits.  | Once every 24 hours.                     | Coding projects or light applications. |
| *Developer*    | **\$150** in monthly usage credits. | Every 8 hours (3 x per day).             | Builders, teams, and automations.      |

## How Usage Works

* **Professional** plans refresh once every 24 hours for predictable, worry-free access.
* **Developer** plans refresh every 8 hours, designed for continuous work or API usage.
* If you hit your allowance, your access will pause until the next refresh, unless you have **IO Credits**.
* **IO Credits (Pay-As-You-Go)** allow instant continuation beyond limits, charging per request through your connected payment method.

## More on Pay-As-You-Go

* Billed directly to your **IO Credits** balance.
* Includes the same tools and models as subscription plans.
* The **Developer** plan offers roughly a 10% discount compared to **PAYG** for consistent high-volume users.
* **PAYG** stops when your plan refreshes.
* Enables precise accounting of model-level usage and costs.

<Note>
  To verify the latest model pricing, use the **GET /models** API endpoint. The response includes detailed pricing information for each available model. The fields `"input_token_price"` and `"output_token_price"` represent the respective costs per token for input and output usage. For implementation details and the full endpoint specification, refer to: [**GET /models API Documentation**](/reference/ai-models/get-models-list)**.**

## FAQs

<Accordion title="What do I do when I hit my daily limit?" icon="comment-question">
  You can buy **IO Credits** or wait for your daily limit to refresh.\
  If you already have credits, they will automatically cover additional usage with no interruptions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the limit work across different models?" icon="comment-question">
  ***IO Intelligence*** uses a **shared credit pool system**.\
  Credits can be spent on any model, with each consuming credits at a different rate depending on the complexity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does my daily limit include both Chat and API calls?" icon="comment-question">
  Yes. **Chat**  interactions count toward your API quota and contribute to your daily limit.
