# Overview

> The R2R Users API manages authenticated entities, enabling secure access, permissions, and collaboration. It provides endpoints for user details, collection membership, limits, and administrative control to support reliable identity management.

A **User** in R2R represents an **authenticated entity** that can interact with the platform. Users are the foundation of R2R’s **access control system**, enabling granular permission management, content organization, and activity tracking through collections and system-level privileges.

Users serve as the primary link between human operators and the R2R platform, managing ownership, collaboration, and administrative functions across all resources.

### Key Capabilities

Users in R2R provide:

* **Authentication and authorization** to ensure secure system access.
* **Collection membership management** for organizing and sharing content.
* **Activity tracking and analytics** for monitoring user behavior and engagement.
* **Metadata customization** to enrich user profiles and associated data.
* **Superuser capabilities** for managing system-wide configurations and administrative tasks.
