## Understanding the Attestation Report

### Nonce Verification

The nonce prevents replay attacks. Always:

1. Generate a **unique, random nonce** for each attestation request
2. Verify the returned nonce **starts with** what you sent (it gets padded to 64 hex characters)
3. Never reuse nonces

```python  theme={null}
import secrets

# Generate fresh nonce
nonce = secrets.token_hex(16)  # 32 character hex string

# After receiving attestation - nonce is padded with zeros to 64 chars
# e.g., "87ebbef3ceb69d2d6d7edc1b05c42ad900000000000000000000000000000000"
assert attestation["nonce"].startswith(nonce), "Nonce mismatch - possible replay attack!"
```

### GPU Attestation Report

The `gpu` field contains NVIDIA's hardware attestation:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "gpu": {
    "nonce": "87ebbef3ceb69d2d6d7edc1b05c42ad900000000000000000000000000000000",
    "arch": "HOPPER",
    "evidence_list": [
      {
        "evidence": "<base64-encoded attestation evidence>",
        "certificate": "<base64-encoded certificate chain to NVIDIA root>"
      }
    ],
    "claims_version": "3.0"
  }
}
```

This proves:

* The GPU is a genuine NVIDIA device (architecture identified, e.g., "HOPPER")
* The GPU is running in Confidential Computing mode
* The GPU's firmware and configuration are in a known-good state
* Multiple GPUs may have multiple evidence entries in `evidence_list`

**Verification:**

Use NVIDIA's attestation API to verify the GPU evidence list:

* [NVIDIA Multi-GPU Attestation API](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/attestation/reference/attestmultigpu)
* Submit the `evidence_list` from the attestation response
* The API validates the certificate chain and returns verification status

### CPU Attestation Report

The `cpu` field (when present) contains CPU-level attestation:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "cpu": {
    "quote": "<hex-encoded CPU attestation quote>"
  }
}
```

This proves:

* The CPU is running in a Trusted Execution Environment (AMD SEV-SNP or Intel TDX)
* The VM's memory is encrypted and isolated from the host

**Verification:**

Use the proof verifier to verify the CPU attestation quote:

* [t16z Proof Verifier](https://proof.t16z.com/)
* Submit the `cpu.quote` from the attestation response
* The verifier validates the quote against Intel TDX attestation

### Image Digest

The `image_digest` field contains the SHA256 hash of the container image running in the TEE:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "image_digest": "sha256:cf47db862b96b243e077a80ee51afa2c007604bf3c648232d42144947e56c339"
}
```

This allows you to verify that the expected code is running inside the TEE.

**Verification:** Compare the `image_digest` with the expected digest published in the [latest official release](https://github.com/ionet-official/attestation-agent/releases). If the digests match, you can be confident the running container hasn't been tampered with.

### Signing Address

The `signing_address` is the Ethereum-style public address the attested machine will use to sign inference responses:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "signing_address": "0xf52373547CAa0EeCB0fcD34042D7518E79aA80cC"
}
```

This key is generated inside the TEE and its binding to the attestation report proves that:

* Only the attested machine holds the private key
* Responses signed with this key came from the attested hardware

## Verifying Response Signatures

Every confidential inference response includes signature headers:

| Header            | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`            | The content that was signed (typically the response body) |
| `signature`       | Cryptographic signature over `text`                       |
| `signing_address` | Public key that created the signature                     |
| `signing_algo`    | Signing algorithm (e.g., ecdsa)                           |
| `image_digest`    | SHA256 hash of the container image running in the TEE     |

### Verification Steps

1. **Verify signing address matches attestation**

```python  theme={null}
assert response_headers["signing_address"].lower() == \
       attestation["signing_address"].lower(), \
       "Signing address mismatch!"
```

2. **Verify the cryptographic signature**

For `ecdsa` signatures (Ethereum-style):

```python  theme={null}
from eth_account.messages import encode_defunct
from eth_account import Account

def verify_ecdsa_signature(text: str, signature: str, expected_address: str) -> bool:
    """Verify an Ethereum-style signature."""
    message = encode_defunct(text=text)
    recovered_address = Account.recover_message(message, signature=signature)
    return recovered_address.lower() == expected_address.lower()

# Verify
is_valid = verify_ecdsa_signature(
    text=response_headers["text"],
    signature=response_headers["signature"],
    expected_address=attestation["signing_address"]
)

if not is_valid:
    raise SecurityError("Response signature verification failed!")
```

3. **Verify content integrity**

Ensure the signed `text` matches the response you received:

```python  theme={null}
import json

# For non-streaming responses, verify the signed text matches the response
response_body = response.json()
signed_text = response_headers["text"]

# The exact format of signed_text depends on implementation
# Typically it's the JSON response body or a hash of it
```

## Troubleshooting

### Nonce Mismatch

**Symptom:** Returned nonce doesn't start with the one you sent.

**Cause:** Possible replay attack, caching issue, or request routing error.

**Note:** The returned nonce is padded with zeros to 64 hex characters. For example, if you send `87ebbef3ceb69d2d6d7edc1b05c42ad9`, you'll receive `87ebbef3ceb69d2d6d7edc1b05c42ad900000000000000000000000000000000`.

**Solution:** Use `startswith()` for comparison instead of exact match. Generate a new nonce and retry if verification fails. If persistent, contact support.

### Signature Verification Fails

**Symptom:** Cryptographic signature doesn't verify.

**Possible Causes:**

* Response was modified in transit
* Encoding mismatch in signed text
* Wrong signing algorithm used for verification

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you're using the correct signing algorithm from the header
2. Verify the `text` header encoding matches what you're verifying
3. Check for any proxy or middleware that might modify responses

### Signing Address Mismatch

**Symptom:** Response `signing_address` doesn't match attestation.

**Possible Causes:**

* Attestation expired and machine rotated keys
* Request was routed to a different machine

**Solution:** Re-request attestation before inference. Attestation should be refreshed periodically.
