# Overview

> The R2R Collections API enables structured organization, sharing, and access control for documents and their related chunks. It provides endpoints to create, manage, and collaborate on collections, supporting team workflows, permission management, and intelligent content organization.

A **Collection** in R2R is a **logical grouping mechanism** that organizes and manages access to documents and their associated chunks. Collections serve as the **core organizational unit** for content management, access control, and collaboration across users and teams.

They provide a structured way to categorize documents, enforce permissions, and enable seamless sharing and processing of related data within the R2R ecosystem.

### Key Capabilities

Collections in R2R enable:

* **Organizational structure** for managing documents.
* **Access control and permission management** for secure data governance.
* **Group-based content sharing** across teams or users.
* **Document categorization** for better organization and retrieval.
* **User collaboration** for joint access and workflow execution.
