# Overview

> The R2R Conversations API enables threaded, context-aware exchanges between users or AI agents. It offers endpoints to create, manage, and update conversations and messages, supporting branching dialogue, metadata attachment, and message history tracking.

A **Conversation** in R2R represents a **threaded exchange of messages** that can **branch into multiple paths**, allowing for dynamic, structured dialogue management. Conversations help maintain **context**, preserve **message history**, and support **branching discussions** for more flexible interactions across users, agents, or systems.

They form the foundation for managing dialogue flows and conversational AI interactions within R2R.

### Key Capabilities

Conversations in R2R provide:

* **Threaded message management** for organized discussions.
* **Message editing** with full history preservation for version tracking.
* **Metadata attachment** to enrich messages with contextual details.
* **Context maintenance** across dialogue turns and branches.
