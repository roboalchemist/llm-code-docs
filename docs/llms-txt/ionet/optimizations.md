# Optimizations

> Explore Kubernetes optimizations on io.net Cloud, including Kubernetes control plane design, minimal GPU cluster sizing, and master node scheduling best practices.

This section explains several infrastructure design decisions and provides guidance on how to optimize your Kubernetes cluster for performance and reliability.

## Control Plane Architecture

By default, a Kubernetes cluster is provisioned with **three CPU-only master (control plane) nodes** running in a **separate cloud environment** from your worker nodes.

### Why this design was chosen?

This architecture enables two key benefits:

* **Minimum cluster size of one GPU VM:** You can create a functional Kubernetes cluster with just a single GPU Virtual Machine, avoiding the cost of running multiple GPU nodes purely for control plane redundancy.
* **Improved fault tolerance without extra GPU cost:** Running three dedicated CPU-only master nodes provides higher availability for the control plane without requiring two or more expensive GPU VMs per cluster.

## Untainted Master Nodes

By default, **master nodes are not tainted**. This means Kubernetes may schedule your workloads (pods) onto master nodes in the control plane cloud.

### Why master nodes are not tainted by default

* Reduce cluster creation time
* Allow clusters to become usable immediately without additional configuration.

## Avoid Running Pods on Master Nodes

Running application pods on master nodes can lead to several issues, such as:

* **Risk to control plane stability:** Application workloads may interfere with critical Kubernetes components responsible for scheduling, networking, and cluster orchestration.
* **Increased latency:** Because master nodes run in a separate cloud, communication between services may experience higher latency when one service runs on a master node and another runs on a worker node.

## Recommended Optimisation - Taint Master Nodes

To prevent pods from being scheduled on master nodes, apply a taint to all control plane nodes.

Run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
kubectl taint nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=:NoSchedule
```

### What this does

* Prevents application pods from being scheduled on master nodes.
* Ensures master nodes are reserved exclusively for control plane workloads.
* Improves performance isolation and overall cluster reliability.
