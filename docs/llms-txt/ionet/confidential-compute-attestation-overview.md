# Confidential Compute Attestation

> Learn what confidential compute attestation is and how it can be utilized to verify secure workloads on io.net Cloud. Explore Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), GPU verification, and hardware-based security for sensitive compute.

## Overview

[io.net](http://io.net) provisioned *Confidential Compute VMs* are equipped with NVIDIA H200 GPUs featuring hardware-based confidential computing capabilities. This guide shows you how to verify that your GPUs are genuine NVIDIA hardware with confidential computing features properly enabled.

### Key Takeaways

* Understand why GPU verification is essential for confidential computing.
* Learn how to confirm GPU authenticity using cryptographic attestation.
* Follow clear, step-by-step instructions to run verification on your VM.

### Prerequisites

* SSH access to your Confidential Compute VM
* Python 3.7 or later (pre-installed on your VM)
* Basic command line understanding
* 5 minutes to perform the initial set up

## Why does GPU verification matter?

### Trust, but Verify

When running sensitive workloads on **Confidential Computing (CC)** infrastructure, it is not enough to rely on a provider’s assurances. You need **cryptographic proof** that the hardware is authentic, correctly configured, and operating in a secure state.

GPU attestation provides independent verification that:

* **The GPUs are genuine NVIDIA hardware** - not counterfeit, emulated, or misrepresented.
* **Firmware is intact and unmodified** - ensuring no tampering with GPU software or drivers.
* **Confidential computing features are enabled** - confirming that CC mode is active and functioning properly.
* **Hardware measurements match expected “golden” values** - validating that the GPU’s state aligns with NVIDIA’s reference integrity manifests.

### Security and Compliance

GPU attestation is a foundational security mechanism for confidential computing environments. It helps ensure:

* **Zero-trust architecture** - trust no component by default, verify every claim cryptographically.
* **Regulatory and compliance adherence** - meet requirements that mandate hardware verification.
* **Data protection** - guarantee that sensitive workloads run only on validated, trustworthy hardware.
* **Clear auditability** - produce cryptographic evidence for stakeholders, security teams, and auditors.

### How It Works

Attestation relies on **cryptographic proofs** that cannot be falsified, forged or altered. The verification process follows a clear chain of checks:

```
Your VM → Collect GPU Evidence → Verify Certificates
                                → Check Measurements
                                → Validate Signatures
                                → Result: Verified or Check Failed
```

**What gets verified:**

During attestation, the following elements are validated:

* **A four-level GPU certificate chain**, traced back to the NVIDIA Root Certificate Authority.
* **Certificate revocation status**, checked via OCSP to ensure no certificates have been revoked.
* **Driver firmware measurements**, consisting of 64 SHA-384 cryptographic hashes.
* **VBIOS firmware measurements**, consisting of 64 SHA-384 cryptographic hashes.
* **Digital signatures on all attestation evidence**, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

## What is GPU Attestation?

### Cryptographic Proof of Authenticity

GPU attestation is a cryptographic verification process rooted in **hardware-based trust**. It provides verifiable proof that a GPU is authentic, securely configured, and operating in a trusted state. Specifically, it validates four core properties:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Hardware Authenticity">
    Every NVIDIA GPU that supports Confidential Computing includes:

    * A **unique hardware identity** permanently embedded in silicon during manufacturing.
    * A **certificate chain** signed by NVIDIA’s Root Certificate Authority.
    * **Cryptographic keys** stored in tamper-resistant hardware.

    **What this proves:**\
    The GPU is genuine NVIDIA hardware, produced by NVIDIA, and not counterfeit or emulated.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="2. Firmware Integrity">
    During attestation, the system:

    * Measures all GPU firmware using **SHA-384 cryptographic hashes.**
    * Compares measurements against NVIDIA’s **Reference Integrity Manifests (RIMs)**.
    * Verifies the **digital signatures** on the RIM files.

    **What this proves:**\
    The GPU firmware has not been modified, tampered with, or compromised.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="3. Configuration State">
    The verification process confirms that:

    * **Confidential Computing (CC)** is enabled.
    * **Protected PCIe (PPCIE)** is correctly configured.
    * The GPU is operating in the **expected secure state**.

    <Note>
      In this context, **CC** refers to the general concept of **Confidential Compute**, where the GPU operates in a secure, protected environment. This is different from **CC mode** (also referred to as `CC State`), which is a specific configuration within the GPU.

      `CC State` cannot be enabled at the same time as **PPCIe**, the two modes are mutually exclusive.

      `CC State` specifically refers to scenarios where a single GPU (or multiple GPUs that are **NOT** NVLink-connected) is passed through directly to a virtual machine.
    </Note>

    **What this proves:**\
    Confidential Computing features are actively enabled and functioning, not merely claimed.

    <Accordion title="Further Reading on CC and PPCIe">
      **How CC and Protected PCIe (PPCIe) Work Together**

      GPU confidentiality is controlled through **two independent mechanisms**:

      * **CC (Confidential Compute / CC State)**
      * **PPCIe (Protected PCIe)**

      These settings determine *how* and *which* GPUs operate in confidential mode. Each GPU can have CC and PPCIe enabled or disabled independently, but only certain combinations are valid.

      * **CC = OFF, PPCIe = OFF**\
        No confidential computing is enabled.
      * **CC = ON, PPCIe = OFF**\
        Only a subset of GPUs is confidential. This mode is **NOT compatible with NVLink-connected GPUs**.
      * **CC = OFF, PPCIe = ON**\
        The **entire GPU set in the server, including NVLink connected GPUs**, operate in confidential mode.

        <Note>
          *This is the configuration used in our recommended setup.*
        </Note>
      * **CC = ON, PPCIe = ON**\
        This is an invalid configuration. The virtual machine will either fail to boot or the CUDA drivers will not load.
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="4. Freshness">
    Attestation uses a **nonce** (a cryptographic challenge) to:

    * Prevent replay attacks.
    * Ensure the evidence is current, not reused or pre-recorded.
    * Confirm that measurements reflect the GPU’s **current state**.

    **What this proves:**\
    The attestation is happening in real time on this specific GPU.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this the same verification NVIDIA uses?" icon="comment-question">
    **Yes.** This verification process uses:

    * The official NVIDIA Python SDK (`nv-attestation-sdk`).
    * The same verification logic used by NVIDIA enterprise customers.
    * Reference Integrity Manifests and certificate chains served directly by NVIDIA.
    * Industry-standard cryptographic validation mechanisms.

    This is not a third-party tool. It is NVIDIA’s official, production-grade attestation solution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What exactly is verified?" icon="comment-question">
    The verification process validates the following components:

    **Hardware**

    * The GPU is genuine NVIDIA hardware, verified through a certificate chain to the NVIDIA Root Certificate Authority.
    * The hardware identity matches the issued certificates.
    * Certificates have not been revoked, as verified through OCSP.

    **Firmware**

    * Driver firmware measurements (64 SHA-384 cryptographic hashes).
    * VBIOS firmware measurements (64 SHA-384 cryptographic hashes).
    * Measurements match NVIDIA’s reference “golden” RIM values.
    * All firmware and measurement signatures are cryptographically valid.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can verification results be falsified?" icon="comment-question">
    **No.** Verification is based on strong cryptographic guarantees, including:

    * A **hardware root of trust**, with cryptographic keys embedded in tamper-resistant silicon.
    * **Certificate chains** signed by NVIDIA’s Root Certificate Authority, protected by NVIDIA’s private keys.
    * **Cryptographic signatures** that cannot be forged without NVIDIA’s private keys.
    * **Fresh nonces** that prevent replay of previously captured attestation results.

    Even if the operating system is fully compromised, an attacker cannot:

    * Forge NVIDIA’s digital signatures.
    * Create certificates that successfully validate against the NVIDIA Root CA.
    * Modify firmware measurements without detection.
    * Bypass the hardware root of trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does verification not prove?" icon="comment-question">
    GPU attestation verifies GPU authenticity and configuration, but it DOES NOT validate:

    * Hypervisor security or configuration.
    * Host operating system security.
    * Network isolation between virtual machines.
    * Physical datacenter security.
    * Guest operating system security within the VM.

    **For comprehensive protection:**\
    GPU attestation should be used as part of a defense-in-depth security strategy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I verify the verification tool itself?" icon="comment-question">
    The verification tooling can be independently validated through the following means:

    1. **Official NVIDIA package distribution:** Published on PyPI

       ```bash  theme={null}
       pip show nv-attestation-sdk
       # Displays: nv-attestation-sdk 2.6.3
       ```
    2. **Open-source implementation:** Publicly available for review

       Repository: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvtrust](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvtrust)
    3. **Package signing:** Signed and distributed by NVIDIA

       ```bash  theme={null}
       pip show --verbose nv-attestation-sdk
       ```
    4. **Checksum verification:** Validate package integrity

       ```bash  theme={null}
       pip hash nv-attestation-sdk
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the CC State show as OFF when I check my onboarded node?" icon="comment-question">
    This is expected for nodes with **NVLink-connected GPUs**. CC State is only used when individual GPUs (or non-NVLink GPUs) are passed into a VM. Because NVLink-connected GPUs must be passed through **as a complete set**, CC State remains `OFF`.

    For these nodes, confidentiality is provided through **Protected PCIe**, not `CC State`. You can confirm this by checking:

    * `Multi-GPU Mode: Protected PCIe` → GPUs are running in confidential mode.
    * `CPU CC Capabilities: INTEL TDX` → CPU is running in confidential mode.
