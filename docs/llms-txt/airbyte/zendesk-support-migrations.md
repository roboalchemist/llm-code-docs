## Upgrading to 5.0.0[​](#upgrading-to-500 "Direct link to Upgrading to 5.0.0")

This version adds OAuth2.0 with refresh token support. Users who authenticate via OAuth must re-authenticate to use the new flow with rotating refresh tokens.

### What changed[​](#what-changed "Direct link to What changed")

The OAuth authentication flow has been updated to support Zendesk's new grant-type tokens with rotating refresh tokens. The legacy OAuth2.0 option has been renamed to "OAuth2.0 (Legacy)" and a new "OAuth2.0 with Refresh Token" option has been added.

### Why this change is required[​](#why-this-change-is-required "Direct link to Why this change is required")

Zendesk announced support for OAuth refresh token grant type on April 30, 2025. According to [Zendesk's announcement](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9182123625370-Announcing-support-for-OAuth-refresh-token-grant-type-and-OAuth-access-and-refresh-token-expirations), all customers are required to adopt the OAuth refresh token flow by April 30, 2026. This connector update ensures compatibility with Zendesk's new authentication requirements.

### Migration steps[​](#migration-steps "Direct link to Migration steps")

1. Go to your Zendesk Support connection settings in Airbyte
2. If you are using OAuth authentication, you will need to re-authenticate
3. Select "OAuth2.0 with Refresh Token" as the authentication method
4. Complete the OAuth flow to authorize the connector

### Connector upgrade guide[​](#connector-upgrade-guide "Direct link to Connector upgrade guide")

Review the following information to prepare for and execute your upgrade.

### Review the changelog[​](#review-the-changelog "Direct link to Review the changelog")

Before updating a connector, review the changelog to understand the changes and their potential impact on your existing connections. Find the changelog for any connector by navigating to the bottom of the documentation for that connector. Major version releases also include a migration guide.

### Plan for major updates[​](#plan-for-major-updates "Direct link to Plan for major updates")

Major updates may require you to adjust connection settings or even make changes to your data pipelines. Allocate enough time and resources for this. Use the migration guide to ensure your transition process goes smoothly.

Airbyte provides tooling that guarantees safe connector version bumps and enforces automated version bumps for minor and patch updates. You always need to manually update for major version bumps.

### Self-managed plans: pin a specific version if you can't update[​](#self-managed-plans-pin-a-specific-version-if-you-cant-update "Direct link to Self-managed plans: pin a specific version if you can't update")

If you're unable to upgrade to the new version of a connector, you can pin that connector to a specific version.
