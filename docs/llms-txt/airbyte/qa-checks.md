# Airbyte connectors QA checks

Copy Page

This document is listing all the static-analysis checks that are performed on the Airbyte connectors. These checks are running in our CI/CD pipeline and are used to ensure a connector is following the best practices and is respecting the Airbyte standards. Meeting these standards means that the connector will be able to be safely integrated into the Airbyte platform and released to registries (DockerHub, Pypi etc.). You can consider these checks as a set of guidelines to follow when developing a connector. They are by no mean replacing the need for a manual review of the connector codebase and the implementation of good test suites.

## 📄 Documentation[​](#-documentation "Direct link to 📄 Documentation")

When a breaking change is introduced, we check that a migration guide is available. It should be stored under `./docs/integrations/<connector-type>s/<connector-name>-migrations.md`. This document should contain a section for each breaking change, in order of the version descending. It must explain users which action to take to migrate to the new version. See the Breaking Changes Policy for full requirements: <https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/connector-development/connector-breaking-changes>

### Connectors must have user facing documentation[​](#connectors-must-have-user-facing-documentation "Direct link to Connectors must have user facing documentation")

*Applies to the following connector types: source* *Applies to the following connector languages: python, low-code* *Applies to connector with any support level* *Applies to connector with 300 internal support level* *Applies to connector with any Airbyte usage level*

The user facing connector documentation should update invalid links in connector documentation. For links that are used as example and return 404 status code, use `example: `before link to skip it.

This check expects the following order of headers in the documentation:

```

```

List of not required headers, which can be not exist in the documentation and their strict check will be skipped:

* Set up the CONNECTOR\_NAME\_FROM\_METADATA connector in Airbyte

* For Airbyte Cloud: (as subtitle of Set up CONNECTOR\_NAME\_FROM\_METADATA)

* For Airbyte Open Source: (as subtitle of Set up CONNECTOR\_NAME\_FROM\_METADATA)
