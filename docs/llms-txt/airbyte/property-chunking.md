# Property chunking

Copy Page

Property chunking enables connectors to handle APIs with limitations on the number of properties that you can fetch per request. This feature breaks down large property lists into smaller, manageable chunks and merges the results back into complete records. Some connectors require this capability to work with APIs that have property limits.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Property chunking works in these steps.

1. Fetching the complete list of properties (either statically defined or dynamically from an API endpoint)

2. Splitting properties into chunks based on configured limits

3. Making separate API requests for each chunk

4. Merging the results back into complete records using a merge strategy, like combining sets of property values into a single record according to their primary key ID

### `GroupByKeyMergeStrategy`[​](#groupbykeymergestrategy "Direct link to groupbykeymergestrategy")

GroupByKeyMergeStrategy:
  title: Group by Key
  description: Record merge strategy that combines records according to fields on the record.

        - "id"
        - ["parent_id", "end_date"]
    $parameters:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: true
```

## Property limit types[​](#property-limit-types "Direct link to Property limit types")

### Characters[​](#characters "Direct link to Characters")

When using `characters` as the limit type, the total character count of all property names (including delimiters) determines chunk size.

### Property count[​](#property-count "Direct link to Property count")

When using `property_count` as the limit type, the number of individual properties determines chunk size.

## Record merging[​](#record-merging "Direct link to Record merging")

When the connector needs multiple requests to fetch all properties for a record, it must merge the results back together. The `GroupByKeyMergeStrategy` combines records based on a specified key field.

### Simple key merging[​](#simple-key-merging "Direct link to Simple key merging")

For records with a single unique identifier.

manifest.yaml

```
record_merge_strategy:
  type: GroupByKeyMergeStrategy
  key: "id"
```

### Compound key merging[​](#compound-key-merging "Direct link to Compound key merging")

For records requiring multiple fields to create a unique identifier.

manifest.yaml

```
record_merge_strategy:
  type: GroupByKeyMergeStrategy
  key: ["parent_id", "end_date"]
```

## Always include properties[​](#always-include-properties "Direct link to Always include properties")

Some properties must be in every chunk request, typically because they're needed for record merging or API requirements. These properties are automatically added to each chunk and don't count toward the property limit.

manifest.yaml

```
always_include_properties:
  - dateRange
  - pivotValues
```

## Usage examples[​](#usage-examples "Direct link to Usage examples")

Here are examples of how Airbyte has used property chunking in some connectors.

### HubSpot: fetching properties from an API endpoint with character-based chunking[​](#hubspot-fetching-properties-from-an-api-endpoint-with-character-based-chunking "Direct link to HubSpot: fetching properties from an API endpoint with character-based chunking")

Airbyte's HubSpot connector uses dynamic property chunking. Instead of specifying a static list of properties, it makes a request to `https://api.hubapi.com/properties/v2/contacts/properties` to determine the list of properties.

manifest.yaml

```
request_parameters:
  properties:
    type: QueryProperties
    property_list:
      type: PropertiesFromEndpoint
      property_field_path: ["name"]
      retriever:
        type: SimpleRetriever
        requester:
          type: HttpRequester
          url_base: "https://api.hubapi.com"
          path: "/properties/v2/contacts/properties"
          http_method: "GET"
        record_selector:
          type: RecordSelector
          extractor:
            type: DpathExtractor
            field_path: []
    property_chunking:
      type: PropertyChunking
      property_limit_type: characters
      property_limit: 15000
```

### LinkedIn Ads: Property count chunking[​](#linkedin-ads-property-count-chunking "Direct link to LinkedIn Ads: Property count chunking")

LinkedIn Ads' API limits the number of properties you can request per call. Airbyte's connector provides a static list of properties and makes a series of requests that always includes `dateRange` and `pivotValues`, then merges responses into a single record using the end date and the pivot values.

manifest.yaml

```

    type: QueryProperties
