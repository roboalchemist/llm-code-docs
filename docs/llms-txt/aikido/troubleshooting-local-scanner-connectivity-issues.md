# Troubleshooting Local Scanner connectivity issues

This guide helps customers run the Aikido Local Scanner behind corporate proxies, custom SSL inspection, or locked-down networks. It covers when and how to use `--enable-proxy` and `--ca-bundle`, which domains to whitelist, and how to fix common certificate errors.

To function correctly, the Local Scanner must be able to access the following domains over HTTPS (port 443): `*.aikido.dev`

#### Using `--enable-proxy`

The scanner does **not** use the system proxy by default. To send all HTTPS traffic through your corporate proxy, you must:

1. **Enable proxy support** with the `--enable-proxy` flag.
2. **Set the proxy URL** via the `HTTPS_PROXY` (or `https_proxy`) environment variable.

#### Using `--ca-bundle` (custom root CAs)

When your proxy or firewall performs **SSL inspection**, it typically replaces the server’s certificate with one signed by an **internal/corporate CA**.

Use **`--ca-bundle`** to point the scanner at a **PEM file** that contains your corporate root CA certificate(s) (and optionally intermediate CAs). The scanner will then trust those CAs when connecting through the proxy.

1. **Get your corporate CA certificate** (e.g. from your IT team or export from the machine’s trust store). It must be in **PEM** format.
2. **Pass it to the scanner** via `--ca-bundle` or the `AIKIDO_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable.
