# Java/Scala/Kotlin Projects Using Gradle: Security Scanning Best Practices

Aikido can find known vulnerabilities (CVE) in your Java dependencies as well as dangerous licenses being used by those dependencies.

How does Aikido find those dependencies and their transitive subdependencies?

Out of the box, Aikido supports the following files for scanning:

* gradle.lockfile
* pom.xml
* .jar/.war/.ear

It should be noted that build.gradle.\* (Gradle manifest) files might not contain exact versions for some of your dependencies. This can cause Aikido to not find the full range of risks in your application.

It's recommended to use Gradle lockfiles that contain an exact version for each dependency as well as the subdependencies.

There are other reasons to use lockfiles besides making security scanning easier for Aikido:

* Using a lockfile protects you against supply chain attacks via malicious packages. This kind of attack is becoming more popular
* Using a lockfiles makes your build more predictable as everyone is using the exact same minor version of packages. Less chance of 'works on my machine'
* Faster build times: no need for dependency resolution anymore

## How to start using lockfiles in your Gradle project? <a href="#how-to-start-using-lockfiles-in-your-gradle-project" id="how-to-start-using-lockfiles-in-your-gradle-project"></a>

There are two ways to get a lockfile into your repo:

**Option 1: Let Aikido create it for you (recommended)**

If your repository contains a `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` without a corresponding `gradle.lockfile`, Aikido detects this automatically and **can open a pull request** to generate it for you. *Note:* [*AutoFix*](https://help.aikido.dev/aikido-autofix/overview-aikido-autofix) *needs to be enabled for this option.*

**Step 1.** Go to the respective repository that is missing the lockfile

**Step 2.** Look for the lockfile suggestion on top and click **Create PR**<br>

**Step 3.** Review and merge the PR — Aikido will handle the rest

Once merged, Aikido will immediately be able to scan your full dependency tree, including all transitive dependencies.

**Option 2: Add it manually**

Add the required configuration to your Gradle manifest files — see the [Gradle lockfile documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html#ex-locking-all-configurations) for the exact lines to add.

Then run:

```
gradle dependencies --write-locks
```

Commit the generated lockfile to your repository. Treat it like a `package-lock.json` in Node.js — never edit it manually.
