## Installing <!-- -->dbt-greenplum

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-greenplum`

## Configuring <!-- -->dbt-greenplum<!-- -->

For <!-- -->Greenplum<!-- -->-specific configuration, please refer to [Greenplum<!-- --> configs.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/greenplum-configs.md)

For further (and more likely up-to-date) info, see the [README](https://github.com/markporoshin/dbt-greenplum#README.md)

## Profile Configuration[​](#profile-configuration "Direct link to Profile Configuration")

### Notes[​](#notes "Direct link to Notes")

This adapter strongly depends on dbt-postgres, so you can read more about configurations here [Profile Setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/postgres-setup.md)
