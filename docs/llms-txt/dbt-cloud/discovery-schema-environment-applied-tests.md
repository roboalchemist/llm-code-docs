# Tests object schema

[Tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests.md) are assertions you make about your models and other resources in your dbt project. When you run `dbt test`, dbt will tell you if each test in your project passes or fails. You can query tests through the Discovery API to understand information about them.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `tests` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Arguments[​](#arguments "Direct link to Arguments")

### Example query[​](#example-query "Direct link to Example query")

query {
  environment(id: 834) {
    applied {
      tests(
        filter: {
          testTypes: [
            GENERIC_DATA_TEST,
            SINGULAR_DATA_TEST,
            UNIT_TEST
          ]
        }, 
        first: 100
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            model
            description
            expect
            resourceType
            testType
            given
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
