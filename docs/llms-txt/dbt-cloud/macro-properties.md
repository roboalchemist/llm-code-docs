# Macro properties

Macro properties can be declared in any `properties.yml` file. Macro properties<!-- --> are "special properties" in that you can't configure them in the `dbt_project.yml` file or using `config()` blocks. Refer to [Configs and properties](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/define-properties#which-properties-are-not-also-configs) for more info.

You can name these files `whatever_you_want.yml` and nest them arbitrarily deep in sub-folders.

macros/\<filename>.yml

```yml

macros:
  - name: <macro name>
    description: <markdown_string>
    config:
      docs:
        show: true | false
      meta: {<dictionary>}
    arguments:
      - name: <arg name>
        type: <string>
        description: <markdown_string>
      - ... # declare properties of additional arguments

  - name: ... # declare properties of additional macros
```
