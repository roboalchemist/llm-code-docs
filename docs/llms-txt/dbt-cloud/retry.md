# About dbt retry command

`dbt retry` re-executes the last `dbt` command from the node point of failure.

* If no nodes are executed before the failure (for example, if a run failed early due to a warehouse connection or permission errors), `dbt retry` won't run anything since there's no recorded nodes to retry from.
* In these cases, we recommend checking your [`run_results.json` file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json.md) and manually re-running the full job so the nodes build.
* Once some nodes have run, you can use `dbt retry` to re-execute from any new point of failure.
* If the previously executed command completed successfully, `dbt retry` will finish as `no operation`.

Retry works with the following commands:

* [`build`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/build.md)
* [`compile`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/compile.md)
* [`clone`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/clone.md)
* [`docs generate`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs.md#dbt-docs-generate)
* [`seed`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/seed.md)
* [`snapshot`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/build.md)
* [`test`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/test.md)
* [`run`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run.md)
* [`run-operation`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run-operation.md)

`dbt retry` references [run\_results.json](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json.md) to determine where to start. Executing `dbt retry` without correcting the previous failures will garner idempotent results.

`dbt retry` reuses the [selectors](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors.md) from the previously executed command.

Example results of executing `dbt retry` after a successful `dbt run`:

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models
 
Nothing to do. Try checking your model configs and model specification args
```

Example of when `dbt run` encounters a syntax error in a model:

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models

Concurrency: 24 threads (target='dev')

4 of 5 ERROR creating sql table model main.customers ........................... [ERROR in 0.03s]
5 of 5 OK created sql table model main.orders .................................. [OK in 0.04s]
 
Finished running 3 view models, 2 table models in 0 hours 0 minutes and 0.15 seconds (0.15s).
  
Completed with 1 error and 0 warnings:
  
Runtime Error in model customers (models/customers.sql)
 Parser Error: syntax error at or near "selct"

Done. PASS=4 WARN=0 ERROR=1 SKIP=0 TOTAL=5
```

Example of a subsequent failed `dbt retry` run without fixing the error(s):

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models

Concurrency: 24 threads (target='dev')

1 of 1 START sql table model main.customers .................................... [RUN]
1 of 1 ERROR creating sql table model main.customers ........................... [ERROR in 0.03s]

Done. PASS=4 WARN=0 ERROR=1 SKIP=0 TOTAL=5
```

Example of a successful `dbt retry` run after fixing error(s):

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models
 
Concurrency: 24 threads (target='dev')

1 of 1 START sql table model main.customers .................................... [RUN]
1 of 1 OK created sql table model main.customers ............................... [OK in 0.05s]

Finished running 1 table model in 0 hours 0 minutes and 0.09 seconds (0.09s).
 
Completed successfully
  
Done. PASS=1 WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
```

In each scenario `dbt retry` picks up from the error rather than running all of the upstream dependencies again.
