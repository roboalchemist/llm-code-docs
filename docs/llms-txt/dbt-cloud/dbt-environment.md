# About dbt environment command

info

The dbt platform CLI provides the `dbt environment` command for environment and connection details. If you're using Fusion or dbt Core, use `dbt debug` to inspect profile, target, and connection — or use `dbtf debug` if you have more than one dbt CLI and want to inspect Fusion.

The `dbt environment` command enables you to interact with your dbt environment. Use the command for:

* Viewing your local configuration details (account ID, active project ID, deployment environment, and more).
* Viewing your dbt configuration details (environment ID, environment name, connection type, and more).

This guide lists all the commands and options you can use with `dbt environment` in the [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation.md). To use them, add a command or option like this: `dbt environment [command]` or use the shorthand `dbt env [command]`.
