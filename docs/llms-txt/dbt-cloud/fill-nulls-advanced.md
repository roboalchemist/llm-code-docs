# Fill null values for metrics

Understanding and implementing strategies to fill null values in metrics is key for accurate analytics. This guide explains `fill_nulls_with` and `join_to_timespine` to ensure data completeness, helping end users make more informed decisions and enhancing your dbt workflows.

### About null values[​](#about-null-values "Direct link to About null values")

You can use `fill_nulls_with` to replace null values in metrics with a value like zero (or your chosen integer). This ensures every data row shows a numeric value.

This guide explains how to ensure there are no null values in your metrics:

* Use `fill_nulls_with` for `simple`, `cumulative`, and `conversion` metrics
* Use `join_to_timespine` and `fill_nulls_with` together for derived and ratio metrics to avoid null values appearing.

### Fill null values for simple metrics[​](#fill-null-values-for-simple-metrics "Direct link to Fill null values for simple metrics")

For example, if you'd like to handle days with site visits but no leads, you can use `fill_nulls_with` to set the value for leads to zero on days when there are no conversions.

Let's say you have three metrics:

* `website_visits` and `leads`
* and a derived metric called `leads_to_website_visit` that calculates the ratio of leads to site visits.

The `website_visits` and `leads` metrics have the following data:

| metric\_time | website\_visits |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 2024-01-01   | 50              |
| 2024-01-02   | 37              |
| 2024-01-03   | 79              |

| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

| metric\_time | leads |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 2024-01-01   | 5     |
| 2024-01-03   | 8     |

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

* Note that there is no data for `2024-01-02` in the `leads` metric.

Although there are no days without visits, there are days without leads. After applying `fill_nulls_with: 0` to the `leads` metric, querying these metrics together shows zero for leads on days with no conversions:

| metric\_time | website\_visits | leads |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----- |
| 2024-01-01   | 50              | 5     |
| 2024-01-02   | 37              | 0     |
| 2024-01-03   | 79              | 8     |

| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

### Use join\_to\_timespine for derived and ratio metrics[​](#use-join_to_timespine-for-derived-and-ratio-metrics "Direct link to Use join_to_timespine for derived and ratio metrics")

### Fill null values for derived and ratio metrics[​](#fill-null-values-for-derived-and-ratio-metrics "Direct link to Fill null values for derived and ratio metrics")

To fill null values for derived and ratio metrics, you can link them with a time spine to ensure daily data coverage. As mentioned in [the previous section](#use-join_to_timespine-for-derived-and-ratio-metrics), this is because `derived` and `ratio` metrics take *metrics* as inputs<!-- -->.

For example, the following structure leaves nulls in the final results (`leads_to_website_visit` column) because `COALESCE` isn't applied at the third outer rendering layer for the final metric calculation in `derived` metrics:

| metric\_time | website\_visits | leads | leads\_to\_website\_visit |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----- | ------------------------- |
| 2024-01-01   | 50              | 5     | .1                        |
| 2024-01-02   | 37              | 0     | null                      |
| 2024-01-03   | 79              | 8     | .1                        |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

To display a zero value for `leads_to_website_visit` for `2024-01-02`, you would join the `leads` metric to a time spine model to ensure a value for each day. You can do this by adding `join_to_timespine` to the <!-- -->in the `leads` metric configuration:

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

Once you do this, if you query the `leads` metric after the timespine join, there will be a record for each day and any null values will get filled with zero.

| metric\_time | leads | leads\_to\_website\_visit |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------- |
| 2024-01-01   | 5     | .1                        |
| 2024-01-02   | 0     | 0                         |
| 2024-01-03   | 8     | .1                        |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

Now, if you combine the metrics in a `derived` metric, there will be a zero value for `leads_to_website_visit` on `2024-01-02` and the final result set will not have any null values.
