# I'm receiving an 'Your IDE session experienced an unknown error and was terminated. Please contact support'.

If you're seeing the following error when you launch the Studio IDE, it could be due to a few scenarios but, commonly, it indicates a missing repository:

```shell

Your <Constant name="cloud_ide" /> session experienced an unknown error and was terminated. Please contact support.
```

You can try to resolve this by adding a repository like a [managed repository](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/managed-repository.md) or your preferred Git account. To add your Git account, navigate to **Project** > **Repository** and select your repository.
