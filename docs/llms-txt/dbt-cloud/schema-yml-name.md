# Does my \`.yml\` file containing tests and descriptions need to be named \`schema.yml\`?

No! You can name this file whatever you want (including `whatever_you_want.yml`), so long as:

* The file is in your `models/` directory¹
* The file has `.yml` extension

Check out the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties.md) for more information.

¹If you're declaring properties for seeds, snapshots, or macros, you can also place this file in the related directory — `seeds/`, `snapshots/` and `macros/` respectively.
