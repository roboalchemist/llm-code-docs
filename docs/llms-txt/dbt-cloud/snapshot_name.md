# snapshot\_name

## Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

The name of a snapshot, which is used when selecting from a snapshot using the [`ref` function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref.md)

This name must not conflict with the name of any other "refable" resource (models, seeds, other snapshots) defined in this project or package.

The name does not need to match the file name. As a result, snapshot filenames do not need to be unique.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Name a snapshot `order_snapshot`[​](#name-a-snapshot-order_snapshot "Direct link to name-a-snapshot-order_snapshot")

<!-- -->

To select from this snapshot in a downstream model:

```sql
select * from {{ ref('orders_snapshot') }}
```
