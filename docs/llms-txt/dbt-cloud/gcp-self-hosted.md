# Configuring GCP Private Service Connect for a self-hosted service [Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

<!-- -->

Available to certain Enterprise tiers

The private connection feature is available on the following dbt Enterprise tiers:

* Business Critical
* Virtual Private

To learn more about these tiers, contact us at <sales@getdbt.com>.

GCP Private Service Connect (PSC) enables secure, private connectivity between dbt and your self-hosted services. These services may include version control systems (VCS), data warehouses, or any other applications you manage. With PSC, you do not need to expose your service to the public internet. All communication occurs over a private network, significantly enhancing security. For more details, refer to the GCP [Private Service Connect documentation](https://cloud.google.com/private-service-connect).

## What this guide covers[​](#what-this-guide-covers "Direct link to What this guide covers")

The focus of this guide is not on any particular service or [Backend](#terminology) architecture, but on the [Service Attachment](#terminology) that interconnects dbt with your self-hosted service. This attachment process should be standard across most use cases.

[![The scope of this guide](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/gcp-self-hosted-psc/scope-of-guide.png?v=2 "The scope of this guide")](#)The scope of this guide

Out of scope

This guide does not cover the configuration or troubleshooting of your self-hosted service, load balancer, or backend health, due to the virtually limitless ways these environments can be configured. While dbt Support may assist with such issues on a best-effort basis, we recommend engaging [Google Cloud Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) to expedite resolution.

## Audience[​](#audience "Direct link to Audience")

This guide is intended for cloud network administrators or engineers responsible for configuring and maintaining secure network communications within your organization's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.

## Terminology[​](#terminology "Direct link to Terminology")

This guide uses several important terms related to Private Service Connect. Understanding these definitions helps ensure successful implementation. For a more detailed explanation of these concepts, refer to the [GCP Private Service Connect documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect#managed-services).

* **Consumer:** In this context, the Consumer is dbt, which establishes the PSC connection as the client.
* **Published Service:** The service you are exposing via PSC to the dbt platform, such as your version control system (VCS), data warehouse, or another application.
* **Service Attachment:** Refers to the resource that is shared with consumer(s) of your Published Service, so that they can establish endpoints to it.
* **Backend:** Can also be referred to as Network Endpoint Groups (NEGs). This is the particular architecture that your service is running on. For example, this may be VMs, GKE Instance Groups, or even on-prem IPs.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before you begin, make sure to review the following requirements:

1. **Supported Load Balancer Types**

   dbt has officially validated Private Service Connect (PSC) functionality with the following load balancer types:

   * Regional Internal Proxy Load Balancer

   * Cross-Regional Internal Proxy Load Balancer

   > While other load balancer types can be compatible with PSC Service Attachments, this guide assumes your service is configured behind one of the officially supported Proxy Load Balancers. For more details, see the [Proxy Load Balancers documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp/internal-proxy).

2. **Service Health**

   * Confirm that your service or application is operational and healthy behind the designated load balancer before proceeding.

3. **dbt GCP Project ID**

   * Contact [dbt Support](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/getting-help.md#dbt-cloud-support) to obtain the dbt GCP project ID. You will need this in order to share your service attachment with the dbt platform.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If the Private Service Connect endpoint has been provisioned and configured in dbt but connectivity is still failing, check the following in your networking setup to ensure requests and responses can be successfully routed between dbt and your service.

### Configuration checklist[​](#configuration-checklist "Direct link to Configuration checklist")

1. **Service Attachment status**

   In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **Network services** → **Private Service Connect** → **Published services**. Select your Service Attachment and verify:

   * Status is **Active**
   * dbt's project appears in the **Connected projects** list with status **Accepted**

2. **Load balancer backend health**

   Navigate to **Network services** → **Load balancing** and select your load balancer. Check the **Backend services** tab to confirm at least one backend is **Healthy**. Unhealthy backends could indicate the service is down or that firewall rules are blocking health check probes.

3. **NAT subnet configuration**

   Verify the Private Service Connect subnet has sufficient IP addresses available. GCP uses these IPs for SNAT when routing consumer traffic to your backends.

4. **Firewall rules**

   Ensure your VPC firewall rules allow:

   * Health check traffic from Google's health check ranges (`35.191.0.0/16` and `130.211.0.0/22`)
   * Traffic from the proxy-only subnet to your backends (for Proxy Load Balancers)

   For more details, see [Firewall rules for health checks](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#ip-ranges).

### Monitoring[​](#monitoring "Direct link to Monitoring")

To help isolate connection issues, use Google Cloud's monitoring tools:

#### Service Attachment metrics[​](#service-attachment-metrics "Direct link to Service Attachment metrics")

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **Monitoring** → **Metrics Explorer**. Search for Private Service Connect metrics:

* `compute.googleapis.com/nat/nat_connections` — Tracks active NAT connections
* `compute.googleapis.com/nat/sent_bytes_count` — Confirms traffic is flowing

#### Load Balancer logs[​](#load-balancer-logs "Direct link to Load Balancer logs")

Enable logging on your load balancer's backend service to capture request details. Navigate to your backend service, click **Edit**, and enable **Logging** with a sample rate of 1.0 for troubleshooting.

For more information, see [Private Service Connect monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/monitor-private-service-connect-connections) and [Load Balancer logging](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/https-logging-monitoring).
