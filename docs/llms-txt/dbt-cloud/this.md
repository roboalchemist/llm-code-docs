# about this

`this` is the database representation of the current model. It is useful when:

* Defining a `where` statement within [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models.md)
* Using [pre or post hooks](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook.md)

`this` is a [Relation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-classes.md#relation), and as such, properties such as `{{ this.database }}` and `{{ this.schema }}` compile as expected.

* Note — Prior to dbt v1.6,
  <!-- -->
  returns `request` as the result of `{{ ref.identifier }}`.

`this` can be thought of as equivalent to `ref('<the_current_model>')`, and is a neat way to avoid circular dependencies.

{% if is_incremental() %}
  where event_time > (select max(event_time) from {{ this }})
