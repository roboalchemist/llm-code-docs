# About schemas variable

`schemas` is a variable available in an `on-run-end` hook, representing a list of schemas that dbt built objects in on this run.

If you do not use [custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas.md), `schemas` will evaluate to your target schema, e.g. `['dbt_alice']`. If you use custom schemas, it will include these as well, e.g. `['dbt_alice', 'dbt_alice_marketing', 'dbt_alice_finance']`.

The `schemas` variable is useful for granting privileges to all schemas that dbt builds relations in, like so (note this is Redshift specific syntax):

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
...

on-run-end:
  - "{% for schema in schemas%}grant usage on schema {{ schema }} to group reporter;{% endfor%}"
  - "{% for schema in schemas %}grant select on all tables in schema {{ schema }} to group reporter;{% endfor%}"
  - "{% for schema in schemas %}alter default privileges in schema {{ schema }}  grant select on tables to group reporter;{% endfor %}"
```
