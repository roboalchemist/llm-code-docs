# Conversion metrics

Conversion metrics let you measure how often one event leads to another for a specific entity within a defined time window.

For example, you can track how often a user (entity) who visits your site (base event) makes a purchase (conversion event) within 7 days (time window). To set this up, you’ll specify both the time range and the entity that links/joins the two events.

Conversion metrics are different from [ratio metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/ratio.md) because you need to include an entity in the pre-aggregated join.

## Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

The specification for conversion metrics is as follows:

Refer to [additional settings](#additional-settings) to learn how to customize conversion metrics with settings for null values, calculation type, and constant properties.

The following code example displays the complete specification for conversion metrics and details how they're applied:

## Conversion metric example[​](#conversion-metric-example "Direct link to Conversion metric example")

The following example will measure conversions from website visits (`VISITS` table) to order completions (`BUYS` table) and calculate a conversion metric for this scenario step by step.

Suppose you have two semantic models, `VISITS` and `BUYS`:

* The `VISITS` table represents visits to an e-commerce site.
* The `BUYS` table represents someone completing an order on that site.

The underlying tables look like the following:

`VISITS`<br />Contains user visits with `USER_ID` and `REFERRER_ID`.

| DS         | USER\_ID | REFERRER\_ID |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 2020-01-01 | bob      | facebook     |
| 2020-01-04 | bob      | google       |
| 2020-01-07 | bob      | amazon       |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

`BUYS`<br />Records completed orders with `USER_ID` and `REFERRER_ID`.

| DS         | USER\_ID | REFERRER\_ID |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 2020-01-02 | bob      | facebook     |
| 2020-01-07 | bob      | amazon       |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

Next, define a conversion metric as follows:

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

To calculate the conversion, link the `BUYS` event to the nearest `VISITS` event (or closest base event). The following steps explain this process in more detail:

### Step 1: Join `VISITS` and `BUYS`[​](#step-1-join-visits-and-buys "Direct link to step-1-join-visits-and-buys")

This step joins the `BUYS` table to the `VISITS` table and gets all combinations of visits-buys events that match the join condition where buys occur within 7 days of the visit (any rows that have the same user and a buy happened at most 7 days after the visit).

The SQL generated in these steps looks like the following:

```sql
select
  v.ds,
  v.user_id,
  v.referrer_id,
  b.ds,
  b.uuid,
  1 as buys
from visits v
inner join (
    select *, uuid_string() as uuid from buys -- Adds a uuid column to uniquely identify the different rows
) b
on
v.user_id = b.user_id and v.ds <= b.ds and v.ds > b.ds - interval '7 days'
```

The dataset returns the following (note that there are two potential conversion events for the first visit):

| V.DS       | V.USER\_ID | V.REFERRER\_ID | B.DS       | UUID  | BUYS |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob        | facebook       | 2020-01-02 | uuid1 | 1    |
| 2020-01-01 | bob        | facebook       | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |
| 2020-01-04 | bob        | google         | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |
| 2020-01-07 | bob        | amazon         | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

### Step 2: Refine with window function[​](#step-2-refine-with-window-function "Direct link to Step 2: Refine with window function")

Instead of returning the raw visit values, use window functions to link conversions to the closest base event. You can partition by the conversion source and get the `first_value` ordered by `visit ds`, descending to get the closest base event from the conversion event:

```sql
select
  first_value(v.ds) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as v_ds,
  first_value(v.user_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as user_id,
  first_value(v.referrer_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as referrer_id,
  b.ds,
  b.uuid,
  1 as buys
from visits v
inner join (
    select *, uuid_string() as uuid from buys
) b
on
v.user_id = b.user_id and v.ds <= b.ds and v.ds > b.ds - interval '7 day'
```

The dataset returns the following:

| V.DS       | V.USER\_ID | V.REFERRER\_ID | B.DS       | UUID  | BUYS |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob        | facebook       | 2020-01-02 | uuid1 | 1    |
| 2020-01-07 | bob        | amazon         | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |
| 2020-01-07 | bob        | amazon         | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |
| 2020-01-07 | bob        | amazon         | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

This workflow links the two conversions to the correct visit events. Due to the join, you end up with multiple combinations, leading to fanout results. After applying the window function, duplicates appear.

To resolve this and eliminate duplicates, use a distinct select. The UUID also helps identify which conversion is unique. The next steps provide more detail on how to do this.

### Step 3: Remove duplicates[​](#step-3-remove-duplicates "Direct link to Step 3: Remove duplicates")

Instead of regular select used in the [Step 2](#step-2-refine-with-window-function), use a distinct select to remove the duplicates:

```sql
select distinct
  first_value(v.ds) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as v_ds,
  first_value(v.user_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as user_id,
  first_value(v.referrer_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as referrer_id,
  b.ds,
  b.uuid,
  1 as buys
from visits v
inner join (
    select *, uuid_string() as uuid from buys
) b
on
v.user_id = b.user_id and v.ds <= b.ds and v.ds > b.ds - interval '7 day';
```

The dataset returns the following:

| V.DS       | V.USER\_ID | V.REFERRER\_ID | B.DS       | UUID  | BUYS |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob        | facebook       | 2020-01-02 | uuid1 | 1    |
| 2020-01-07 | bob        | amazon         | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1    |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

You now have a dataset where every conversion is connected to a visit event. To proceed:

1. Sum up the total conversions in the "conversions" table.
2. Combine this table with the "opportunities" table, matching them based on group keys.
3. Calculate the conversion rate.

### Step 4: Aggregate and calculate[​](#step-4-aggregate-and-calculate "Direct link to Step 4: Aggregate and calculate")

Now that you’ve tied each conversion event to a visit, you can calculate the aggregated conversions and opportunities <!-- -->. Then, you can join them to calculate the actual conversion rate. The SQL to calculate the conversion rate is as follows:

```sql
select
  coalesce(subq_3.metric_time__day, subq_13.metric_time__day) as metric_time__day,
  cast(max(subq_13.buys) as double) / cast(nullif(max(subq_3.visits), 0) as double) as visit_to_buy_conversion_rate_7d
from ( -- base
  select
    metric_time__day,
    sum(visits) as visits
  from (
    select
      date_trunc('day', first_contact_date) as metric_time__day,
      1 as visits
    from visits
  ) subq_2
  group by
    metric_time__day
) subq_3
full outer join ( -- conversion
  select
    metric_time__day,
    sum(buys) as buys
  from (
    -- ...
    -- The output of this subquery is the table produced in Step 3. The SQL is hidden for legibility.
    -- To see the full SQL output, add --explain to your conversion metric query. 
  ) subq_10
  group by
    metric_time__day
) subq_13
on
  subq_3.metric_time__day = subq_13.metric_time__day
group by
  metric_time__day
```

### Additional settings[​](#additional-settings "Direct link to Additional settings")

Use the following additional settings to customize your conversion metrics:

* **Null conversion values:** Set null conversions to zero using `fill_nulls_with`. Refer to [Fill null values for metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/fill-nulls-advanced.md) for more info.
* **Calculation type:** Choose between showing raw conversions or conversion rate.
* **Constant property:** Add conditions for specific scenarios to join conversions on constant properties.

- Set null conversion events to zero
- Set calculation type parameter
- Set constant property

To return zero in the final data set, you can set the value of a null conversion event to zero instead of null. You can add the `fill_nulls_with` parameter to your conversion metric definition like this:

This will return the following results:

[![Conversion metric with fill nulls with parameter](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/conversion-metrics-fill-null.png?v=2 "Conversion metric with fill nulls with parameter")](#)Conversion metric with fill nulls with parameter

Refer to [Fill null values for metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/fill-nulls-advanced.md) for more info.

Use the conversion calculation parameter to either show the raw number of conversions or the conversion rate. The default value is the conversion rate.

You can change the default to display the number of conversions by setting the `calculation: conversion` parameter:

*Refer to [Amplitude's blog posts on constant properties](https://amplitude.com/blog/holding-constant) to learn about this concept.*

You can add a constant property to a conversion metric to count only those conversions where a specific dimension or entity matches in both the base and conversion events.

For example, if you're at an e-commerce company and want to answer the following question:

* *How often did visitors convert from `View Item Details` to `Complete Purchase` with the same product in each step?*
  <br />
  * This question is tricky to answer because users could have completed these two conversion milestones across many products. For example, they may have viewed a pair of shoes, then a T-shirt, and eventually checked out with a bow tie. This would still count as a conversion, even though the conversion event only happened for the bow tie.

Back to the initial questions, you want to see how many customers viewed an item detail page and then completed a purchase for the *same* product.

In this case, you want to set `product_id` as the constant property. You can specify this in the configs as follows:

You will add an additional condition to the join to make sure the constant property is the same across conversions.

```sql
select distinct
  first_value(v.ds) over (partition by buy_source.ds, buy_source.user_id, buy_source.session_id order by v.ds desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as ds,
  first_value(v.user_id) over (partition by buy_source.ds, buy_source.user_id, buy_source.session_id order by v.ds desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as user_id,
  first_value(v.referrer_id) over (partition by buy_source.ds, buy_source.user_id, buy_source.session_id order by v.ds desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as referrer_id,
  buy_source.uuid,
  1 as buys
from {{ source_schema }}.fct_view_item_details v
inner join
  (
    select *, {{ generate_random_uuid() }} as uuid from {{ source_schema }}.fct_purchases
  ) buy_source
on
  v.user_id = buy_source.user_id
  and v.ds <= buy_source.ds
  and v.ds > buy_source.ds - interval '7 day'
  and buy_source.product_id = v.product_id --Joining on the constant property product_id
```
