Visualize and orchestrate downstream exposures in dbt to automatically generate exposures from dashboards and proactively refresh the underlying data sources (like Tableau extracts) during scheduled dbt jobs.

The following table summarizes the differences between visualizing and orchestrating downstream exposures:

| Info              | Set up and visualize downstream exposures                                          | Orchestrate downstream exposures [Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles") |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Automatically brings downstream assets into your dbt lineage.                      | Proactively refreshes the underlying data sources during scheduled dbt jobs.                                                                                               |
| Benefits          | Provides visibility into data flow and dependencies.                               | Ensures BI tools always have up-to-date data without manual intervention.                                                                                                  |
| Location          | Exposed in dbt [Catalog](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects.md) | Exposed in [dbt scheduler](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deployments.md)                                                                                             |
| Supported BI tool | Tableau                                                                            | Tableau                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Use case          | Helps users understand how models are used and reduces incidents.                  | Optimizes timeliness and reduces costs by running models when needed.                                                                                                      |
