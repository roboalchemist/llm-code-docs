## What to know before upgrading[​](#what-to-know-before-upgrading "Direct link to What to know before upgrading")

We are committed to providing backward compatibility for all versions 1.x. If you encounter an error upon upgrading, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/new).

There are three changes in dbt Core v1.3 that may require action from some users:

1. If you have a `profiles.yml` file located in the root directory where you run dbt, dbt will start preferring that profiles file over the default location on your machine. [You can read more details here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/profiles.yml.md#advanced-customizing-a-profile-directory).
2. If you already have `.py` files defined in the `model-paths` of your dbt project, dbt will start trying to read them as Python models. You can use [the new `.dbtignore` file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbtignore.md) to tell dbt to ignore those files.
3. If you have custom code accessing the `raw_sql` property of models (with the [model](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/model.md) or [graph](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/graph.md) objects), it has been renamed to `raw_code`. This is a change to the manifest contract, described in more detail below.

### For users of dbt Metrics[​](#for-users-of-dbt-metrics "Direct link to For users of dbt Metrics")

The names of metric properties have changed, with backward compatibility. Those changes are:

* Renamed `type` to `calculation_method`
* Renamed `sql` to `expression`
* Renamed `expression` calculation method metrics to `derived` calculation method metrics

We plan to keep backward compatibility for a full minor version. Defining metrics with the old names will raise an error in dbt Core v1.4.

### For consumers of dbt artifacts (metadata)[​](#for-consumers-of-dbt-artifacts-metadata "Direct link to For consumers of dbt artifacts (metadata)")

We have updated the manifest schema version to `v7`. This includes the changes to metrics described above and a few other changes related to the addition of Python models:

* Renamed `raw_sql` to `raw_code`
* Renamed `compiled_sql` to `compiled_code`
* A new top-level node property, `language` (`'sql'` or `'python'`)

For users of [state-based selection](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax.md#about-node-selection): This release includes logic providing backward and forward compatibility for older manifest versions. While running dbt Core v1.3, it should be possible to use `state:modified --state ...` selection against a manifest produced by dbt Core v1.0 and higher.

## New and changed documentation[​](#new-and-changed-documentation "Direct link to New and changed documentation")

* **[Python models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models.md)** are natively supported in `dbt-core` for the first time, on data warehouses that support Python runtimes.

* Updates made to **[Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/build-metrics-intro.md)** reflect their new syntax for definition, as well as additional properties that are now available.

* Plus, a few related updates to **[exposure properties](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/exposure-properties.md)**: `config`, `label`, and `name` validation.

* **[Custom `node_color`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/docs.md)** in `dbt-docs`. For the first time, you can control the colors displayed in dbt's DAG. Want bronze, silver, and gold layers? It's at your fingertips.

* **[`Profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/profiles.yml.md#advanced-customizing-a-profile-directory)** search order now looks in the current working directory before `~/.dbt`.

### Quick hits[​](#quick-hits "Direct link to Quick hits")

* **["Full refresh"](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/full_refresh.md)** flag supports a short name, `-f`.
* **[The "config" selection method](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/methods.md#config)** supports boolean and list config values, in addition to strings.
* Two new dbt-Jinja context variables for accessing invocation metadata: [`invocation_args_dict`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/flags.md#invocation_args_dict) and [`dbt_metadata_envs`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var.md#custom-metadata).
