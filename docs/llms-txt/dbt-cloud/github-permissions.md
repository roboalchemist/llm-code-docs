# I'm seeing a 'GitHub and dbt latest permissions' error

If you see the error `This account needs to accept the latest permissions for the dbt GitHub App` in dbt — this usually occurs when the permissions for the dbt GitHub App are out-of-date.

To solve this issue, you'll need to update the permissions for the dbt GitHub App in your GitHub account. This FAQ shares a couple of ways you can do it.

## Update permissions[​](#update-permissions "Direct link to Update permissions")

A GitHub organization admin will need to update the permissions in GitHub for the dbt GitHub App. If you're not the admin, reach out to your organization admin to request this.

1. Navigate to your GitHub account. Click on the top right profile icon and then **Settings** (or personal if using a non-organization account).

2. Then go to **Integrations** and then select **Applications** to identify any necessary permission changes. Note that a GitHub repository admin may not see the same permission request.

3. Click on **Review request** and then click on the **Accept new permissions** button on the next page.
