## What to know before upgrading[​](#what-to-know-before-upgrading "Direct link to What to know before upgrading")

dbt Core major version 1.0 includes a number of breaking changes! Wherever possible, we have offered backwards compatibility for old behavior, and (where necessary) made migration simple.

### Renamed fields in `dbt_project.yml`[​](#renamed-fields-in-dbt_projectyml "Direct link to renamed-fields-in-dbt_projectyml")

**These affect everyone:**

* [model-paths](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/model-paths.md) have replaced `source-paths` in `dbt-project.yml`.
* [seed-paths](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/seed-paths.md) have replaced `data-paths` in `dbt-project.yml` with a default value of `seeds`.
* The [packages-install-path](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/packages-install-path.md) was updated from `modules-path`. Additionally the default value is now `dbt_packages` instead of `dbt_modules`. You may need to update this value in [`clean-targets`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/clean-targets.md).
* Default for `quote_columns` is now `True` for all adapters other than Snowflake.

**These probably don't:**

* The default value of [test-paths](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/test-paths.md) has been updated to be the plural `tests`.
* The default value of [analysis-paths](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/analysis-paths.md) has been updated to be the plural `analyses`.

### Tests[​](#tests "Direct link to Tests")

The two **test types** are now "singular" and "generic" (instead of "data" and "schema", respectively). The `test_type:` selection method accepts `test_type:singular` and `test_type:generic`. (It will also accept `test_type:schema` and `test_type:data` for backwards compatibility.) **Not backwards compatible:** The `--data` and `--schema` flags to dbt test are no longer supported, and tests no longer have the tags `'data'` and `'schema'` automatically applied. Updated docs: [data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests.md), [test selection](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/test-selection-examples.md), [selection methods](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/methods.md).

The `greedy` flag/property has been renamed to **`indirect_selection`**, which is now eager by default. **Note:** This reverts test selection to its pre-v0.20 behavior by default. `dbt test -s my_model` *will* select multi-parent tests, such as `relationships`, that depend on unselected resources. To achieve the behavior change in v0.20 + v0.21, set `--indirect-selection=cautious` on the CLI or `indirect_selection: cautious` in YAML selectors. Updated docs: [test selection examples](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/test-selection-examples.md), [yaml selectors](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors.md).

### Global macros[​](#global-macros "Direct link to Global macros")

Global project macros have been reorganized, and some old unused macros have been removed: `column_list`, `column_list_for_create_table`, `incremental_upsert`. This is unlikely to affect your project.

### Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

* [Installation docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms.md) reflects adapter-specific installations
* `python -m pip install dbt` is no longer supported, and will raise an explicit error. Install the specific adapter plugin you need as `python -m pip install dbt-<adapter>`.
* `brew install dbt` is no longer supported. Install the specific adapter plugin you need (among Postgres, Redshift, Snowflake, or BigQuery) as `brew install dbt-<adapter>`.
* Removed official support for python 3.6, which is reaching end of life on December 23, 2021

### For users of adapter plugins[​](#for-users-of-adapter-plugins "Direct link to For users of adapter plugins")

* **BigQuery:** Support for ingestion-time-partitioned tables has been officially deprecated in favor of modern approaches. Use `partition_by` and incremental modeling strategies instead. For more information, refer to [Incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models.md).

### For maintainers of plugins + other integrations[​](#for-maintainers-of-plugins--other-integrations "Direct link to For maintainers of plugins + other integrations")

We've introduced a new [**structured event interface**](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/events-logging.md), and we've transitioned all dbt logging to use this new system. **This includes a breaking change for adapter plugins**, requiring a very simple migration. For more details, see the [`events` module README](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/HEAD/core/dbt/events/README.md#adapter-maintainers). If you maintain a different kind of plugin that *needs* legacy logging, for the time being, you can re-enable it with an env var (`DBT_ENABLE_LEGACY_LOGGER=True`); be advised that we will remove this capability in a future version of dbt Core.

The [**dbt RPC Server**](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/rpc.md) has been split out from `dbt-core` and is now packaged separately. Its functionality will be fully deprecated by the end of 2022, in favor of a new dbt Server. Instead of `dbt rpc`, use `dbt-rpc serve`.

**Artifacts:** New schemas (manifest v4, run results v4, sources v3). Notable changes: add `metrics` nodes; schema test + data test nodes are renamed to generic test + singular test nodes; freshness threshold default values look slightly different.

### Deprecations from long ago[​](#deprecations-from-long-ago "Direct link to Deprecations from long ago")

Several under-the-hood changes from past minor versions, tagged with deprecation warnings, have now been fully deprecated.

* The `packages` argument of [dispatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch.md) has been deprecated and will raise an exception when used.
* The "adapter\_macro" macro has been deprecated. Instead, use the [dispatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch.md) method to find a macro and call the result.
* The `release` arg has been removed from the `execute_macro` method.

## New features and changed documentation[​](#new-features-and-changed-documentation "Direct link to New features and changed documentation")

* Add [metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/build-metrics-intro.md), a new node type
* [Generic tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests.md) can be defined in `tests/generic` (new), in addition to `macros/` (as before)
* [Parsing](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/parsing.md): partial parsing and static parsing have been turned on by default.
* [Global configs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs.md) have been standardized. Related updates to [global CLI flags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs.md) and [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/profiles.yml.md).
* [The `init` command](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/init.md) has a whole new look and feel. It's no longer just for first-time users.
* Add `result:<status>` subselectors for smarter reruns when dbt models have errors and tests fail. See examples: [Pro-tips for Workflows](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/best-practice-workflows.md#pro-tips-for-workflows)
* Secret-prefixed [env vars](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var.md) are now allowed only in `profiles.yml` + `packages.yml`
