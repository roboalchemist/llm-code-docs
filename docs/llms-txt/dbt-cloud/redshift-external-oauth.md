note

This feature is currently only available for Okta and Entra ID identity providers.

dbt Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans support OAuth authentication with external providers. When **External OAuth** is enabled, users can authorize their Development credentials using single sign-on (SSO) via the identity provider (IdP). External OAuth authorizes users to access multiple applications, including dbt, without sharing their static credentials with the service. This makes the process of authenticating for development environments easier for the user and provides an additional layer of security to your dbt account.

## Getting started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting started")

The process of setting up external OAuth will require a little bit of back-and-forth between your dbt, IdP, and data warehouse accounts, and having them open in multiple browser tabs will help speed up the configuration process:

* **dbt:** You’ll primarily be working in the **Account settings** —> **Integrations** page. You will need [proper permission](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md) to set up the integration and create the connections.

* **Identity providers:**

  * **Okta:** You’ll be working in multiple areas of the Okta account, but you can start in the **Applications** section. You will need permissions to [create an application](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/custom-admin-role/about-role-permissions.htm#Application_permissions) and an [authorization server](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/custom-admin-role/about-role-permissions.htm#Authorization_server_permissions).
  * **Entra ID** An admin with access to create [Entra ID apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-available-permissions) who is also a user in the data warehouse is required.

* **Data warehouse:**
  * **Redshift:** Create and manage the [Identity Center integration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/integrate-identity-provider-idp-with-amazon-redshift-query-editor-v2-and-sql-client-using-aws-iam-identity-center-for-seamless-single-sign-on/) with your identity provider.

If the admins that handle these products are all different people, it’s better to have them coordinating simultaneously to reduce friction.

Ensure your Amazon admins have completed the [Amazon Identity Center integration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/integrate-identity-provider-idp-with-amazon-redshift-query-editor-v2-and-sql-client-using-aws-iam-identity-center-for-seamless-single-sign-on/) with Okta or Entra ID.

## Identity provider configuration[​](#identity-provider-configuration "Direct link to Identity provider configuration")

1. Navigate back to the dbt **Account settings** —> **Integrations** page you were on at the beginning. It’s time to start filling out all of the fields. There will be some back-and-forth between the Entra ID account and dbt.
2. `Integration name`: Give the integration a descriptive name that includes identifying information about the Entra ID environment so future users won’t have to guess where it belongs.
3. `Client secrets`: Found in the Client ID from the **Certificates and secrets** page. `Value` is the `Client secret`. Note that it only appears when created; *Microsoft hides the secret if you return later, and you must recreate it.*
4. `Client ID`: Copy the’ Application (client) ID’ on the overview page for the client ID app.
5. `Authorization URL` and `Token URL`: From the client ID app, open the `Endpoints` tab. These URLs map to the `OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint (v2)` and `OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)` fields. *You must use v2 of the `OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint`. Do not use V1.* You can use either version of the `OAuth 2.0 token endpoint`.
6. `Application ID URI`: Copy the `Application ID URI` field from the resource server’s Overview screen.

## Configure the Trusted Token Issuer in IAM IdC[​](#configure-the-trusted-token-issuer-in-iam-idc "Direct link to Configure the Trusted Token Issuer in IAM IdC")

A *trusted token issuer* generates an access token that is used to identify a user, and then authenticates that user. This essentially lets services outside of the AWS ecosystem, such as the dbt platform, connect to IAM IdC (and Redshift) with access tokens they have generated or retrieved from an external IdP (Entra ID or Okta).

The following steps are outlined per [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/integrate-tableau-and-microsoft-entra-id-with-amazon-redshift-using-aws-iam-identity-center/):

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to [IAM Identity Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon), and then to the **Settings**.

2. Select the **Authentication** tab and under **Trusted token issuers**, choose **Create trusted token issuer**.

3. On the **Set up an external IdP to issue trusted tokens** page, under **Trusted token issuer details**, do the following:

   <!-- -->

   1. For **Issuer URL**, enter the OIDC discovery URL of the external IdP that will issue tokens for trusted identity propagation. *Include the forward slash at the end of the URL*.

   2. For **Trusted token issuer name**, enter a name to identify this TTI in IAM Identity Center and the application console.

   3. Under Map attributes, do the following:

      <!-- -->

      1. For **Identity provider attribute**, select an attribute from the list to map to an attribute in the Identity Center identity store. You can choose:

      * Email 
      * Object Identifier
      * Subject
      * Other — When using this options with UPN, it's been our experience that `upn` matched up with `Email`.

## Configure Redshift IdC application to utilize TTI[​](#configure-redshift-idc-application-to-utilize-tti "Direct link to Configure Redshift IdC application to utilize TTI")

To start, select **IAM Identity Center connection** from the Amazon Redshift console menu.

[![The AWS Redshift console.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/redshift-idc.png?v=2 "The AWS Redshift console.")](#)The AWS Redshift console.

1. Select the Amazon Redshift application that you created as part of the setup.
2. Select the **Client connections tab** and choose **Edit**.
3. Choose **Yes** under **Configure client connections that use third-party IdPs**.
4. Select the checkbox for **Trusted token issuer** that you created in the previous section.
5. Enter the aud claim value under **Configure selected trusted token issuers**. **This should be the application ID URI you set for the integration in the dbt platform.**

## Finalizing the dbt configuration[​](#finalizing-the-dbt-configuration "Direct link to Finalizing the dbt configuration")

If you have an existing connection, make sure that the OAuth method is set to **External OAuth** and select the integration you created in an earlier step. Otherwise, create a new Redshift connection, being sure to set values for:

* **Server Hostname**
* **OAuth Method**
* **Database name** (this field can be found under the **Optional Settings**)

This connection should be set as the connection for a development environment in an existing or new project.

Once the connection has been assigned to a development environment, you can configure your user credentials for that development environment under `Account Settings > Your Profile > Credentials > <Your Project Name>`. Set the authentication method to `External OAuth`, set the `schema` and other fields if desired, and save the credentials. You can then click the `Connect to Redshift` button.

### Verify connection in Studio[​](#verify-connection-in-studio "Direct link to Verify connection in Studio")

Once your development session has initialized, you can test that you’re able to connect to Redshift using external OAuth by running `dbt debug`.
