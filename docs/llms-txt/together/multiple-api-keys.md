# Multiple API Keys

## Can I create multiple API keys?

Under [Settings](https://api.together.ai/settings/api-keys) you will find a list of all the API keys associated with the account. Here, you can create a new API key, set an API key name and optionally set an expiration date.

<Note>
  Note: new API keys will not be available to copy after creation. Make sure to copy the API key and save it in a secure location.
</Note>

## What is the Together.ai user key?

Every account has a default API key. You can find and copy this key under Manage Account on the dashboard. For the time being, this first API key cannot be revoked. If it is compromised, it can be regenerated. If this happens, no further work is required on your end, all the Together systems will recognize the regenerated API key as the new default API key.

## Can I set limits on a specific API key?

At this point in time, it is not possible to limit usage of a given API key

## How does the playground work with API keys?

The playground recognizes all of the API keys associated with the account. In the playground, the list of My online models will show the models online across all API keys.

## Can I copy my API key after creating it?

New API keys will be shown only after it is created. Be sure to secure your new API key as soon as it is created. User keys, however, will always be available to copy.
