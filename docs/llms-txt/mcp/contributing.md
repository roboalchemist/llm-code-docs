# Contributing to MCP

> How to contribute to the Model Context Protocol project

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open source project that welcomes contributions from the
community. This guide walks you through everything you need to get started.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed and ready:

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** - For cloning repositories and submitting changes
* **[Node.js 24+](https://nodejs.org/)** - Required for building and testing our projects
* **npm** - Comes with Node.js, used for dependency management
* **[GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)** - For submitting pull requests and issues
* **Language-specific tooling** - If contributing to an SDK, you'll need the appropriate
  development environment for that language (e.g., Python, Rust, Go)

Verify your setup:

```bash  theme={null}
node --version  # Should be 24.x or higher
npm --version   # Should be 11.x or higher
git --version   # Any recent version
```

<Note>
  These commands work the same on macOS, Linux, and Windows, so you're good to
  go on any platform.
</Note>

### Repository Structure

MCP spans multiple repositories in the
[`modelcontextprotocol`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) organization on GitHub. Here are
a few notable sub-projects worth checking out:

| Repository                                                                                                  | Contents                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [`modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) | Specification, docs, SEPs |
| [`modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)             | TypeScript/JavaScript SDK |

Throughout this guide, **specification repository** refers to
`modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol`, which contains the protocol spec, this documentation
site, and [Spec Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)](/community/sep-guidelines).

### Project Roles

MCP follows a [governance model](/community/governance) with different levels of responsibility:

* **Contributors** - Anyone who files issues, submits PRs, or participates in discussions (that's
  you!)
* **Maintainers** - Steward specific areas like SDKs, documentation, or
  [Working Groups](/community/working-interest-groups)
* **Core Maintainers** - Guide overall project direction, review SEPs, and oversee the specification

You can find the current list of maintainers in the
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)
file.

Maintainers are here to help you succeed! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or
need guidance on your contribution.

## Your First Contribution

Start here if you are new to MCP and contributing to its ecosystem.

<Note>
  While we use the specification repository as an example, the key patterns are
  applicable to other MCP repos as well.
</Note>

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Set up your local environment so you can test and validate changes before submitting them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the repository">
    Click the **Fork** button on the [repository page](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) to create your own copy. This gives you a personal workspace where you can make changes without affecting the main project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone your fork">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/modelcontextprotocol.git
    cd modelcontextprotocol
    ```

    Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm install
    ```

    This installs the tools needed for schema generation, documentation building, and validation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify everything works">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run check
    ```

    This runs TypeScript compilation, schema validation, example validation, documentation link checks, and formatting checks. If everything passes, your environment is good and you're ready to contribute.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If `npm run check` fails, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### Step 2: Find Something to Work On

While a lot of the items you might see tracked in the repository can feel intimidating, especially
for newcomers, there are plenty of places where you can start with your first improvements:

1. **Documentation improvements** - Help us fix typos, unclear explanations, broken links, or
   incomplete examples
2. **Issues labeled `good first issue`** - Tackle issues tagged in the
   [specification repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
   as well as our SDK repos
3. **Schema examples** - Add examples to `schema/draft/examples/` to make it easier for developers
   to understand protocol primitives

### Step 3: Make Your Change

Create your changes in a dedicated branch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    git checkout -b fix/your-description
    ```

    Use a descriptive branch name that reflects your change, like `fix/typo-in-tools-doc` or `feat/add-example-for-resources`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the relevant files in your local copy. If you're editing schema files, remember to run `npm run generate:schema` to regenerate the JSON schema and documentation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run checks">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run check
    ```

    Fix any issues before committing. If you have formatting errors, `npm run format` can auto-fix most of them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit with a clear message">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    git commit -m "Fix typo in tools documentation"
    ```

    Write a concise message that describes what you changed and why. Reference issue numbers if applicable (e.g., `Fix typo in tools documentation (#123)`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

When you're ready, push your branch and open a pull request.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push your branch">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    git push origin fix/your-description
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open a PR on GitHub">
    You can use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to make this process easier:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    gh pr create --fill
    ```

    Alternatively, navigate to your fork on GitHub and click **Compare & pull request**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the PR template">
    Provide a clear description of your changes and link any related issues.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Maintainers typically respond within 1-5 business days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  That's it, **congratulations on your first contribution**! Every improvement,
  no matter how small, helps make MCP better for everyone.
</Tip>

### What Makes a Good Contribution

Help us review your contribution quickly by following these patterns:

| Harder to Review                             | Thoughtful and Impactful                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Large PR with unrelated changes              | Focused PR addressing one issue                  |
| Reformatting code without functional changes | Fixing a bug with a clear explanation            |
| Vague commit messages ("fixed stuff")        | Descriptive commits linking to issues            |
| Submitting with failing CI checks            | All CI tests pass before requesting review       |
| Duplicating existing documentation           | Documenting an undocumented feature or edge case |

## Types of Contributions

Different contributions follow different processes depending on their scope.

<Tip>
  Not sure which category your change falls into? Ask in the [MCP Contributor
  Discord](/community/communication#discord) before starting any significant
  work.
</Tip>

### Small Changes (Direct PR)

Simply submit a pull request directly to the repo for:

* Bug fixes and typo corrections
* Documentation improvements, such as bringing clarity to an ambiguous or unclear section
* Adding examples to existing features
* Minor schema fixes that don't materially change the specification or SDK behavior
* Test improvements

### Major Changes (SEP Required)

Anything that changes the MCP specification requires following the
[Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP)](/community/sep-guidelines) process. This includes, but
is not limited to:

* New protocol features or API methods
* Breaking changes to existing behavior
* Changes to the message format or schema structure
* New interoperability standards
* Governance or process changes

Here are a few concrete examples of what would require following the SEP steps:

* Adding a new RPC method like `tools/execute`
* Changing how authentication and authorization works
* Adding a new capability negotiation field
* Modifying the transport layer specification

## Working with the Specification Repository

Once you've determined [what type of contribution](#types-of-contributions) you're making, here's
how to work with the specification repository.

### Schema Changes

The TypeScript schema (`schema/draft/schema.ts`) is the **source of truth** for the protocol. It
defines every message type, request/response structure, and primitive (tools, resources, prompts)
that clients and servers exchange. SDK implementers across all languages rely on this schema to
build conformant implementations.

When you run `npm run generate:schema`, it generates:

* The JSON schema (`schema/draft/schema.json`) for validation
* The Schema Reference documentation (`docs/specification/draft/schema.mdx`)

To modify the schema:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit the TypeScript schema">
    Make your changes in `schema/draft/schema.ts`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add examples (optional)">
    Add JSON examples in `schema/draft/examples/[TypeName]/` (e.g., `Tool/my-example.json`). Reference them in the schema using `@example` + `@includeCode` JSDoc tags.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate JSON schema and docs">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run generate:schema
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate your changes">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run check
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Documentation Changes

Docs are written in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown with JSX components) and powered by
[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/). The `docs/` directory contains:

* `docs/docs/` - Guides and tutorials for getting started and building with MCP
* `docs/specification/` - Formal protocol specification (versioned by date)

Here is how you can contribute to our documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the local docs server">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run serve:docs
    ```

    This launches a live preview at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the relevant `.mdx` files. You can use [Mintlify components](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/components) like `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Steps>`, and `<Card>` for richer formatting.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for issues">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run check:docs
    ```

    This validates formatting, broken links, and other common issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Major Protocol Changes

For significant changes, follow the [SEP process](/community/sep-guidelines). Prior to spending a
lot of time on a spec proposal, make sure to follow these best practices.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate your idea first">
    Discuss in an [Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups) or on
    [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build a prototype">
    Demonstrate practical application of your idea.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find a sponsor">
    A maintainer from the [maintainer
    list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)
    who will champion your proposal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the SEP">
    Follow the [SEP Guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with the SDK Repositories

MCP maintains official SDKs in multiple languages. Contributions are welcome - whether you're
fixing bugs, improving performance, adding features, or enhancing documentation.

<Note>
  Each SDK has its own repository, maintainers, and contribution guidelines.
  Some SDKs are maintained in collaboration with larger partner organizations,
  such as Google, Microsoft, JetBrains, and others, so processes may vary
  slightly between repositories.
</Note>

### Before Contributing to an SDK

Before diving into code, follow these steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an issue first">
    Before starting significant work, open an issue to discuss your approach.
    This helps avoid duplicate effort, ensures your contribution aligns with the
    SDK's direction, and gives maintainers a chance to provide early feedback.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Join the SDK channel">
    Find the relevant channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) (e.g.,
    `#typescript-sdk-dev`, `#python-sdk-dev`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read the SDK's CONTRIBUTING.md">
    Each repository has its own `CONTRIBUTING.md` with specific instructions for
    setting up your development environment, coding standards, commit message
    conventions, and PR requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write tests">
    All contributions should include appropriate test coverage. Bug fixes should
    include a test that reproduces the issue, and new features should have tests
    covering the expected behavior. This helps maintain SDK reliability and
    prevents regressions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Help

### Communication Channels

Got questions or need guidance? The MCP community is here to help.

* **[Discord](/community/communication#discord)** - Real-time discussion with contributors and
  maintainers, focused on MCP contributions (not general MCP support)
* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions)**
  \- Exploration and conversation: **feature requests**, questions, roadmap planning, and proposals
  that need input before becoming concrete tasks
* **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues)** -
  Actionable work: bug reports with reproducible steps, documentation fixes, and tasks that are
  well-defined and ready to implement (not feature requests)

This separation helps maintainers focus on work that's ready for implementation while giving ideas
room to develop. If you're unsure whether something is ready to be an issue, start with a
discussion. For a complete guide, see our [Contributor Communication](/community/communication)
documentation.

For protocol discussions, join [Working Group](/community/working-interest-groups) channels like
`#auth-wg` or `#server-identity-wg`. For SDK help, find your language's channel (e.g.,
`#typescript-sdk-dev`).

### Finding a Sponsor for SEPs

A **sponsor** is a Core Maintainer or Maintainer who champions your SEP through the review
process. They provide feedback, help refine your proposal, and present it at Core Maintainer
meetings.

<Warning>
  Every SEP needs a sponsor to move forward. SEPs that don't find a sponsor
  within 6 months are marked as **dormant**. Dormant SEPs aren't rejected
  outright - they can be revived later if a sponsor is found or the proposal is
  re-assessed to be needed.
</Warning>

To find a sponsor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find relevant maintainers">
    Look at the [maintainer
    list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)
    to find maintainers working in your area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag maintainers in your PR">
    Tag 1-2 relevant maintainers (don't spam everyone).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share in Discord">
    Post your PR in the relevant Discord channel to increase visibility.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow up if needed">
    If no response after 2 weeks, ask in `#general` or reach out to a Core
    Maintainer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Maintainers review open proposals regularly, but response time varies based on complexity and
availability.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things don't go as planned - that's completely normal! Here are solutions to common
issues. If you're still stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help in
[Discord](/community/communication#discord). The community is friendly and happy to help you get
unstuck.

### `npm run check` fails

Common causes:

* **Wrong Node.js version** - Ensure you have Node.js 24+
* **Missing dependencies** - Run `npm install` again
* **Schema out of sync** - Run `npm run generate:schema`
* **Formatting issues** - Run `npm run format` to auto-fix

### My PR has been sitting unnoticed for weeks

1. Ensure all CI checks pass
2. Politely ping the desired reviewer in a comment
3. Ask in the relevant Discord channel
4. For urgent issues, reach out to a Core Maintainer

### I can't find a sponsor for my SEP

1. Make sure your idea has been discussed in Discord or an Interest Group first
2. Proposals with demonstrated community interest are more likely to find sponsors
3. Consider whether your change might be too large - could it be split into smaller SEPs?

### My SEP was rejected

Don't take it personally - a SEP rejection doesn't mean your idea was bad. SEPs can be rejected
for many reasons: timing, scope, competing priorities, or simply because the protocol isn't ready
for that change yet. The feedback you receive is valuable and often points toward a path forward.

Rejection is not permanent. You have a few options ahead:

1. **Address the feedback and resubmit** - Often, rejection comes with specific concerns.
   Addressing those concerns and resubmitting can be the right path forward.
2. **Discuss in Discord** - Talk with maintainers to better understand the concerns. Sometimes a
   brief conversation reveals a simpler path forward.
3. **Try a different approach** - Submit a new SEP that addresses the same problem differently,
   incorporating what you learned.
4. **Wait for the right moment** - Circumstances change. New use cases emerge, the community
   grows, and priorities shift. An idea rejected today might be welcomed tomorrow.

## Out of Scope

This guide covers contributions to the **core MCP project** - the specification, official SDKs,
and documentation.

Building your own MCP servers, clients, or tools is **not** covered here. For guidance on building
with MCP, see our documentation:

* [Build a Server](/docs/develop/build-server)
* [Build a Client](/docs/develop/build-client)
* [Example Servers](/examples)

If you build something you'd like to share with the community, you can submit it to the
[MCP Registry](/registry/about).

## AI Contributions

We welcome the use of AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to help with your contributions! If you do
use AI assistance, just let us know in your pull request or issue - a quick note about how you
