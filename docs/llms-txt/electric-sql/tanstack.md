# TanStack

[TanStack](https://tanstack.com) is a collection of TypeScript libraries for building web and mobile apps.

Developed by an open collective, stewarded by [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley), it's one of the best and most popular ways to build modern apps.

## TanStack DB

Electric have [partnered with TanStack](https://tanstack.com/blog/tanstack-db-0.1-the-embedded-client-database-for-tanstack-query) to build [TanStack DB](https://tanstack.com/db), a reactive client store for building super fast apps on sync.

Type-safe, declarative, incrementally adoptable and insanely fast, it's the [future of app development with Electric](/blog/2025/07/29/local-first-sync-with-tanstack-db) and the best way of [building AI apps and agentic systems](/blog/2025/04/09/building-ai-apps-on-sync).

See the blog post for more details:

[Maxi Ferreira](https://x.com/charca) also wrote an [awesome interactive guide](https://frontendatscale.com/blog/tanstack-db) to what TanStack DB is, how it works, and why it might change the way you build apps:
