# LiveStore

[LiveStore](https://livestore.dev) is a next-generation state management framework based on reactive SQLite and git-inspired syncing (via event-sourcing).

## Electric and LiveStore

LiveStore supports syncing via Electric through the [Electric sync provider](https://docs.livestore.dev/reference/syncing/sync-provider/electricsql/). There's an example of using Electric with LiveStore at [web-todomvc-sync-electric](https://github.com/livestorejs/livestore/tree/main/examples/src/web-todomvc-sync-electric).
