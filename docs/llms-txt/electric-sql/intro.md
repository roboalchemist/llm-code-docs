# Documentation

How to build [fast, modern, collaborative apps](/sync) with the Electric stack.

## Getting started

Start with the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) for the fastest way to get up-and-running.

The easiest way to use Electric in production is the [Electric Cloud](/cloud). Alternatively, the [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment) guide covers how to self host.

## What's documented where?

> \[!Warning] 🔭  Product documentation is split across multiple sites
> It's worth taking a moment to understand what's documented where.

This website contains the main documentation for [Postgres Sync](/products/postgres-sync).

Usage examples and recipes often use Postgres Sync together with [TanStack DB](/products/tanstack-db). Guides like [Auth](/docs/guides/auth) and [Security](/docs/guides/security) are also generally relevant for [Durable Streams](/products/durable-streams).

### Project websites

[Durable Streams](/products/durable-streams), [TanStack DB](/products/tanstack-db) and [PGlite](/products/pglite) each have their own docs:

## Examples

See the [Demos](/demos) section and [`examples`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/examples) folder on GitHub for demos and examples, e.g.:

The integration docs also illustrate common patterns, e.g. using Electric with frameworks like [TanStack](/docs/integrations/tanstack) and [Phoenix](/docs/integrations/phoenix) and platforms like [Supabase](/docs/integrations/supabase) and [Cloudflare](/docs/integrations/cloudflare).

## Source code

Electric is an open source project developed at [github.com/electric-sql](https://github.com/electric-sql). Check out the source code, issues and development in progress there.
