## How our plans and billing works

### Plans

Refer to our [pricing page](https://linear.app/pricing) for the most up-to-date information on our plans offering.

### Billing

Customers are billed for the number of unsuspended users within a workspace. Thus, your paid plan only applies to the single workspace associated with it.

For billing frequency, we offer either monthly or yearly options. On our Enterprise plan, we exclusively offer a yearly option.

#### Monthly billing

Your account is charged on a monthly basis for the number of unsuspended users in any role on your workspace.

Adding users mid-month will not result in a charge until the following month. Similarly, removing a user mid-month will not result in a credit for the remainder of the month.

#### Yearly billing

When you upgrade to a yearly plan, Linear charges for the total number of **unsuspended users** in your workspace at that time. This establishes your subscription year and billing cycle.



If you add or suspend users during that year, your account automatically adjusts to reflect those changes:

* **Adding users** → generates a **pro-rated charge** for the remaining time in your subscription year.
* **Suspending users** → generates a **pro-rated credit** for the remaining time in your subscription year.



All adjustments are fully automated — there’s no need to request manual changes. Credits are automatically applied toward future invoices or renewals (they aren’t refunded).



Linear reconciles these adjustments on your **monthly billing cycle**, which is tied to your annual plan’s start date (not the calendar month).



* If additional users were added during the past monthly billing cycle, a **true-up invoice** is created and charged automatically or sent by email.
* If users were suspended, a **credit** is automatically issued and applied to future invoices.

#### Example



Your annual plan starts on **February 10** and renews the following year.



Date | Event | Result
--- | --- | ---
February 10 | Upgrade with 12 active users | You’re charged for 12 users for the full subscription year (Feb 10 → Feb 10).
April 18 | Add 3 users | Linear calculates a pro-rated charge for those 3 users covering Apr 18 → Feb 10 next year. This appears on your next monthly billing cycle (May 10).
May 15 | Suspend 2 users | Linear calculates a pro-rated credit for those 2 users covering May 15 → Feb 10 next year. This credit appears on your next monthly billing cycle (June 10).

  
Each change — adding or suspending users — is billed or credited based on the exact date it happens. Invoices only ever reflect past activity, and **we don’t edit or cancel them once issued.**



This ensures your account stays accurate and that all future prorations calculate correctly. Any new user changes are automatically included in your next billing cycle — no manual action or adjustments needed.



#### **Key things to know**

* “Billing month” refers to your plan’s recurring monthly cycle, not the calendar month.
* Annual subscriptions are charged once for the base year, with **automated monthly true-ups** for user changes.
* **Invoices are final once issued.** Future user changes are automatically included in upcoming invoices.
* Credits are automatically applied to future charges or renewals.

## Manage your billing

Navigate to _[Settings > Workspace > Billing](https://linear.app/settings/billing)_ to access your plan information and make changes. From here, you can:

* View and change your plan.
* Update your payment information.
* Update the billing email.
* View billing history — past invoices and charges.
* We will also show if a charge is failed or past due.

### Change or Cancel a subscription

Workspace admins can change or cancel a subscription from [_Settings > Workspace > Plans_](https://linear.app/settings/plans). Subscription updates take effect at the _end of the subscription period_. If you are on a monthly plan, this will be at the end of the billing month. If you are on a yearly plan, this will be at the end of the billing year.

We do not provide refunds for cancellations mid-subscription. If you are uncertain you are ready to commit to a full year, we recommend starting on a monthly plan first. You can switch to yearly at a later date when you are ready to commit longer term and take advantage of the discounted rates.

When cancelling a subscription:

* Nothing will be deleted.
* If you have over 250 issues, you will no longer be able to create new issues.
* Members will become Admins of the workspace, as all users are Admins on free plans.

### Add a VAT number

To add a VAT number, choose the _I'm purchasing as a business_ option on the checkout page when upgrading.

To add a VAT number for an existing subscription, go to [Settings > Billing > Billing Details > Edit](https://linear.app/settings/billing). 

## Sales tax

In certain areas Linear is required to apply sales tax. The billing address you provide is used to determine whether tax must be applied, and if so the applicable rate.

Areas in which Linear must apply sales tax as of October 1st, 2025 include the following. We anticipate this list will grow over time, and we will keep it updated with new additions.

* Arizona
* Chicago, Illinois (PPLT Tax)
* Colorado
* Connecticut
* District of Columbia
* Maryland
* Massachusetts
* New York
* Ohio
* Pennsylvania
* Tennessee
* Texas
* Utah
* Washington

If needed, you can revise your billing address in _[Settings > Workspace > Billing](https://linear.app/settings/billing)._
