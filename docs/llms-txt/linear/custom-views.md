## Overview

Create custom views using filters to show only the items you want to see. Save, share and favorite these views for easy access and faster team collaboration.

## Basics

### Open views

Open views in the team or workspace Views pages in your sidebar, or search for views to open with `O` then `V`.

### Create views

To build a custom view from scratch, click on Views in the sidebar, select the type of view you wish to create (Issue, Project, or Initiative on Enterprise plans) and click _New view_. 

You can also save any filtered board or list as a custom view with the keyboard shortcut `Option/Alt` `V` or by clicking on the Save view icon. The icon appears next to the Display Options icon after you've add at least one filter to any team-specific list or board.

### Edit views

To edit an existing view, click on the view name from within the view itself and  choose the _Edit view…_ option in the pop-up menu.   
  
You also have the option to duplicate an existing view from here, just click on the _Duplicate view..._ option.

### Share views

![Share view](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/866f7257d57e24abaeb6ff6c8a613fc2f57eeca7-1998x850.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

If a shared view is created at the workspace level, then the view will appear under Workspace views on the Views page. If you select a specific team when creating the view, then only members of that team will see the shared view and it will be listed under Team views in the View page.   
  
To share a view across multiple teams but limit it to projects or issues within a specific team or teams, create an _All teams_ view and use filters to refine the list.

### Create views attached to Teams or Projects

![+ Create new view button next to All Issues, Active and Backlog views](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/f8bbfb68fe973ab9e7de98fc8b8a7318653aff17-800x218.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

From your team's Issues and Projects sections, you can create new views that appear alongside the team's default views (All Issues, Active and Backlog.)   
  
Unlike shared team views in the Views menu, these contextual views are shown only in the Issues and Projects section. 

### Copy view link

To share a specific view in Slack or wherever you discuss work, copy a link by clicking the custom view's three dot (more) menu and selecting _Copy view URL_ or by copying the View's URL in the browser. Sharing a link does not automatically give anyone access to a view, it must be shared first.

### Favorite views

Favorite views that you access frequently to add them to your sidebar. Do this by clicking on the star next to the view name or from the overflow menu. Favoriting custom views lets you select them as your default page when opening Linear in [Settings > Account > Preferences](https://linear.app/settings/account/preferences).

### Collapse view group headers

Expand or collapse group headers when in list view by hovering over the group and pressing `t`, or clicking on the toggle icon at the left side of the group header.

### View sidebars

The righthand sidebar clarifies the view's contents and allows you to quickly filter for common properties. Project view sidebars display information on those project's leads, teams, projects, initiatives and health. Issue view sidebars display assignees, labels and projects.

### Issue view subscriptions

Configure personal or Slack channel notifications when an issue meets parameters defined by a view, or when an issue in a view is completed/canceled. 

#### Individual notifications

Click the bell icon at the top of an issue view. Select whether you'd like to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, marked completed or canceled, or both. 

To reduce notification noise, you won't receive notifications in views you subscribe to for actions you take yourself.

Once you've configured a view subscription, manage the subscription in [notification settings](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications).

#### Slack channel notifications

Click the bell icon at the top of a view, then the _Configure_ button next to _Slack notifications_. Turn on the toggle and authorize Linear to post to a particular channel. Choose whether to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, completed/canceled, or both.

Moving forwards, notifications for these selected changes will be sent as messages to the chosen Slack channel.

### View owners

Every view has an owner property visible in that View's dedicated sidebar as well as on the main _Views_ page in Linear's main sidebar. This field defaults to the creator of the view but can be changed to other users as desired. Before deleting a view, we advise checking in with its owner to ensure it's no longer needed.

<summary>When should I use an initiative to group projects instead of a view?</summary>
If you want to curate a list of projects for planning purposes that map to an organization goal or objective and you want to keep track of overall progress, an initiative is the ideal tool. The projects in an initiative are manually curated and do not change over time unless new projects are manually added or removed.

In Project views, any projects meeting the view's filter criteria will appear. Use project views to represent the current state of work, or as a quick way to keep an eye on particular types of projects you care about.

**Quarterly review**
