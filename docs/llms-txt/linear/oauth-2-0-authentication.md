# OAuth 2.0 authentication

Linear supports OAuth2 authentication, which is recommended if you’re building applications to integrate with Linear.

> [!NOTE]
> It is **highly recommended** you create a workspace for the purpose of managing the OAuth2 Application, as each admin user will have access.

> [!NOTE]
> OAuth2 applications created from October 1, 2025 onwards have refresh tokens enabled by default for user-initiated OAuth with no option to disable them.

## Create an OAuth2 application

Create a new [OAuth2 Application](https://linear.app/settings/api/applications/new) and configure the redirect callback URLs to your application.

## Redirect user access requests to Linear

When authorizing a user to the Linear API, redirect to an authorization URL with correct parameters and scopes:

```http
GET https://linear.app/oauth/authorize HTTP/1.1
```

Name | Description
--- | ---
`client_id` | (required) Client ID provided when you create the OAuth2 Application
`redirect_uri` | (required) Redirect URI
`response_type=code` | (required) Expected response type
`scope` | (required) Comma separated list of scopes:

* `read` - (Default) Read access for the user's account. This scope will always be present.
* `write` - Write access for the user's account. If your application only needs to create comments, use a more targeted scope
* `issues:create` - Allows creating new issues and their attachments
* `comments:create` - Allows creating new issue comments
* `timeSchedule:write` - Allows creating and modifying time schedules
* `admin` - Full access to admin level endpoints. You should never ask for this permission unless it's absolutely needed

See [App authentication](https://linear.app/developers/agents?noRedirect=1#actor-and-scopes) for agent-specific scopes such as  `app:assignable` or `app:mentionable`.
`state` | (optional) Prevents CSRF attacks and should always be supplied. Read more about it [here](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/state-parameters)
`prompt=consent` | (optional) The consent screen is displayed every time, even if all scopes were previously granted. This can be useful if you want to give users the opportunity to connect multiple workspaces.
`actor` | Define how the OAuth application should create issues, comments and other changes:

* `user` - (Default) Resources are created as the user who authorized the application. This option should be used if you want each user to do their own authentication
* `app` - Resources are created as the application. This option should be used for agents and service accounts or agents.

### PKCE

Linear supports the [PKCE flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/authorization-request/). To use this flow, you'll need to include two additional parameters as part of your `/authorize` request:

**Name** | Description
--- | ---
`code_challenge` | (required) Code challenge you generated
`code_challenge_method` | (required) Either `plain` or `S256`, depending on whether the challenge is the plain verifier string or the SHA256 hash of the string

### Example

```http
GET https://linear.app/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URL&state=SECURE_RANDOM&scope=read HTTP/1.1

GET https://linear.app/oauth/authorize?client_id=client1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Foauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=read,write HTTP/1.1

GET https://linear.app/oauth/authorize?client_id=client1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Foauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=read,write&code_challenge=challenge&code_challenge_method=S256 HTTP/1.1
```

## Handle the redirect URLs you specified in the OAuth2 Application

Once the user approves your application they will be redirected back to your application, with the OAuth authorization `code` in the URL params.

Any `state` parameter you specified in step 2 will also be returned in the URL params and must match the value specified in step 2. If the values do not match, the request should not be trusted.

### Example

```http
GET https://example.com/oauth/callback?code=9a5190f637d8b1ad0ca92ab3ec4c0d033ad6c862&state=b1ad0ca92 HTTP/1.1
```

## Exchange ,`code`, for an access token

After receiving the `code`, you can exchange it for a Linear API access token:

```http
POST https://api.linear.app/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pass parameters in body as [URL-encoded form submission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST#url-encoded_form_submission), where the `Content-Type` header must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`code` | (required) Authorization code from the previous step
`redirect_uri` | (required) Same redirect URI which you used in the previous step
`client_id` | (required) Application's client ID
`client_secret` | (required) Application's client secret
`grant_type=authorization_code` | (required)

### PKCE

If you are using the PKCE flow, the parameters required by the `/token` endpoint are different:

**Name** | **Description**
--- | ---
`code` | (required) Authorization code from the previous step
`redirect_uri` | (required) Same redirect URI which you used in the previous step
`client_id` | (required) Application's client ID
`client_secret` | (optional) Application's client secret
`code_verifier` | (required) The code verifier for the PKCE request that you originally generated before the authorization request
`grant_type=authorization_code` | (required)

### Response

After a successful request, a valid access token will be returned in the response.

If your application has refresh tokens enabled (default behavior for applications created from October 1, 2025 onwards), your response will contain a refresh token along with an access token. The access token is valid for 24 hours and will need to be refreshed when it expires. Example response:

```json
{  
  "access_token": "00a21d8b0c4e2375114e49c067dfb81eb0d2076f48354714cd5df984d87b67cc",
  "token_type": "Bearer",  
  "expires_in": 86399,  
  "scope": "read write",
  "refresh_token": "sz0c8ffy95zj2ff6bh1hiausauw3dbfsu4gly1z4p49b5odqv8l7owunb654vg1f",
}
```

If your application does not have refresh tokens enabled, your response will contain an access token that is valid for 10 years. Example response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "00a21d8b0c4e2375114e49c067dfb81eb0d2076f48354714cd5df984d87b67cc",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 315705599,
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note: OAuth apps created prior to Dec 1, 2023 will instead return `scope` as an array of strings in the token response.

## Refresh an access token

If your application uses refresh tokens, you'll need to use the refresh token you receive alongside your access token to retrieve a new access token when the previous one expires.

For authorization, you have two options:

1. Use HTTP basic authentication by passing a Base64-encoded `client_id:client_secret` string as an authorization header: `Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>`
2. Pass `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters

If your access token was generated using PKCE, you can simply pass `client_id` as a parameter.

```http
POST https://api.linear.app/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pass parameters in body as [URL-encoded form submission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST#url-encoded_form_submission), where the `Content-Type` header must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Parameter** | **Description**
--- | ---
`refresh_token` | (required) Refresh token from the previous step
`grant_type=refresh_token` | (required)
`client_id` | (optional if you're using HTTP basic authentication) Application's client ID
`client_secret` | (optional if you're using HTTP basic authentication or refreshing a token generated using PKCE) Application's client secret

### Response

After a successful request, a new valid access token and a new refresh token will be returned in the response:

```json
{  
  "access_token": "fxra4u0msw3bagb9rdn2i641bs52m9zo8ksoxljouygcu31nh8s2jf8fygbepy16",
  "token_type": "Bearer",  
  "expires_in": 86399,  
  "scope": "read write",
  "refresh_token": "qjmj51q8f8fnwe188702jarfqxwhdy6r5ivqy4yjuhw2crubm5e7nyu84un3marx",
}
```

## Make an API request

Once you have obtained a valid access token, you can make a request to Linear's GraphQL API. You can initialize the [Linear Client](https://linear.app/developers/sdk) with the access token:

```typescript
const client = new LinearClient({ accessToken: response.access_token })
const me = await client.viewer
```

Or pass the token as an authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`

```sh
curl https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --data '{ "query": "{ viewer { id name } }" }' \
```

## Revoke an access token

To revoke a user's access to your application pass the access token as Bearer token in the authorization header (`Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`) or as the `access_token` form field.

You can also revoke access using a refresh token by passing it as the `refresh_token` form field. 

```http
POST https://api.linear.app/oauth/revoke HTTP/1.1
```

### Response

Expected HTTP status:

* `200` - token was revoked
* `400` - unable to revoke token (e.g. token was already revoked)
* `401` - unable to authenticate with the token

## Migrate to using refresh tokens

To ease the transition to refresh tokens for OAuth2 applications that aren't currently using them, we've added a temporary endpoint to migrate any old, long-lived access token to a new, short-lived access token with a refresh token.

```http
POST https://api.linear.app/oauth/migrate_old_token HTTP/1.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pass parameters in body as [URL-encoded form submission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST#url-encoded_form_submission), where the `Content-Type` header must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Parameter** | **Description**
--- | ---
`access_token` | (required) Existing long-lived access token
`client_id` | (required) Application's client ID
`client_secret` | (required) Application's client secret

## Client credentials tokens

We support the `client_credentials` grant type for OAuth2 apps that use tokens for server-to-server communication and cannot support a user-initiated OAuth flow involving refresh tokens.

> [!NOTE]
> **Client credentials**
> You must first toggle on client credentials tokens for your OAuth2 app when creating or editing the app in Linear

The token generated using this grant type will be an `app` actor token that has access to all public teams in the workspace and is valid for 30 days. You can learn more about `app` actor tokens [here](https://linear.app/developers/oauth-actor-authorization).

The app user's team access can be modified through the [app details page](https://linear.app/settings/applications/) for your app at any point after the token is generated. Since there is no refresh token paired with this access token, your server is expected to fetch a new token if it receives a 401 error when making a request with the previous token.

Every OAuth2 app can only have one active client credentials token at a time since it is an `app` token. If you request a new client credentials token while you still have an active one, we will invalidate the currently active token and return a new token with a 30-day validity. 

For increased security, we will also invalidate your app's client credentials token if its client secret is rotated. 

### Request

For authorization, you have two options:

1. Use HTTP basic authentication by passing a Base64-encoded `client_id:client_secret` string as an authorization header: `Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>`
2. Pass `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters

```http
POST https://api.linear.app/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
```

Name | Description
--- | ---
`grant_type=client_credentials` | (required)
`scope` | (required) Comma-separated list of scopes
`client_id` | (optional if you're using HTTP basic authentication) Application's client ID
`client_secret` | (optional if you're using HTTP basic authentication) Application's client secret

### Response

After a successful request, a new valid access token will be returned in the response:

```json
{  
  "access_token": "fxra4u0msw3bagb9rdn2i621bs52m9zo8ksoxljouygcu31nh8s2jf8fygbepy16",
  "token_type": "Bearer",  
  "expires_in": 2591999,  
  "scope": "read write",
}
```

If your OAuth2 app does not have client credentials tokens enabled, you will receive an error response:

```json
{
  "error":"Error",
  "error_description":"Client does not support the client_credentials grant type"
}                                              
```
