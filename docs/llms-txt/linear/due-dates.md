## Overview

Issues with due dates display a calendar icon on the list or board with a color indication to quick understanding of an issue's status. The icon will be:

* Red if it's overdue
* Orange if it's due within the next week, or
* grey otherwise.

Hover over the icon to view the due date and how many days are remaining or have passed since it was due.

If you don't see the icon on your list or board view, open Display Options and make sure that **Due Date** is selected under _Display properties_.

## Add due date

Use the shortcut `Shift` `D` when viewing or selecting an issue to set the due date. During issue creation, select the three dot menu to bring up the set due date option.

## Due date notifications

If enabled in your [notification settings](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications), you will receive a notification when an issue's due date is near and/or if the issue is past due.

## Filter by due date

Type `F` then search _due_ or click the add filter button to apply the following related Filters to any issue view: 

* Overdue
* 1 day from now
* 1 week from now
* 3 months from now
* Custom date or timeframe
* No due date

## Sort by due date

On list views, open view options and select _Ordering: Due date_ to sort issues by due date. Issues with a due date will show up at the top of each group.



### FAQ

<details>
<summary>What's the relationship between due dates and SLAs?</summary>
An issue may use either due dates or an SLA, but not both. If an issue has a due date and then has an SLA applied, the due date will be replaced by the SLA.
