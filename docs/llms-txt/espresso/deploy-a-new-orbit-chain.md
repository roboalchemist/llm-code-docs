# Deploy a New Orbit Chain

### TL;DR

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to deploying a rollup or Arbitrum Orbit chain with the Espresso Network. It emphasizes testing the integration in a controlled environment and includes guidance for mainnet deployment. The instructions cover both local and cloud setups using Docker.

> **Note:** This guide assumes certain trust conditions and may not be suitable for production.

### Background

The Espresso Network is a confirmation layer that provides chains with information about the state of their own chain and the states of other chains, which is important for cross-chain composability. Espresso confirmations can be used in addition to the soft confirmations from a centralized sequencer, are backed by the security of the Espresso Network, and are faster than waiting for Ethereum finality (12-15 minutes).

#### How It Works

In a regular chain, the transaction lifecycle will look something like this:

1. A user transacts on an Arbitrum chain.
2. The transaction is processed by the chain's sequencer, which provides a soft-confirmation to the user, and the transactions are packaged into a block.
3. The sequencer, responsible for collecting these blocks, compressing, and submitting, submits the transactions to the base layer.
   * If the base layer is Arbitrum One or Ethereum, the transaction will take at least 12-15 minutes to finalize, or longer, depending on how frequently the sequencer posts to the base layer.
   * In this transaction lifecycle, the user must trust that the chain's sequencer provided an honest soft-confirmation and will not act maliciously. There are limited ways to verify that the sequencer and batcher acted honestly or did not censor transactions.

This reliance on trust is a strong assumption, and it's where the Espresso Network provides significant benefits. When the chain is integrated with the Espresso Network, the following enhancements occur:

* The sequencer provides a soft confirmation to the user, while the transactions are also sent to the Espresso Network to receive a stronger confirmation secured by Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus.
* A software component of the sequencer, called the batch poster (henceforth referred to as "batcher"), operates inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and must honor the Espresso Network confirmation. It cannot change the ordering or equivocate.
* This setup provides a strong guarantee that the transaction will ultimately be included and finalized by the base layer.

While the user must still trust that the chain's sequencer has provided an honest soft confirmation, the Espresso Network offers a stronger confirmation that holds the sequencer accountable and prevents it from equivocating or acting maliciously. The initial implementation of the batch poster is permissioned, and the user must trust that it will not reorder blocks produced by the sequencer.

For a comprehensive overview of how the Espresso Network integrates with your rollup—including details on the architecture, component interactions, and overall flow—please refer to [this integration guide](https://docs.espressosys.com/network/guides/using-the-espresso-network/using-the-espresso-network-as-an-arbitrum-orbit-chain).

#### Running Your Own

Integrating with the Espresso Network requires minimal changes to Arbitrum Nitro's existing rollup design. The Espresso Team has already done that, and in the following sections we will provide a comprehensive guide for running your own instance and building on Espresso!

#### Components

We model the rollup as a collection of three components:

* The sequencer
* The batcher
* The TEE contract (which we mock in this example)

### Deploying The Cloud Arbitrum Orbit Chain

Please note that these documents are to facilitate the deployment of a **testable** instance of the Arbitrum Orbit Chain with Espresso and should **not** be assumed to be production-ready infrastructure.

> **Note:** This guide is based on deploying your on own rollup on Arbitrum Sepolia. A dedicated section at the end of the guide outlines all the modifications needed for deployment on Arbitrum One.

#### 0. Install Requisite Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js 16, yarn, foundry, git and build-essential tools installed on your system before proceeding.

#### 1. Deploy the Contracts

First, clone the contracts repository and set up the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EspressoSystems/nitro-contracts.git
cd nitro-contracts
git checkout develop
```

Install the dependencies and build the project (this may take several minutes):

```bash
yarn install && forge install
yarn build:all
```

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
ARBISCAN_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
DEVNET_PRIVKEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
ESPRESSO_TEE_VERIFIER_ADDRESS="0x8354db765810dF8F24f1477B06e91E5b17a408bF"
```

You can get your Arbiscan API key by going to [here](https://arbiscan.io/myapikey). You need an account in order to get one. As for the private key, choose any address you want to use as the owner of the rollup. The amount required to deploy all the rollup contracts is arount 0.15 ETH.

This contract above is a mock TEE verifier that will be used to test the rollup by always returning true for any input. In this guide, we are thus assuming that the batch poster will not act maliciously because it is not operating inside a TEE.

#### 2. Configure Deployment

There is a config.example.ts file in the `scripts` folder that show you how the config file should look like. There is also a config.template.ts file that you can use to create your own config file.

1. Rename `config.template.ts` to `config.ts` 2.Update the following values in `config.ts`:

```bash
owner: "OWNER_ADDRESS",
chainId: ethers.BigNumber.from('YOUR_CHAIN_ID'), // Update with your desired chain ID
// Chain configuration
chainConfig: {
    "chainId": ChainID, // Update with the same chain ID,
    "InitialChainOwner": "YOUR_OWNED_ADDRESS",
}
validators: ["AN_OWNED_ADDRESS"],
batchPosterAddress: ["ANOTHER_OWNED_ADDRESS"],
batchPosterManager: "ANOTHER_OWNED_ADDRESS",
```

> **Important Notes:**
>
> * **chainId:** Ensure that the `chainId` values in both configuration fields are identical and unique.
> * **initialChainOwner:** The `initialChainOwner` should be the same as the `owner` address. Don't forget to modify this value at the end of the chain configuration.
> * **Validators/Stackers:** The `validators` array only requires one address, though you may add more if needed. These addresses need a minimal amount of funds (approximately 0.00003 ETH \~ ArbSepolia) each time they stake.
> * **Batch Poster:** The `batchPosterAddress` and `batchPosterManager` can be the same, but they should differ from the validators. A very small amount of funds (approximately 0.00001 ETH \~ ArbSepolia) is required for posting batches.

#### 3. Run Deployment

Execute the deployment script:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deployment.ts --network arbSepolia
```

> **Note:** You can ignore the message "env var ESPRESSO\_LIGHT\_CLIENT\_ADDRESS not set..." - this is only needed for RollupCreator deployment.

**Add deployed rollup creator address to .env**

The previous deployment script will output the address of the rollup creator. Add this address to your `.env`:

```bash
ROLLUP_CREATOR_ADDRESS="DEPLOYED_ADDRESS"
```

**Deploy the Rollup Proxy Contract**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/createEthRollup.ts --network arbSepolia
```

> **Note:** You can keep the terminal opened with the logged addresses and the block number. This is the easiest way to find the deployed contract addresses when configuring the chain in the latest sections of this guide.

**Find the Deployed Contract Addresses**

To find the addresses of your deployed contracts:

1. Go to [Arbiscan Sepolia](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/) (or [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) for mainnet)
2. Search for the address associated with your `DEVNET_PRIVKEY` from the `.env` file
3. In the transactions list, look for a transaction with the method name `Create Rollup`
4. Click on the transaction to view its details
5. Click on the "Logs(x)" tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page to find all deployed contract addresses.

> 📝 **Note:** You can also find most of the contract addresses in `espresso-deployments/arbSepolia.json`. The upgrade executor contract address from this JSON file will be needed for the next section.

### Configuring and Running the Chain

The docker configuration can be found in the [espresso-build-something-real](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-build-something-real) repository.

#### 1. Clone and Configure the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-build-something-real
cd espresso-build-something-real
```

#### 2. Update Configuration Files

You'll need to modify two configuration files with the deployment addresses, keys, ids and rpc url from the previous steps:

**Files to update:**

* `config/full_node.json`
* `config/l2_chain_info.json`

**Required updates:**

* In `config/l2_chain_info.json`:
  * Set `chainId` under `chain-config` to match your rollup's chain ID
  * Set `InitialChainOwner` to the address of the rollup owner
  * Set the rollup smart contract addresses from the previous deployment
  * Update `deployed-at` to the block number where rollup proxy was created
* In `config/full_node.json`:
  * Add the rpc provider's arbitrum URL with your API key to the `url` field (e.g., infura, alchemy, etc.)
  * Set `id` under `chain` to match your rollup's chain ID
  * Update `private-key` for both stacker (validator) and batch poster addresses

> **Note:** Make sure you do not push your private keys to your repository if it is public. Or use environment variables to store your private keys.

#### 3. Run the Chain

For those seeking to evaluate their infrastructure and to get a clearer picture of what a "working" implementation looks like, we have made available a Docker Compose configuration for local development. The configuration included in this repository is ready to use as is – it will run your rollup locally. For cloud deployment details, see the Cloud Configuration [section](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#cloud-configuration) at the end of the guide.

```yaml
version: '2.2'
services:
  nitro:
    image: ghcr.io/espressosystems/nitro-espresso-integration/nitro-node:integration
    container_name: nitro-node
    ports:
      - "8547:8547"
      - "8548:8548"
      - "8549:8549"
    command: --conf.file /config/full_node.json
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./wasm:/home/user/wasm/
      - ./database:/home/user/.arbitrum
    depends_on:
      - validation_node

  validation_node:
    image: ghcr.io/espressosystems/nitro-espresso-integration/nitro-node:integration
    container_name: validation_node
    ports:
      - "8949:8549"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    entrypoint: /usr/local/bin/nitro-val
    command: --conf.file /config/validation_node_config.json
```

Start the chain using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Understanding the Startup Process**

During startup, you'll see various logs and warnings. Here's what to expect and how to interpret them:

1. **Initial Staker Warnings**

   ```
   WARN [02-11|18:54:23.102] error acting as staker
   err="error advancing stake from node 5: block validation is still pending"
   WARN [02-11|18:55:00.911] Large gap between last seen and current block number, skipping check for reverts 
   last=122,990,253 current=122,990,485
   ```

   This is normal, this means that staker doesnt have any new nodes to stake on.
2. **Batch Validation Process**

   ```
   INFO [02-11|19:33:42.369] Batch validation status: hasBatchBeenValidated=false
   INFO [02-11|18:55:52.264] Fetching Merkle Root at hotshot height=1,173,100
   ```

   These logs show the batch poster working to validate and process transactions.
3. **Successful Batch Processing** When you see the following logs, it indicates successful batch processing:

   ```
   INFO [02-11|19:36:28.868] Batch validation status: hasBatchBeenValidated=true
   INFO [02-11|19:36:29.688] DataPoster sent transaction
   INFO [02-11|19:36:29.691] BatchPoster: batch sent
   ```

   > **Important Notes:**
   >
   > * Update to Batch posting can take from 1-30 minutes after a user has sent the transaction.
   > * Verify successful operation by checking the sequencerInbox contract on the Arbitrum Sepolia explorer.
   > * Occasional staker warnings occur when there are no new nodes to stake on.
4. **RPC Rate Limiting Issues**

   You may encounter errors indicating you've exceeded the RPC provider's rate limits:

   ```
   2025-02-27 11:12:54 INFO [02-27|16:12:54.607] rpc response method=eth_getLogs logId=199 err="Too Many Requests" result=null
   2025-02-27 11:12:54 WARN [02-27|16:12:54.609] error reading inbox err="Too Many Requests"
   ```

   These errors can occur when resyncing the entire rollup history after deleting the database folder or when using an RPC provider with strict rate limits.

   **Solutions:**

   * Adjust polling intervals in configuration files to reduce request frequency
   * Use one provider for initial sync, then switch to another for ongoing operations
   * Upgrade to a higher tier with your RPC provider

#### 4. Testing the Chain

To verify your chain is running correctly:

1. Check Confirmed Nodes by the Validator/Staker

```bash
cast call --rpc-url https://arbitrum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com YOUR_ROLLUP_PROXY_ADDRESS "latestConfirmed()(uint256)"
```

2. Test bridge functionality:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://arbitrum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com YOUR_INBOX_CONTRACT_ADDRESS 'depositEth() external payable returns (uint256)' --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY  --value 10000000000 -vvvv
```

> **Note:** Bridging transactions can take up to 15 minutes to finalize.

3. Verify your balance:

```bash
cast balance YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8547
```

4. Test sending transactions:

```bash
cast send ANY_ADDRESS --value 1 --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_WITH_FUNDS --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8547
```

For a more consistent test, you can also continuously send transactions to the rollup. This approach simulates a more realistic environment by continually submitting transactions, allowing you to see how the system handles ongoing activity. (See the next [section](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#transaction-flow-generator) for details.)

5. Check recipient balance:

```bash
cast balance ANY_ADDRESS --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8547
```

If successful, the recipient's balance should show 1 wei or the amount you sent if different.

#### Transaction Flow Generator

If you want to generate test transactions on your rollup, navigate to the `tx-generator` repository subfolder and follow the README instructions:

```bash
cd tx-generator
```

This script continuously generates transactions to help you evaluate your rollup and the Espresso Network.

### Hotshot Query Tool

You can also use this project in conjunction with the transaction generator to verify that the transactions you generate are properly submitted to Hotshot. By inputting the correct chain ID in the config, the [Hotshot Query Tool](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/hackathon-example)—a simple Go project—fetches and prints namespace transactions from the Hotshot query service. This tool sends HTTP requests and can be easily adapted for other API endpoints as needed.

### Deploying Your Rollup on Mainnet

To deploy your rollup on Arbitrum mainnet, update your configuration files with the appropriate parameters and follow the guide. Below are the key changes you need to make, along with references to the relevant sections of this guide:

* **TEE Verifier Address**:\
  Set the mock Espresso TEE verifier address to:
  * Mainnet: `0xE68c322e548c3a43C528091A3059F3278e0274Ed`
  * Testnet: `0x8354db765810dF8F24f1477B06e91E5b17a408bF`\
    Refer to [Deploy the Contracts](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#1-deploy-the-contracts).
* **Network Selection**:\
  Change the network in the nitro-contracts repository from `arbSepolia` to `arb1` when running smart contract and deployment scripts.\
  Refer to [Run Deployment](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#3-run-deployment).
* **Batch Poster Settings**:\
  Update the batch-poster configuration in the `config/full_node.json` file by:
  * Changing the hotshot URL to `https://query.main.net.espresso.network/v0`
  * Setting the light-client address to `0x47495bb99CCCBB1bda9F15b32B69093137F886Db`.\
    Refer to [Update Configuration Files](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#2-update-configuration-files).
* **Parent Chain ID**:\
  In `l2_chain_info.json`, change the `parent-chain-id` from `421614` to `42161` and optionally adjust the `chain-name`.\
  Refer to [Update Configuration Files](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#2-update-configuration-files).
* **RPC Endpoint**:
  * In `full_node.json`, update the RPC URL to the mainnet endpoint.
  * When testing, change the RPC URL from `https://arbitrum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com` to `https://arbitrum-one-rpc.publicnode.com`.\
    Refer to both [Update Configuration Files](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#2-update-configuration-files) and [Testing the Chain](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#4-testing-the-chain).

Apply these modifications to ensure your rollup is properly configured for mainnet deployment.

### Cloud Configuration

> **Info:** If you want to get up and running with this and you already know about cloud configuration, you can take the docker compose file and modify it as needed. If you aren't familiar with cloud environments, read on. (Note: This setup is for AWS, but it should work with any cloud.)

#### Booting A Chain on EC2

The first step is to launch an ec2 instance, which is a simple process. First, go into the console and either search for ec2, or select it from the quick select if you've used it before.

From here, we can configure the EC2 launch configuration. You can leave everything default, but feel free to change the settings if you've done this before. Under `Instance Type` you can select `t3.medium` or `t3.large`, but any cloud instance with at least 4 gigabytes of RAM and 2 CPU cores should be sufficient.

> **Info:** Please note that in our testing `t3.medium` seems to meet the requirements, but if you encounter instability, you might need to upgrade to the larger instance.

From here, make sure you configure your key pair, otherwise you will **not** have SSH access to the machine. You can use the auto generated security group for the instance. Make sure you allow SSH traffic as well. The following image should mostly reflect your configuration:

> **Security Note:** Keep your key pair secure and do not share it with others. Ensure that the permissions on your key file are set to be readable only by you (e.g., `chmod 400 your-key.pem`).

#### Setting up CloudWatch logging (Optional)

If you want to have access to the logs of your rollup without having to each time SSH into the instance, you can enable CloudWatch logging and send the logs to a CloudWatch log group. You will then be able to view the logs in the CloudWatch console. Follow the steps below to enable this:

1. **Create IAM Role**:

* In the advanced details section, create a new IAM profile to enable logging if you don't have one already.
* Click on **Create role** then select **EC2** as the use case in the next screen.
* Click "Next" then select the **AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs** policy in the next screen.
* Name your role in the next screen (e.g., "CloudWatchLogsRole") and create the role.

2. **Attach Role to EC2**:

* Return to the EC2 instance creation screen.
* In Advanced settings, select the role you just created and click **Launch instance**.

3. **Create Log Group**:
   * Navigate to the CloudWatch console and create two log groups for your rollup:
   * You can name them both `nitro-node-logs` and `validation-node-logs` or something similar. This is the name we give them in the docker-compose.yml file at the following step.
4. **Update Docker Configuration**: Modify your docker-compose.yml to include CloudWatch logging:

   ```yaml{19-24,42-47}
   version: '2.2'
   services:
     nitro:
       image: ghcr.io/espressosystems/nitro-espresso-integration/nitro-node:integration
       container_name: nitro-node
       ports:
         - "8547:8547"
         - "8548:8548"
         - "8549:8549"
       command: --conf.file /config/full_node.json
       volumes:
         - ./config:/config
         - ./wasm:/home/user/wasm/
         - ./database:/home/user/.arbitrum
       depends_on:
         - validation_node
       # ===== CloudWatch Configuration Start =====
       logging:
         driver: "awslogs"
         options:
           awslogs-region: "us-east-2" # Update to your EC2 instance's region
           awslogs-group: "nitro-node-logs"
           awslogs-stream: "nitro-node"
       # ===== CloudWatch Configuration End =====

     validation_node:
       image: ghcr.io/espressosystems/nitro-espresso-integration/nitro-node:integration
       container_name: validation_node
       ports:
         - "8949:8549"
       volumes:
         - ./config:/config
       entrypoint: /usr/local/bin/nitro-val
       command: --conf.file /config/validation_node_config.json
       # ===== CloudWatch Configuration Start =====
       logging:
         driver: "awslogs"
         options:
           awslogs-region: "us-east-2" # Update to your EC2 instance's region
           awslogs-group: "validation-node-logs"
           awslogs-stream: "validation-node"
       # ===== CloudWatch Configuration End =====
   ```

   > 📝 **Note:** Make sure to update the `awslogs-region` to match your EC2 instance's region.

#### Preparing Your Environment

1. **Move Key to .ssh Folder**:
   * Move your key from the downloads folder or any other folder to the `.ssh` folder:

     ```bash
     mv ~/Downloads/'your-key.pem' ~/.ssh/
     ```
2. **Test Your Connection**:
   * Use `ping` to test your connection with the IPv4 address:

     ```bash
     ping 'your-host'
     ```
   * If you encounter "Connection refused" or "Communication prohibited by filter," try using a different network, like mobile data.
3. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance**:
   * Run this command to connect to your EC2 instance using your key:

     ```bash
     ssh -i ~/.ssh/'your-key.pem' ec2-user@'your-host'
     ```

     > **Note:** Replace `your-host` with either the public DNS or IP address of your EC2 instance.

#### Transferring Files to Your EC2 Instance

1. **Create Config Folder**:
   * On another terminal, run the following to create a config folder on your instance:

     ```bash
     ssh -i ~/.ssh/'your-key.pem' ec2-user@'your-host' "mkdir -p ~/rollup/config"
     ```

     > **Note:** For this first step, you can also run the mkdir command from the instance terminal.
2. **Move Config Files to Instance**:
   * From the root of your git repo, transfer your config files to the instance's config folder:

     ```bash
     scp -i ~/.ssh/'your-key.pem' config/* ec2-user@'your-host':~/rollup/config/
     ```
3. **Move Docker File to Instance**:
   * Similarly, transfer the Docker Compose file to your instance:

     ```bash
     scp -i ~/.ssh/'your-key.pem' docker-compose.yml ec2-user@'your-host':~/rollup/
     ```

#### Configuring Docker

From inside your instance, install docker with the following steps:

```bash
sudo yum update -y && \
    sudo yum install -y docker && \
    sudo service docker start && \
    sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
```

You can now log out and back in, and your user, ec2-user, should have Docker access without needing sudo. The last thing we need is Docker Compose. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Amazon Linux 2023 has an older distribution of Docker, which does not yet support the compose subcommand. To access Docker Compose, you need to download it by executing the following steps:

> **Note:** Before continuing, exit and reconnect to your instance by running `exit` in the terminal.

```bash
# First, pull docker compose
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Then, add execute permissions
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify
docker-compose version
```

#### Running Docker Compose

1. **Connect to EC2 Instance**:
   * Return to the terminal connected to your EC2 instance, or reconnect if you have logged out. You can find the connection command in the [Preparing Your Environment](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/gitbook/blob/main/guides/rollup/nitro/running-the-espresso-network-with-arbitrum-cloud.md#preparing-your-environment) section.
2. **Run Docker Compose**:
   * From the rollup folder, execute the following command to start your services:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

     > **Note:** You can add the `-d` flag to run the containers in the background.
3. **Handle Permission Errors**:
   * If you encounter a permission error like:

     ```
     nitro-node | Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/local: permission denied
     ```
   * Create the necessary folders and set permissions:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p database wasm
     sudo chown -R 1000:1000 database wasm
     ```
   * This gives Docker container's user permission to write to these directories.

#### Testing the Connection

You can now that the connection to your rollup by for example checking your balance:

```bash
cast balance 'your-address' --rpc-url http://your-host:8547
```
