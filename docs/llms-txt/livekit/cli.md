## Overview

The LiveKit CLI (`lk`) provides command-line tools for managing LiveKit Cloud projects, creating applications from templates, and streamlining your development workflow.

The CLI integrates with LiveKit Cloud, allowing you to authenticate, manage projects, and deploy applications directly from your terminal. It also works with self-hosted LiveKit servers for local development and testing.

## CLI components

Use the LiveKit CLI to manage projects and create applications:

| Component | Description | Use cases |
| **Setup** | Install the CLI, authenticate with LiveKit Cloud, and test your setup with example applications. | Getting started, initial setup, and testing your LiveKit deployment. |
| **Project management** | Use the CLI to add, list, and manage projects on LiveKit Cloud or self-hosted servers. | Managing multiple projects, switching between environments, and configuring project settings. |
| **App templates** | Create applications from prebuilt templates for Python, React, Android, Swift, Flutter, and more. | Bootstrapping new projects, prototyping applications, and starting with best practices. |
