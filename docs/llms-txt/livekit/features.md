> An overview of telephony features for LiveKit.

## Overview

LiveKit telephony includes advanced features for call handling, audio quality, security, and compliance. Use these features to build production-ready telephony applications with enhanced call quality, secure communications, and regulatory compliance.

## Telephony features

Enhance your telephony applications with advanced call handling, audio quality, security, and compliance features.

| Feature | Description | Use cases |
| **DTMF** | Support for Dual-tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones, enabling integration with legacy IVR systems and allowing agents to receive DTMF input from callers. | IVR system integration, menu navigation, and collecting numeric input from callers. |
| **Region pinning** | Restrict network traffic to specific geographical regions to comply with local telephony regulations or data residency requirements. | Regulatory compliance, data residency requirements, and regional data isolation. |
| **Transfers** | Transfer calls between participants, including call forwarding and agent-assisted transfers for seamless call routing. | Call center workflows, call escalation, and transferring calls between agents or departments. |
| **HD voice** | Support for high-fidelity audio using wideband codecs for superior call quality compared to traditional PSTN calls. | High-quality voice applications, professional call centers, and applications requiring clear audio. |
| **Secure trunking** | Encrypt signaling and media traffic using TLS and SRTP to protect calls from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. | Secure communications, compliance requirements, and protecting sensitive call data. |
