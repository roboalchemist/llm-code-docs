# Introduction

> Deploy, manage, and monitor your LiveKit applications with a comprehensive suite of tools and flexible hosting options.

## Overview

LiveKit provides tools for deploying, managing, and monitoring your realtime apps in production. Whether you choose the fully managed LiveKit Cloud or deploy to custom environments, you have access to testing frameworks, observability tools, and deployment options that ensure your apps are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

Deploying with LiveKit means you can focus on building your app while LiveKit handles the complexity of WebRTC infrastructure, scaling, and global distribution. You can test and validate your agents, monitor their behavior in production, and deploy to the infrastructure that best fits your needs.

## Key concepts

Understand these core concepts to deploy and manage effective LiveKit applications.

### Observability

Monitor and analyze your agent's behavior with comprehensive observability tools. Use built-in LiveKit Cloud insights to view transcripts, traces, logs, and audio recordings, or collect custom data with data hooks for integration with external systems.
