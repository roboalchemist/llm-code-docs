## Overview

LiveKit provides prebuilt UI components for React, Shadcn, SwiftUI, Android, and Flutter to simplify frontend development for AI agent apps. These components abstract away complexity by managing state synchronization, track rendering, and room interactions, allowing developers to focus on building agent features rather than infrastructure.
