# Room service API

> Use LiveKit's built-in API to manage rooms, participants, and tracks in your backend.

## Overview

LiveKit has built-in APIs that let you to manage rooms, participants, and tracks. These APIs are designed for use by your backend and are fully distributed across multiple nodes: any instance is capable of fulfilling requests about any room, participant, or track.

## Implementation details

LiveKit provides [server SDKs](https://docs.livekit.io/reference.md#server-apis) that make it easy to use these APIs. However, you can implement your own client using the details in the following sections.

### Endpoints

Server APIs are built with [Twirp](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/intro.html), and differ from a traditional REST interface. Arguments are passed as JSON to an endpoint using the POST method.

The room service API is accessible via `/twirp/livekit.RoomService/<MethodName>`.

### Authorization header

All endpoints require a signed access token. This token should be set via HTTP header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>

```

LiveKit's server SDKs automatically include the above header.

### Post body

Twirp expects an HTTP POST request. The body of the request must be a JSON object (`application/json`) containing parameters specific to that request. Use an empty `{}` body for requests that don't require parameters.

For example, the following lists the room <room-name>. The token in this example requires the `roomList` [permission](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/authentication/tokens.md#video-grant).

```shell
curl -X POST <your-host>/twirp/livekit.RoomService/ListRooms \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer <token-with-roomList>" \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{ "names": ["<room-name>"] }'

```

When passing in parameters, the server accepts either `snake_case` or `camelCase` for keys.

## RoomService APIs

The RoomService API allows you to manage rooms, participants, tracks, and data.

### CreateRoom

Create a room with the specified settings. Requires `roomCreate` permission. This method is optional; a room is created automatically when the first participant joins it.

When creating a room, it's possible to configure automatic recording of the room or individually published tracks. See [Auto Egress](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/ingress-egress/egress/autoegress.md) docs.
