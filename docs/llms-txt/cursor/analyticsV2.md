# Analytics V2

> Advanced team usage and activity metrics tracking

We are working on a V2 release of our analytics infrastructure. This includes a refactor of the way in which we track various metrics.

As of **September 1, 2025**, and for users on **Cursor version 1.5**, analytics will utilize our V2 infrastructure. Prior versions would have undercounted various metrics, including:

* Total Accepted Lines of Code
* Total Suggested Lines of Code
* Total Tabs Accepted

Please stay tuned as we continue to invest in analytics and release new features in this space.
