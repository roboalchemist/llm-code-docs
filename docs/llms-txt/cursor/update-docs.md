# Update Docs

> Update docs for a repository by using Cursor CLI in GitHub Actions

Update documentation using Cursor CLI in GitHub Actions. Two approaches: full agent autonomy or deterministic workflow with agent-only file modifications.

            The GitHub CLI is available as `gh` and authenticated via `GH_TOKEN`. Git is available. You have write access to repository contents and can comment on pull requests, but you must not create or edit PRs.

            # Context:
            - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
            - Owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
            - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            - Base Ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
            - Head Ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
            - Docs Branch Prefix: ${{ env.BRANCH_PREFIX }}

            # Goal:
            - Implement an end-to-end docs update flow driven by incremental changes to the original PR.

            # Requirements:
            1) Determine what changed in the original PR and, if there have been multiple pushes, compute the incremental diffs since the last successful docs update.
            2) Update only the relevant docs based on those incremental changes.
            3) Maintain the persistent docs branch for this PR head using the Docs Branch Prefix from Context. Create it if missing, update it otherwise, and push changes to origin.
            4) You do NOT have permission to create PRs. Instead, post or update a single natural-language PR comment (1–2 sentences) that briefly explains the docs updates and includes an inline compare link to quick-create a PR

            # Inputs and conventions:
            - Use `gh pr diff` and git history to detect changes and derive incremental ranges since the last docs update.
            - Do not attempt to create or edit PRs directly. Use the compare link format above.
            - Keep changes minimal and consistent with repo style. If no doc updates are necessary, make no changes and post no comment.

            # Deliverables when updates occur:
            - Pushed commits to the persistent docs branch for this PR head.
            - A single natural-language PR comment on the original PR that includes the inline compare link above. Avoid posting duplicates; update a previous bot comment if present.

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT create branches, commit, push, or post PR comments. Only modify files in the working directory as needed. A later workflow step is responsible for publishing changes and commenting on the PR.

            # Goal:
            - Update repository documentation based on incremental changes introduced by this PR.

            # Requirements:
            1) Determine what changed in the original PR (use `gh pr diff` and git history as needed). If an existing persistent docs branch `${{ env.BRANCH_PREFIX }}/${{ github.head_ref }}` exists, you may use it as a read-only reference point to understand prior updates.
            2) Update only the relevant docs based on those changes. Keep edits minimal and consistent with repo style.
            3) Do NOT commit, push, create branches, or post PR comments. Leave the working tree with updated files only; a later step will publish.

            # Inputs and conventions:
            - Use `gh pr diff` and git history to detect changes and focus documentation edits accordingly.
            - If no doc updates are necessary, make no changes and produce no output.

            - Modified documentation files in the working directory only (no commits/pushes/comments).
