# Deprecation of protocol version 1 - November 2025

SDKs using version 1 of Ably's realtime protocol will be sunset on 1st November 2025.

This version was superseded by version 2 in January 2023. It introduced new functionality, with a more efficient and scalable backend implementation. New features are not available using version 1 of the protocol, nor in any SDKs implementing it.

## Request failures

On the 1st November 2025 attempts to connect to Ably using an SDK that uses version 1 of the protocol will start to fail. Failures will be phased, with only a fraction of traffic being rejected at first, until 100% of requests are rejected after several weeks.

Requests that are rejected will contain an error message and code referencing this deprecation notice and the associated [deprecation policy.](https://ably.com/docs/platform/deprecate.md)
