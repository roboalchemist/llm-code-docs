# Datadog integration

The Ably [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/ably/) integration enables you to monitor your application's statistics. Every 60 seconds, Ably streams a comprehensive set of [statistics](https://ably.com/docs/metadata-stats/stats.md#metrics) to the Datadog API.

<Aside data-type="note">
DataDog is available to [Enterprise](https://ably.com/docs/platform/pricing/enterprise.md) packages. A [DataDog Lite](#lite) version is available to [Standard](https://ably.com/docs/platform/pricing/standard.md) and [Pro](https://ably.com/docs/platform/pricing/pro.md) packages.

## Setup the Datadog integration

To connect Ably with Datadog, authorize the integration through Datadog's [OAuth](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/integrations/oauth_for_integrations/) flow. This process requires the `api_keys_write` scope, allowing Ably to push data to your Datadog account.

Once the integration is active, Datadog provides a specific Ably [dashboard](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/ably/), enabling you to monitor key metrics without extra setup.

The following steps setup the Datadog integration:

1. In Datadog, go to **Integrations**, find the **Ably** tile, and click **Install Integration**.
2. Click **Connect Accounts** to start the authorization process. Datadog redirects you to Ably.
3. Log in to your **Ably** account.
4. Select your application from the **Your Apps** page.
5. Navigate to **Integrations**, and select **Connect to Datadog**.
6. Datadog authorization page, authorize Ably using **OAuth** to grant access. The required authorization scope is: `api_keys_write`.
7. After completing authorization, you will be redirected to the **Ably dashboard**, and the process is complete.

## Remove access

Removing access disconnects Ably from Datadog, stopping data transmission and revoking authorization. Follow the steps remove the Ably and Datadog integration using either platform.

### Remove access using Ably

* Open your application's integration settings.
* Click **Remove** next to the Datadog integration.
* Ably revokes OAuth credentials and stops metric transmission.

### Remove access using Datadog

* Remove associated Ably API keys via **Integrations** or **API Keys**.
* Adjust scopes or entirely revoke OAuth tokens if necessary.

## Datadog lite

Datadog Lite is a lightweight version of the full Datadog integration that sends a reduced set of [statistics](https://ably.com/docs/metadata-stats/stats.md#metrics) to the Datadog API. This integration is designed for use cases where full statistics are not required, such as when you only need to monitor a limited number channels or connections.

DataDog Lite is available to [Pro](https://ably.com/docs/platform/pricing/pro.md) packages. A 30-day trial is also available to [Standard](https://ably.com/docs/platform/pricing/standard.md) packages, which can be enabled by contacting [Ably support](https://ably.com/support).

The following statistics are streamed from Ably to Datadog using the Lite integration:
