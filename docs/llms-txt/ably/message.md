# Message

The `Message` interface represents a single message in a chat room. Messages are received through the [`messages.subscribe()`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/api/javascript/messages.md#subscribe) method or retrieved via [`messages.history()`](https://ably.com/docs/chat/api/javascript/messages.md#history).

const updatedMessage = message.with(updateEvent);
```

</Code>

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Created | A new chat message was received. The value is `message.created`. |
| Updated | A chat message was updated. The value is `message.updated`. |
| Deleted | A chat message was deleted. The value is `message.deleted`. |

<Table id='MessageReactionSummaryEvent' >

| Property | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | The event type. | <Table id='MessageReactionSummaryEventType'/> |
| messageSerial | The serial of the message. | String |
| reactions | The aggregated reaction counts. | <Table id='MessageReactionSummary'/> |

</Table>

<Table id='MessageReactionSummaryEventType' >

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | A reaction summary update was received. The value is `reaction.summary`. |

</Table>

### Returns

`Message`

Returns a new message instance with the event applied, or the same instance if the event would be a no-op.

## Copy a message

`message.copy(params?: MessageCopyParams): Message`

Creates a copy of the message with specified fields replaced.

<Code>

### Javascript

```
const messageCopy = message.copy({ text: 'New text' });

### Parameters

The `copy()` method takes the following parameters:

<Table id='CopyParameters'>

</Table>

### Returns

`Message`

## Example

<Code>

### Javascript

```
import { ChatMessageAction } from '@ably/chat';

// Subscribe to messages and handle different actions
room.messages.subscribe((event) => {
  const message = event.message;

  console.log('Serial:', message.serial);
  console.log('From:', message.clientId);
  console.log('Text:', message.text);
  console.log('Sent at:', message.timestamp);
  console.log('Action:', message.action);

  // Check if message has metadata
  if (Object.keys(message.metadata).length > 0) {
    console.log('Metadata:', message.metadata);
  }

  // Check message version for updates or deletions
  if (message.action === ChatMessageAction.MessageUpdate) {
    console.log('Updated by:', message.version.clientId);
    console.log('Update reason:', message.version.description);
  }

  if (message.action === ChatMessageAction.MessageDelete) {
    console.log('Deleted by:', message.version.clientId);
    console.log('Delete reason:', message.version.description);
  }

  // Check reaction summary
  for (const [name, summary] of Object.entries(message.reactions.distinct)) {
    console.log(`${name}: ${summary.total} reactions from ${summary.clientIds.length} clients`);
  }
});
```

</Code>
