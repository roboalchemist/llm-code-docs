# App

> Wraps your app to provide global configurations and more.

## Usage

This component implements Reka UI [ConfigProvider](https://reka-ui.com/docs/utilities/config-provider) to provide global configuration to all components:

- Enables all primitives to inherit global reading direction.
- Enables changing the behavior of scroll body when setting body lock.
- Much more controls to prevent layout shifts.

It's also using [ToastProvider](https://reka-ui.com/docs/components/toast#provider) and [TooltipProvider](https://reka-ui.com/docs/components/tooltip#provider) to provide global toasts and tooltips, as well as programmatic modals and slideovers.

Wrap your entire application with the App component in your `app.vue` file:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <UApp>
    <NuxtPage />
  </UApp>
</template>
```
