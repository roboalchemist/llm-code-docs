# Recursive Retriever + Node References

This guide shows how you can use recursive retrieval to traverse node
relationships and fetch nodes based on “references”.

Node references are a powerful concept. When you first perform retrieval, you
may want to retrieve the reference as opposed to the raw text. You can have
multiple references point to the same node.

In this guide we explore some different usages of node references:

  * **Chunk references** : Different chunk sizes referring to a bigger chunk
  * **Metadata references** : Summaries + Generated Questions referring to a bigger chunk

    
    
    %pip install llama-index-llms-openai

    %autoreload 2
    
    %env OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY

If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install
LlamaIndex 🦙.

## Load Data + Setup

Section titled “Load Data + Setup”

In this section we download the Llama 2 paper and create an initial set of
nodes (chunk size 1024).

## Baseline Retriever

Section titled “Baseline Retriever”

Define a baseline retriever that simply fetches the top-k raw text nodes by
embedding similarity.

    
    
    base_index = VectorStoreIndex(base_nodes, embed_model=embed_model)
    
    base_retriever = base_index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=2)

we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec- tion 3.2.2.

challenging adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and
PPO optimization. 3.SafetyContextDistillation :

**Text:** Examples of evaluation prompts and responses can be found in
Appendix A.4.6. We then asked raters to judge models for safety violations on
a five-point Likert scale with the following definitions: •5- No safety
violations and very helpful •4- No safety violations and only minor non-safety
issues •3- No safety violations but not helpful or other major non-safety
issues •2- Mild or moderate safety violations 29

to note that these results are subject to limitations of the prompt set,
subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters.

    The key concepts for safety fine-tuning include supervised safety fine-tuning, safety RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), and safety context distillation. In supervised safety fine-tuning, adversarial prompts and safe demonstrations are gathered and included in the general supervised fine-tuning process. This helps the model align with safety guidelines and lays the foundation for high-quality human preference data annotation. Safety RLHF involves integrating safety in the general RLHF pipeline, which includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) optimization. Safety context distillation is the final step, where the RLHF pipeline is refined with context distillation. This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety preprompt and then fine-tuning the model on the safer responses without the preprompt.

## Chunk References: Smaller Child Chunks Referring to Bigger Parent Chunk

Section titled “Chunk References: Smaller Child Chunks Referring to Bigger
Parent Chunk”

In this usage example, we show how to build a graph of smaller chunks pointing
to bigger parent chunks.

During query-time, we retrieve smaller chunks, but we follow references to
bigger chunks. This allows us to have more context for synthesis.

## Metadata References: Summaries + Generated Questions referring to a bigger
chunk

Section titled “Metadata References: Summaries + Generated Questions referring
to a bigger chunk”

In this usage example, we show how to define additional context that
references the source node.

This additional context includes summaries as well as generated questions.

During query-time, we retrieve smaller chunks, but we follow references to
bigger chunks. This allows us to have more context for synthesis.

    The key concepts for safety fine-tuning include supervised safety fine-tuning, safety RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), and safety context distillation. Supervised safety fine-tuning involves gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstrations to train the model to align with safety guidelines. Safety RLHF integrates safety into the RLHF pipeline by training a safety-specific reward model and gathering challenging adversarial prompts for fine-tuning and optimization. Safety context distillation involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety preprompt and fine-tuning the model on the safer responses without the preprompt. These concepts are used to mitigate safety risks and improve the model's ability to produce safe and helpful responses.

## Evaluation

Section titled “Evaluation”

We evaluate how well our recursive retrieval + node reference methods work. We
evaluate both chunk references as well as metadata references. We use
embedding similarity lookup to retrieve the reference nodes.

We compare both methods against a baseline retriever where we fetch the raw
nodes directly.

In terms of metrics, we evaluate using both hit-rate and MRR.

### Dataset Generation

Section titled “Dataset Generation”

We first generate a dataset of questions from the set of text chunks.

    
    
    from llama_index.core.evaluation import (
    
        generate_question_context_pairs,
    
        EmbeddingQAFinetuneDataset,
    
    )
    
    from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
    
    
    
    
    import nest_asyncio
    
    
    
    
    nest_asyncio.apply()
    
    
    eval_dataset = generate_question_context_pairs(
    
        base_nodes, OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
    
    )
    
    
    100%|██████████| 93/93 [02:08<00:00,  1.38s/it]
    
    
    eval_dataset.save_json("data/llama2_eval_dataset.json")
    
    
    # optional
    
    eval_dataset = EmbeddingQAFinetuneDataset.from_json(
    
        "data/llama2_eval_dataset.json"
    
    )

### Compare Results

Section titled “Compare Results”

We run evaluations on each of the retrievers to measure hit rate and MRR.

We find that retrievers with node references (either chunk or metadata) tend
to perform better than retrieving the raw chunks.
