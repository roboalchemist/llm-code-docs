**Windsurf Autocomplete** is powered by our own models, trained in-house from scratch to optimize for speed and accuracy.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://exafunction.github.io/public/autocomplete/autocomplete-speed-fast.gif" />
</Frame>

Our autocomplete makes in-line and multi-line suggestions based on the context of your code.

Suggestions appear in grey text as you type. You can press `esc` to cancel a suggestion.
Suggestions will also disappear if you continue typing or navigating without accepting them.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### General Shortcuts

Here are the general shortcuts that apply for macOS.
Replace `⌘` with `Ctrl` and `⌥` with `Alt` to get the corresponding shortcuts on Windows/Linux.

* **Accept suggestion**: `⇥`
* **Cancel suggestion**: `esc`
* **Accept suggestion word-by-word**: `⌘+→` (VS Code), `⌥+⇧+\` (JetBrains)
* **Next/previous suggestion**: `⌥+]`/`⌥+[`
* **Trigger suggestion**: `⌥+\`

### JetBrains Shortcuts - 2.2.2 (stable) and 2.3.5 (pre-release) and later

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    * **Accept suggestion**: `⇥`

# Tips
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/autocomplete/tips



## Inline Comments

You can instruct autocomplete with the use of comments in your code.
Windsurf will read these comments and suggest the code to bring the comment to life.

<Frame>

</Frame>

This method can get you good mileage, but if you're finding value in writing natural-language instructions and having the AI execute them,
consider using [Windsurf Command](/command/overview).

## Fill In The Middle (FIM)

Windsurf's Autocomplete can Fill In The Middle (FIM).

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://exafunction.github.io/public/videos/inline_fim/inline_fim_codeium.mp4" />

Read more about in-line FIM on our blog [here](https://windsurf.com/blog/inline-fim-code-suggestions).

## Snooze

Click the Windsurf widget in the status bar towards the bottom right of your editor to see the option to switch Autocomplete off,
either temporarily or until you reenable it.


# Prompt Engineering
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/best-practices/prompt-engineering



If you're reading this, you're probably someone that already understands some of the use cases and limitations of LLMs. The better prompt and context that provide to the model, the better the outcome will be.

Similarly with Windsurf, there are best practices for crafting more effective prompts to get the most out of the tool, and get the best quality code possible to help you accelerate your workflows.

<Tip>For more complex tasks that may require you to [@-Mention](/chat/overview/#mentions) specific code blocks, use [Chat](/chat/overview) instead of [Command](/command/overview). </Tip>

## Components of a high quality prompt

* ***Clear objective or outcome***
  * What are you asking the model to produce?
  * Are you asking the model for a plan? For new code? Is it a refactor?
* ***All relevant context to perform the task(s)***
  * Have you properly used @-Mentions to ensure that the proper context is included?
  * Is there any context that is customer specific that may be unclear to Windsurf?
* ***Necessary constraints***
  * Are there any specific frameworks, libraries, or languages that must be utilized?
  * Are there any space or time complexity constraints?
  * Are there any security considerations?

## Examples

***Example #1:***

* **Bad**: Write unit tests for all test cases for an Order Book object.

* **Good**: Using `@class:unit-testing-module` write unit tests for `@func:src-order-book-add` testing for exceptions thrown when above or below stop loss

***Example #2***:

* **Bad**: Refactor rawDataTransform.

* **Good**: Refactor `@func:rawDataTransform` by turning the while loop into a for loop and using the same data structure output as `@func:otherDataTransformer`

***Example #3***:

* **Bad**: Create a new Button for the Contact Form.

* **Good**: Create a new Button component for the `@class:ContactForm` using the style guide in `@repo:frontend-components` that says “Continue”


# Common Use Cases
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/best-practices/use-cases



Windsurf serves a variety of use cases at a high level. However, we see certain use cases to be more common than others, especially among our enterprise customers within their production codebases.

## Code generation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Boilerplate code">
    **Guidance:** Windsurf should work well for this use case. Windsurf features including single-line suggestions, multi-line suggestions, and fill-in-the-middle (FIM) completions.

    **Best Practices:** Ensuring usage of Next Completion (`⌥ + ]`), Context Pinning, @ Mentions, and Custom Context will provide best results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Front-end development tasks">
    **Guidance:** Windsurf should work well for this use case. Windsurf features including single-line suggestions, multi-line suggestions, and fill-in-the-middle (FIM) completions.

    **Best Practices:** Ensuring usage of Next Completion (`⌥ + ]`), Context Pinning, @ Mentions, and Custom Context will provide best results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Back-end development tasks">
    **Guidance:** Windsurf should work well for this use case. Windsurf features including single-line suggestions, multi-line suggestions, and fill-in-the-middle (FIM) completions.

    **Best Practices:** Ensuring usage of Next Completion (`⌥ + ]`), Context Pinning, @ Mentions, and Custom Context will provide best results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Unit Test generation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generate unit tests and automatically remove redundant test cases">
    **Guidance:** Basic usage of Windsurf for generating unit tests should reliably generate 60-70% of unit tests. Edge case coverage will only be as good as the user prompting the model is.

    **Best Practices:** Use @ Mentions. Prompt Engineering best practices. Examples include:

    Write unit test for `@function-name` that tests all edge cases for X and for Y (e.g. email domain).

    Use `@testing-utility-class` to write a unit test for `@function-name`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generate sample data for test execution">
    **Guidance:** Good for low-hanging fruit use cases. For very specific API specs or in-house libraries, Windsurf will not know the intricacies well enough to ensure the quality of generated sample data.

    **Best Practices:** Be very specific about the interface you expect. Think about the complexity of the task (and if a single-shot LLM call will be sufficient to address).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Internal Code Commentary

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generate in-line comments and code descriptions">
    **Guidance:** Windsurf should work well for this use case. Use Windsurf Command or Windsurf Chat to generate in-line comments and code descriptions.

    **Best Practices:** Use @ Mentions and use Code Lenses as much as possible to ensure the scope of the LLM call is correct.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suggest improvements and clarifications">
    **Guidance:** Generally the Refactor button / Windsurf Command would be the best ways to prompt for improvements. Windsurf Chat is the best place to ask for explanations or clarifications. This is a little vague but Windsurf should be good at doing both.

    Windsurf Chat is the best place to ask for explanations or clarifications.

    This is a little vague but Windsurf should be good at doing both.

    **Best Practices**: Use the dropdown prompts (aka Windsurf's Refactor button) - we have custom prompts that are better engineered to deliver the answer you'd more likely expect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automate function headers (C/C++/C#)">
    **Guidance**: The best way to do this would be to create the header file, open chat, @ mention the function in the cpp file, and ask it to write the header function. Then do this iteratively for each in the cpp file. This is the best way to ensure no hallucinations along the way.

    **Best Practices**: Generally avoid trying to write a whole header file with one LLM call. Breaking down the granularity of the work makes the quality of the generated code significantly higher.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Documentation and Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create documentation as APIs created and inform proper context">
    **Guidance**: This is similar to test coverage where parts of the API spec that are common across many libraries Windsurf would be able to accurately decorate. However, things that are built special for your in-house use case Windsurf might struggle to do at the quality that you expect.

    **Best Practices**: Similar to test coverage, as much as possible, walk Windsurf's model through the best way to think about what the API is doing and it will be able to decorate better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search repo for APIs with natural language and generate code for integrations">
    **Guidance**: Windsurf's context length for a single LLM call is 16,000 tokens. Thus, depending on the scope of your search, Windsurf's repo-wide search capability may not be sufficient. Repo-wide, multi-step, multi-edit tasks will be supported in upcoming future Windsurf products.

    This is fundamentally a multi-step problem that single-shot LLM calls (i.e. current functionality of all AI code assistants) are not well equipped to address. Additionally, accuracy of result must be much higher than other use cases as integrations are especially fragile.

    **Best Practices**: Windsurf is not well-equipped to solve this problem today. If you'd like to test the extent of Windsurf's existing functionality, build out a step-by-step plan and prompt Windsurf individually with each step and high level of details to guide the AI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Code Refactoring

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code simplification and modularization">
    **Guidance**: Ensure proper scoping using Windsurf Code Lenses or @ Mentions to make sure all of the necessary context is passed to the LLM.

    Context lengths for a single LLM call are finite. Thus, depending on the scope of your refactor, this finite context length may be an issue (and for that matter, any single-shot LLM paradigm). Repo-wide, multi-step, multi-edit tasks are now supported in Windsurf's [Cascade](/windsurf/cascade).

    **Best Practices**: Try to break down the prompt as much as possible. The simpler and shorter the command for refactoring the better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restructuring code to improve readability / maintainability">
    **Guidance**: Ensure proper scoping using Windsurf Code Lenses or @ Mentions to make sure all of the necessary context is passed to the LLM.

    Windsurf's context length for a single LLM call is 16,000 tokens. Thus, depending on the scope of your refactor, Windsurf's context length may be an issue (and for that matter, any single-shot LLM paradigm). Repo-wide, multi-step, multi-edit tasks will be supported in upcoming future Windsurf products.

    **Best Practices**: Try to break down the prompt as much as possible. The simpler and shorter the command for refactoring the better.

In any given chat message you send, you can explicitly refer to context items from within the chat input by prefixing a word with `@`.

Context items available to be @-mentioned:

* Functions & classes
  * Only functions and classes in the local indexed
  * Also only available for languages we have built AST parsers for (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Java, C, C++, PHP, Ruby, C#, Perl, Kotlin, Dart, Bash, COBOL, and more)
* Directories and files in your codebase
* Remote repositories
* The contents of your in-IDE terminal (VS Code only).

You can also try `@diff`, which lets you chat about your repository's current `git diff` state.
The `@diff` feature is currently in beta.

<Tip>If you want to pull a section of code into the chat and you don't have @-Mentions available, you can: 1. highlight the code -> 2. right click -> 3. select 'Windsurf: Explain Selected Code Block'</Tip>

## Persistent Context

You can instruct the chat model to use certain context throughout a conversation and across different conversations

In this tab, you can see:

* **Custom Chat Instructions**: a short prompt guideline like "Respond in Kotlin and assume I have little familiarity with it" to orient the model towards a certain type of response.
* **Pinned Contexts**: items from your codebase like files, directories, and code snippets that you would like explicitly for the model to take into account.
  See also [Context Pinning](/context-awareness/overview#context-pinning).
* **Active Document**: a marker for your currently active file, which receives special focus.
* **Local Indexes**: a list of local repositories that the Windsurf context engine has indexed.

## Slash Commands

You can prefix a message with `/explain` to ask the model to explain something of your choice.
Currently, `/explain` is the only supported slash command.
[Let us know](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/) if there are other common workflows you want wrapped in a slash command.

## Copy and Insert

Sometimes, Chat responses will contain code blocks. You can copy a code block to your clipboard or insert it directly into the editor
at your cursor position by clicking the appropriate button atop the code block.

<Note>
  If you would like the AI to enact a change directly in your editor based on an instruction,
  consider using [Windsurf Command](/command/overview).
</Note>

## Inline Citations

Chat is aware of code context items, and its responses often contain linked references to snippets of code in your files.

</Frame>

## Regenerate with Context

By default, Windsurf makes a judgment call whether any given question is general or if it requires codebase context.

You can force the model to use codebase context by submitting your question with `⌘⏎`.
For a question that has already received a response, you rerun with context by clicking the sparkle icon.

# Overview

AI-powered in-line edits

**Windsurf Command** generates new or edits existing code via natural language inputs, directly in the editor window.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code">
    To invoke Command, press `⌘+I` on Mac or `Ctrl+I` on Windows/Linux.
    From there, you can enter a prompt in natural language and hit the Submit button (or `⌘+⏎`/`Ctrl+⏎`) to forward the instruction to the AI.
    Windsurf will then provide a multiline suggestion that you can accept or reject.

    If you highlight a section of code before invoking Command, then the AI will edit the selection spanned by the highlighted lines.
    Otherwise, it will generate code at your cursor's location.

    <Frame>
      <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://exafunction.github.io/public/videos/codeium_command_vscode.mp4" />
    </Frame>

    You can accept, reject, or follow-up a generation by clicking the corresponding code lens above the generated diff,
    or by using the appropriate shortcuts (`⌥+A`/`Alt+A`, `⌥+R`/`Alt+R`, and `⌥+F`/`Alt+F`, respectively).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JetBrains">
    To invoke Command, press `⌘+I` on Mac or `Ctrl+I` on Windows/Linux.

    <Note>
      Some users have reported keyboard conflicts with this shortcut, so `⌘+⇧+I` and `⌘+\`on Mac (`Ctrl+⇧+I` and `Ctrl+\` on Windows/Linux)
      will also work.
    </Note>

    The Command invocation will open an interactive popup at the appropriate location in the code.
    You can enter a prompt in natural language and Windsurf will provide a multiline suggestion that you can accept or reject.
    If you highlight a section of code before invoking Command, then the AI will edit the selection spanned by the highlighted lines.
    Otherwise, it will generate code at your cursor's location.

    <Frame>
      <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://exafunction.github.io/public/videos/codeium_command_jetbrains.mp4" />
    </Frame>

    The Command popup will persist in the editor if you scroll around or focus your cursor elsewhere in the editor.
    It will act on your most recently highlighted selection of code or your most recent cursor position.
    While it is active, the Command popup gives you the following options:

    * **Cancel** (`Esc`): this will close the popup and undo any code changes that may have occured while the popup was open.
    * **Accept generation** (`⌘+⏎`): this option appears after submitting an instruction and receiving a generation.
      It will write the suggestion into the code editor and close the popup.
    * **Undo generation** (`⌘+⌫`): this option appears after submitting an instruction and receiving a generation.
      It will restore the code to its pre-Command state without closing the popup, while reinserting your most recent instruction
      into the input box.
    * **Follow-up**: this option appears after submitting an instruction and receiving a generation.
      You can enter a second (and third, fourth, etc.) instruction and submit it,
      which will undo the currently shown generation and rerun Command using your comma-concatenated instruction history.

# Best Practices

Windsurf Command is great for file-scoped, in-line changes that you can describe as an instruction in natural language.
Here are some pointers to keep in mind:

* The model that powers Command is larger than the one powering autocomplete.
  It is slower but more capable, and it is trained to be especially good at instruction-following.

* If you highlight a block of code before invoking Command, it will edit the selection. Otherwise, it will do a pure generation.

* Using Command effectively can be an art. Simple prompts like "Fix this" or "Refactor" will likely work
  thanks to Windsurf's context awareness.
  A specific prompt like "Write a function that takes two inputs of type `Diffable` and implements the Myers diff algorithm"
  that contains a clear objective and references to relevant context may help the model even more.


# Refactors, Docstrings, and More
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/command/related-features

Features powered by Command

Command enables streamlined experiences for a few common operations.

## Function Refactors and Docstring Generation

Above functions and classes, Windsurf renders *code lenses*,
which are small, clickable text labels that invoke Windsurf's AI capabilities on the labeled item.

<Tip>You can disable code lenses by clicking the `✕` to the right of the code lens text.</Tip>

The `Refactor` and `Docstring` code lenses in particular will invoke Command.

* If you click `Refactor`, Windsurf will prompt you with a dropdown of selectable, pre-populated
  instructions that you can choose from. You can also write your own. This is equivalent to highlighting the function and invoking Command.
* If you click `Docstring`, Windsurf will generate a docstring for you above the function header.
  (In Python, the docstring will be correctly generated *underneath* the function header.)

  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/jetbrains_docstrings.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=508c5797d57e88cf7b7db1c07a1e45c7" data-path="assets/jetbrains_docstrings.mp4" />
</Frame>

## Smart Paste

This feature allows you to copy code and paste it into a file in your IDE written in a different programming language.
Use `⌘+⌥+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+V` (Windows/Linux) to invoke Smart Paste.
Behind the scenes, Windsurf will detect the language of the destination file and use Command to translate the code in your clipboard.
Windsurf's context awareness will try to write it to fit in your code, for example by referencing proper variable names.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://exafunction.github.io/public/videos/demos/Smart_Paste_Demo_1080p.mp4" />
</Frame>

Some possible use cases:

* **Migrating code**: you're rewriting JavaScript into TypeScript, or Java into Kotlin.
* **Pasting from Stack Overflow**: you found a utility function online written in Go, but you're using Rust.
* **Learning a new language**: you're curious about Haskell and want to see what your would look like if written in it.


# Command

Cmd/Ctrl + I for in-line code generations and edits

**Command** generates new or edits existing code via natural language inputs, directly in the editor window.

<Tip>Command does NOT consume any premium model credits.</Tip>

To invoke Command, press `⌘+I` on Mac or `Ctrl+I` on Windows/Linux.

You can enter a prompt in natural language and hit the Submit button (or `⌘+⏎`/`Ctrl+⏎`) to forward the instruction to the AI.

If you highlight a section of code before invoking Command, then the AI will edit the selection spanned by the highlighted lines.
Otherwise, it will generate code at your cursor's location.

# Best Practices

Command is great for file-scoped, in-line changes that you can describe as an instruction in natural language.
Here are some pointers to keep in mind:

* The model that powers Command is larger than the one powering autocomplete.
  It is slower but more capable, and it is trained to be especially good at instruction-following.

* If you highlight a block of code before invoking Command, it will edit the selection. Otherwise, it will do a pure generation.

* Using Command effectively can be an art. Simple prompts like "Fix this" or "Refactor" will likely work
  thanks to Windsurf's context awareness.
  A specific prompt like "Write a function that takes two inputs of type `Diffable` and implements the Myers diff algorithm"
  that contains a clear objective and references to relevant context may help the model even more.

</Frame>

The `Explain` code lens will invoke Cascade, which will simply explain what the function or class does and how it works.

The `Refactor` and `Docstring` code lenses in particular will invoke Command.

* If you click `Refactor`, Windsurf will prompt you with a dropdown of selectable, pre-populated
  instructions that you can choose from. You can also write your own. This is equivalent to highlighting the function and invoking Command.
* If you click `Docstring`, Windsurf will generate a docstring for you above the function header.
  (In Python, the docstring will be correctly generated *underneath* the function header.)

# Fast Context
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/fast-context



Fast Context is a specialized subagent in Windsurf that retrieves relevant code from your codebase up to 20x faster than traditional agentic search. It powers Cascade's ability to quickly understand large codebases while maintaining the intelligence of frontier models.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/4npKb0dOJvGVxGDm/assets/windsurf/cascade/fastcontext.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=4npKb0dOJvGVxGDm&q=85&s=7fa30dffb4eb96df65f8a302fc4cff50" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/fastcontext.mp4" />

## Using Fast Context

When Cascade receives a query that requires code search, Fast Context will trigger automatically. You can also force it to activate by using `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) when submitting your query.

You'll notice Fast Context is working when:

* Cascade quickly identifies relevant files across your codebase
* Large codebase queries complete faster than before
* Cascade spends less time reading irrelevant code

## How It Works

Fast Context uses `SWE-grep` and `SWE-grep-mini`, custom models trained specifically for rapid code retrieval. These models combine the speed of traditional embedding search with the intelligence of agentic exploration.

When you make a query to Cascade that requires searching through your codebase, Fast Context automatically activates to:

1. Identify relevant files and code sections using parallel tool calls
2. Execute multiple searches simultaneously
3. Return targeted results in seconds rather than minutes

This approach prevents context pollution and aims to mitigate the traditional speed-accuracy tradeoff. By delegating retrieval to a specialized subagent, Cascade conserves its context budget and intelligence for the actual task at hand.

## SWE-grep Models

Fast Context is powered by the SWE-grep model family:

* **SWE-grep**: High-intelligence variant optimized for complex retrieval tasks
* **SWE-grep-mini**: Ultra-fast variant serving at over 2,800 tokens per second

Both models are trained using reinforcement learning to excel at parallel tool calling and efficient codebase navigation. They execute up to 8 parallel tool calls per turn over a maximum of 4 turns, allowing them to explore different parts of your codebase simultaneously.

The models use a restricted set of cross-platform compatible tools (grep, read, glob) to ensure consistent performance across different operating systems and development environments.


# Overview
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/overview

On codebase context and related features

Windsurf's context engine builds a deep understanding of your codebase, past actions, and next intent.

Historically, code-generation approaches focused on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a codebase,
which is difficult to scale to the needs of every individual user.
A more recent and popular approach leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
which focuses on techniques to construct highly relevant, context-rich prompts
to elicit accurate answers from an LLM.

We've implemented an optimized RAG approach to codebase context,
which produces higher quality suggestions and fewer hallucinations.

<Note>
  Windsurf offers full fine-tuning for enterprises, and the best solution
  combines fine-tuning with RAG.
</Note>

## Default Context

Out of the box, Windsurf takes multiple relevant sources of context into consideration.

* The current file and other open files in your IDE, which are often very relevant to the code you are currently writing.
* The entire local codebase is then indexed (including files that are not open),
  and relevant code snippets are sourced by Windsurf's retrieval engine as you write code, ask questions, or invoke commands.
* For Pro users, we offer expanded context lengths increased indexing limits, and higher limits on custom context and pinned context items.
* For Teams and Enterprise users, Windsurf can also index remote repositories.
  This is useful for companies whose development organization works across multiple repositories.

## Knowledge Base (Beta)

<Note>Only available for Teams and Enterprise customers. Currently not available to Hybrid customers.</Note>

This feature allows teams to pull in Google Docs as shared context or knowledge sources for their entire team.

Currently, only Google Docs are supported. Images are not imported, but charts, tables, and formatted text are fully supported.

<Card title="Knowledge Base" icon="people-group" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Configure knowledge base settings for your team. This page will only be visible with admin privileges.
</Card>

Admins must manually connect with Google Drive via OAuth, after which they can add up to 50 Google Docs as team knowledge sources.

Cascade will have access to the docs specified in the Windsurf dashboard. These docs do not obey individual user access controls, meaning if an admin makes a doc available to the team, all users will have access to it regardless of access controls on the Google Drive side.

### Best Practices

Context Pinning is great when your task in your current file depends on information from other files.
Try to pin only what you need. Pinning too much may slow down or negatively impact model performance.

Here are some ideas for effective context pinning:

* Module Definitions: pinning class/struct definition files that are inside your repo but in a module separate from your currently active file.
* Internal Frameworks/Libraries: pinning directories with code examples for using frameworks/libraries.
* Specific Tasks: pinning a file or folder defining a particular interface (e.g., `.proto` files, abstract class files, config templates).
* Current Focus Area: pinning the "lowest common denominator" directory containing the majority of files needed for your current coding session.
* Testing: pinning a particular file with the class you are writing unit tests for.

## Chat-Specific Context Features

When conversing with Windsurf Chat, you have various ways of leveraging codebase context,

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Does Windsurf index my codebase?

Yes, Windsurf does index your codebase. It also uses LLMs to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on your codebase using our own [M-Query](https://youtu.be/DuZXbinJ4Uc?feature=shared\&t=606) techniques.

Indexing performance and features vary based on your workflow and your Windsurf plan. For more information, please visit our [context awareness page](https://windsurf.com/context).


# Remote Indexing
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/remote-indexing



<Note> This feature is only available in the Windsurf Plugins for Enterprise plans. </Note>

While Local Indexing works great, the user may want to index codebases that they do not have stored locally for our models to take in as context.

For this use case, organizations on Teams and Enterprise plans can use Windsurf's Indexing Service to globally import all the relevant repositories. The indexing and embedding is then performed by Windsurf's servers (on an isolated tenant), and once the index is created, it is available to be queried by any member of the Team.

## Adding a repository

From [https://windsurf.com/indexing](https://windsurf.com/indexing) you can add a repository to index. Currently we support Git repositories from GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket.

</Frame>

You can choose to index a particular branch and to automatically re-index the repository after some number of days.

## Security Guarantees

We clone the repository in order to create the index, but once we finish creating embeddings for the codebase we delete all the code and code snippets **assuming that the Store Snippets setting is unchecked.** We don't persist anything other than the embeddings themselves, from which you cannot derive the original code.

Furthermore, all indexing and embedding is performed on a single-tenant instance—nothing about the indexing process is shared between multiple Windsurf Teams customers.


# Windsurf Ignore
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/windsurf-ignore



## WindsurfIgnore

By default, Windsurf Indexing will ignore:

* Paths specified in `gitignore`
* Files in `node_modules`
* Hidden pathnames (starting with ".")

When a file is ignored, it will not be indexed, and also does not count against the Indexing Max Workspace Size file counts.
Files included in .gtiignore cannot be edited by Cascade.

If you want to further configure files that Windsurf Indexing ignores, you can add a `.codeiumignore` file to your repo root, with the same syntax as `.gitignore`

</Frame>

### Global .codeiumignore

For enterprise customers managing multiple repositories, you can enforce ignore rules across all repositories by placing a global `.codeiumignore` file in the `~/.codeium/` folder. This global configuration will apply to all Windsurf workspaces on your system.

The global `.codeiumignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and works in addition to any repository-specific `.codeiumignore` files.

## System Requirements

When first enabled, Windsurf will consume a fraction of CPU while it indexes the workspace. Depending on your workspace size, this should take 5-10 minutes, and only needs to happen once per workspace. CPU usage will return to normal automatically. Windsurf Indexing also requires RAM (\~300MB for a 5000-file workspace).

The "Max Workspace Size (File Count)" setting determines the largest workspace for which Windsurf Indexing will try to index a particular workspace / module. If your workspace does not appear to be indexed, please try adjusting this number higher. For users with \~10GB of RAM, we recommend setting this no higher than 10,000 files.

* Field aliases must be unique across all selections and aggregations
* If no aggregation function is specified, it defaults to UNSPECIFIED


# Error Handling
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/api-reference/errors

Common error messages and debugging tips for the Analytics API

## Overview

The Analytics API returns detailed error messages to help debug invalid queries. This page covers common error scenarios and how to resolve them.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns an error response with a descriptive message:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

## Common Errors

### Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid service key">
    **Error:** `Invalid service key`

    **Cause:** The provided service key is not valid or has been revoked.

    **Solution:**

    * Verify your service key is correct
    * Check that the service key hasn't been revoked
    * Generate a new service key if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient permissions">
    **Error:** `Insufficient permissions`

    **Cause:** The service key doesn't have the required "Teams Read-only" permissions.

    **Solution:**

    * Update the service key permissions in team settings
    * Ensure the service key has "Teams Read-only" access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Query Structure Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing selections">
    **Error:** `at least one field or aggregation is required`

    **Cause:** The query request doesn't contain any selections or aggregations.

    **Solution:** Add at least one selection to your query request:

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid data source">
    **Error:** `invalid query table: QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_UNSPECIFIED`

    **Cause:** There's likely a typo in the `data_source` field.

    **Solution:** Double-check the spelling of your data source. Valid options:

    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_USER_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_CHAT_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_COMMAND_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_PCW_DATA`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mixed aggregation functions">
    **Error:** `all selection fields should have an aggregation function, or none of them should`

    **Cause:** Some selections have aggregation functions while others don't.

    **Solution:** Either add aggregation functions to all selections or remove them from all:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      },
      {
        "field": "num_lines_accepted",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_UNSPECIFIED"
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      },
      {
        "field": "num_lines_accepted",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Field and Aggregation Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid aggregation function">
    **Error:** `invalid aggregation function for string type field ide: QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM`

    **Cause:** The aggregation function is not supported for the specified field type.

    **Solution:** Check the [Available Fields](/plugins/accounts/api-reference/custom-analytics#available-fields) section to see which aggregation functions are valid for each field. String fields typically only support `COUNT` and `UNSPECIFIED`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Distinct field aggregation">
    **Error:** `tried to aggregate on a distinct field: distinct_developer_days. Consider aggregating on the non-distinct fields instead: [api_key date]`

    **Cause:** Fields with the "distinct\_\*" pattern cannot be used in the aggregations section.

    **Solution:** Use the suggested alternative fields for aggregation:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "aggregations": [
      {
        "field": "distinct_developer_days",
        "name": "distinct_developer_days"
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "aggregations": [
      {
        "field": "api_key",
        "name": "api_key"
      },
      {
        "field": "date",
        "name": "date"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate field aliases">
    **Error:** `duplicate field alias for selection/aggregation: num_acceptances`

    **Cause:** Multiple selections or aggregations have the same name.

    **Solution:** Ensure all field aliases are unique. Remember that if no name is specified, it defaults to `{aggregation_function}_{field_name}`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Filtering Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid group name">
    **Error:** `invalid group name: GroupName`

    **Cause:** The specified group name doesn't exist in your organization.

    **Solution:**

    * Double-check the group name spelling
    * Verify the group exists in your team settings
    * Use the exact group name as it appears in your team dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid timestamp format">
    **Error:** `invalid timestamp format`

    **Cause:** The timestamp is not in the correct RFC 3339 format.

    **Solution:** Use the correct timestamp format:

    ```
    2023-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```

    **Valid examples:**

    * `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`
    * `2024-12-31T23:59:59Z`
    * `2024-06-15T12:30:45Z`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conflicting filters">
    **Error:** `Cannot use both group_name and emails parameters`

    **Cause:** Both `group_name` and `emails` parameters were provided in a Cascade Analytics request.

    **Solution:** Use either `group_name` OR `emails`, but not both:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "group_name": "engineering",
      "emails": ["user@example.com"]
    }
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "group_name": "engineering"
    }
    ```

    **Or:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "emails": ["user@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate limit exceeded">
    **Error:** `429 Too Many Requests`

    **Cause:** You've exceeded the API rate limit.

    **Solution:**

    * Wait before making additional requests
    * Implement exponential backoff in your client
    * Consider batching multiple queries into single requests where possible
    * Contact support if you need higher rate limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with basic queries and gradually add complexity:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "service_key": "your_key",
  "query_requests": [
    {
      "data_source": "QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_USER_DATA",
      "selections": [
        {
          "field": "num_acceptances",
          "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_COUNT"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Validate Field Names

Double-check field names against the [Available Fields](/plugins/accounts/api-reference/custom-analytics#available-fields) documentation.

### 3. Check Aggregation Compatibility

Ensure your aggregation functions are compatible with the field types you're selecting.

### 4. Test Filters Separately

If your query isn't returning expected results, try removing filters one by one to isolate the issue.

### 5. Use Proper JSON Formatting

Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and all strings are quoted correctly.

## Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check the error message carefully** - Most errors include specific guidance on how to fix the issue
2. **Review the examples** - Compare your query structure to the working examples in the documentation
3. **Contact support** - Reach out to [Windsurf Support](https://windsurf.com/support) with your specific error message and query

## API Version Notes

Error handling and validation have been improved in API version 1.10.0 and later. If you're using an older version, consider updating to get more detailed error messages.

# Role Based Access & Management
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/rbac-role-management

Configure and manage role-based access controls, permissions, and user management for your Windsurf team

Windsurf's Role-Based Access Control system provides granular, role-based access to enterprise resources, enabling administrators to assign permissions and roles dynamically for secure and efficient access management.

<Note>Role-based access features are available for Teams and Enterprise plans.</Note>

## Role Based Access Controls

Windsurf's role-based access system allows enterprise organizations to implement fine-grained access controls across all team resources. The system enables:

* **Granular Permission Management**: Control access to specific features and data based on user roles
* **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Administrators can assign and modify roles for individual users or user groups
* **Secure Resource Access**: Ensure users only have access to the resources they need for their responsibilities
* **Audit and Compliance**: Track user permissions and access patterns for security and compliance requirements

The role-based access system integrates seamlessly with Windsurf's existing authentication mechanisms, including SSO and SCIM, to provide a comprehensive security framework for enterprise deployments.

## Role Management

<Note>We are continually working to improve role management features and functionality.</Note>

Roles can be created and managed in the Windsurf admin console via the Settings tab. For Windsurf's SaaS offering, access the Settings tab at:

<Card title="Team Settings" horizontal={true} icon="gear" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Manage roles, permissions, and team settings from the admin console.
</Card>

### Creating a New Role

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Role Management">
    Go to [windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings) and locate the Role Management section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Role">
    Click the **"Create Role"** button to start creating a new role.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Role">
    Enter a descriptive name for the role and select the appropriate permissions from the checkbox list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Role">
    Review your selections and save the new role. It will now be available for assignment to users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Role Permissions

Windsurf provides two default roles out of the box:

* **Admin Role**: Includes all available permissions for complete system access
* **User Role**: Includes no permissions by default, providing a minimal access baseline

### Modifying Role Permissions

To modify permissions for custom roles, click the permissions dropdown next to the role name in the Role Management section. This allows you to add or remove specific permissions as needed.

### Disable Windsurf Access Feature

For administrators who need access to team analytics and audit/attribution logging but do not wish to consume a license, Windsurf provides a "disable Windsurf access" feature.

To access this feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Manage Team">
    Go to the **"Manage Team"** tab in your team settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit User">
    Find the user you want to modify and click **"Edit"** next to their name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Access">
    In the user edit dialog, you can disable their Windsurf access while maintaining their administrative permissions for analytics and logging.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## User Groups

<Note>User Groups are available for Enterprise organizations with SCIM integration enabled.</Note>

For enterprise organizations, Windsurf offers the ability to split users into multiple user groups via SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration. This feature enables:

* **Organizational Structure**: Mirror your company's organizational structure within Windsurf
* **Group-Based Analytics**: View analytics and usage data filtered by specific user groups
* **Delegated Administration**: Assign group administrators who can manage specific user groups
* **Scalable Management**: Efficiently manage large numbers of users through group-based operations

User groups are automatically synchronized with your identity provider through SCIM, ensuring that organizational changes are reflected in Windsurf's access controls.

## User Management

Windsurf's role-based access functionality allows administrators to assign roles to individual users or user groups, providing flexible access control management.

### Assigning Roles to Users

User role management is performed in the Windsurf admin console at [windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Management">
    Go to the team settings page and locate the user management section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find User">
    Scroll through the user list or use the search functionality to find the user you want to modify. Users can be sorted alphabetically by name, email, sign-up time, or last login.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit User Role">
    Click **"Edit"** next to the user's name to open the user management dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Role">
    In the pop-out window, select the appropriate role from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Confirm your selection and save the changes. The new role will be applied immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Administrative Hierarchy

Windsurf's role-based access system recognizes different levels of administrative access:

* **Super Admin**: Users with the admin role in the "all users" group have complete system access and can modify any role or permission
* **Group Admins**: Administrators of specific user groups can only make role and permission changes within their assigned groups

This hierarchical structure ensures that administrative responsibilities can be delegated appropriately while maintaining security boundaries.

### User Sorting and Management

The user management interface provides several sorting options to help administrators efficiently manage large teams:

* **Alphabetical by Name**: Sort users by their display names
* **Email Address**: Sort users by their email addresses
* **Sign-up Time**: View users in order of when they joined the team
* **Last Login**: Sort by most recent activity to identify active users

These sorting options make it easier to find specific users and understand team engagement patterns.

    ## Part 2: Configure SAML and User Attributes in Microsoft Entra ID

    <Note>All steps in this section are performed in the **Microsoft Entra ID admin center**.</Note>

    4. In your new Windsurf application, click on **Set up single sign on**, then click **SAML**.

    5. Click on **Edit** under **Basic SAML Configuration**.

    6. **Keep this Entra ID tab open** and open a new tab to navigate to the **Windsurf Teams SSO settings** at [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings).

    7. In the **Microsoft Entra ID** SAML configuration form:
       * **Identifier (Entity ID)**: Copy the **SP Entity ID** value from the **Windsurf SSO settings page**
       * **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**: Copy the **Callback URL** value from the **Windsurf SSO settings page**
       * Click **Save** at the top

    8. Configure user attributes for proper name display. In **Microsoft Entra ID**, under **Attributes & Claims**, click **Edit**.

    9. Create 2 new claims by clicking **Add new claim** for each:
       * **First claim**: Name = `firstName`, Source attribute = `user.givenname`
       * **Second claim**: Name = `lastName`, Source attribute = `user.surname`

    ## Part 3: Configure SSO Settings in Windsurf Portal

    <Note>Complete the configuration in the **Windsurf portal** ([https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings)).</Note>

    10. In the **Windsurf SSO settings page**:
        * **Pick your SSO ID**: Choose a unique identifier for your team's login portal (this cannot be changed later)
        * **IdP Entity ID**: Copy the value from **Microsoft Entra ID** under **Set up Windsurf** → **Microsoft Entra Identifier**
        * **SSO URL**: Copy the **Login URL** value from **Microsoft Entra ID**
        * **X509 Certificate**: Download the **SAML certificate (Base64)** from **Microsoft Entra ID**, open the file, and paste the text content here

    11. In the **Windsurf portal**, click **Enable Login with SAML**, then click **Save**.

    12. **Test the configuration**: Click **Test Login** to verify the SSO configuration works as expected.

    <Note>**Important**: Do not log out or close the Windsurf settings page until you've successfully tested the login. If the test fails, you may need to troubleshoot your configuration before proceeding.</Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Okta SSO">
    Windsurf Enterprise now supports sign in with Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML. If your organization uses Microsoft Entra, Okta, Google Workspaces, or some other identity provider that supports SAML, you will be able to use SSO with Windsurf.

    <Note>Windsurf only supports SP-initiated SSO; IDP-initiated SSO is NOT currently supported.</Note>

  <Tab title="Azure SCIM">
    Windsurf supports SCIM synchronization for users and groups with Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD. It isn't necessary to setup SSO to use SCIM synchronization, but it is highly recommended.

    You'll need:

    * Admin access to Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD
    * Admin access to Windsurf
    * An existing Windsurf Application on Entra ID (normally from your existing SSO application)

    ## Step 1: Navigate to the existing Windsurf Application

    Go to Microsoft Entra ID on Azure, click on Enterprise applications on the left sidebar, and then click on the existing Windsurf application in the list.

    Click on Save to finish, you have now enabled user and group syncing for SCIM. Only users and groups assigned to the application will be synced to Windsurf. Note that removing users only disables them access to Windsurf (and stops them from taking up a seat) rather than deleting users due to Azure's SCIM design.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Okta SCIM">
    Windsurf supports SCIM synchronization for users and groups with Okta. It isn't necessary to setup SSO to use SCIM synchronization, but it is highly recommended.

    You'll need:

    * Admin access to Okta
    * Admin access to Windsurf
    * An existing Windsurf Application on Okta (normally from your existing SSO application)

    ## Step 1: Navigate to the existing Windsurf Application

    Go to Okta, click on Applications, Applications on the left sidebar, and then click on the existing Windsurf application in the application list.

    ## Step 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning

    Under the general tab, App Settings click on Edit on the top right. Then tick the 'Enable SCIM Provisioning' checkbox, then click Save. A new provisioning tab should have showed up on the top.

    Now go to provisioning, click Edit and input in the following fields:

    SCIM connector base URL: [https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2](https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2)

    Unique identifier field for users: email

    Supported provisioning actions: Push New Users, Push Profile Updates, Push Groups

    Authentication Mode: HTTP Header

    For HTTP Header - Authorization, you can generate the token from

    * [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings) and go to the Other Settings and find Service Key Configuration
    * Click on Add Service Key, and give your key a name
    * Copy the API key, go back to Okta and paste it to HTTP Header - Authorization

    Click on Save after filling out Provisioning Integration.

    ## Step 3: Setup Provisioning

    Under the provisioning tab, on the left there should be two new tabs. Click on To App, and Edit Provisioning to App. Tick the checkbox for Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users, and click Save.

    After this step, all users assigned to the group will now be synced to Windsurf.

    ## Step 4: Setup Group Provisioning (Optional)

    In order to sync groups to Windsurf, you will have to specify which groups to push. Under the application, click on the Push Groups tab on top. Now click on + Push Groups -> Find Groups by name. Filter for the group you would like to add, make sure Push group memberships immediately is checked, and then click Save. The group will be created and group members will be synced to Windsurf. Groups can then be used to filter for group analytics in the analytics page.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SCIM API">
    This guide shows how to create and maintain groups in Windsurf with the SCIM API.

    There are reasons one may want to provision groups manually rather than with their Identity Provider (Azure/Okta). Companies may want Groups provisioned from a different internal source (HR website, Sourcecode Management Tool etc.) that Windsurf doesn't have access to, or companies may finer control to Groups than what their Idendity Provider provides. Groups can thus be created with an API via HTTP request instead. The following provides examples on the HTTP request via CURL.

    There are 5 main APIs here, Create Group, Add group members, Replace group members, Delete Group, and List Users in a Group.

    ### Create Group

    ```
    curl -k -X POST https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups -d '{
    "displayName": "<group name>",
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"]
    }' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Add Group Members

    ```
    curl -X PATCH https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -d '{"schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations":[
    {
    "op": "add",
    "path":"members",
    "value": [{"value": "<email 1>"}, {"value": "<email 2>"}]
    }]}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Replace Group Members

    ```
    curl -X PATCH https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -d '{"schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations":[
    {
    "op": "replace",
    "path":"members",
    "value": [{"value": "<email 1>"}, {"value": "<email 2>"}]
    }]}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Delete Group

    ```
    curl -X DELETE https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### List Group

    ```
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" "https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups"
    ```

    ### List Users in a Group

    ```
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" "https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group_id>"
    ```

    You'll have to at least create the group first, and then replace group to create a group with members in them. You'll also need to URL encode the group names if your group name has a special character like space, so a Group name such as 'Engineering Group' will have to be 'Engineering%20Group' in the URL.

    Note that users need to be created in Windsurf (through SCIM or manually creating the account) before they can be added to a group.

    ## User APIs

    There are also APIs for users as well. The following are some of the common SCIM APIs that Windsurf supports.

    Disable a user (Enable by replacing false to true):

    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Users/<user api key> \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>' \
      -d '{
        "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
        "Operations": [
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "active",
            "value": false
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    Create a user:

    ```
    curl -X POST \
      https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Users \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>' \
      -d '{
        "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
        "userName": "<email>",
        "displayName": "<full name>",
        "active": true,
    }' 
    ```

    Update name:

    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      'https://<enterprise portal url>/_route/api_server/scim/v2/Users/<user api key>' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer <service key>' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
        -d '{
          "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
          "Operations": [
            {
              "op": "Replace",
              "path": "displayName",
              "value": "<new name>"
            }
          ]
       }'
    ```

    ## Creating Api Secret Key

    Go to [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings). Under Service Key Configuration, click on Configure, then Add Service Key. Enter any key name (such as 'Azure Provisioning Key') and click Create Service Key. Copy the output key and save it, you can now use the key to authorize the above APIs.

    10. Enable the SAML login in the Windsurf portal so you can test it.

    **NOTE: DO NOT LOGOUT OR CLOSE THE WINDOW AT THIS POINT.**

    If you get an error or it times out, troubleshoot your settings, otherwise you have to disable your SAML Settings in the Windsurf portal.

    **If you logout or close the window without confirming a successful test - you may get locked out.**

    11. Once your test was successfully completed, you may logout. You can now use SSO sign in when browsing to your team/organization page with the SSO ID you have configured in step 3.

    9. Add/edit any other policies and access as required by your setup/organization

    10. Enable the SAML login in the Windsurf portal so you can test it.

    **NOTE: DO NOT LOGOUT OR CLOSE THE WINDOW AT THIS POINT.**

    If you get an error or it times out, troubleshoot your settings, otherwise you have to disable your SAML Settings in the Windsurf portal.

    **If you logout or close the window without confirming a successful test - you may get locked out.**

    11. Once your test was successfully completed, you may logout. You can now use SSO sign in when browsing to your team/organization page with the SSO ID you have configured in step 3.

# Plans and Credit Usage
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/usage



Prompt credits are consumed whenever a message is sent to Cascade with a premium model. Every model has it's own credit multiplier with the default message costing 1 credit. You can view all available models and their associated costs on the [models page.](/windsurf/models)

Upon using all of your credits, select premium models will no longer be accessible; however, you will still be able to use several other models that we've made available for free.

## Plans

The [Free](#using-a-free-plan) plan includes:

* 25 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab

The 2 week [Pro Trial](#using-a-free-pro-trial) includes:

* 100 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab

The [Pro](#using-pro-plan) plan includes everything in Free, but with:

* 500 prompt credits
* Add-on prompt credits at \$10/250 credits
* All premium models

The [Teams](#using-teams-plan) plan includes everything in Pro, but with:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Add-on prompt credits at \$40/1000 credits
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support
* Access control features available to add

The [Enterprise](#using-enterprise-plan) plan includes everything in Teams, but with:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Add-on prompt credits at \$40/1000 credits
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM
* Highest priority support
* Longer context

If you run out of credits on any paid plan, you will have the option of [purchasing additional credits](#purchasing-additional-credits) or setting up [Automatic Credit Refills](#automatic-credit-refills).

After upgrading, your paid plan will start immediately and you'll have access to premium models again. To learn more about the quotas and features per pricing plan, [click here](https://codeium.com/pricing).

## Errors

If a user message is unsuccessful, prompt credits will not be consumed. For example, if Cascade attempts to write to a file but that file has unsaved changes, the operation will fail and it will not consume a credit.

## Viewing your usage

There are a few ways to view your usage.

Go to the Cascade usage directly by clicking on the overflow menu, and then selecting "Cascade Usage".

View the settings panel by clicking on "Windsurf Settings" on the status bar, followed by selecting the "Plan Info" tab.

You can also view it on your plan page at [codeium.com/plan](https://codeium.com/plan) after you're authenticated.

## Upgrading to a paid plan

To learn more about paid features or to upgrade to a paid plan, [click here](https://codeium.com/plan). Paid plans include Pro for individuals, Teams for organizations, and Enterprise for larger companies.

We accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Cash App Pay, Google Pay, Link, WeChat Pay, and Alipay. If you have a payment method not listed, please reach out to us at [support](https://codeium.com/support). You may need to disable your VPN to view the relevant payment methods for your region.

## What happens when you run out of prompt credits?

If you no longer have prompt credits, you have two options:

* You can purchase additional prompt credits to continue using premium models

* You can use Write or Chat mode with the models that cost 0 credits!

## Automatic Credit Refills

We've introduced Automatic Credit Refills so that you no longer need to manually purchase additional credits. Under your plan settings page on the Windsurf website, you can specify a maximum amount of credits and other refill settings. The system will automatically "top-up" your credits as you start running low (below 15 credits).

Automatic Credit Refills are purchased in configurable increments (multiples of \$10 for Pro and \$40 for Teams) and subject to maximum monthly budget caps (\$50 by default for Pro users and \$160 for Teams users). This ensures you won't lose access to Cascade during critical work.

## Purchasing additional credits

If you run out of prompt credits, you can purchase additional credits in the [billing website](https://codeium.com/plan). Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits for Pro users.

For Team and Enterprise plans, additional credits are purchased within and treated as a pool amongst all members of the team at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits. Please contact your Teams admin to purchase more credits if you're on a team plan.

## Usage examples

To explain how credits work, here's a simple example:

When you send a message to Cascade with a premium model, 1 prompt credit is consumed. It doesn't matter how many actions Cascade takes to fulfill your request - whether it searches your codebase, analyzes files, or makes edits - you only pay for the initial prompt.

This simplified system makes it much easier to predict and manage your usage. No more complicated calculations of flow actions or different credit types.

## Plan Usage

### Using a Free Pro Trial

The Pro Trial lasts for 2 weeks and includes unlimited Windsurf Tab, 100 prompt credits, Previews, and Deploys.

When you're on a Pro Trial, you'll have access to premium features! To get started, ask Cascade a question. In Write and Chat mode, Cascade is optimized to fully understand your codebase and leverages tool calls to assist you. By default, all of your requests will use premium models until you run out of credits.

After your trial period ends, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue using premium models.

If you don't upgrade during the Free Trial period, you'll be downgraded to our Free plan which includes 25 prompt credits per month.

### Using Pro Plan

The Pro plan costs \$15/month and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/month
* All premium models
* Previews
* App Deploys

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits.

While on Pro, you'll have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. You can view how many credits you have remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel that's accessible in the status bar.

If you're running low on credits, Cascade will notify you so that you can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. To purchase additional credits, visit the billing website and select "Purchase credits". The credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

If you want to reduce your consumption of prompt credits, there are several available models that cost 0 credits!

In addition to prompt credits, Pro comes with unlimited Fast Autocomplete and unlimited premium model requests with Command.

### Using Teams Plan

The Teams plan costs \$30/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Everything in Pro, plus:
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

The Teams plan has a seat cap of 200 users. Coming soon, there will be an option to add Access Control features for +\$10/user/month.

While on the Teams plan, each user will have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. Unlike the previous system, base prompt credits are not pooled - each user has their own credit limit. However, purchased add-on prompt credits are pooled across the organization. You can view how many credits your team has remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel.

If your team is running low on credits, your administrator can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. These add-on prompt credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

### Using Enterprise Plan

The Enterprise plan costs \$60/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes everything in Teams plus:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM (included)
* Longer model context lengths
* Highest priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

Coming soon, Enterprise will be self-serviceable with month-to-month pricing. The Enterprise plan includes self-serve SSO integration and enhanced security features.

For enterprise support, account management, and more involved deployments such as Hybrid or FedRAMP under an annual commitment, contact our enterprise team at [trust.windsurf.com](https://trust.windsurf.com) for any standard security collateral.

# Queued Messages

While you are waiting for Cascade to finish its current task, you can queue up new messages to execute in order once the task is complete.

To add a message to the queue, simply type in your message while Cascade is working and press `Enter`.

* **Send immediately**: Press Enter again on an empty text box to send it right away.
* **Delete**: Remove any message from the queue before it's sent

# Access to Tools

Cascade has a variety of tools at its disposal, such as Search, Analyze, [Web Search](/windsurf/web-search), and the [terminal](/windsurf/terminal).

It can detect which packages and tools that you're using, which ones need to be installed, and even install them for you. Just ask Cascade how to run your project and press Accept.

<Note>Cascade can make up to 25 tool calls per prompt. If the trajectory stops, simply type in `continue` and Cascade will resume from where it left off. Each `continue` will count as a new prompt. </Note>

# Voice input

Use Voice input to use your voice to interact with Cascade. In its current form it can transcribe your speech to text.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/voice-mode.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=b6881ef11385d4f05fa151e0808a9e78" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/voice-mode.mp4" />

# Revert to previous steps

You have the ability to revert changes that Cascade has made if you want to. Simply hover your mouse over the original prompt and click on the revert arrow on the right, or revert directly from the table of contents. This will revert all code changes back to the state of your codebase at the desired step.

<Warning>Reverts are currently irreversible, so be careful!</Warning>

# Real-time collaboration

A unique capability of Cascade is that it is aware of your real-time actions.

You no longer necessarily need to prompt with context on your prior actions, as Cascade is already aware.

Try making a manual change in the code editor, and then prompt Cascade to "continue my work"!

# Ignoring files

If you'd like Cascade to ignore files, you can add your files to `.codeiumignore` at the root of your workspace. This will prevent Cascade from viewing, editing or creating files inside of the paths designated. You can declare the file paths in a format similar to `.gitignore`.

## Global .codeiumignore

For enterprise customers managing multiple repositories, you can enforce ignore rules across all repositories by placing a global `.codeiumignore` file in the `~/.codeium/` folder. This global configuration will apply to all Windsurf workspaces on your system and works in addition to any repository-specific `.codeiumignore` files.


# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp



**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol that enables LLMs to access custom tools and services.
An MCP client (Cascade, in this case) can make requests to MCP servers to access tools that they provide.
Cascade now natively integrates with MCP, allowing you to bring your own selection of MCP servers for Cascade to use.
See the [official MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for more information.

<Note>Enterprise users must manually turn this on via settings</Note>

## Adding a new MCP plugin

New MCP plugins can be added by going to the `Settings` > `Tools` > `Windsurf Settings` > `Add Server` section.

If you cannot find your desired MCP plugin, you can add it manually by clicking `View Raw Config` button and editing the raw `mcp_config.json` file.

When you click on an MCP server, simply click `+ Add Server` to expose the server and its tools to Cascade.

</Frame>

Cascade supports two [transport types](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports) for MCP servers: `stdio` and `http`.

For `http` servers, the URL should reflect that of the endpoint and resemble `https://<your-server-url>/mcp`.

We can also support streamable HTTP transport and MCP Authentication.

<Note>Make sure to press the refresh button after you add a new MCP plugin.</Note>

## mcp\_config.json

The `~/.codeium/mcp_config.json` file is a JSON file that contains a list of servers that Cascade can connect to.

The JSON should follow the same schema as the config file for Claude Desktop.

Here's an example configuration, which sets up a single server for GitHub:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that for HTTP servers, the configuration is slightly different and requires a `serverUrl` field.

Here's an example configuration for an HTTP server:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "serverUrl": "<your-server-url>/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>For Figma Dev Mode MCP server, make sure you have updated to the latest Figma desktop app version to use the new `/mcp` endpoint.</Note>

Be sure to provide the required arguments and environment variables for the servers that you want to use.

See the [official MCP server reference repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) or [OpenTools](https://opentools.com/) for some example servers.

## Admin Controls (Teams & Enterprises)

Team admins can toggle MCP access for their team, as well as whitelist approved MCP servers for their team to use:

<Card title="MCP Team Settings" horizontal={true} icon="hammer" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Configurable MCP settings for your team.
</Card>

<Warning>The above link will only work if you have admin privileges for your team.</Warning>

By default, users within a team will be able to configure their own MCP servers. However, once you whitelist even a single MCP server, **all non-whitelisted servers will be blocked** for your team.

### How Server Matching Works

When you whitelist an MCP server, the system uses **regex pattern matching** with the following rules:

* **Full String Matching**: All patterns are automatically anchored (wrapped with `^(?:pattern)$`) to prevent partial matches
* **Command Field**: Must match exactly or according to your regex pattern
* **Arguments Array**: Each argument is matched individually against its corresponding pattern
* **Array Length**: The number of arguments must match exactly between whitelist and user config
* **Special Characters**: Characters like `$`, `.`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)` have special regex meaning and should be escaped with `\` if you want literal matching

### Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Plugin Store Default (Recommended)" description="Leave the Server Config (JSON) field empty to allow the default configuration from the Windsurf MCP Plugin Store.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `github-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**: *(leave empty)*

    ```json  theme={null}
    {}
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github-mcp-server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This allows users to install the GitHub MCP server with any valid configuration, as long as the server ID matches the plugin store entry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 2: Exact Match Configuration" description="Provide the exact configuration that users must use. Users must match this configuration exactly.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `github-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": ""
      }
    }
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github-mcp-server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Users must use this exact configuration - any deviation in command or args will be blocked. The `env` section can have different values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 3: Flexible Regex Patterns" description="Use regex patterns to allow variations in user configurations while maintaining security controls.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `python-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/.*\\.py", "--port", "[0-9]+"]
    }
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "python-mcp-server": {
          "command": "python3",
          "args": ["/home/user/my_server.py", "--port", "8080"],
          "env": {
            "PYTHONPATH": "/home/user/mcp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This example allows users flexibility while maintaining security:

    * The regex `/.*\\.py` matches any Python file path like `/home/user/my_server.py`
    * The regex `[0-9]+` matches any numeric port like `8080` or `3000`
    * Users can customize file paths and ports while admins ensure only Python scripts are executed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Regex Patterns

| Pattern         | Matches                   | Example                |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `.*`            | Any string                | `/home/user/script.py` |
| `[0-9]+`        | Any number                | `8080`, `3000`         |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` | Alphanumeric + underscore | `api_key_123`          |
| `\\$HOME`       | Literal `$HOME`           | `$HOME` (not expanded) |
| `\\.py`         | Literal `.py`             | `script.py`            |
| `\\[cli\\]`     | Literal `[cli]`           | `mcp[cli]`             |

## Notes

### Admin Configuration Guidelines

* **Environment Variables**: The `env` section is not regex-matched and can be configured freely by users
* **Disabled Tools**: The `disabledTools` array is handled separately and not part of whitelist matching
* **Case Sensitivity**: All matching is case-sensitive
* **Error Handling**: Invalid regex patterns will be logged and result in access denial
* **Testing**: Test your regex patterns carefully - overly restrictive patterns may block legitimate use cases

### Troubleshooting

If users report that their MCP servers aren't working after whitelisting:

1. **Check Exact Matching**: Ensure the whitelist pattern exactly matches the user's configuration
2. **Verify Regex Escaping**: Special characters may need escaping (e.g., `\.` for literal dots)
3. **Review Logs**: Invalid regex patterns are logged with warnings
4. **Test Patterns**: Use a regex tester to verify your patterns work as expected

Remember: Once you whitelist any server, **all other servers are automatically blocked** for your team members.

### General Information

* Since MCP tool calls can invoke code written by arbitrary server implementers, we do not assume liability
  for MCP tool call failures. To reiterate:
* We currently support an MCP server's [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources), not [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts).


# Memories & Rules
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/memories



`Memories` is the system for sharing and persisting context across conversations.

There are two mechanisms for this in Cascade: Memories, which can be automatically generated by Cascade, and rules, which are manually defined by the user at both the local and global levels.

## How to Manage Memories

Memories and Rules can be accessed and configured at any time by clicking on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade. To edit an existing memory, simply click into it and then click the `Edit` button.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/managing-memories-jb.gif?s=364abea59051eb01f19dbe91ba7bcf35" data-og-width="800" width="800" data-og-height="506" height="506" data-path="assets/managing-memories-jb.gif" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" />
</Frame>

## Memories

During conversation, Cascade can automatically generate and store memories if it encounters context that it believes is useful to remember.

Additionally, you can ask Cascade to create a memory at any time. Just prompt Cascade to "create a memory of ...".

Cascade's autogenerated memories are associated with the workspace that they were created in and Cascade will retrieve them when it believes that they are relevant. Memories generated in one workspace will not be available in another.

<Tip>Creating and using auto-generated memories do NOT consume credits</Tip>

## Rules

Users can explicitly define their own rules for Cascade to follow.

Rules can be defined at either the global level or the workspace level.

`global_rules.md` - rules applied across all workspaces

`.windsurf/rules` - workspace level directory containing rules that are tied to globs or natural language descriptions.

## Rules Discovery

Windsurf automatically discovers rules from multiple locations to provide flexible organization:

* **Current workspace and sub-directories**: All `.windsurf/rules` directories within your current workspace and its sub-directories
* **Git repository structure**: For git repositories, Windsurf also searches up to the git root directory to find rules in parent directories
* **Multiple workspace support**: When multiple folders are open in the same workspace, rules are deduplicated and displayed with the shortest relative path

### Rules Storage Locations

Rules can be stored in any of these locations:

* `.windsurf/rules` in your current workspace directory
* `.windsurf/rules` in any sub-directory of your workspace
* `.windsurf/rules` in parent directories up to the git root (for git repositories)

When you create a new rule, it will be saved in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your current workspace, not necessarily at the git root.

To get started with Rules, click on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the `Rules` panel. Here, you can click on the `+ Global` or `+ Workspace` button to create new rules at either the global or workspace level, respectively.

<Tip>You can find example rule templates curated by the Windsurf team at [https://windsurf.com/editor/directory](https://windsurf.com/editor/directory) to help you get started.</Tip>

Rules files are limited to 12000 characters each.

### Best Practices

To help Cascade follow your rules effectively, follow these best practices:

* Keep rules simple, concise, and specific. Rules that are too long or vague may confuse Cascade.
* There's no need to add generic rules (e.g. "write good code"), as these are already baked into Cascade's training data.
* Format your rules using bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown. These are easier for Cascade to follow compared to a long paragraph.

For example:

```
# Coding Guidelines 
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
```

* XML tags can be an effective way to communicate and group similar rules together. For example:

```
<coding_guidelines>
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
</coding_guidelines>
```

In Cascade, you can easily switch between different models of your choosing.

Depending on the model you select, each of your input prompts will consume a different number of [prompt credits](/windsurf/cascade/usage).

Under the text input box, you will see a model selection dropdown menu containing the following models:

<ModelsTable />

# SWE-1.5, swe-grep, SWE-1

Our SWE model family of in-house frontier models are built specifically for software engineering tasks.

Our latest frontier model, SWE-1.5, achieves near-SOTA performance in a fraction of the time.

Our in house models include:

* `SWE-1.5`: Our best agentic coding model we've released so far. Near Claude 4.5-level performance, at 13x the speed. Read our [research announcement](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-1-5).
* `SWE-1`: Our first agentic coding model. Achieved Claude 3.5-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
* `SWE-1-mini`: Powers passive suggestions in Windsurf Tab, optimized for real-time latency.
* `swe-grep`: Powers context retrieval and [Fast Context](context-awareness/fast-context)

# Bring your own key (BYOK)

<Warning>This is only available to free and paid individual users.</Warning>

For certain models, we allow users to bring their own API keys. In the model dropdown menu, individual users will see models labled with `BYOK`.

To input your API key, navigate to [this page](https://windsurf.com/subscription/provider-api-keys) in the subscription settings and add your key.

If you have not configured your API key, it will return an error if you try to use the BYOK model.

Currently, we only support BYOK for these models:

* `Claude 4 Sonnet`
* `Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking)`
* `Claude 4 Opus`
* `Claude 4 Opus (Thinking)`


# Web and Docs Search
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/web-search



Cascade can now intuitively parse through and chunk up web pages and documentation, providing realtime context to the models. The key way to understand this feature is that Cascade will browse the Internet as a human would.

Our web tools are designed in such a way that gets only the information that is necessary in order to efficiently use your credits.

## Overview

To help you better understand how Web Search works, we've recorded a short video covering the key concepts and best practices.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moIySJ4d0UY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

### Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to activate web search in your Windsurf Settings in the bottom right corner of the editor. You can activate it a couple of different ways:

1. Ask a question that probably needs the Internet (ie. "What's new in the latest version of React?").
2. Use `@web` to force a docs search.
3. Use `@docs` to query over a list of docs that we are confident we can read with high quality.
4. Paste a URL into your message.

## Search the web

Cascade can deduce that certain prompts from the user may require a real-time web search to provide the optimal response. In these cases, Cascade will perform a web search and provide the results to the user. This can happen automatically or manually using the `@web` mention.

</Frame>

## Reading Pages

Cascade can read individual pages for things like documentation, blog posts, and GitHub files. The page reads happen entirely on your device within your network so if you're using a VPN you shouldn't have any problems.

Pages are picked up either from web search results, inferred based on the conversation, or from URLs pasted directly into your message.

We break pages up into multiple chunks, very similar to how a human would read a page: for a long page we skim to the section we want then read the text that's relevant. This is how Cascade operates as well.

# Workflows
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/workflows



Workflows enable users to define a series of steps to guide Cascade through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or responding to PR comments.

These Workflows are saved as markdown files, allowing users and their teams an easy repeatable way to run key processes.

Once saved, Workflows can be invoked in Cascade via a slash command with the format of `/[name-of-workflow]`

## How it works

Rules generally provide large language models with guidance by providing persistent, reusable context at the prompt level.

Workflows extend this concept by providing a structured sequence of steps or prompts at the trajectory level, guiding the model through a series of interconnected tasks or actions.

</Frame>

To execute a Workflow, users simply invoke it in Cascade using the `/[workflow-name]` command.

<Tip>You can call other Workflows from within a Workflow! <br /><br />For example, /workflow-1 can include instructions like "Call /workflow-2" and "Call /workflow-3".</Tip>

Upon invocation, Cascade sequentially processes each step defined in the Workflow, performing actions or generating responses as specified.

## How to create a Workflow

To get started with Workflows, click on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the `Workflows` panel. Here, you can click on the `+ Workflow` button to create a new Workflow.

Workflows are saved as markdown files within `.windsurf/workflows/` directories and contain a title, description, and a series of steps with specific instructions for Cascade to follow.

## Workflow Discovery

Windsurf automatically discovers workflows from multiple locations to provide flexible organization:

* **Current workspace and sub-directories**: All `.windsurf/workflows/` directories within your current workspace and its sub-directories
* **Git repository structure**: For git repositories, Windsurf also searches up to the git root directory to find workflows in parent directories
* **Multiple workspace support**: When multiple folders are open in the same workspace, workflows are deduplicated and displayed with the shortest relative path

### Workflow Storage Locations

Workflows can be stored in any of these locations:

* `.windsurf/workflows/` in your current workspace directory
* `.windsurf/workflows/` in any sub-directory of your workspace
* `.windsurf/workflows/` in parent directories up to the git root (for git repositories)

When you create a new workflow, it will be saved in the `.windsurf/workflows/` directory of your current workspace, not necessarily at the git root.

Workflow files are limited to 12000 characters each.

### Generate a Workflow with Cascade

You can also ask Cascade to generate Workflows for you! This works particularly well for Workflows involving a series of steps in a particular CLI tool.

## Example Workflows

There are a myriad of use cases for Workflows, such as:

<Card title="/address-pr-comments">
  This is a Workflow our team uses internally to address PR comments:

  ```
  1. Check out the PR branch: `gh pr checkout [id]`

  2. Get comments on PR

   bash
   gh api --paginate repos/[owner]/[repo]/pulls/[id]/comments | jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, body, path, line, original_line, created_at, in_reply_to_id, pull_request_review_id, commit_id}'

  3. For EACH comment, do the following. Remember to address one comment at a time.
   a. Print out the following: "(index). From [user] on [file]:[lines] — [body]"
   b. Analyze the file and the line range.
   c. If you don't understand the comment, do not make a change. Just ask me for clarification, or to implement it myself.
   d. If you think you can make the change, make the change BEFORE moving onto the next comment.

  4. After all comments are processed, summarize what you did, and which comments need the USER's attention.

      <Step title="Install Jupyter Extension">
        Open a new Jupyter Lab session. In a cell, paste and run `Shift+Enter` the following:

        ```python  theme={null}
        import sys
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U pip --user
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U codeium-jupyter --user
        ```

        If you’re inside a virtual environment, run:

        ```python  theme={null}
        import sys
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U pip
        !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U codeium-jupyter

Windsurf Guide for Enterprise Admins

# Windsurf Guide for Enterprise Admins

> **Purpose**   This guide helps enterprise *platform / developer-experience* administrators plan, roll out, and operate Windsurf for organizations with **large enterprise teams**.  It is intentionally *opinionated* and links out to detailed "how-to" docs per topic.  Treat it both as a **read-through guide** *and* as a **check-list** when onboarding.

***

## 1.   Audience & Pre-Requisites

|                       | Details                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who should read**   | Platform / Dev-Ex admins, Corporate IT, Centralized Tooling teams                  |
| **Assumed knowledge** | Basic Windsurf terms (team, role), Enterprise IdP concepts (SAML, SCIM), CLI usage |
| **Out-of-scope**      | Deep security / compliance internals → see **Security & Compliance** docs          |

***

## 2.   Quick-Start Checklist

1. Confirm organization-wide settings
2. Set up **SSO** (Okta, Azure AD, Google; see SAML docs for others)
3. Enable **SCIM** & map IdP groups → Windsurf *teams*
4. Define **role** & **permission** model (least privilege)
5. Configure **Admin Portal**: team view & security controls
6. Distribute **Windsurf clients/extensions** to end users
7. View **analytics dashboards** & **API access tokens**

> Use this list as your "Day 0" deployment tracker.

***

## 3.   Core Windsurf Concepts

* **Team** – flat collections of members; no nested teams. Teams (also called *Groups*) drive **role assignment** and **analytics grouping**, letting you scope permissions and view usage metrics per cohort.
* **Roles & Permissions** – predefined RBAC; admins are primarily responsible for **team management**, **Windsurf feature settings**, and **analytics**. Built-in roles usually cover these needs, but creating a custom role with *analytics-view* permission lets team managers and leads see metrics for their own teams. (<a href="/plugins/accounts/rbac-role-management" target="_blank">RBAC docs</a>)
* **Admin Portal** – centralized UI for user & team management, credit usage, SSO configuration, feature toggles (<a href="/plugins/cascade/web-search" target="_blank">Web Search</a>, <a href="/plugins/cascade/mcp" target="_blank">MCP</a>, <a href="/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys" target="_blank">Deploys</a>), analytics dashboards/report export, service keys for API usage, and role/permission controls.
* **Agents & Workspaces** – Windsurf IDE and Jetbrains Plugins are Agentic

### 3.1   Admin Portal Overview

The Admin Portal provides centralized management for all Windsurf enterprise features through an intuitive web interface. Core capabilities include:

#### User & Team Management

* Add, remove, and manage users across your organization
* Configure teams with proper role assignments
* User status and activity monitoring

#### Authentication & Security

* Configure SSO integration with major identity providers
* Set up SCIM provisioning for automated user lifecycle management
* Manage role-based access controls (RBAC)
* Create and manage **service keys** for API automations with scoped permissions

#### Feature Toggles & Controls

> **Important:** These feature controls affect behavior for your entire organization and can only be modified by administrators. New major features with data privacy implications are released in the "off" state by default to ensure you have control over when and how they're enabled.

The <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings" target="_blank">Admin Portal</a> gives you granular control over Windsurf features that can be enabled or disabled per team. **Data Privacy Note:** Some features require storing additional data or telemetry as noted below:

**Models Configuration**

* Configure which AI models your teams can access within Windsurf
* Select multiple models for different use cases (code completion, chat, etc.)

**Auto Run Terminal Commands** *(Beta)*

* Allow or restrict Cascade's ability to auto-execute commands on users' machines
* [Learn more about auto-executed commands](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/terminal#auto-executed-cascade-commands)

**MCP Servers** *(Beta)*

* Enable users to configure and use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
* Maintain whitelisted MCP servers for approved integrations
* **Security Note:** Review operational and security implications before enabling, as MCP can create infrastructure resources outside Windsurf's security monitoring
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp" target="_blank">Learn more about Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp#admin-controls-teams-%26-enterprises" target="_blank">MCP admin controls for teams & enterprises</a>

**App Deploys** *(Beta)*

* Manage deployment permissions for your teams in Cascade
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys#app-deploys" target="_blank">Learn more about App Deploys</a>

**Conversation Sharing**

* Allow team members to share Cascade conversations with others
* Conversations are securely uploaded to Windsurf servers
* Shareable links are restricted to logged-in team members only
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/cascade#sharing-your-conversation" target="_blank">Learn more about sharing conversations</a>

**PR Reviews (GitHub Integration)**

* Install Windsurf in your team's GitHub organization
* Enable PR review automation and description editing
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf-reviews/windsurf-reviews#windsurf-pr-reviews" target="_blank">Learn more about Windsurf PR Reviews</a>

**Knowledge Base Management**

* Curate knowledge from Google Drive sources for your development teams
* Upload and organize internal documentation and resources
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/overview#knowledge-base-beta" target="_blank">Learn more about Knowledge Base</a>

## 4.   Identity & Access Management

> **Recommendation:** Use **SSO plus SCIM** wherever possible for automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and group management.

### 4.1   Single Sign-On (SSO)

|                          | Guidance                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IdPs supported**       | Okta, Azure AD, Google (others via generic SAML)                                                                       |
| **Recommended approach** | Create Windsurf-specific *app* in IdP; use **role-based** group assignments rather than org-wide `All Employees` group |
| **Common pitfalls**      | Email suffix mismatches, duplicate user aliases                                                                        |

*See the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/sso-scim" target="_blank">SSO & SCIM Setup Guide</a> for step-by-step configuration for Okta, Azure AD, Google, and Generic SAML.*

### 4.2   SCIM Provisioning

* **Why** – automated user lifecycle & team membership management at scale
* **Capabilities**
  * Create / deactivate **users** automatically
  * Create **teams** automatically (or manage manually)
  * Users can belong to **multiple teams**
  * Custom team creation via SCIM API (<a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/sso-scim#scim-api" target="_blank">docs</a>)
* **Mapping strategies**
  * 1 IdP group → 1 Windsurf team (simple, most common)
  * Functional vs. project-based group prefixes (e.g. `proj-foo-devs`)
* **Things to decide**
  * Which groups to *exclude* (e.g. interns, contractors)
  * Renaming rules when IdP group names change
* **Caution**: SCIM should remain your **source of truth**—mixing SCIM and manual / API updates can create drift. Use the API mainly for adding supplemental groups.

***

## 5.   User & Team Management at Scale

* Flat *team* → design team taxonomy carefully (no nesting to fall back on)
* Users can belong to **multiple groups**. Groups are used to view analytics
* Today, SCIM does not support assigning roles to users. SCIM only supports assigning users to Groups

***

## 6.   Analytics & API Access

### 6.1   Built-In Analytics

| Dashboard             | Use-case                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Adoption Overview** | Track total active users, daily engagement |
| **Team Activity**     | Team usage                                 |

Analytics shows the **percentage of code written by Windsurf**, helping quantify impact—see your dashboards at <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/analytics" target="_blank">team analytics</a>.

### 6.2   APIs

| API      | Typical admin scenarios    |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| **REST** | SCIM management, analytics |

* Generate service keys under <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings" target="_blank">**Team Settings → Service Keys**</a>. Scope keys to *least privilege* needed.
* More advanced reporting and usage management: see the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/api-reference/api-introduction" target="_blank">API Reference</a>.
* For team management: see the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/sso-scim#scim-api" target="_blank">SCIM API – Custom Teams</a>.

***

## 7.   Operational Considerations

* **Status Pages** – monitor live service health: <a href="https://status.windsurf.com/" target="_blank">Windsurf</a>, <a href="https://status.anthropic.com/" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://status.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>
* **Support Channels** – windsurf.com/support

***

## 8.   Setting Up End Users for Success

1. Point end users to the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/getting-started" target="_blank">Windsurf installation guide</a> to install the appropriate extension or desktop client.
2. Publish an internal "Getting Started with Windsurf" page (link to official docs)
3. Hold live onboarding sessions / record short demos
4. Curate starter project templates & sample prompts
5. Collect feedback via survey after 2 weeks; iterate

# Tab
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/tab/overview

A powerful next-intent prediction experience routed to a single keystroke.

**Windsurf Tab** has evolved from a simple autocomplete tool into a contextually aware diff-suggestion and navigation engine for writing code.

It is powered by SWE-1-mini, our in-house model trained from scratch to optimize for speed and flow awareness.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/bVGscI7v3lPUsThV/assets/windsurf/tabdemo.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=bVGscI7v3lPUsThV&q=85&s=eb7a88258f63bdedb0895c79dc251ba4" data-path="assets/windsurf/tabdemo.mp4" />
</Frame>

Suggestions are based on the context of your code, terminal, Cascade chat history, your prior actions around the editor, and even your clipboard (must opt in via advanced Settings).

Tab is able to make edits *both before and after* your current cursor position. You can press `esc` to cancel a suggestion.

Suggestions will also disappear if you continue typing or navigating without accepting them.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

* **Accept suggestion**: `tab`
* **Cancel suggestion**: `esc`
* **Accept suggestion word-by-word**: `⌘+→` (VS Code), `⌥+⇧+\` (JetBrains)
* **Next/previous suggestion**: `⌥+]`/`⌥+[`

## Tab to Jump

Windsurf can also anticipate your next cursor position and prompt you with a `Tab to Jump` label at a certain line in the editor, allowing you to easily navigate through your file.

If you accept by simply pressing `tab`, then you will be taken to that next position.

</Frame>

## Tab to Import

After defining a new dependency to use in a file, just simply hit `tab` to import it at the top of the file once the hint shows. Your cursor will stay in the same position.

<Frame>
  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/vRt4FQOyBeZpD2Pu/assets/tab-import.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=vRt4FQOyBeZpD2Pu&q=85&s=9e1a5dce9a510ea50295228011d93eab" data-path="assets/tab-import.mp4" />
</Frame>

## Settings

Windsurf Tab is split up into two main configurable parts: Autocomplete and Supercomplete.

Autocompletes typically appear at your cursor, and Supercompletes appear either in small windows around your cursor, which can suggest both deletions and additions.

Autocomplete and Supercomplete can be toggled on and off. Autocomplete speeds can also be configured between Slow, Default, and Fast modes.

You can also opt-in to using your clipboard as context. This means if you copy something to your clipboard, Windsurf will be able to use it as context.

You can also toggle Tab to Import and Tab to Jump functionalities, and choose whether or not you want to highlight the code after an accepted Tab suggestion.

</Frame>

## Fill In The Middle (FIM)

Windsurf Tab can Fill In The Middle (FIM), meaning it can make suggestions while your cursor is in the middle of a line of code.

You can also reach out to us on Twitter/X! [@windsurf](https://x.com/windsurf)

### My Windsurf Chat panel goes blank

Please reach out to us if this happens! A screen recording would be much appreciated. This can often be solved by clearing your chat history.

### How do I download diagnostic logs to send to the support team?

Please see the intructions for various plugins [here](/troubleshooting/gathering-logs)


# Eclipse
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-enterprise/eclipse



# Supported Versions

Version 4.25+ (2022-09+)

# Gathering extension logs

In Eclipse, logs are written to the following paths:

* **Mac/Linux**: \~/.codeium/codeium.log
* **Windows**: C:\Users\<username>.codeium\codeium.log

# Known IDE issues and solutions

## Codeium isn't starting

If Codeium isn't starting up, use the logs to debug what the cause could be (See above). If you are not able to resolve the issue, file a help request by submitting a ticket at help.codeium.com. Make sure to include the logs referenced above to help our team debug the issue as quickly as possible.

## Codeium Chat shows an empty screen

If you are using Windows 10, it's possible you need to install **WebView2** to switch the Eclipse web renderer from Internet Explorer to Edge.

You can see if this is the case by right-clicking --> `Properties` and seeing if there is an Internet Explorer icon.

## Certificate issue

This issue may be indicated by the following errors in the logs:

```
Failed to fetch extension version at <YourDomainURL>
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

Unlike other IDEs, Eclipse does not use the OS certificate store. You will have to load the certificates to the Java keystore.

* SaaS users will have to load the Codeium Github URL
* Self-hosted (On-prem) users will have to load their Codeium Enterprise domain URL as well as the Codeium Github URL

**Note**: This is an example for SaaS users, but the process is the same. *For enterprise users - Your certificate is issued and managed by your local IT or Admin team. Please reach out to them for assistance with installing the necessary certificates on your system.*

1. Export the certificate for [https://exafunction.github.io/](https://exafunction.github.io/) from the browser as `githubio.cer` file

In Chrome: navigate to the website, click the padlock, click `Connection is secure`, click `Certificate is valid`, go to the `Details` tab, press the `Copy to File...` button

2. Import in JDK/JRE keystore: (Need to run from cmd prompt opened with "Administrator" privilege)

```
keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias codeiumgithub -file githubio.cer -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/ cacerts" -storepass changeit
```

3. Verify that the certificate is added to the Keystore by executing:

```
keytool -list -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/ cacerts" | findstr codeium
```

Enter the Keystore password.

4. Restart Eclipse and browse the marketplace extension from an internal browser. You should be directed to trust the unsigned content.

5. In some cases you might also need to pass the certificates path in VM arguments by editing your eclipse.ini file and adding the path:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="path-to-your-certificates"
```


# JetBrains
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-enterprise/jetbrains



# Supported Versions

Version 2022.3 or greater.

* JetBrains Fleet or Reshaper are not supported
* Remote SSH is not supported.

# Gathering extension logs

Starting in extension version 1.10.0, the Chat Panel has an Extension Diagnostics button on the Settings page. This button will automatically collect relevant logs and parameters into a text file that can be downloaded.

For older versions of the extension:

1. Logs are written to the idea.log file. To locate this file, go to the `Help > Show Log in Finder/Explorer` menu option

2. Export or copy the logs

# Known IDE issues and solutions

## Cascade not being displayed

Usually, you will see the following error in the logs:

```
JCEF is not supported in this env or failed to initialize
```

or

```
Internal JCEF not supported, trying external JCEF
```

JCEF is a browser needed to display Cascade. To fix this, go to `Help > Find Actions > Choose Java Boot Runtime` and pick a runtime with a bundled JCEF.
If you already have JCEF bundled as part of your runtime, JCEF may be disabled in your registry/properties.
Edit your properties: Help > Edit Custom Properties, add the following flag and restart your IDE:

```
ide.browser.jcef.enabled=true
```

## Certificate Issues

If you encounter the following errors:

```
Failed to fetch extension base URL at <YourDomainURL>
```

```
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: 
unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

This suggests that the Codeium extension is unable to trust the TLS connection to your enterprise portal / API server because it does not trust the certificate being presented. This either means that the certificate presented by the Codeium deployment is untrusted or a certificate presented by a corporate proxy intercepting the request is untrusted.

In either case, the most preferable solution is to ensure that the root certificate that signed this certificate is properly installed on end-user machines in the appropriate location. JetBrains IDEs and most other IDEs load certificates from the operating system's default location.

Your certificate is issued and managed by your local IT or Admin team. Please reach out to them for assistance with installing the necessary certificates on your system.

It is important that the full certificate chain is being presented from wherever TLS is being terminated. Oftentimes, if only the leaf certificate is presented, JetBrains IDE and other IDEs are unable to verify its authenticity because they are not aware of the intermediate certificate which validates the leaf certificate and is validated by the root certificate. Browsers are often able to work around this issue as users will likely have encountered a different website that does present the full certificate chain, so the intermediate cert is seen and cached, but applications like JetBrains IDEs don't have this advantage.

**Note**: In JetBrains family products **2024.3** a bug was introduced in which the IDE is failing to accept the OS certificates ([JetBrains issue report](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-171446/Unable-to-find-valid-certification-path-to-requested-target-exception-in-Settings-Sync-when-proxy-is-used)). To solve this, users can do any of the following:

* Downgrade JB products to earlier versions
* Use the 2024.3.1 preview version (beta version)
* Add `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT` as a custom JVM option

## Custom Workspaces

If you see the following error when using Cascade:

```
Cascade cannot access paths without an active workspace
```

This indicates that Cascade needs access to a custom workspace to function properly. To resolve this:

1. Open your JetBrains IDE Settings by going to `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` on macOS)

2. Navigate to `Tools > Windsurf Settings`

3. In the Windsurf Settings panel, locate the "Custom Workspaces" section at the bottom

4. Click the "Add Workspace" button to add your project workspace

5. Select the appropriate workspace directory for your project

6. Click "OK" to apply the settings

7. Restart your IDE for the changes to take effect

### Enterprise vs Non-Enterprise Behavior

The behavior of custom workspaces differs depending on your user type:

#### Enterprise Users

Enterprise users have selective control over workspace indexing:

* When adding workspaces, you'll see a checkbox option to enable indexing for each workspace
* Only workspaces with the checkbox enabled will be indexed and available to Cascade
* This allows you to control which workspaces consume indexing resources
* Tool calls are restricted to the active workspace for security

#### Non-Enterprise Users

Non-enterprise users get automatic workspace indexing:

* Any workspace you add is automatically indexed without requiring a checkbox
* All added workspaces are immediately available to Cascade
* Tool calls are never blocked outside the active workspace
* The selective indexing feature is not relevant under this model

After completing the setup steps above, Cascade should be able to access your workspace and function normally.


# Proxy Configuration for Windsurf in JetBrains IDEs
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-enterprise/jetbrains-proxy

Configure proxy settings for Windsurf plugin in JetBrains IDEs

Some corporate and enterprise networks route traffic through HTTP/HTTPS proxies. The Windsurf plugin in JetBrains IDEs needs to reach external Windsurf services (for sign-in and AI features), so you may need to configure a proxy before things work reliably.

## When Proxy Configuration May Be Required

Proxy configuration may be required if:

* You see "Failed to connect" or similar network errors in Windsurf
* The Windsurf panel in the IDE stays blank and never loads
* Cascade or other Windsurf features cannot connect or time out

This guide covers:

* Checking whether your network uses a proxy
* Configuring the IDE's proxy
* Enabling Windsurf's proxy detection
* Configuring proxy settings for JetBrains Remote

## Check Whether Your Network Uses a Proxy

Before changing anything:

Ask your IT / infra / network team:

* Do we use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy for outbound traffic?
* If yes, is it configured automatically (system settings / PAC file / device management), or do I need to configure it manually in applications?

If your organization does not use a proxy, you usually don't need to change these settings.

If your organization does use one, collect the proxy details (address, port, and any credentials). You can share screenshots of the JetBrains HTTP Proxy and Windsurf settings with them so they can tell you exactly what to fill in.

## Configure the JetBrains IDE Proxy

First, make sure the IDE itself can access the internet through your proxy — in particular, that it can reach `windsurf.com`.

1. Open Settings / Preferences in your JetBrains IDE. For example: File → Settings… (Windows/Linux) or ⌘, → Settings… (macOS).

2. Go to Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → HTTP Proxy.

3. Choose the appropriate option based on your IT team's guidance:
   * **No proxy** – if your network does not use a proxy.
   * **Auto-detect proxy settings** or **Use system proxy settings** – if the proxy is configured globally on your machine.
   * **Manual proxy configuration** – if IT provided a specific proxy host/port (and optional username/password) to enter here.

4. Use Check connection… (if available) to verify the configuration — ideally test connectivity to `https://windsurf.com` from this dialog.

5. Apply the changes and restart the IDE if prompted.

If the IDE itself cannot reach the network (for example, plugin marketplace, updates, or built-in web features fail, or you cannot reach `https://windsurf.com` from within the IDE), fix that here first. Windsurf relies on this connectivity.

## Enable Windsurf Proxy Detection in JetBrains

Once your IDE-level proxy is set (or confirmed not needed), configure how Windsurf uses those settings.

The Windsurf plugin has its own Detect proxy option inside its settings:

1. In your JetBrains IDE, open Settings / Preferences.

2. Navigate to Tools → Windsurf Settings.

3. Find the Detect proxy toggle.

4. Turn Detect proxy ON if:
   * Your proxy is configured at the OS or IDE level, and
   * IT expects applications to "just pick up" those settings.

5. Click Apply and OK if needed, then restart the IDE.

6. Try using Windsurf again:
   * Open the Windsurf panel from the IDE sidebar
   * Run Cascade or retry the operation that was failing with "Failed to connect" or showing a blank screen

If you see new connection issues after enabling Detect proxy, you can:

* Turn Detect proxy back OFF,
* Double-check your IDE HTTP Proxy configuration (including that it can reach `https://windsurf.com`), and
* Confirm with IT whether additional manual configuration is required.

## Proxy Configuration in JetBrains Remote

If you use JetBrains Remote Development (for example via JetBrains Gateway, a remote backend, or a cloud dev environment), there are effectively two places where proxy settings matter:

* Your local machine, running the thin client.
* The remote machine, where the actual IDE backend (and Windsurf) runs.

When you connect with JetBrains Remote, Windsurf's network requests originate from the remote machine, not from your local laptop. This means:

* Proxy setup on the remote IDE affects how Windsurf connects to Windsurf services.
* The remote machine may need its own proxy configuration, even if your local machine is already set up correctly.

<Warning>
  For JetBrains remote development, you must use the dedicated "Windsurf (Remote Development)" plugin, not the standard Windsurf plugin. Make sure you've installed Windsurf (Remote Development) as described in the Remote Development section of the Windsurf JetBrains getting started guide.
</Warning>

### Configure the Proxy for the Remote Environment

1. Connect to your remote backend using JetBrains Remote / Gateway.

2. Open Settings / Preferences in the remote IDE session (this opens the settings for the IDE running on the remote machine).

3. Configure the proxy for the remote IDE:
   * Go to Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → HTTP Proxy on the remote IDE.
   * Set the proxy according to your IT team's instructions (No proxy / Auto-detect / Use system proxy / Manual).
   * If the IDE provides a Check connection… button, use it to test connectivity to `https://windsurf.com` from the remote machine.

4. Configure Windsurf on the remote IDE:
   * Go to Tools → Windsurf Settings (still in the remote session).
   * Enable Detect proxy if your IT team expects applications on the remote host to use system/IDE proxy settings.

5. Apply the changes, then restart the remote IDE backend or disconnect and reconnect your remote session.

6. Open the Windsurf panel again in the remote IDE and retry the previously failing action.

<Note>
  It's common in corporate setups that both your local machine and the remote machine have their own proxy rules. Make sure you follow IT guidance for each side; fixing only the local proxy will not help if the remote host itself cannot reach the internet (including `https://windsurf.com`) without its own proxy configuration.
</Note>

## When to Change What

### Change Only the Local IDE HTTP Proxy

If:

* You are not using JetBrains Remote, and
* Other JetBrains features already work after setting it, and
* Windsurf works without touching its own settings, and
* The IDE can reach `https://windsurf.com`.

### Enable Windsurf "Detect Proxy"

(Local or remote) if:

* The proxy is already set up at the OS or IDE level on that machine, and
* Windsurf is the only thing that can't connect, or shows a blank Windsurf panel.

### Configure Proxy on the Remote IDE

If:

* You use JetBrains Remote,
* You've installed the Windsurf (Remote Development) plugin for that environment, and
* Errors occur only when connected to a remote backend, or
* IT says the remote server must also go through a proxy to reach the internet (including `https://windsurf.com`).

### Talk to IT / Infra

If:

* You're not sure whether your environment uses a proxy at all, or
* You've configured the HTTP Proxy + Windsurf Detect proxy (locally and/or remotely) and verified connection to `https://windsurf.com`, but still see blank Windsurf panels or connection failures.

Your IT / infra team is the final source of truth—they can confirm whether you need a proxy on your local machine, your remote machine, or both, how it should be configured in JetBrains, and whether the Windsurf Detect proxy setting should be enabled in your environment.

5. Change the dropdown in the top right that reads "Extension Host" and select "Codeium"

6. Export or copy the logs

# Known IDE issues and solutions

## e.split is not defined

You are using an unsupported VS Code version, please update to a supported version and try again. You can find a list of supported versions [here](/plugins/compatibility).

## Using the wrong API Server

If a user changes their API Server/Portal URL in their **workspace** settings, this will override their user settings and may result in an error where the extension is communicating with the wrong API server.

Make sure that your API Server/Portal URL is set correctly and not overridden accidentally by the workspace settings.

## Not seeing Codeium Chat responses

If you are trying to send messages to Codeium chat but not seeing responses, check if you can cancel the response. If you are unable to cancel the response, this means that the response was completed but not displayed. This can happen if the Chat Web Server loses connection to the extension. Reloading VS Code and opening the Codeium Chat panel again should show the responses.

## Unable to read file .../package.json

```
Unable to read file .../.vscode/extensions/codeium.codeium-<version>/package.json 
```

If the above error shows up in the Codeium logs, try deleting the extension folder (.../.vscode/extensions/codeium.codeium-\<version>) and reinstall the extension.

In order to do so manually:

1. Open the command palette ( CTRL + SHIFT + P )
2. Run 'Codeium Enterprise: Reset'
3. Select "Help" from the popup
4. Select "Show Disabled Extensions"
5. Re-enable your Codeium Extension

## Proxy / Network Issues

Unchecking `Detect Proxy` in Codeium settings in VSCode can sometimes resolve issues where the extension is incorrectly attempting to use a proxy.

## Certificate Issues

If you encounter the following errors:

```
ConnectError: [internal] unable to get issuer certificate
```

```
[ERROR]: [internal] unable to verify the first certificate
```

```
tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: "<yourdomainurl>" certificate is not standards compliant
```

This suggests that the Codeium extension is unable to trust the TLS connection to your enterprise portal / API server because it does not trust the certificate being presented. This either means that the certificate presented by the Codeium deployment is untrusted or a certificate presented by a corporate proxy intercepting the request is untrusted.

In either case, the most preferable solution is to ensure that the root certificate that signed this certificate is properly installed on end-user machines in the appropriate location. VS Code and most other IDEs load certificates from the operating system's default location.

Your certificate is issued and managed by your local IT or Admin team. Please reach out to them for assistance with installing the necessary certificates on your system.

It is important that the full certificate chain is being presented from wherever TLS is being terminated. Oftentimes, if only the leaf certificate is presented, VS Code and other IDEs are unable to verify its authenticity because they are not aware of the intermediate certificate which validates the leaf certificate and is validated by the root certificate. Browsers are often able to work around this issue as users will likely have encountered a different website that does present the full certificate chain, so the intermediate cert is seen and cached, but applications like VS Code don't have this advantage.

The Network Proxy Text VS Code extension is useful for debugging certificate issues.


# Gathering Logs
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/plugins-gathering-logs



If you're having issues, the first step in the troubleshooting process is to retrieve the logs from your IDE. Here's how you can get Windsurf logs for each of the major IDEs:

## JetBrains IDEs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local">
    Cascade has now the option to generate a diagnostics file directly from the IDE, there are 2 ways to do so:

    * In the Cascade window, click on the 3 dots in the upper right side, and select Download Diagnostics
    * In the IDE menu, go to Tools > Windsurf > Download Windsurf Diagnostics

    The first option is preferred since it also includes Cascade embedded browser logs.
    This button will automatically collect relevant logs and parameters into a text file.

    In extreme situations, you can always get the IDE full log (idea.log) from Help > Show Log in Explorer/Finder.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Remote">
    To gather the Windsurf diagnostics, you can use the following options:

    * In the Cascade window, click on the 3 dots in the upper right side, and select Download Diagnostics
    * In the IDE menu, go to Tools > Windsurf > Download Windsurf Diagnostics

    The first option is preferred since it also includes Cascade embedded browser logs.

    In addition, to collect the full IDE logs:

    * In the IDE menu, go to Tools > Windsurf > Collect Host and Client Logs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## VS Code

1. Go to the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` or go to View > Command Palette)

2. Type in "Show logs" and select the option that reads "Developer: Show Logs"

3. Change the dropdown in the top right that reads "Extension Host" and select "Windsurf"

4. You should see something similar to the image below:

<Frame style={{ border: 'none', background: 'none' }}>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=5559a02942eaf0fe736625f13e86bf67" data-og-width="2042" width="2042" data-og-height="272" height="272" data-path="assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=2344ea0881b4de4a4433812e6c956e23 280w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=429e361008386d9abcf033d991477321 560w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=a0ad762267a2b4c3af14027caf4eb2bf 840w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=deb9ce059733784d94a337a19993a5c5 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=56faddc7414338ad6e16650acba2d53a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL/assets/extension-diagnostics-log.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=d8O4q6w3H2CjrirL&q=85&s=88e03340e7060bc698560856ffe32fb4 2500w" />
</Frame>

5. Export or copy the logs

## Eclipse

In Eclipse, logs are written to the following paths:

* **Mac/Linux**: \~/.codeium/codeium.log
* **Windows**: C:\Users\<username>.codeium\codeium.log

## Visual Studio

Go to **view > output**, select "Windsurf" in the dropdown, and copy the logs.

## NeoVim

Set `g:codeium_log_file` to a path to a file in their vimrc and then relaunch vim.

Then the logs should be written to that file.

### On MacOS, I see a pop-up: 'Windsurf' is damaged and cannot be opened.

This pop-up is due to a false positive in MacOS security features. You can usually resolve this by going to "System Settings -> Privacy & Security" and clicking "Allow" or "Open anyway" for Windsurf. If this fails or is not possible, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that Windsurf is placed under your `/Applications` folder and that you are running it from there.
2. Check your processor type: if your Mac has an Intel chip, make sure you have the Intel version. If it's Apple Silicon (like M1, M2 or M3), make sure you have the Apple Silicon version. You can select the processor type from the [Mac download page](https://windsurf.com/windsurf/download_mac).
3. Try redownloading the DMG and reinstalling from [the official download page](https://windsurf.com/windsurf/download_mac), as the failing security feature is usually triggered on download.
4. Make sure Windsurf (and the "Windsurf is Damaged" pop-up) is closed, and run `xattr -c "/Applications/Windsurf.app/"`.

### I received an error message about updates on Windows, or updates are not appearing on Windows.

For example:

> Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator.

We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator. Please re-run Windsurf with User scope to update.

### What domains should I whitelist for network filters/firewalls, VPNs, or proxies?

If you're using any network filtering, firewalls, VPN services, or working in environments with restricted network access, you may experience connectivity issues with Windsurf. To ensure smooth operation, please whitelist the following domains in your network configuration:

* \*.codeium.com
* \*.windsurf.com
* \*.codeiumdata.com

### On Linux, Windsurf quietly doesn't launch, or crashes on launch

This is usually due to an Electron permissions issue, which VSCode also has, and is expected when using the tarball on Linux.

The easiest way to fix it is to run the following:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo chown root:root /path/to/windsurf/chrome-sandbox
sudo chown 4755 /path/to/windsurf/chrome-sandbox
```

You should then be able to launch Windsurf. You can also just run `windsurf` with the flag `--no-sandbox`, though we don't encourage this.

If this fails, then try the below.

### I received an error message saying 'Windsurf failed to start'

<Warning>Warning: deleting these folders will remove your conversation history and local settings!</Warning>

Delete the following folder:

Windows: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.codeium\windsurf\cascade`

Linux/Mac: `~/.codeium/windsurf/cascade`

and try restarting the IDE.

### I received an error message about updates on Windows, or updates are not appearing on Windows.

An example:

> Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator.

We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator. Please re-run Windsurf with User scope to update.

### My Cascade panel goes blank

Please reach out to us if this happens! A screen recording would be much appreciated. This can often be solved by clearing your chat history (`~/.codeium/windsurf/cascade`).

# Proxy Configuration in Windsurf Editor
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/troubleshooting/windsurf-proxy-configuration

Configure HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings for Windsurf Editor in corporate and enterprise networks

Some corporate and enterprise networks route traffic through HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Windsurf Editor needs to reach a few external services (for sign-in and AI features), so you may need to configure a proxy before things work reliably.

In particular, proxy configuration may be required if:

* You see **"Failed to connect"** or similar network errors

* The **editor or Cascade panel shows a blank screen** and never loads

* Cascade or other cloud-backed features **cannot load or connect**

* Sign-in or activation flows fail unexpectedly

All proxy options live in **Windsurf Settings**. You can open them from the **top-right dropdown → Windsurf Settings**, or via the **Command Palette (Ctrl/⌘+Shift+P) → "Open Windsurf Settings Page"**.

***

## **1. Check whether your network uses a proxy**

Before changing anything in the editor:

1. **Ask your IT / infra / network team**:

   * Do we use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy for outbound traffic?

   * If yes, is it configured **automatically** (system settings / PAC file), or do I need to configure it **manually** in applications?

2. If your organization does **not** use a proxy, you usually don't need to change these settings.

3. If your organization does use one, collect the proxy details (address, port, and any credentials) from your IT team.

You can share a screenshot of the Windsurf proxy settings with them so they can tell you exactly what to fill in.

***

## **2. Use your system proxy ("Detect proxy")**

If your proxy is **already configured on your machine** (for example via system network settings or a PAC file), you can let Windsurf detect and reuse it:

1. Open **Windsurf Settings**.

2. In the settings search bar, type **"proxy"**.

3. Locate the **Detect proxy** toggle (see screenshot).

4. Turn **Detect proxy** **ON**.

5. Close the settings page and **restart Windsurf Editor**.

6. Try again:

   * Reload the editor / Cascade

   * Retry sign-in or any previously failing operation

</Frame>

If things stop working after enabling this, you can turn **Detect proxy** back **OFF** and use manual settings instead (see next section), or follow guidance from your IT team.

***

## **3. Manually configure a proxy in Windsurf Editor**

If your organization requires you to **manually specify** the proxy in applications:

1. Collect the required details from your IT / infra team:

   * **Proxy protocol + address** (for example `http://proxy.company.com:8080` or `https://proxy.company.com:8443`)

   * Whether the proxy **requires authentication**

   * Your **proxy username/password** or other credentials, if needed

2. Open **Windsurf Settings**.

3. In the settings search bar, type **"proxy"** to open the proxy configuration section (see screenshot).

4. Fill in the fields:

   * **Proxy URL / address** – include protocol and port (e.g. `http://proxy.company.com:8080`)

   * **Authentication** – if your proxy requires it, enter the username and password fields shown in the UI

5. (Optional, if recommended by IT) Turn **Detect proxy** **ON** if your setup still relies on system/PAC detection alongside the manual settings.

6. Close the settings page and **restart Windsurf Editor** so the new proxy configuration is fully applied.

7. Try again:

   * Reload the editor or Cascade if you previously saw a **blank screen**

   * Retry the operation that was failing with **"Failed to connect"** or similar errors

## **4. Proxy settings for remote development (SSH / dev containers)**

If you use **remote development** (for example a dev container or Windsurf SSH remote), there is a separate set of proxy settings that control traffic between your local Windsurf Editor and the **remote** environment.

You may need to adjust these settings if:

* Connecting to a **dev container** or **SSH remote** fails or times out

* The remote window opens, but tools that depend on the network don't work as expected

* Your IT / infra team says the **remote host** must also go through a proxy

To configure the proxy for remote environments:

1. Open **Windsurf Settings**.

2. In the search bar, type **"proxy"**.

3. Under **User → Extensions → Windsurf Remote…**, locate:

   * **Remote › Windsurf SSH: Http Proxy**

   * **Remote › Windsurf SSH: Https Proxy**

4. Enter the proxy address(es) provided by your IT / infra team (usually including protocol and port, for example `http://proxy.company.com:8080`).

5. Restart the remote session (close the remote window and reconnect, or restart the dev container) and try again.

<Note>These **remote** proxy settings are independent from the general proxy / Detect proxy options described above. In some environments you may need to configure **both** the local editor proxy and the Windsurf Remote SSH proxy values.</Note>

</Frame>

***

## **5. When to use which option**

* **Use "Detect proxy" only** if:

  * Your organization configures proxies centrally on your device (system network settings, PAC file), **and**

  * IT tells you apps should "just pick up the system proxy."

* **Use manual configuration (with or without Detect proxy)** if:

  * IT gives you a specific proxy URL and credentials to enter in each application, or

  * Auto-detection in your environment is unreliable or not supported.

If you're unsure which of these applies to you, your **IT / infra team is the source of truth**—they can confirm whether you need proxy settings at all, what to enter, and whether the **Detect proxy** toggle should be on or off.

## How It Works

Once enabled, Windsurf automatically reviews eligible pull requests in selected repositories and provides feedback as GitHub review comments.

Reviews can be manually triggered when you mark a PR as “ready for review” or you type `/windsurf-review` in a PR comment.

You can also edit a PR title by typing `/windsurf` into the PR title.

Example workflow:

1. Developer opens a pull request in an enabled repository
2. Developer marks the PR as ready for review or types “@windsurf /review” in a PR comment
3. Windsurf reviews the PR and posts feedback as GitHub review comments
4. Developer addresses feedback and updates the PR

<Note>Limitations: 50 files per PR and Organization-wide limit of 500 reviews/month.</Note>

## Setup

An organization admin must connect the Windsurf GitHub bot to your GitHub Cloud organization to enable Windsurf PR Reviews:

1. Navigate to the Windsurf Team Settings page and click on Github Integration, or click [here](https://windsurf.com/team/settings)
2. During installation on the Github side, select which repositories to enable for PR reviews
3. Back in the Windsurf settings, configure toggles for allowing reviews/edits, define PR Guidelines for Reviews and Descriptions
4. All users in the organization can then receive PR reviews on their pull requests

<Warning>Reviews are not triggered on draft pull requests.</Warning>

## Disabling PR Reviews

To disable Windsurf PR Reviews, disconnect the Windsurf GitHub bot from your organization or remove it from specific repositories via GitHub settings.

## Best Practices

For effective PR reviews:

* Use natural language in PR Guidelines
* Don't be too vague about the purpose of your changes
* Include detailed examples where helpful

* Field aliases must be unique across all selections and aggregations
* If no aggregation function is specified, it defaults to UNSPECIFIED


# Error Handling
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/api-reference/errors

Common error messages and debugging tips for the Analytics API

## Overview

The Analytics API returns detailed error messages to help debug invalid queries. This page covers common error scenarios and how to resolve them.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns an error response with a descriptive message:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

## Common Errors

### Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid service key">
    **Error:** `Invalid service key`

    **Cause:** The provided service key is not valid or has been revoked.

    **Solution:**

    * Verify your service key is correct
    * Check that the service key hasn't been revoked
    * Generate a new service key if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient permissions">
    **Error:** `Insufficient permissions`

    **Cause:** The service key doesn't have the required "Teams Read-only" permissions.

    **Solution:**

    * Update the service key permissions in team settings
    * Ensure the service key has "Teams Read-only" access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Query Structure Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing selections">
    **Error:** `at least one field or aggregation is required`

    **Cause:** The query request doesn't contain any selections or aggregations.

    **Solution:** Add at least one selection to your query request:

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid data source">
    **Error:** `invalid query table: QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_UNSPECIFIED`

    **Cause:** There's likely a typo in the `data_source` field.

    **Solution:** Double-check the spelling of your data source. Valid options:

    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_USER_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_CHAT_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_COMMAND_DATA`
    * `QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_PCW_DATA`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mixed aggregation functions">
    **Error:** `all selection fields should have an aggregation function, or none of them should`

    **Cause:** Some selections have aggregation functions while others don't.

    **Solution:** Either add aggregation functions to all selections or remove them from all:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      },
      {
        "field": "num_lines_accepted",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_UNSPECIFIED"
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "selections": [
      {
        "field": "num_acceptances",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      },
      {
        "field": "num_lines_accepted",
        "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Field and Aggregation Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid aggregation function">
    **Error:** `invalid aggregation function for string type field ide: QUERY_AGGREGATION_SUM`

    **Cause:** The aggregation function is not supported for the specified field type.

    **Solution:** Check the [Available Fields](/windsurf/accounts/api-reference/custom-analytics#available-fields) section to see which aggregation functions are valid for each field. String fields typically only support `COUNT` and `UNSPECIFIED`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Distinct field aggregation">
    **Error:** `tried to aggregate on a distinct field: distinct_developer_days. Consider aggregating on the non-distinct fields instead: [api_key date]`

    **Cause:** Fields with the "distinct\_\*" pattern cannot be used in the aggregations section.

    **Solution:** Use the suggested alternative fields for aggregation:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "aggregations": [
      {
        "field": "distinct_developer_days",
        "name": "distinct_developer_days"
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    "aggregations": [
      {
        "field": "api_key",
        "name": "api_key"
      },
      {
        "field": "date",
        "name": "date"
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate field aliases">
    **Error:** `duplicate field alias for selection/aggregation: num_acceptances`

    **Cause:** Multiple selections or aggregations have the same name.

    **Solution:** Ensure all field aliases are unique. Remember that if no name is specified, it defaults to `{aggregation_function}_{field_name}`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Filtering Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid group name">
    **Error:** `invalid group name: GroupName`

    **Cause:** The specified group name doesn't exist in your organization.

    **Solution:**

    * Double-check the group name spelling
    * Verify the group exists in your team settings
    * Use the exact group name as it appears in your team dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid timestamp format">
    **Error:** `invalid timestamp format`

    **Cause:** The timestamp is not in the correct RFC 3339 format.

    **Solution:** Use the correct timestamp format:

    ```
    2023-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```

    **Valid examples:**

    * `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`
    * `2024-12-31T23:59:59Z`
    * `2024-06-15T12:30:45Z`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conflicting filters">
    **Error:** `Cannot use both group_name and emails parameters`

    **Cause:** Both `group_name` and `emails` parameters were provided in a Cascade Analytics request.

    **Solution:** Use either `group_name` OR `emails`, but not both:

    **Invalid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "group_name": "engineering",
      "emails": ["user@example.com"]
    }
    ```

    **Valid:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "group_name": "engineering"
    }
    ```

    **Or:**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "emails": ["user@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate limit exceeded">
    **Error:** `429 Too Many Requests`

    **Cause:** You've exceeded the API rate limit.

    **Solution:**

    * Wait before making additional requests
    * Implement exponential backoff in your client
    * Consider batching multiple queries into single requests where possible
    * Contact support if you need higher rate limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with basic queries and gradually add complexity:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "service_key": "your_key",
  "query_requests": [
    {
      "data_source": "QUERY_DATA_SOURCE_USER_DATA",
      "selections": [
        {
          "field": "num_acceptances",
          "aggregation_function": "QUERY_AGGREGATION_COUNT"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Validate Field Names

Double-check field names against the [Available Fields](/windsurf/accounts/api-reference/custom-analytics#available-fields) documentation.

### 3. Check Aggregation Compatibility

Ensure your aggregation functions are compatible with the field types you're selecting.

### 4. Test Filters Separately

If your query isn't returning expected results, try removing filters one by one to isolate the issue.

### 5. Use Proper JSON Formatting

Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and all strings are quoted correctly.

## Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check the error message carefully** - Most errors include specific guidance on how to fix the issue
2. **Review the examples** - Compare your query structure to the working examples in the documentation
3. **Contact support** - Reach out to [Windsurf Support](https://windsurf.com/support) with your specific error message and query

## API Version Notes

Error handling and validation have been improved in API version 1.10.0 and later. If you're using an older version, consider updating to get more detailed error messages.

# Domain Verification
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/domain-verification



Domain verification is the process of proving that your organization owns or controls a specific domain. This prevents spoofing or unauthorized use of your domain and enables secure organization-level features in Windsurf, such as SSO and user management.

In Windsurf, verifying your domain is required so that users with emails from your organization can be recognized and managed. The domain you need to verify should be the top-level domain of your users’ email addresses (for example, if your users log in with [name@company.com](mailto:name@company.com), you must verify company.com).

## How to verify your domain in Windsurf

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your domain in the Windsurf portal">
    Enter the domain you want to verify (e.g., company.com). Windsurf will generate a unique verification token and TXT record.

    ⚠️ This token will only be shown once. Be sure to copy it before closing the window.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the TXT record to your DNS settings">
    In your DNS provider’s management console, create a new TXT record with the value provided. For example:

    <Frame>
      windsurf-verification=\<your-verification-token>
    </Frame>

    * Name/Host: as specified in the Windsurf portal (often @ or left blank).
    * Value/Content: the exact token string shown in the portal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click “Verify” in Windsurf">
    After adding the record, return to the Windsurf portal and click the Verify button to complete the process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done">
    If the TXT record is detected, your domain will be marked as verified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>DNS changes can take up to 24–48 hours to propagate. If verification does not succeed immediately, wait a bit longer and try again.</Note>

## What happens after domain verification

Once your domain is verified, the following behavior will occur:

### For teams with SSO enabled

Any user with an email that ends in your verified domain will only be able to sign up for an account through your SSO integration. Other sign-up attempts (such as username + password or Google OAuth) will be redirected to your SSO portal. Users will be automatically added to your team without an additional approval process.

### For teams without SSO enabled

Users with an email that ends in your verified domain will still be able to sign up for an account using any available method. These users will be automatically invited to your team, but will need to be accepted by a team admin before gaining access.


# Role Based Access & Management
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/rbac-role-management

Configure and manage role-based access controls, permissions, and user management for your Windsurf team

Windsurf's Role-Based Access Control system provides granular, role-based access to enterprise resources, enabling administrators to assign permissions and roles dynamically for secure and efficient access management.

<Note>Role-based access features are available for Teams and Enterprise plans.</Note>

## Role Based Access Controls

Windsurf's role-based access system allows enterprise organizations to implement fine-grained access controls across all team resources. The system enables:

* **Granular Permission Management**: Control access to specific features and data based on user roles
* **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Administrators can assign and modify roles for individual users or user groups
* **Secure Resource Access**: Ensure users only have access to the resources they need for their responsibilities
* **Audit and Compliance**: Track user permissions and access patterns for security and compliance requirements

The role-based access system integrates seamlessly with Windsurf's existing authentication mechanisms, including SSO and SCIM, to provide a comprehensive security framework for enterprise deployments.

## Role Management

<Note>We are continually working to improve role management features and functionality.</Note>

Roles can be created and managed in the Windsurf admin console via the Settings tab. For Windsurf's SaaS offering, access the Settings tab at:

<Card title="Team Settings" horizontal={true} icon="gear" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Manage roles, permissions, and team settings from the admin console.
</Card>

### Creating a New Role

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Role Management">
    Go to [windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings) and locate the Role Management section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Role">
    Click the **"Create Role"** button to start creating a new role.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Role">
    Enter a descriptive name for the role and select the appropriate permissions from the checkbox list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Role">
    Review your selections and save the new role. It will now be available for assignment to users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Role Permissions

Windsurf provides two default roles out of the box:

* **Admin Role**: Includes all available permissions for complete system access
* **User Role**: Includes no permissions by default, providing a minimal access baseline

### Modifying Role Permissions

To modify permissions for custom roles, click the permissions dropdown next to the role name in the Role Management section. This allows you to add or remove specific permissions as needed.

### Disable Windsurf Access Feature

For administrators who need access to team analytics and audit/attribution logging but do not wish to consume a license, Windsurf provides a "disable Windsurf access" feature.

To access this feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Manage Team">
    Go to the **"Manage Team"** tab in your team settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit User">
    Find the user you want to modify and click **"Edit"** next to their name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Access">
    In the user edit dialog, you can disable their Windsurf access while maintaining their administrative permissions for analytics and logging.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## User Groups

<Note>User Groups are available for Enterprise organizations with SCIM integration enabled.</Note>

For enterprise organizations, Windsurf offers the ability to split users into multiple user groups via SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration. This feature enables:

* **Organizational Structure**: Mirror your company's organizational structure within Windsurf
* **Group-Based Analytics**: View analytics and usage data filtered by specific user groups
* **Delegated Administration**: Assign group administrators who can manage specific user groups
* **Scalable Management**: Efficiently manage large numbers of users through group-based operations

User groups are automatically synchronized with your identity provider through SCIM, ensuring that organizational changes are reflected in Windsurf's access controls.

## User Management

Windsurf's role-based access functionality allows administrators to assign roles to individual users or user groups, providing flexible access control management.

### Assigning Roles to Users

User role management is performed in the Windsurf admin console at [windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Management">
    Go to the team settings page and locate the user management section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find User">
    Scroll through the user list or use the search functionality to find the user you want to modify. Users can be sorted alphabetically by name, email, sign-up time, or last login.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit User Role">
    Click **"Edit"** next to the user's name to open the user management dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Role">
    In the pop-out window, select the appropriate role from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Confirm your selection and save the changes. The new role will be applied immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Administrative Hierarchy

Windsurf's role-based access system recognizes different levels of administrative access:

* **Super Admin**: Users with the admin role in the "all users" group have complete system access and can modify any role or permission
* **Group Admins**: Administrators of specific user groups can only make role and permission changes within their assigned groups

This hierarchical structure ensures that administrative responsibilities can be delegated appropriately while maintaining security boundaries.

### User Sorting and Management

The user management interface provides several sorting options to help administrators efficiently manage large teams:

* **Alphabetical by Name**: Sort users by their display names
* **Email Address**: Sort users by their email addresses
* **Sign-up Time**: View users in order of when they joined the team
* **Last Login**: Sort by most recent activity to identify active users

These sorting options make it easier to find specific users and understand team engagement patterns.

    ## Part 2: Configure SAML and User Attributes in Microsoft Entra ID

    <Note>All steps in this section are performed in the **Microsoft Entra ID admin center**.</Note>

    4. In your new Windsurf application, click on **Set up single sign on**, then click **SAML**.

    5. Click on **Edit** under **Basic SAML Configuration**.

    6. **Keep this Entra ID tab open** and open a new tab to navigate to the **Windsurf Teams SSO settings** at [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings).

    7. In the **Microsoft Entra ID** SAML configuration form:
       * **Identifier (Entity ID)**: Copy the **SP Entity ID** value from the **Windsurf SSO settings page**
       * **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**: Copy the **Callback URL** value from the **Windsurf SSO settings page**
       * Click **Save** at the top

    8. Configure user attributes for proper name display. In **Microsoft Entra ID**, under **Attributes & Claims**, click **Edit**.

    9. Create 2 new claims by clicking **Add new claim** for each:
       * **First claim**: Name = `firstName`, Source attribute = `user.givenname`
       * **Second claim**: Name = `lastName`, Source attribute = `user.surname`

    ## Part 3: Configure SSO Settings in Windsurf Portal

    <Note>Complete the configuration in the **Windsurf portal** ([https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings)).</Note>

    10. In the **Windsurf SSO settings page**:
        * **Pick your SSO ID**: Choose a unique identifier for your team's login portal (this cannot be changed later)
        * **IdP Entity ID**: Copy the value from **Microsoft Entra ID** under **Set up Windsurf** → **Microsoft Entra Identifier**
        * **SSO URL**: Copy the **Login URL** value from **Microsoft Entra ID**
        * **X509 Certificate**: Download the **SAML certificate (Base64)** from **Microsoft Entra ID**, open the file, and paste the text content here

    11. In the **Windsurf portal**, click **Enable Login with SAML**, then click **Save**.

    12. **Test the configuration**: Click **Test Login** to verify the SSO configuration works as expected.

    <Note>**Important**: Do not log out or close the Windsurf settings page until you've successfully tested the login. If the test fails, you may need to troubleshoot your configuration before proceeding.</Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Okta SSO">
    Windsurf Enterprise now supports sign in with Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML. If your organization uses Microsoft Entra, Okta, Google Workspaces, or some other identity provider that supports SAML, you will be able to use SSO with Windsurf.

    <Note>Windsurf only supports SP-initiated SSO; IDP-initiated SSO is NOT currently supported.</Note>

    ### Caveats

    Note that Windsurf does not currently support IDP-initiated login flows.

    We also do not yet support OIDC.

  <Tab title="Azure SCIM">
    Windsurf supports SCIM synchronization for users and groups with Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD. It isn't necessary to setup SSO to use SCIM synchronization, but it is highly recommended.

    You'll need:

    * Admin access to Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD
    * Admin access to Windsurf
    * An existing Windsurf Application on Entra ID (normally from your existing SSO application)

    <Note>
      **Service Key Permissions Required**

      The service key used for SCIM provisioning must have the following permissions:

      * **Team User Read** - Required to read user and group information
      * **Team User Update** - Required to create and update users and groups
      * **Team User Delete** - Required to deactivate/delete users and groups

      You can create a custom role with these permissions or use an existing admin role that includes them.
    </Note>

    ## Step 1: Create a Role with SCIM Permissions

    Before setting up SCIM provisioning, you need to create a role with the required permissions.

    1. Go to [Windsurf Team Settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings)
    2. Under "Other Settings", click **Configure** next to **Role Management**
    3. Click **Add Role** and name it "SCIM Provisioning"
    4. Add the following permissions:
       * Team User Read
       * Team User Update
       * Team User Delete
    5. Click **Save**

    ## Step 2: Navigate to the existing Windsurf Application

    Go to Microsoft Entra ID on Azure, click on Enterprise applications on the left sidebar, and then click on the existing Windsurf application in the list.

    On the Provisioning page at the bottom, there should also be a Provisioning Status toggle. Set that to On to enable SCIM syncing. Now every 40 minutes your users and groups for the Entra ID application will be synced to Windsurf.

    Click on Save to finish, you have now enabled user and group syncing for SCIM. Only users and groups assigned to the application will be synced to Windsurf. Note that removing users only disables them access to Windsurf (and stops them from taking up a seat) rather than deleting users due to Azure's SCIM design.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Okta SCIM">
    Windsurf supports SCIM synchronization for users and groups with Okta. It isn't necessary to setup SSO to use SCIM synchronization, but it is highly recommended.

    You'll need:

    * Admin access to Okta
    * Admin access to Windsurf
    * An existing Windsurf Application on Okta (normally from your existing SSO application)

    ## Step 1: Navigate to the existing Windsurf Application

    Go to Okta, click on Applications, Applications on the left sidebar, and then click on the existing Windsurf application in the application list.

    ## Step 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning

    Under the general tab, App Settings click on Edit on the top right. Then tick the 'Enable SCIM Provisioning' checkbox, then click Save. A new provisioning tab should have showed up on the top.

    Now go to provisioning, click Edit and input in the following fields:

    SCIM connector base URL: [https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2](https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2)

    Unique identifier field for users: email

    Supported provisioning actions: Push New Users, Push Profile Updates, Push Groups

    Authentication Mode: HTTP Header

    For HTTP Header - Authorization, you can generate the token from

    * [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings) and go to the Service Key Configuration
    * Click on Configure, then Add Service Key, and give your API key a name
    * Copy the API key, go back to Okta and paste it to HTTP Header - Authorization

    Click on Save after filling out Provisioning Integration.

    ## Step 3: Setup Provisioning

    Under the provisioning tab, on the left there should be two new tabs. Click on To App, and Edit Provisioning to App. Tick the checkbox for Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users, and click Save.

    After this step, all users assigned to the group will now be synced to Windsurf.

    ## Step 4: Setup Group Provisioning (Optional)

    In order to sync groups to Windsurf, you will have to specify which groups to push. Under the application, click on the Push Groups tab on top. Now click on + Push Groups -> Find Groups by name. Filter for the group you would like to add, make sure Push group memberships immediately is checked, and then click Save. The group will be created and group members will be synced to Windsurf. Groups can then be used to filter for group analytics in the analytics page.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SCIM API">
    This guide shows how to create and maintain groups in Windsurf with the SCIM API.

    There are reasons one may want to provision groups manually rather than with their Identity Provider (Azure/Okta). Companies may want Groups provisioned from a different internal source (HR website, Sourcecode Management Tool etc.) that Windsurf doesn't have access to, or companies may finer control to Groups than what their Idendity Provider provides. Groups can thus be created with an API via HTTP request instead. The following provides examples on the HTTP request via CURL.

    There are 5 main APIs here, Create Group, Add group members, Replace group members, Delete Group, and List Users in a Group.

    ### Create Group

    ```
    curl -k -X POST https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups -d '{
    "displayName": "<group name>",
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"]
    }' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Add Group Members

    ```
    curl -X PATCH https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -d '{"schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations":[
    {
    "op": "add",
    "path":"members",
    "value": [{"value": "<email 1>"}, {"value": "<email 2>"}]
    }]}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Replace Group Members

    ```
    curl -X PATCH https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -d '{"schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
    "Operations":[
    {
    "op": "replace",
    "path":"members",
    "value": [{"value": "<email 1>"}, {"value": "<email 2>"}]
    }]}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### Delete Group

    ```
    curl -X DELETE https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group name> -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json"
    ```

    ### List Group

    ```
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" "https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups"
    ```

    ### List Users in a Group

    ```
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>" "https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Groups/<group_id>"
    ```

    You'll have to at least create the group first, and then replace group to create a group with members in them. You'll also need to URL encode the group names if your group name has a special character like space, so a Group name such as 'Engineering Group' will have to be 'Engineering%20Group' in the URL.

    Note that users need to be created in Windsurf (through SCIM or manually creating the account) before they can be added to a group.

    ## User APIs

    There are also APIs for users as well. The following are some of the common SCIM APIs that Windsurf supports.

    Disable a user (Enable by replacing false to true):

    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Users/<user api key> \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>' \
      -d '{
        "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
        "Operations": [
          {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "active",
            "value": false
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    Create a user:

    ```
    curl -X POST \
      https://server.codeium.com/scim/v2/Users \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api secret key>' \
      -d '{
        "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
        "userName": "<email>",
        "displayName": "<full name>",
        "active": true,
    }' 
    ```

    Update name:

    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      'https://<enterprise portal url>/_route/api_server/scim/v2/Users/<user api key>' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer <service key>' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' \
        -d '{
          "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
          "Operations": [
            {
              "op": "Replace",
              "path": "displayName",
              "value": "<new name>"
            }
          ]
       }'
    ```

    ## Creating Api Secret Key

    Go to [https://windsurf.com/team/settings](https://windsurf.com/team/settings). Under Service Key Configuration, click on Add Service Key. Enter any key name (such as 'Azure Provisioning Key') and click Create Service Key. Copy the output key and save it, you can now use the key to authorize the above APIs.

    10. Enable the SAML login in the Windsurf portal so you can test it.

    **NOTE: DO NOT LOGOUT OR CLOSE THE WINDOW AT THIS POINT.**

    If you get an error or it times out, troubleshoot your settings, otherwise you have to disable your SAML Settings in the Windsurf portal.

    **If you logout or close the window without confirming a successful test - you may get locked out.**

    11. Once your test was successfully completed, you may logout. You can now use SSO sign in when browsing to your team/organization page with the SSO ID you have configured in step 3.

    * ACS URLs - this is the `Callback URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)` from the Windsurf portal.
    * Entity ID - this is the `SP Entity ID` from the Windsurf portal.

# Plans and Credit Usage
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/usage



Prompt credits are consumed whenever a message is sent to Cascade with a premium model. Every model has it's own credit multiplier with the default message costing 1 credit. You can view all available models and their associated costs on the [models page.](/windsurf/models)

Prompt credits are issued monthly according to your plan. They do not roll over to the next month—whether or not you’ve used them, your credit balance will reset at the start of each new billing cycle. Once your monthly prompt credits run out, if you have add-on credits, those will automatically be used instead. Unlike prompt credits, add-on credits do not expire and can be carried over until they’re fully used.

Upon using all of your credits, select premium models will no longer be accessible; however, you will still be able to use several other models that we've made available for free.

## Plans

The [Free](#using-a-free-plan) plan includes:

* 25 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab
* Unlimited Previews
* 1 App Deploy per day

The 2 week [Pro Trial](#using-a-free-pro-trial) includes:

* 100 prompt credits
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab
* Unlimited Previews
* 10 App Deploys per day

The [Pro](#using-pro-plan) plan includes everything in Free, but with:

* 500 prompt credits
* Add-on prompt credits at \$10/250 credits
* All premium models

The [Teams](#using-teams-plan) plan includes everything in Pro, but with:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Add-on prompt credits at \$40/1000 credits
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support
* Access control features available to add

The [Enterprise](#using-enterprise-plan) plan includes everything in Teams, but with:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Add-on prompt credits at \$40/1000 credits
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM
* Highest priority support
* Longer context

If you run out of credits on any paid plan, you will have the option of [purchasing additional credits](#purchasing-additional-credits) or setting up [Automatic Credit Refills](#automatic-credit-refills).

After upgrading, your paid plan will start immediately and you'll have access to premium models again. To learn more about the quotas and features per pricing plan, [click here](https://windsurf.com/pricing).

## Errors

If a user message is unsuccessful, prompt credits will not be consumed. For example, if Cascade attempts to write to a file but that file has unsaved changes, the operation will fail and it will not consume a credit.

## Viewing your usage

There are a few ways to view your usage.

Go to the Cascade usage directly by clicking on the overflow menu, and then selecting "Cascade Usage".

## What happens when you run out of prompt credits?

If you no longer have prompt credits, you have two options:

* You can purchase additional prompt credits to continue using premium models

* You can use Write or Chat mode with the models that cost 0 credits!

## Automatic Credit Refills

We've introduced Automatic Credit Refills so that you no longer need to manually purchase additional credits. Under your plan settings page on the Windsurf website, you can specify a maximum amount of credits and other refill settings. The system will automatically "top-up" your credits as you start running low (below 15 credits).

Automatic Credit Refills are purchased in configurable increments (multiples of \$10 for Pro and \$40 for Teams) and subject to maximum monthly budget caps (\$50 by default for Pro users and \$160 for Teams users). This ensures you won't lose access to Cascade during critical work.

## Purchasing additional credits

If you run out of prompt credits, you can purchase additional credits in the [billing website](https://windsurf.com/plan). Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits for Pro users.

For Team and Enterprise plans, additional credits are purchased within and treated as a pool amongst all members of the team at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits. Please contact your Teams admin to purchase more credits if you're on a team plan.

## Usage examples

To explain how credits work, here's a simple example:

When you send a message to Cascade with a premium model, 1 Prompt credit is consumed. It doesn't matter how many actions Cascade takes to fulfill your request - whether it searches your codebase, analyzes files, or makes edits - you only pay for the initial prompt.

This simplified system makes it much easier to predict and manage your usage. No more complicated calculations of flow actions or different credit types.

## Plan Usage

### Using a Free Pro Trial

The Pro Trial lasts for 2 weeks and includes unlimited Windsurf Tab, 100 prompt credits, Previews, and Deploys.

When you're on a Pro Trial, you'll have access to premium features! To get started, ask Cascade a question. In Write and Chat mode, Cascade is optimized to fully understand your codebase and leverages tool calls to assist you. By default, all of your requests will use premium models until you run out of credits.

After your trial period ends, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue using premium models.

If you don't upgrade during the Free Trial period, you'll be downgraded to our Free plan which includes 25 prompt credits per month.

### Using Pro Plan

The Pro plan costs \$15/month and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/month
* All premium models
* Previews
* App Deploys

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$10 for 250 credits.

While on Pro, you'll have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. You can view how many credits you have remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel that's accessible in the status bar.

If you're running low on credits, Cascade will notify you so that you can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. To purchase additional credits, visit the billing website and select "Purchase credits". The credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

If you want to reduce your consumption of prompt credits, there are several available models that cost 0 credits!

In addition to prompt credits, Pro comes with unlimited Fast Autocomplete and unlimited premium model requests with Command.

### Using Teams Plan

The Teams plan costs \$30/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes:

* 500 prompt credits/user/month
* Everything in Pro, plus:
* Centralized billing
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

The Teams plan has a seat cap of 200 users. Coming soon, there will be an option to add Access Control features for +\$10/user/month.

While on the Teams plan, each user will have access to a monthly quota of prompt credits. Unlike the previous system, base prompt credits are not pooled - each user has their own credit limit. However, purchased add-on prompt credits are pooled across the organization. You can view how many credits your team has remaining in the Windsurf Settings panel.

If your team is running low on credits, your administrator can purchase additional credits or enable Automatic Credit Refills. These add-on prompt credits purchased will rollover to the following usage month if there are any remaining.

### Using Enterprise Plan

The Enterprise plan costs \$60/user/month (up to 200 users) and includes everything in Teams plus:

* 1000 prompt credits/user/month
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* SSO & SCIM (included)
* Longer model context lengths
* Highest priority support

Additional prompt credits can be purchased at a rate of \$40 for 1000 pooled credits.

Coming soon, Enterprise will be self-serviceable with month-to-month pricing. The Enterprise plan includes self-serve SSO integration and enhanced security features.

### Using a Free plan

The Free plan comes with:

* 25 prompt credits/month
* Unlimited Windsurf Tab
* Unlimited Previews
* 1 App Deploy per day

Windsurf can still be used for free after your credits are exhausted! There are several models available that cost 0 credits to use.

When editing code, you'll have access to unlimited Tab completions and AI command instructions. To learn more about features in Free and in paid tiers, [click here](https://codeium.com/pricing).

## Canceling your paid plan

As a paid individial user, you can cancel your plan at any time by browsing to the [windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan](https://windsurf.com/subscription/manage-plan) page.
Upon canceling your paid plan, you'll still have access to all of your credits from your monthly quota and add-on prompt credits until the end of the usage month. After the usage month, all add-on prompt credits will expire and you'll be downgraded to the Free plan where you'll be provided a limited number of prompt credits.
If you change your mind and decide not to cancel before the end of the usage month, you can renew your plan by visiting the billing page.

For Teams or Enterprise plans, only the admin can cancel the plan, delete the team and remove users.


# Advanced
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/advanced



All advanced configurations can be found in Windsurf Settings which can be accessed by the top right dropdown → Windsurf Settings or Command Palette (Ctrl/⌘+Shift+P) → Open Windsurf Settings Page.

# Enabling Cascade access to .gitignore files

To provide Cascade with access to files that match patterns in your project's .gitignore , go to your Windsurf Settings and go to "Cascade Gitignore Access". By default, it is turned off. To provide access, turn it on by clicking the toggle.

# SSH Support

The usual SSH support in VSCode is licensed by Microsoft, so we have implemented our own just for Windsurf. It does require you to have [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) installed, but otherwise has minimal dependencies, and should "just work" like you're used to. You can access SSH under `Remote-SSH` in the Command Palette, or via the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left.
This extension has worked great for our internal development, but there are some known caveats and bugs:

* We currently only support SSHing into Linux-based remote hosts.

* The usual Microsoft "Remote - SSH" extension (and the [open-remote-ssh](https://github.com/jeanp413/open-remote-ssh) extension) will not work—please do not install them, as they conflict with our support.

* We don't have all the features of the Microsoft SSH extension right now. We mostly just support the important thing: connecting to a host. If you have feature requests, let us know!

* Connecting to a remote host via SSH then accessing a devcontainer on that remote host won't work like it does in VSCode. (We're working on it!) For now, if you want to do this, we recommend instead manually setting up an SSH daemon inside your devcontainer. Here is the set-up which we've found to work, but please be careful to make sure it's right for your use-case.

  1. Inside the devcontainer, run this once (running multiple times may mess up your `sshd_config`):

  ```
  sudo -s -- <<HERE
  sed -i '/SSO SSH Config START/Q' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  echo "Port 2222" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ssh-keygen -A
  HERE
  ```

  2. Inside the devcontainer, run this in a terminal you keep alive (e.g. via tmux):

  ```
  sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -D
  ```

  3. Then just connect to your remote host via SSH in windsurf, but using the port 2222.

* SSH agent-forwarding is on by default, and will use Windsurf's latest connection to that host. If you're having trouble with it, try reloading the window to refresh the connection.

* On Windows, you'll see some `cmd.exe` windows when it asks for your password. This is expected—we'll get rid of them soon.

* If you have issues, please first make sure that you can ssh into your remote host using regular `ssh` in a terminal. If the problem persists, include the output from the `Output > Remote SSH (Windsurf)` tab in any bug reports!

# Dev Containers

Windsurf supports Development Containers on Mac, Windows, and Linux for both local and remote (via SSH) workflows.

Prerequisites:

* Local: Docker must be installed on your machine and accessible from the Windsurf terminal.
* Remote over SSH: Connect to a remote host using Windsurf Remote-SSH. Docker must be installed and accessible on the remote host (from the remote shell). Your project should include a `devcontainer.json` or equivalent config.

Available commands (in both local and remote windows):

1. `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container`
   * Open a new workspace using a specified `devcontainer.json`.
2. `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
   * Reopen the current workspace in a new container defined by your `devcontainer.json`.
3. `Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container`
   * Attach to an existing Docker container and connect your current workspace to it. If the container does not follow the [Development Container Specificaton](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/), Windsurf will attempt best-effort detection of the remote user and environment.
4. `Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally`
   * When connected to a development container, disconnect and reopen the workspace on the local filesystem.
5. `Dev Containers: Show Windsurf Dev Containers Log`
   * Open the Dev Containers log output for troubleshooting.

These commands are available from the Command Palette and will also appear when you click the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left (including when you are connected to a remote host via SSH).

Related:

* `Remote Explorer: Focus on Dev Containers (Windsurf) View` — quickly open the Dev Containers view.

# WSL (Beta)

As of version 1.1.0, Windsurf has beta support for Windows Subsystem for Linux. You must already have WSL set up and configured on your Windows machine.

You can access WSL by clicking on the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom left, or under `Remote-WSL` in the Command Palette.

# Extension Marketplace

You can change the marketplace you use to download extensions from. To do this, go to `Windsurf Settings` and modify the Marketplace URL settings under the `General` section.

# App Deploys
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys



App Deploys lets you deploy web applications and sites directly within Windsurf through Cascade tool calls. This feature helps you share your work through public URLs, update your deployments, and claim projects for further customization. This feature is in beta and support for additional frameworks, more robust builds, etc. are coming soon.

</Frame>

## Overview

With App Deploys, you can:

* Deploy a website or JS web app to a public domain
* Re-deploy to the same URL after making changes
* Claim the project to your personal account

<Warning>
  App Deploys are intended primarily for preview purposes. For production
  applications with sensitive data, we recommend claiming your deployment and
  following security best practices.
</Warning>

## Supported Providers

We currently support the following deployment provider:

* **Netlify** - For static sites and web applications

<Note>Support for additional providers are planned for future releases.</Note>

## How It Works

When you use App Deploys, your code is uploaded to our server and deployed to the provider under our umbrella account. The deployed site will be available at a public URL formatted as:

```
<SUBDOMAIN_NAME>.windsurf.build
```

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys-demo1.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=844977e5cf94c8393e2418bdaec2e921" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys-demo1.mp4" />

### Deployment Process

1. Cascade analyzes your project to determine the appropriate framework
2. Your project files are securely uploaded to our server
3. The deployment is created on the provider's platform
4. You receive a public URL and a claim link

### Project Configuration

To facilitate redeployment, we create a `windsurf_deployment.yaml` file at the root of your project. This file contains information for future deployments, such as a project ID and framework.

## Using App Deploys

To deploy your application, simply ask Cascade something like:

```
"Deploy this project to Netlify"
"Update my deployment"
```

Cascade will guide you through the process and help troubleshoot common issues.

## Team Deploys

<Note> You will need Team admin priveleges to toggle this feature.</Note>

Users on Teams and Enterprise plans can connect their Netlify accounts with their Windsurf accounts and deploy to their Netlify Team.

This can be toggled in Team Settings, which you can access via the Profile page or by clicking [here](https://windsurf.com/team/settings).

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Your code will be uploaded to our servers for deployment. Only deploy code
  that you're comfortable sharing publicly.
</Warning>

We take several precautions to ensure security:

* File size limits and validation
* Rate limiting based on your account tier
* Secure handling of project files

For added privacy, visit [clear-cookies.windsurf.build](https://clear-cookies.windsurf.build) to check for and clear any cookies set by sites under `windsurf.build`. If any cookies show up, they shouldn't be there, and clearing them helps prevent cross-site cookie issues and keeps your experience clean.

Windsurf sites are built by humans and AI, and while we encourage the AI to make best practice decisions, it's smart to stay cautious. Windsurf isn't responsible for issues caused by sites deployed by our users.

## Claiming Your Deployment

After deploying, you'll receive a claim URL. By following this link, you can claim the project on your personal provider account, giving you:

* Full control over the deployment
* Access to provider-specific features
* Ability to modify the domain name
* Direct access to logs and build information

<Note>
  Unclaimed deployments may be deleted after a certain period. We recommend
  claiming important projects promptly.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

To prevent abuse, we apply these tier-based rate limits:

| Plan | Deployments per day | Max unclaimed sites |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Free | 1                   | 1                   |
| Pro  | 10                  | 5                   |

## Supported Frameworks

App Deploys works with most popular JavaScript frameworks, including:

* Next.js
* React
* Vue
* Svelte
* Static HTML/CSS/JS sites

## Troubleshooting

### Failed Deployment Build

If your deployment fails:

1. Check the build logs provided by Cascade
2. Ensure your project can build locally (run `npm run build` to test)
3. Verify that your project follows the framework's recommended structure
4. View the documentation for how to deploy [your framework to Netlify via `netlify.toml`](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/)
5. Consider claiming the project to access detailed logs on the provider's dashboard

</Frame>

This likely means that your build failed. Please claim your site (you can find it on your [deploy history](https://windsurf.com/deploy)) and check the build logs for more details. Often times you can paste your build logs into Cascade and ask for help.

### Changing Your Subdomain / URL

#### Updating `netlify.app` domain

You can change your subdomain by claiming your deployment and updating the Netlify site settings. This will update your `.netlify.app` domain.

#### Updating custom `.windsurf.build` subdomain

<Warning>
  You cannot change your custom `.windsurf.build` subdomain after you've
  deployed. Instead, you'll need to deploy a new site with a new subdomain.
</Warning>

To update your custom `.windsurf.build` subdomain, you'll need to deploy a new site with a new subdomain:

1. Delete the `windsurf_config.yaml` file from your project
2. Ask Cascade to deploy a new site with a new subdomain and tell it which one you want
3. It can help to start a new conversation or clear your auto-generated memories so that Cascade doesn't try to re-deploy to the old subdomain
4. When you create a new deployment, you'll be able to press the "Edit" button on the subdomain UI to update it prior to pressing "Deploy"

### Error: `Unable to get project name for project ID`

This error occurs when your project ID is not found in our system of records or if Cascade is using the subdomain as the project ID incorrectly. To fix this:

1. Check that the project still exists in your Netlify account (assuming it is claimed).
2. Check that the project ID is in the `windsurf_deployment.yaml` file. If it is not in the file, you can download your config file from your [deploy history](https://windsurf.com/deploy) dropdown.
3. Try redeploying and telling Cascade to use the `project_id` from the `windsurf_deployment.yaml` file more explicitly

# Cascade Code / Cascade Chat

Cascade comes in two primary modes: **Code** and **Chat**.

Code mode allows Cascade to create and make modifications to your codebase, while Chat mode is optimized for questions around your codebase or general coding principles.

While in Chat mode, Cascade may propose new code to you that you can accept and insert.

# Plans and Todo Lists

Cascade has built-in planning capabilities that help improve performance for longer tasks.

In the background, a specialized planning agent continuously refines the long-term plan while your selected model focuses on taking short-term actions based on that plan.

Cascade will create a Todo list within the conversation to track progress on complex tasks. To make changes to the plan, simply ask Cascade to make updates to the Todo list.

Cascade may also automatically make updates to the plan as it picks up new information, such as a [Memory](/windsurf/memories), during the course of a conversation.

# Queued Messages

While you are waiting for Cascade to finish its current task, you can queue up new messages to execute in order once the task is complete.

To add a message to the queue, simply type in your message while Cascade is working and press `Enter`.

* **Send immediately**: Press Enter again on an empty text box to send it right away.
* **Delete**: Remove any message from the queue before it's sent

# Tool Calling

Cascade has a variety of tools at its disposal, such as Search, Analyze, [Web Search](/windsurf/web-search), [MCP](/windsurf/mcp), and the [terminal](/windsurf/terminal).

It can detect which packages and tools that you're using, which ones need to be installed, and even install them for you. Just ask Cascade how to run your project and press Accept.

<Note>Cascade can make up to 20 tool calls per prompt. If the trajectory stops, simply press the `continue` button and Cascade will resume from where it left off. However, each `continue` will count as a new prompt credit due to tool calling costs.</Note>

You can configure an `Auto-Continue` setting to have Cascade automatically continue its response if it hits a limit. These will consume a prompt credit(s) corresponding to the model you are using.

# Named Checkpoints and Reverts

You have the ability to revert changes that Cascade has made. Simply hover your mouse over the original prompt and click on the revert arrow on the right, or revert directly from the table of contents. This will revert all code changes back to the state of your codebase at the desired step.

<Warning>Reverts are currently irreversible, so be careful!</Warning>

# Ignoring files

If you'd like Cascade to ignore files, you can add your files to `.codeiumignore` at the root of your workspace. This will prevent Cascade from viewing, editing or creating files inside of the paths designated. You can declare the file paths in a format similar to `.gitignore`.

## Global .codeiumignore

For enterprise customers managing multiple repositories, you can enforce ignore rules across all repositories by placing a global `.codeiumignore` file in the `~/.codeium/` folder. This global configuration will apply to all Windsurf workspaces on your system and works in addition to any repository-specific `.codeiumignore` files.

# Linter integration

Cascade can automatically fix linting errors on generated code. This is turned on by default, but it can be disabled by clicking `Auto-fix` on the tool call, and clicking `disable`. This edit will not consume any credits.

When Cascade makes an edit with the primary goal of fixing lints that it created and auto-detected,
it may discount the edit to be free of credit charge. This is in recognition of the fact that
fixing lint errors increases the number of tool calls that Cascade makes.

# Sharing your conversation

<Note>This feature is currently only available for Teams and Enterprise customers. Currently not available to Hybrid customers.</Note>

You can share your Cascade trajectories with your team by clicking the `...` Additional options button in the top right of the Cascade panel, and clicking `Share Conversation`.

# @-mention previous conversations

You can also reference previous conversations with other conversations via an `@-mention`.

When you do this, Cascade will retrieve the most relevant and useful information like the conversation summaries and checkpoints, and specific parts of the conversation that you query for. It typically will not retrieve the full conversation as to not overwhelm the context window.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/at-mention-convos.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=f580f0222fdf75ec42cb7a9470e6de02" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/at-mention-convos.mp4" />

# Simultaneous Cascades

Users can have multiple Cascades running simultaneously. You can navigate between them using the dropdown menu in the top left of the Cascade panel.

<Warning>If two Cascades edit the same file at the same time, the edits can race, and sometimes the second edit will fail.</Warning>


# Cascade Hooks (Beta)
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/hooks



Cascade Hooks enable you to execute custom shell commands at key points during Cascade's workflow. This powerful extensibility feature allows you to log operations, enforce guardrails, run validation checks, or integrate with external systems.

<Warning>
  **Beta Release**: Cascade Hooks are currently in beta and undergoing active development. Features and APIs may change. Please contact [Windsurf Support](https://windsurf.com/support) with feedback or bug reports.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Hooks are designed for power users and enterprise teams who need fine-grained control over Cascade's behavior. They require basic shell scripting knowledge.
</Note>

## What You Can Build

Hooks unlock a wide range of automation and governance capabilities:

* **Logging & Analytics**: Track every file read, code change, or command executed by Cascade for compliance and usage analysis
* **Security Controls**: Block Cascade from accessing sensitive files or running dangerous commands
* **Quality Assurance**: Run linters, formatters, or tests automatically after code modifications
* **Custom Workflows**: Integrate with issue trackers, notification systems, or deployment pipelines
* **Team Standardization**: Enforce coding standards and best practices across your organization

## How Hooks Work

Hooks are shell commands that run automatically when specific Cascade actions occur. Each hook:

1. **Receives context** (details about the action being performed) via JSON as standard input
2. **Executes your script** - Python, Bash, Node.js, or any executable
3. **Returns a result** via exit code and output streams

For **pre-hooks** (executed before an action), your script can **block the action** by exiting with exit code `2`. This makes pre-hooks ideal for implementing security policies or validation checks.

## Configuration

Hooks are configured in JSON files that can be placed at three different levels. Cascade loads and merges hooks from all locations, giving teams flexibility in how they distribute and manage hook configurations.

#### System-Level

System-level hooks are ideal for organization-wide policies enforced on shared development machines. For example, you can use them to enforce security policies, compliance requirements, or mandatory code review workflows.

* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/hooks.json`
* **Linux/WSL**: `/etc/windsurf/hooks.json`
* **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Windsurf\hooks.json`

#### User-Level

User-level hooks are perfect for personal preferences and optional workflows.

* **Location**: `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`

#### Workspace-Level

Workspace-level hooks allow teams to version control project-specific policies alongside their code. They may include custom validation rules, project-specific integrations, or team-specific workflows.

* **Location**: `.windsurf/hooks.json` in your workspace root

<Note>
  Hooks from all three locations are **merged together**. If the same hook event is configured in multiple locations, all hooks will execute in order: system → user → workspace.
</Note>

### Basic Structure

Here is an example of the basic structure of the hooks configuration:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre_read_code": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /path/to/your/script.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ],
    "post_write_code": [

        "command": "python3 /path/to/another/script.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

Each hook accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter           | Type    | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `command`           | string  | The shell command to execute. Can be any valid executable with arguments.                               |
| `show_output`       | boolean | Whether to display the hook's stdout/stderr output on the user-facing Cascade UI. Useful for debugging. |
| `working_directory` | string  | Optional. The directory to execute the command from. Defaults to your workspace root.                   |

## Hook Events

Cascade provides eight hook events that cover the most critical actions in the agent workflow.

### Common Input Structure

All hooks receive a JSON object with the following common fields:

| Field               | Type   | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `agent_action_name` | string | The hook event name (e.g., "pre\_read\_code", "post\_write\_code") |
| `trajectory_id`     | string | Unique identifier for the overall Cascade conversation             |
| `execution_id`      | string | Unique identifier for the single agent turn                        |
| `timestamp`         | string | ISO 8601 timestamp when the hook was triggered                     |
| `tool_info`         | object | Event-specific information (varies by hook type)                   |

In the following examples, the common fields are omitted for brevity. There are eight major types of hook events:

### pre\_read\_code

Triggered **before** Cascade reads a code file. This may block the action if the hook exits with code 2.

**Use cases**: Restrict file access, log read operations, check permissions

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "pre_read_code",
  "tool_info": {
    "file_path": "/Users/yourname/project/file.py"
  }
}
```

This `file_path` may be a directory path when Cascade reads a directory recursively.

### post\_read\_code

Triggered **after** Cascade successfully reads a code file.

**Use cases**: Log successful reads, track file access patterns

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "post_read_code",
  "tool_info": {
    "file_path": "/Users/yourname/project/file.py"
  }
}
```

This `file_path` may be a directory path when Cascade reads a directory recursively.

### pre\_write\_code

Triggered **before** Cascade writes or modifies a code file. This may block the action if the hook exits with code 2.

**Use cases**: Prevent modifications to protected files, backup files before changes

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "pre_write_code",
  "tool_info": {
    "file_path": "/Users/yourname/project/file.py",
    "edits": [
      {
        "old_string": "def old_function():\n    pass",
        "new_string": "def new_function():\n    return True"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### post\_write\_code

Triggered **after** Cascade writes or modifies a code file.

**Use cases**: Run linters, formatters, or tests; log code changes

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "post_write_code",
  "tool_info": {
    "file_path": "/Users/yourname/project/file.py",
    "edits": [
      {
        "old_string": "import os",
        "new_string": "import os\nimport sys"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### pre\_run\_command

Triggered **before** Cascade executes a terminal command. This may block the action if the hook exits with code 2.

**Use cases**: Block dangerous commands, log all command executions, add safety checks

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "pre_run_command",
  "tool_info": {
    "command_line": "npm install package-name",
    "cwd": "/Users/yourname/project"
  }
}
```

### post\_run\_command

Triggered **after** Cascade executes a terminal command.

**Use cases**: Log command results, trigger follow-up actions

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "post_run_command",
  "tool_info": {
    "command_line": "npm install package-name",
    "cwd": "/Users/yourname/project"
  }
}
```

### pre\_mcp\_tool\_use

Triggered **before** Cascade invokes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool. This may block the action if the hook exits with code 2.

**Use cases**: Log MCP usage, restrict which MCP tools can be used

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "pre_mcp_tool_use",
  "tool_info": {
    "mcp_server_name": "github",
    "mcp_tool_arguments": {
      "owner": "code-owner",
      "repo": "my-cool-repo",
      "title": "Bug report",
      "body": "Description of the bug here"
    },
    "mcp_tool_name": "create_issue"
  }
}
```

### post\_mcp\_tool\_use

Triggered **after** Cascade successfully invokes an MCP tool.

**Use cases**: Log MCP operations, track API usage, see MCP results

**Input JSON**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "agent_action_name": "post_mcp_tool_use",
  "tool_info": {
    "mcp_result": "...",
    "mcp_server_name": "github",
    "mcp_tool_arguments": {
      "owner": "code-owner",
      "perPage": 1,
      "repo": "my-cool-repo",
      "sha": "main"
    },
    "mcp_tool_name": "list_commits"
  }
}
```

## Exit Codes

Your hook scripts communicate results through exit codes:

| Exit Code | Meaning        | Effect                                                                                               |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | Success        | Action proceeds normally                                                                             |
| `2`       | Blocking Error | The Cascade agent will see the error message from stderr. For pre-hooks, this **blocks** the action. |
| Any other | Error          | Action proceeds normally                                                                             |

<Warning>
  Only **pre-hooks** (pre\_read\_code, pre\_write\_code, pre\_run\_command, pre\_mcp\_tool\_use) can block actions using exit code 2. Post-hooks cannot block since the action has already occurred.
</Warning>

Keep in mind that the user can see any hook-generated standard output and standard error in the Cascade UI if `show_output` is true.

## Example Use Cases

### Logging All Cascade Actions

Track every action Cascade takes for auditing purposes.

**Config** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`):

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "post_read_code": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /Users/yourname/hooks/log_input.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ],
    "post_write_code": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /Users/yourname/hooks/log_input.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ],
    "post_run_command": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /Users/yourname/hooks/log_input.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ],
    "post_mcp_tool_use": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /Users/yourname/hooks/log_input.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Script** (`log_input.py`):

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import json

def main():
    # Read the JSON data from stdin
    input_data = sys.stdin.read()
    
    # Parse the JSON
    try:
        data = json.loads(input_data)
        
        # Write formatted JSON to file
        with open("/Users/yourname/hooks/input.txt", "a") as f:
            f.write('\n' + '='*80 + '\n')
            f.write(json.dumps(data, indent=2, separators=(',', ': ')))
            f.write('\n')
    
        print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing JSON: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script appends every hook invocation to a log file, creating an audit trail of all Cascade actions. You may transform the input data or perform custom logic as you see fit.

### Restricting File Access

Prevent Cascade from reading files outside a specific directory.

**Config** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`):

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre_read_code": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /Users/yourname/hooks/block_read_access.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Script** (`block_read_access.py`):

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import json

ALLOWED_PREFIX = "/Users/yourname/my-project/"

def main():
    # Read the JSON data from stdin
    input_data = sys.stdin.read()

    # Parse the JSON
    try:
        data = json.loads(input_data)

        if data.get("agent_action_name") == "pre_read_code":
            tool_info = data.get("tool_info", {})
            file_path = tool_info.get("file_path", "")
            
            if not file_path.startswith(ALLOWED_PREFIX):
                print(f"Access denied: Cascade is only allowed to read files under {ALLOWED_PREFIX}", file=sys.stderr)
                sys.exit(2)  # Exit code 2 blocks the action
            
            print(f"Access granted: {file_path}", file=sys.stdout)

    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing JSON: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When Cascade attempts to read a file outside the allowed directory, this hook blocks the operation and displays an error message.

### Blocking Dangerous Commands

Prevent Cascade from executing potentially harmful commands.

**Config** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`):

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre_run_command": [
      {
        "command": "python3 /Users/yourname/hooks/block_dangerous_commands.py",
        "show_output": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Script** (`block_dangerous_commands.py`):

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import json

DANGEROUS_COMMANDS = ["rm -rf", "sudo rm", "format", "del /f"]

def main():
    # Read the JSON data from stdin
    input_data = sys.stdin.read()

    # Parse the JSON
    try:
        data = json.loads(input_data)

        if data.get("agent_action_name") == "pre_run_command":
            tool_info = data.get("tool_info", {})
            command = tool_info.get("command_line", "")

            for dangerous_cmd in DANGEROUS_COMMANDS:
                if dangerous_cmd in command:
                    print(f"Command blocked: '{dangerous_cmd}' is not allowed for safety reasons.", file=sys.stderr)
                    sys.exit(2)  # Exit code 2 blocks the command
            
            print(f"Command approved: {command}", file=sys.stdout)

    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing JSON: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This hook scans commands for dangerous patterns and blocks them before execution.

### Running Code Formatters After Edits

Automatically format code files after Cascade modifies them.

**Config** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json`):

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "post_write_code": [
      {
        "command": "bash /Users/yourname/hooks/format_code.sh",
        "show_output": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Script** (`format_code.sh`):

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

# Read JSON from stdin
input=$(cat)

# Extract file path using jq
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_info.file_path')

# Format based on file extension
if [[ "$file_path" == *.py ]]; then
    black "$file_path" 2>&1
    echo "Formatted Python file: $file_path"
elif [[ "$file_path" == *.js ]] || [[ "$file_path" == *.ts ]]; then
    prettier --write "$file_path" 2>&1
    echo "Formatted JS/TS file: $file_path"
elif [[ "$file_path" == *.go ]]; then
    gofmt -w "$file_path" 2>&1
    echo "Formatted Go file: $file_path"
fi

exit 0
```

This hook automatically runs the appropriate formatter based on the file type after each edit.

## Best Practices

### Security

<Warning>
  **Use Cascade Hooks at Your Own Risk**: Hooks execute shell commands automatically with your user account's full permissions. You are entirely responsible for the code you configure. Poorly designed or malicious hooks can modify files, delete data, expose credentials, or compromise your system.
</Warning>

* **Validate all inputs**: Never trust the input JSON without validation, especially for file paths and commands.
* **Use absolute paths**: Always use absolute paths in your hook configurations to avoid ambiguity.
* **Protect sensitive data**: Avoid logging sensitive information like API keys or credentials.
* **Review permissions**: Ensure your hook scripts have appropriate file system permissions.
* **Audit before deployment**: Review every hook command and script before adding to your configuration.
* **Test in isolation**: Run hooks in a test environment before enabling them on your primary development machine.

### Performance Considerations

* **Keep hooks fast**: Slow hooks will impact Cascade's responsiveness. Aim for sub-100ms execution times.
* **Use async operations**: For non-blocking hooks, consider logging to a queue or database asynchronously.
* **Filter early**: Check the action type at the start of your script to avoid unnecessary processing.

### Error Handling

* **Always validate JSON**: Use try-catch blocks to handle malformed input gracefully.
* **Log errors properly**: Write errors to `stderr` so they're visible when `show_output` is enabled.
* **Fail safely**: If your hook encounters an error, consider whether it should block the action or allow it to proceed.

### Testing Your Hooks

1. **Start with logging**: Begin by implementing a simple logging hook to understand the data flow.
2. **Use `show_output: true`**: Enable output during development to see what your hooks are doing.
3. **Test blocking behavior**: Verify that exit code 2 properly blocks actions in pre-hooks.
4. **Check all code paths**: Test both success and failure scenarios in your scripts.

## Enterprise Distribution

Enterprise organizations need to enforce security policies, compliance requirements, and development standards that individual users cannot bypass. Cascade Hooks supports this through **system-level configuration**, which takes precedence and cannot be disabled by end users without root permissions.

Deploy your mandatory `hooks.json` configuration to these OS-specific locations:

**macOS:**

```
/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/hooks.json
```

**Linux/WSL:**

```
/etc/windsurf/hooks.json
```

**Windows:**

```
C:\ProgramData\Windsurf\hooks.json
```

Place your hook scripts in a corresponding system directory (e.g., `/usr/local/share/windsurf-hooks/` on Unix systems).

### Deployment Methods

Enterprise IT teams can deploy system-level hooks using standard tools and workflows:

**Mobile Device Management (MDM)**

* **Jamf Pro** (macOS) - Deploy via configuration profiles or scripts
* **Microsoft Intune** (Windows/macOS) - Use PowerShell scripts or policy deployment
* **Workspace ONE**, **Google Endpoint Management**, and other MDM solutions

**Configuration Management**

* **Ansible**, **Puppet**, **Chef**, **SaltStack** - Use your existing infrastructure automation
* **Custom deployment scripts** - Shell scripts, PowerShell, or your preferred tooling

### Verification and Auditing

After deployment, verify that hooks are properly installed and cannot be bypassed:

```bash  theme={null}
# Verify system hooks are present
ls -la /etc/windsurf/hooks.json  # Linux
ls -la "/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/hooks.json"  # macOS

# Test hook execution (should see hook output in Cascade)
# Have a developer trigger the relevant Cascade action

# Verify users cannot modify system hooks
sudo chown root:root /etc/windsurf/hooks.json
sudo chmod 644 /etc/windsurf/hooks.json
```

<Note>
  **Important**: System-level hooks are entirely managed by your IT or security team. Windsurf does not deploy or manage files at system-level paths. Ensure your internal teams handle deployment, updates, and compliance according to your organization's policies.
</Note>

### Workspace Hooks for Team Projects

For project-specific conventions, teams can use workspace-level hooks in version control:

```bash  theme={null}
# Add to your repository
.windsurf/
├── hooks.json
└── scripts/
    └── format-check.py

# Commit to git
git add .windsurf/
git commit -m "Add workspace hooks for code formatting"
```

This allows teams to standardize development practices. Be sure to keep security-critical policies at the system level, and be sure not to check in any sensitive information to version control.

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp



**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol that enables LLMs to access custom tools and services.
An MCP client (Cascade, in this case) can make requests to MCP servers to access tools that they provide.
Cascade now natively integrates with MCP, allowing you to bring your own selection of MCP servers for Cascade to use.
See the [official MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for more information.

<Note>Enterprise users must manually turn this on via settings</Note>

## Adding a new MCP plugin

New MCP plugins can be added from the Plugin Store, which you can access by clicking on the `Plugins` icon in the top right menu in the Cascade panel, or from the `Windsurf Settings` > `Cascade` > `Plugins` section.

If you cannot find your desired MCP plugin, you can add it manually by editing the raw `mcp_config.json` file.

Official MCP plugins will show up with a blue checkmark, indicating that they are made by the parent service company.

When you click on a plugin, simply click `Install` to expose the server and its tools to Cascade.

Windsurf supports two [transport types](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports) for MCP servers: `stdio` and `http`.

For `http` servers, the URL should reflect that of the endpoint and resemble `https://<your-server-url>/mcp`.

We can also support streamable HTTP transport and MCP Authentication.

<Note>Make sure to press the refresh button after you add a new MCP plugin.</Note>

## Configuring MCP tools

Each plugin has a certain number of tools it has access to. Cascade has a limit of 100 total tools that it has access to at any given time.

At the plugin level, you can navigate to the Tools tab and toggle the tools that you wish to enable. Or, from the `Windsurf Settings`, you can click on the `Manage plugins` button.

## mcp\_config.json

The `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` file is a JSON file that contains a list of servers that Cascade can connect to.

The JSON should follow the same schema as the config file for Claude Desktop.

Here’s an example configuration, which sets up a single server for GitHub:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that for HTTP servers, the configuration is slightly different and requires a `serverUrl` field.

Here's an example configuration for an HTTP server:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "serverUrl": "<your-server-url>/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>For Figma Dev Mode MCP server, make sure you have updated to the latest Figma desktop app version to use the new `/mcp` endpoint.</Note>

Be sure to provide the required arguments and environment variables for the servers that you want to use.

See the [official MCP server reference repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) or [OpenTools](https://opentools.com/) for some example servers.

## Admin Controls (Teams & Enterprises)

Team admins can toggle MCP access for their team, as well as whitelist approved MCP servers for their team to use:

<Card title="MCP Team Settings" horizontal={true} icon="hammer" href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings">
  Configurable MCP settings for your team.
</Card>

<Warning>The above link will only work if you have admin privileges for your team.</Warning>

By default, users within a team will be able to configure their own MCP servers. However, once you whitelist even a single MCP server, **all non-whitelisted servers will be blocked** for your team.

### How Server Matching Works

When you whitelist an MCP server, the system uses **regex pattern matching** with the following rules:

* **Full String Matching**: All patterns are automatically anchored (wrapped with `^(?:pattern)$`) to prevent partial matches
* **Command Field**: Must match exactly or according to your regex pattern
* **Arguments Array**: Each argument is matched individually against its corresponding pattern
* **Array Length**: The number of arguments must match exactly between whitelist and user config
* **Special Characters**: Characters like `$`, `.`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)` have special regex meaning and should be escaped with `\` if you want literal matching

### Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Plugin Store Default (Recommended)" description="Leave the Server Config (JSON) field empty to allow the default configuration from the Windsurf MCP Plugin Store.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `github-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**: *(leave empty)*

    ```json  theme={null}
    {}
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github-mcp-server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This allows users to install the GitHub MCP server with any valid configuration, as long as the server ID matches the plugin store entry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 2: Exact Match Configuration" description="Provide the exact configuration that users must use. Users must match this configuration exactly.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `github-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": ""
      }
    }
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github-mcp-server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Users must use this exact configuration - any deviation in command or args will be blocked. The `env` section can have different values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Option 3: Flexible Regex Patterns" description="Use regex patterns to allow variations in user configurations while maintaining security controls.">
    **Admin Whitelist Configuration:**

    * **Server ID**: `python-mcp-server`
    * **Server Config (JSON)**:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/.*\\.py", "--port", "[0-9]+"]
    }
    ```

    **Matching User Config (`mcp_config.json`):**

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "python-mcp-server": {
          "command": "python3",
          "args": ["/home/user/my_server.py", "--port", "8080"],
          "env": {
            "PYTHONPATH": "/home/user/mcp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This example allows users flexibility while maintaining security:

    * The regex `/.*\\.py` matches any Python file path like `/home/user/my_server.py`
    * The regex `[0-9]+` matches any numeric port like `8080` or `3000`
    * Users can customize file paths and ports while admins ensure only Python scripts are executed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Regex Patterns

| Pattern         | Matches                   | Example                |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `.*`            | Any string                | `/home/user/script.py` |
| `[0-9]+`        | Any number                | `8080`, `3000`         |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` | Alphanumeric + underscore | `api_key_123`          |
| `\\$HOME`       | Literal `$HOME`           | `$HOME` (not expanded) |
| `\\.py`         | Literal `.py`             | `script.py`            |
| `\\[cli\\]`     | Literal `[cli]`           | `mcp[cli]`             |

## Notes

### Admin Configuration Guidelines

* **Environment Variables**: The `env` section is not regex-matched and can be configured freely by users
* **Disabled Tools**: The `disabledTools` array is handled separately and not part of whitelist matching
* **Case Sensitivity**: All matching is case-sensitive
* **Error Handling**: Invalid regex patterns will be logged and result in access denial
* **Testing**: Test your regex patterns carefully - overly restrictive patterns may block legitimate use cases

### Troubleshooting

If users report that their MCP servers aren't working after whitelisting:

1. **Check Exact Matching**: Ensure the whitelist pattern exactly matches the user's configuration
2. **Verify Regex Escaping**: Special characters may need escaping (e.g., `\.` for literal dots)
3. **Review Logs**: Invalid regex patterns are logged with warnings
4. **Test Patterns**: Use a regex tester to verify your patterns work as expected

Remember: Once you whitelist any server, **all other servers are automatically blocked** for your team members.

### General Information

* Since MCP tool calls can invoke code written by arbitrary server implementers, we do not assume liability
  for MCP tool call failures. To reiterate:
* We currently support an MCP server's [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources), not [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts).


# Memories & Rules
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/memories



`Memories` is the system for sharing and persisting context across conversations.

There are two mechanisms for this in Windsurf: Memories, which can be automatically generated by Cascade, and rules, which are manually defined by the user at both the local and global levels.

## How to Manage Memories

Memories and Rules can be accessed and configured at any time by clicking on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, or via “Windsurf - Settings” in the bottom-right hand corner. To edit an existing memory, simply click into it and then click the `Edit` button.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/memories-rules.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=2a80ad4bb69460c082c09f9633ab3649" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/memories-rules.mp4" />

## Memories

During conversation, Cascade can automatically generate and store memories if it encounters context that it believes is useful to remember.

Additionally, you can ask Cascade to create a memory at any time. Just prompt Cascade to "create a memory of ...".

Cascade's autogenerated memories are associated with the workspace that they were created in and Cascade will retrieve them when it believes that they are relevant. Memories generated in one workspace will not be available in another.

<Tip>Creating and using auto-generated memories do NOT consume credits</Tip>

## Rules

Users can explicitly define their own rules for Cascade to follow.

Rules can be defined at either the global level or the workspace level.

`global_rules.md` - rules applied across all workspaces

`.windsurf/rules` - workspace level directory containing rules that are tied to globs or natural language descriptions.

## Rules Discovery

Windsurf automatically discovers rules from multiple locations to provide flexible organization:

* **Current workspace and sub-directories**: All `.windsurf/rules` directories within your current workspace and its sub-directories
* **Git repository structure**: For git repositories, Windsurf also searches up to the git root directory to find rules in parent directories
* **Multiple workspace support**: When multiple folders are open in the same workspace, rules are deduplicated and displayed with the shortest relative path

### Rules Storage Locations

Rules can be stored in any of these locations:

* `.windsurf/rules` in your current workspace directory
* `.windsurf/rules` in any sub-directory of your workspace
* `.windsurf/rules` in parent directories up to the git root (for git repositories)

When you create a new rule, it will be saved in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your current workspace, not necessarily at the git root.

To get started with Rules, click on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the `Rules` panel. Here, you can click on the `+ Global` or `+ Workspace` button to create new rules at either the global or workspace level, respectively.

<Tip>You can find example rule templates curated by the Windsurf team at [https://windsurf.com/editor/directory](https://windsurf.com/editor/directory) to help you get started.</Tip>

Rules files are limited to 12000 characters each.

### Activation Modes

At the rule level, you can define how a rule should be activated for Cascade.

There are 4 modes:

1. **Manual**: This rule can be manually activated via `@mention` in Cascade's input box
2. **Always On**: This rule will always be applied
3. **Model Decision**: Based on a natural language description of the rule the user defines, the model decides whether to apply the rule.
4. **Glob**: Based on the glob pattern that the user defines (e.g. *.js, src/\*\*/*.ts), this rule will be applied to all files that match the pattern.

### Best Practices

To help Cascade follow your rules effectively, follow these best practices:

* Keep rules simple, concise, and specific. Rules that are too long or vague may confuse Cascade.
* There's no need to add generic rules (e.g. "write good code"), as these are already baked into Cascade's training data.
* Format your rules using bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown. These are easier for Cascade to follow compared to a long paragraph. For example:

```
# Coding Guidelines 
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
```

* XML tags can be an effective way to communicate and group similar rules together. For example:

```
<coding_guidelines>
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
</coding_guidelines>
```


# Web and Docs Search
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/web-search



Cascade can now intuitively parse through and chunk up web pages and documentation, providing realtime context to the models. The key way to understand this feature is that Cascade will browse the Internet as a human would.

Our web tools are designed in such a way that gets only the information that is necessary in order to efficiently use your credits.

## Overview

To help you better understand how Web Search works, we've recorded a short video covering the key concepts and best practices.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moIySJ4d0UY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

### Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to activate web search in your Windsurf Settings in the bottom right corner of the editor. You can activate it a couple of different ways:

1. Ask a question that probably needs the Internet (ie. "What's new in the latest version of React?").
2. Use `@web` to force a docs search.
3. Use `@docs` to query over a list of docs that we are confident we can read with high quality.
4. Paste a URL into your message.

## Search the web

Cascade can deduce that certain prompts from the user may require a real-time web search to provide the optimal response. In these cases, Cascade will perform a web search and provide the results to the user. This can happen automatically or manually using the `@web` mention.

</Frame>

## Reading Pages

Cascade can read individual pages for things like documentation, blog posts, and GitHub files. The page reads happen entirely on your device within your network so if you're using a VPN you shouldn't have any problems.

Pages are picked up either from web search results, inferred based on the conversation, or from URLs pasted directly into your message.

We break pages up into multiple chunks, very similar to how a human would read a page: for a long page we skim to the section we want then read the text that's relevant. This is how Cascade operates as well.

It's worth noting that not all pages can be parsed. We are actively working on improving the quality of our website reading. If you have specific sites you'd like us to handle better, feel free to file a feature request!


# Workflows
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/workflows



Workflows enable users to define a series of steps to guide Cascade through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or responding to PR comments.

These Workflows are saved as markdown files, allowing users and their teams an easy repeatable way to run key processes.

Once saved, Workflows can be invoked in Cascade via a slash command with the format of `/[name-of-workflow]`

## How it works

Rules generally provide large language models with guidance by providing persistent, reusable context at the prompt level.

Workflows extend this concept by providing a structured sequence of steps or prompts at the trajectory level, guiding the model through a series of interconnected tasks or actions.

</Frame>

To execute a Workflow, users simply invoke it in Cascade using the `/[workflow-name]` command.

<Tip>You can call other Workflows from within a Workflow! <br /><br />For example, /workflow-1 can include instructions like "Call /workflow-2" and "Call /workflow-3".</Tip>

Upon invocation, Cascade sequentially processes each step defined in the Workflow, performing actions or generating responses as specified.

## How to create a Workflow

To get started with Workflows, click on the `Customizations` icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the `Workflows` panel. Here, you can click on the `+ Workflow` button to create a new Workflow.

Workflows are saved as markdown files within `.windsurf/workflows/` directories and contain a title, description, and a series of steps with specific instructions for Cascade to follow.

## Workflow Discovery

Windsurf automatically discovers workflows from multiple locations to provide flexible organization:

* **Current workspace and sub-directories**: All `.windsurf/workflows/` directories within your current workspace and its sub-directories
* **Git repository structure**: For git repositories, Windsurf also searches up to the git root directory to find workflows in parent directories
* **Multiple workspace support**: When multiple folders are open in the same workspace, workflows are deduplicated and displayed with the shortest relative path

### Workflow Storage Locations

Workflows can be stored in any of these locations:

* `.windsurf/workflows/` in your current workspace directory
* `.windsurf/workflows/` in any sub-directory of your workspace
* `.windsurf/workflows/` in parent directories up to the git root (for git repositories)

When you create a new workflow, it will be saved in the `.windsurf/workflows/` directory of your current workspace, not necessarily at the git root.

Workflow files are limited to 12000 characters each.

### Generate a Workflow with Cascade

You can also ask Cascade to generate Workflows for you! This works particularly well for Workflows involving a series of steps in a particular CLI tool.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/create-workflow-with-cascade.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=f4d4dc32f319a356a776e03d355907a5" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/create-workflow-with-cascade.mp4" />

## Example Workflows

There are a myriad of use cases for Workflows, such as:

<Card title="/address-pr-comments">
  This is a Workflow our team uses internally to address PR comments:

  ```
  1. Check out the PR branch: `gh pr checkout [id]`

  2. Get comments on PR

   bash
   gh api --paginate repos/[owner]/[repo]/pulls/[id]/comments | jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, body, path, line, original_line, created_at, in_reply_to_id, pull_request_review_id, commit_id}'

  3. For EACH comment, do the following. Remember to address one comment at a time.
   a. Print out the following: "(index). From [user] on [file]:[lines] — [body]"
   b. Analyze the file and the line range.
   c. If you don't understand the comment, do not make a change. Just ask me for clarification, or to implement it myself.
   d. If you think you can make the change, make the change BEFORE moving onto the next comment.

  4. After all comments are processed, summarize what you did, and which comments need the USER's attention.
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="/git-workflows">
  Commit using predefined formats and create a pull requests with standardized title and descriptions using the appropriate CLI commands.
</Card>

<Card title="/dependency-management">

# Codemaps (Beta)
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/codemaps

Hierarchical maps for codebase understanding.

Powered by a specialized agent, Codemaps are shareable artifacts that bridge the gap between human comprehension and AI reasoning, making it possible to navigate, discuss, and modify large codebases with precision and context.

<Note>
  Codemaps is currently in Beta and subject to change in future releases.
</Note>

## What are Codemaps?

While [DeepWiki](/windsurf/deepwiki) provides symbol-level documentation, Codemaps help with codebase understanding by mapping how everything works together—showing the order in which code and files are executed and how different components relate to each other.

To navigate a Codemap, click on any node to instantly jump to that file and function. Each node in the Codemap links directly to the corresponding location in your code.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/K1c0U9TfuKxwshS5/assets/windsurf/codemaps/codemaps-overview.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=K1c0U9TfuKxwshS5&q=85&s=e8b8990690ec210cced0f78ba1969fac" data-path="assets/windsurf/codemaps/codemaps-overview.mp4" />

## Accessing Codemaps

You can access Codemaps in one of two ways:

* **Activity Bar**: Find the Codemaps interface in the Activity Bar (left side panel)
* **Command Palette**: Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and search for "Focus on Codemaps View"

## Creating a Codemap

To create a new Codemap:

1. Open the Codemaps panel
2. Create a new Codemap by:
   * Selecting a suggested topic (suggestions are based on your recent navigation history)
   * Typing your own custom prompt
   * Generating from Cascade: Create new Codemaps from the bottom of a Cascade conversation
3. The Codemap agent explores your repository, identify relevant files and functions, and generate a hierarchical view

## Sharing Codemaps

You can share Codemaps with teammates as links that can be viewed in a browser.

<Warning>
  For enterprise customers, sharing Codemaps requires opt-in because they need to be stored on our servers. By default, Codemaps are only available within your Team and require authentication to view.
</Warning>

C# / C++ Development Setup for Windsurf

# Windsurf Development Environment Setup Guide

## Overview

Windsurf workspaces rely **exclusively on open‑source tooling** for compiling, linting, and debugging. Microsoft's proprietary Visual Studio components cannot be redistributed, so we integrate community‑maintained language servers, debuggers, and compilers instead.

This guide covers two stacks:

1. **.NET / C#** – targeting both .NET Core and .NET Framework (via Mono)
2. **C / C++** – using clang‑based tooling

You can install either or both in the same workspace.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The examples below are templates that you must customize for your specific project. You'll need to edit file paths, project names, and build commands to match your codebase.

***

## 1. .NET / C# development

> **Choose the flavour that matches your codebase.**

### .NET Core / .NET 6+

**Extensions:**

* **[C#](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=muhammad-sammy.csharp)** (`muhammad-sammy.csharp`) – bundles **OmniSharp LS** and **NetCoreDbg**, so you can hit <kbd>F5</kbd> immediately

* **[.NET Install Tool](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime)** (`ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime`) – auto‑installs missing runtimes/SDKs

* **[Solution Explorer](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer)** (`fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer`) – navigate and manage .NET solutions and projects

**Debugger:** Nothing else is required—the extension already contains the language server and an open‑source debugger suitable for .NET Core.

**Build:** `dotnet build`

### .NET Framework via Mono

**Extensions:**

* **[Mono Debug](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=chrisatwindsurf.mono-debug)** (`chrisatwindsurf.mono-debug`) – debug adapter for Mono ([Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/chrisatwindsurf/mono-debug))
* **[C#](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=muhammad-sammy.csharp)** (`muhammad-sammy.csharp`) for language features

**Debugger:** **You must also install the Mono tool‑chain inside the workspace.** Follow the install guide in the [Mono repo](https://gitlab.winehq.org/mono/mono#compilation-and-installation). The debugger extension connects to that runtime at debug time.

> **⚠️ .NET Framework Configuration**: After installing Mono, to use the C# extension with .NET Framework projects, you need to toggle a specific setting in the IDE Settings. Go to **Settings** (in the C# Extension section) and toggle off  **"Omnisharp: Use Modern Net"**. This setting uses the OmniSharp build for .NET 6, which provides significant performance improvements for SDK-style Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5+ projects. Note that this version *does not* support non-SDK-style .NET Framework projects, including Unity.

**Build:** `mcs Program.cs`

### Configure `tasks.json` for Your Project

**You must create/edit `.vscode/tasks.json` in your workspace root** and customize these templates:

```jsonc  theme={null}
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "build-dotnet",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["build", "YourProject.csproj"], // ← Edit this
      "group": "build",
      "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
    },
    {
      "label": "build-mono",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "mcs",
      "args": ["YourProgram.cs"], // ← Edit this
      "group": "build"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configure `launch.json` for Debugging

**You must create/edit `.vscode/launch.json` in your workspace root** and update the paths:

```jsonc  theme={null}
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": ".NET Core Launch",
      "type": "coreclr",
      "request": "launch",
      "preLaunchTask": "build-dotnet",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net6.0/YourApp.dll", // ← Edit this path
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "args": [] // Add command line arguments if needed
    },
    {
      "name": "Mono Launch",
      "type": "mono",
      "request": "launch",
      "preLaunchTask": "build-mono",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/YourProgram.exe", // ← Edit this path
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### CLI equivalents

```bash  theme={null}
# .NET Core
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run

# Mono / .NET Framework
$ mcs Program.cs
$ mono Program.exe
```

### .NET Framework Limitations

⚠️ **Important**: .NET Framework codebases with mixed assemblies (C++/CLI) or complex Visual Studio dependencies have significant limitations in Windsurf. These codebases typically require Visual Studio's proprietary build system and cannot be fully compiled or debugged in Windsurf due to dependencies on Microsoft-specific tooling and assembly reference resolution.

**Recommended approaches for .NET Framework projects:**

* Use Windsurf alongside Visual Studio for code generation and editing
* Migrate compatible portions to .NET Core where possible

***

## 2. C / C++ development

**Required Extensions:**

| Extension                                                                                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Windsurf C++ Tools](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Codeium/windsurf-cpptools)** (`Codeium.windsurf-cpptools`) | This is a bundle of the three extensions we recommend using to get started. Package that contains C/C++ LSP support, debugging support, and CMake support. |

> **Note:** Installing the Windsurf C++ Tools bundle will automatically install the individual extensions listed below, so you only need to install the bundle.

| Extension                                                                                                                                           | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **[clangd](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)** (`llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`) | **clangd** language‑server integration. If `clangd` is missing it will offer to download the correct binary for your platform. |
| **[CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/extension/vadimcn/vscode-lldb)** (`vadimcn.vscode-lldb`)                                              | Native debugger based on LLDB for C/C++ and Rust code.                                                                         |
| **[CMake Tools](https://marketplace.windsurf.com/vscode/item?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)** (`ms-vscode.cmake-tools`)                            | Project configuration, build, test, and debug integration for **CMake**‑based projects.                                        |

For non‑CMake workflows you can still invoke `make`, `ninja`, etc. via custom `tasks.json` targets.

### Configure C/C++ Build Tasks

**Create/edit `.vscode/tasks.json`** for your C/C++ project:

```jsonc  theme={null}
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "build-cpp",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "clang++",
      "args": ["-g", "main.cpp", "-o", "main"], // ← Edit for your files
      "group": "build",
      "problemMatcher": "$gcc"
    }
  ]
}
```

***

## 3. Notes & Gotchas

* **Open‑source only** – decline any prompt to install proprietary Microsoft tooling; Windsurf containers cannot ship it.
* **Container vs Host** – SDKs/compilers must be present **inside** the Windsurf workspace container.
* **Keyboard shortcuts**
  * <kbd>Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + B</kbd> → compile using the active build task
  * <kbd>F5</kbd> → debug using the selected `launch.json` config

***

## 4. Setup Checklist

* Install the required extensions for your language stack
* **Create and customize** `.vscode/tasks.json` with your project's build commands
* **Create and customize** `.vscode/launch.json` with correct paths to your executables
* For Mono: install the runtime and verify `mono --version`
* Update file paths, project names, and build arguments to match your codebase
* Test your setup: Press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + B</kbd> to build, then <kbd>F5</kbd> to debug

> 💡 **Tip**: The configuration files are project-specific. You'll need to adapt the examples above for each workspace.


# DeepWiki
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/deepwiki



We've implemented [Devin's DeepWiki feature](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki) inside of the Windsurf Editor. Use it to get up to speed on unfamiliar parts of your codebase.

You can find the DeepWiki interface in the Primary Side Bar / Activity Bar.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/deepwiki-demo.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=3b9abf7eda8d39b6a9ae8c064fe876c5" data-path="assets/windsurf/deepwiki-demo.mp4" />

To use DeepWiki, hover over a symbol in your codebase and press `Cmd+Shift+Click` to open detailed explanations of code symbols.

Unlike classical hover cards that just show basic type information, DeepWiki-powered hover explains functions, variables, and classes as you read through code.

You can send the DeepWiki explanation to Cascade as an `@-mention` by clicking the `⋮` button in the top right of the DeepWiki panel and selecting `Add to Cascade`.

Windsurf Guide for Enterprise Admins

# Windsurf Guide for Enterprise Admins

> **Purpose**   This guide helps enterprise *platform / developer-experience* administrators plan, roll out, and operate Windsurf for organizations with **large enterprise teams**.  It is intentionally *opinionated* and links out to detailed “how-to” docs per topic.  Treat it both as a **read-through guide** *and* as a **check-list** when onboarding.

***

## 1.   Audience & Pre-Requisites

|                       | Details                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who should read**   | Platform / Dev-Ex admins, Corporate IT, Centralized Tooling teams                  |
| **Assumed knowledge** | Basic Windsurf terms (team, role), Enterprise IdP concepts (SAML, SCIM), CLI usage |
| **Out-of-scope**      | Deep security / compliance internals → see **Security & Compliance** docs          |

***

## 2.   Quick-Start Checklist

1. Confirm organization-wide settings
2. Set up **SSO** (Okta, Azure AD, Google; see SAML docs for others)
3. Enable **SCIM** & map IdP groups → Windsurf *teams*
4. Define **role** & **permission** model (least privilege)
5. Configure **Admin Portal**: team view & security controls
6. Distribute **Windsurf clients/extensions** to end users
7. View **analytics dashboards** & **API access tokens**

> Use this list as your “Day 0” deployment tracker.

***

## 3.   Core Windsurf Concepts

* **Team** – flat collections of members; no nested teams. Teams (also called *Groups*) drive **role assignment** and **analytics grouping**, letting you scope permissions and view usage metrics per cohort.
* **Roles & Permissions** – predefined RBAC; admins are primarily responsible for **team management**, **Windsurf feature settings**, and **analytics**. Built-in roles usually cover these needs, but creating a custom role with *analytics-view* permission lets team managers and leads see metrics for their own teams. (<a href="/windsurf/accounts/rbac-role-management" target="_blank">RBAC docs</a>)
* **Admin Portal** – centralized UI for user & team management, credit usage, SSO configuration, feature toggles (<a href="/windsurf/cascade/web-search" target="_blank">Web Search</a>, <a href="/windsurf/cascade/mcp" target="_blank">MCP</a>, <a href="/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys" target="_blank">Deploys</a>), analytics dashboards/report export, service keys for API usage, and role/permission controls.
* **Agents & Workspaces** – Windsurf IDE and Jetbrains Plugins are Agentic

### 3.1   Admin Portal Overview

The Admin Portal provides centralized management for all Windsurf enterprise features through an intuitive web interface. Core capabilities include:

#### User & Team Management

* Add, remove, and manage users across your organization
* Configure teams with proper role assignments
* User status and activity monitoring

#### Authentication & Security

* Configure SSO integration with major identity providers
* Set up SCIM provisioning for automated user lifecycle management
* Manage role-based access controls (RBAC)
* Create and manage **service keys** for API automations with scoped permissions

#### Feature Toggles & Controls

> **Important:** These feature controls affect behavior for your entire organization and can only be modified by administrators. New major features with data privacy implications are released in the "off" state by default to ensure you have control over when and how they're enabled.

The <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings" target="_blank">Admin Portal</a> gives you granular control over Windsurf features that can be enabled or disabled per team. **Data Privacy Note:** Some features require storing additional data or telemetry as noted below:

**Models Configuration**

* Configure which AI models your teams can access within Windsurf
* Select multiple models for different use cases (code completion, chat, etc.)

**Auto Run Terminal Commands** *(Beta)*

* Allow or restrict Cascade's ability to auto-execute commands on users' machines
* [Learn more about auto-executed commands](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/terminal#auto-executed-cascade-commands)

**MCP Servers** *(Beta)*

* Enable users to configure and use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
* Maintain whitelisted MCP servers for approved integrations
* **Security Note:** Review operational and security implications before enabling, as MCP can create infrastructure resources outside Windsurf's security monitoring
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp" target="_blank">Learn more about Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/mcp#admin-controls-teams-%26-enterprises" target="_blank">MCP admin controls for teams & enterprises</a>

**App Deploys** *(Beta)*

* Manage deployment permissions for your teams in Cascade
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/app-deploys#app-deploys" target="_blank">Learn more about App Deploys</a>

**Conversation Sharing**

* Allow team members to share Cascade conversations with others
* Conversations are securely uploaded to Windsurf servers
* Shareable links are restricted to logged-in team members only
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/cascade#sharing-your-conversation" target="_blank">Learn more about sharing conversations</a>

**PR Reviews (GitHub Integration)**

* Install Windsurf in your team's GitHub organization
* Enable PR review automation and description editing
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf-reviews/windsurf-reviews#windsurf-pr-reviews" target="_blank">Learn more about Windsurf PR Reviews</a>

**Knowledge Base Management**

* Curate knowledge from Google Drive sources for your development teams
* Upload and organize internal documentation and resources
* <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/context-awareness/overview#knowledge-base-beta" target="_blank">Learn more about Knowledge Base</a>

## 4.   Identity & Access Management

> **Recommendation:** Use **SSO plus SCIM** wherever possible for automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and group management.

### 4.1   Single Sign-On (SSO)

|                          | Guidance                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IdPs supported**       | Okta, Azure AD, Google (others via generic SAML)                                                                       |
| **Recommended approach** | Create Windsurf-specific *app* in IdP; use **role-based** group assignments rather than org-wide `All Employees` group |
| **Common pitfalls**      | Email suffix mismatches, duplicate user aliases                                                                        |

*See the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/sso-scim" target="_blank">SSO & SCIM Setup Guide</a> for step-by-step configuration for Okta, Azure AD, Google, and Generic SAML.*

### 4.2   SCIM Provisioning

* **Why** – automated user lifecycle & team membership management at scale
* **Capabilities**
  * Create / deactivate **users** automatically
  * Create **teams** automatically (or manage manually)
  * Users can belong to **multiple teams**
  * Custom team creation via SCIM API (<a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/sso-scim#scim-api" target="_blank">docs</a>)
* **Mapping strategies**
  * 1 IdP group → 1 Windsurf team (simple, most common)
  * Functional vs. project-based group prefixes (e.g. `proj-foo-devs`)
* **Things to decide**
  * Which groups to *exclude* (e.g. interns, contractors)
  * Renaming rules when IdP group names change
* **Caution**: SCIM should remain your **source of truth**—mixing SCIM and manual / API updates can create drift. Use the API mainly for adding supplemental groups.

***

## 5.   User & Team Management at Scale

* Flat *team* → design team taxonomy carefully (no nesting to fall back on)
* Users can belong to **multiple groups**. Groups are used to view analytics
* Today, SCIM does not support assigning roles to users. SCIM only supports assigning users to Groups

***

## 6.   Analytics & API Access

### 6.1   Built-In Analytics

| Dashboard             | Use-case                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Adoption Overview** | Track total active users, daily engagement |
| **Team Activity**     | Team usage                                 |

Analytics shows the **percentage of code written by Windsurf**, helping quantify impact—see your dashboards at <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/analytics" target="_blank">team analytics</a>.

### 6.2   APIs

| API      | Typical admin scenarios    |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| **REST** | SCIM management, analytics |

* Generate service keys under <a href="https://windsurf.com/team/settings" target="_blank">**Team Settings → Service Keys**</a>. Scope keys to *least privilege* needed.
* More advanced reporting: see the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/api-reference/introduction" target="_blank">Analytics API Reference</a>.
* For team management: see the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/accounts/sso-scim#scim-api" target="_blank">SCIM API – Custom Teams</a>.

***

## 7.   Operational Considerations

* **Status Pages** – monitor live service health: <a href="https://status.windsurf.com/" target="_blank">Windsurf</a>, <a href="https://status.anthropic.com/" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://status.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>
* **Support Channels** – windsurf.com/support

***

## 8.   Setting Up End Users for Success

1. Point end users to the <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/getting-started" target="_blank">Windsurf installation guide</a> to install the appropriate extension or desktop client.
2. Publish an internal “Getting Started with Windsurf” page (link to official docs)
3. Hold live onboarding sessions / record short demos
4. Curate starter project templates & sample prompts
5. Collect feedback via survey after 2 weeks; iterate

In Cascade, you can easily switch between different models of your choosing.

Depending on the model you select, each of your input prompts will consume a different number of [prompt credits](/windsurf/cascade/usage).

Under the text input box, you will see a model selection dropdown menu containing the following models:

<ModelsTable />

# SWE-1.5, swe-grep, SWE-1

Our SWE model family of in-house frontier models are built specifically for software engineering tasks.

Our latest frontier model, SWE-1.5, achieves near-SOTA performance in a fraction of the time.

Our in house models include:

* `SWE-1.5`: Our best agentic coding model we've released. Near Claude 4.5-level performance, at 13x the speed. Read our [research announcement](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-1-5).
* `SWE-1`: Our first agentic coding model. Achieved Claude 3.5-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
* `SWE-1-mini`: Powers passive suggestions in Windsurf Tab, optimized for real-time latency.
* `swe-grep`: Powers context retrieval and [Fast Context](context-awareness/fast-context)

# Bring your own key (BYOK)

<Warning>This is only available to free and paid individual users.</Warning>

For certain models, we allow users to bring their own API keys. In the model dropdown menu, individual users will see models labled with `BYOK`.

To input your API key, navigate to [this page](https://windsurf.com/subscription/provider-api-keys) in the subscription settings and add your key.

If you have not configured your API key, it will return an error if you try to use the BYOK model.

Currently, we only support BYOK for these models:

* `Claude 4 Sonnet`
* `Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking)`
* `Claude 4 Opus`
* `Claude 4 Opus (Thinking)`


# Windsurf Previews
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/previews



Windsurf Previews allow you to view the local deployment of your app either in the IDE or in the browser (optimized for Google Chrome, Arc, and Chromium based browsers) with listeners, allowing you to iterate rapidly by easily sending elements and errors back to Cascade as context.

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/bVGscI7v3lPUsThV/assets/windsurf/previews/browser-preview-demo.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=bVGscI7v3lPUsThV&q=85&s=b3befa08affd8c5c10a84ae9259d0f15" data-path="assets/windsurf/previews/browser-preview-demo.mp4" />

Windsurf Previews are opened via tool call, so just ask Cascade to preview your site to get started. Alternatively, you can also click the Web icon in the Cascade toolbar to automatically propagate the natural language prompt to enter the proxy.

# Send Elements to Cascade

In the Preview, you can select and send elements/components and errors directly to Cascade. Simply click on the "Send element" button on the bottom right and then proceed to select the element you want to send.

The selected element will be inserted into your current Cascade prompt as an `@ mention`. You can add as many elements as you want in the prompt.

# In-IDE Preview

Windsurf can open a up a Preview as a new tab in your editor. This is a simple web view that enables you to view web app alongside your Cascade panel.

Because these Previews are hosted locally, you can open them in your system browser as well, complete with all the listeners and ability to select and send elements and console errors to Cascade.

<Warning>The listeners and the abilities to send elements and errors are optimized for Google Chrome, Arc, and Chromium based browsers.</Warning>

# How to Disable

You can disable Windsurf Previews from Windsurf - Settings. This will prevent Cascade from making this tool call.

# Auto-executed Cascade commands

Cascade has the ability to run terminal commands on its own with user permission. However, certain terminal commands can be accepted or rejected automatically through the Allow and Deny lists.

By enabling Auto mode, it will rely on Cascade's judgement on whether the command requires the user's permission to be executed. This feature is only available for messages sent with premium models.

### Turbo Mode

In Turbo mode, Cascade will always execute the command, unless it is in the deny list.

You can toggle this via the Windsurf - Settings panel in the bottom right hand corner of the editor.

</Frame>

### Deny list

A deny list defines a set of terminal commands that will never auto-execute. For example, if you add `rm`, then Cascade will always ask for permission to run `rm index.py`.

The setting can be via Command Palette → Open Settings (UI) → Search for `windsurf.cascadeCommandsDenyList`.

<Frame>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: "500px" }} src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=83f5c447deeb931e68781fbd6cb89733" data-og-width="2090" width="2090" data-og-height="624" height="624" data-path="assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=479a1b8b643adefbca8fcd08bbb2d4cd 280w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=fb60fb1ea1f66c2cd63eb62ae0513675 560w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=83520e9689fae159e121ccce1dc72901 840w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=a4832324125ef273f72d41f315a434ca 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=28da77a6ed6fb67a2467df9bd95c7c90 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/codeium/qJj_RRojefb93yIg/assets/windsurf/cascade/deny-list.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=qJj_RRojefb93yIg&q=85&s=01bc9a72d11a63527867a908cdace643 2500w" />

# Vibe and Replace
Source: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/vibe-and-replace



Vibe and Replace is an evolution of find and replace that allows you to search through your codebase for exact text matches and apply an AI prompt to each replacement.

Use this for more context-aware transformations and refactors.

<video autoPlay controls muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://mintcdn.com/codeium/bVGscI7v3lPUsThV/assets/windsurf/vibe-and-replace.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=bVGscI7v3lPUsThV&q=85&s=af192ccb94e21e78607f5a8b6884b580" data-path="assets/windsurf/vibe-and-replace.mp4" />

## Modes

Vibe and Replace can be used in two different modes:

1. `Smart` - utilizes a slower model that will apply changes more carefully

2. `Fast` - utilizes a faster model that will apply changes quickly

To set the mode, click on the `⌄` button next to the Vibe and Replace prompt box.
