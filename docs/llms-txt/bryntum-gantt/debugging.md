# Debugging Bryntum components

## The browser debugger

Open the browser's debugging console. Uncaught fatal errors will be logged there. The full stack trace of all the function
calls which led up to the failure will be listed there and are always useful for debugging purposes. Always include this
call stack in any bug report.

## Accessing components in a running application

### Querying by component type

The [bryntum.query](#Core/widget/Widget#function-query-static) function is always available to query widgets in a Bryntum application
by widget type. For example, to access the first `Scheduler` on your page use:

```javascript
theScheduler = bryntum.query('scheduler', true)
```

This will return a reference to the first `Scheduler` instance and you can use the full API from the debugger command line.

Passing the second parameter as `true` matches any subclass of the type specified.

There is also a [bryntum.queryAll](#Core/widget/Widget#function-queryAll-static) function which returns an array of all matching
components.

### Getting the encapsulating component from an element

If examining the DOM structure, you can use the [bryntum.fromElement](#Core/widget/Widget#function-fromElement-static) function
to access the closest matching widget which encapsulates the passed element, eg, when you have a node selected in the "Elements" tab,
the token `$0` will reference it in the debugger command line:

```javascript
theCombo = bryntum.fromElement($0)
```

Components have a tree structure analogous to the DOM tree. You can find any ancestor of a component by type:

```javascript
theEditor = theCombo.up('popup', true)
```

The second parameter means it will match any subclass of `Popup`, so this could find an encapsulating `EventEditor` or `TaskEditor`.

When you have access to the component, you can use its documented API to inspect it to access its internals and examine them in any way:

```javascript
multiAssigned = theScheduler.eventStore.getRange().filter(e => e.resources.length > 1);
```

### Getting a component by id

If you know the id of a component, you can use [bryntum.get](#Core/widget/Widget#function-getById-static):

```javascript
theCalendar = bryntum.get('app-calendar')
```

## Debugging code

You can use the "Sources" tab of the browser debugging console to set breakpoints in your code to have it halt at certain lines to allow
you to examine application state.

Using the right click gesture, these breakpoints can be made conditional to only break when a certain expression evaluates to a truthy value.

If a certain error only occurs after some other line of code has been executed, you can have that line set a flag which a future breakpoint can then evaluate.

So at the line which needs to execute before the error happens, set a conditional breakpoint using a condition like this:

```javascript
(window.doBreak = 1),0
```

That sets the `doBreak` global to `1`, but does *not* break at that line because the value of that expression is zero.

A *future* breakpoint conditional on the expression `window.doBreak` will then only halt execution when that first breakpoint has
been passed.

## Discovering fired events

A special event name, `catchAll` may be used by event listeners which will call the listener for *all* events.

You can use this to discover useful events emitted from your UI by adding such a listener from the debugger console:

```javascript
myCalendar.on('catchAll', (e) => {
    if (e.type.endsWith('click')) console.dir(e);
});
```

## Focus issues

The Chrome debugging console's "Elements" tab allows you to set an "Emulate a focused page" flag which means that even while debugging,
focus remains in your application.

Note that as of August 2025, Chrome has a bug where this setting sometimes fails and the checkbox needs to be cleared and rechecked
for it to take effect again.

This is useful for debugging the `EventEditor` or `TaskEditor` which hides itself when focus leaves. With this option set, you can operate
the debugger and examine and change application state while the editor is displayed:

## Reproducing faults using Bryntum's online examples

The *Javascript* examples allow you to examine and modify the code:

This allows you to experiment with the API. The editor is the Monaco editor used by Visual Studio Code:

You can then use the "Open in Codepen" button in the application toolbar to create a Codepen based upon the state of the application.
