# Introduction

::introduction
::

**Rete.js** (pronounced /ˈriː.ti/, meaning "network" in Italian) is a framework for creating visual interfaces and workflows. It provides out-of-the-box solutions for visualization using various libraries and frameworks, as well as solutions for processing graphs based on dataflow and control flow approaches.

::alert
**You are reading the documentation for Rete.js v2**

- Rete.js v1 documentation is still available at [rete.js.org](https://rete.js.org){rel="nofollow"}

::

In the interactive example above, you can see the notation of the basic elements of the classic editor view and the graph processing using the Dataflow-based engine. This demonstrates the essential capabilities of the framework:

- **Visualization**: you can choose React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte or Lit to visualize nodes, sockets, controls, and connections. These visual components can be tailored to your specific needs by creating custom components for each framework, and they can all coexist in a single editor.
- **Processing**: the framework offers various types of engines that enable processing diagrams based on their nature, including dataflow and control flow. These types can be combined within the same graph.

## Ecosystem

The framework is made up of various packages, including the core `rete` package and different plugins.

This approach provides flexibility in choosing only the required packages for your use case, avoiding unnecessary dependencies. It also offers the flexibility to choose different versions (e.g., testing out an RC version of a specific plugin) and substitute these packages with your custom builds (forks or plugins created from scratch).

Each of packages has its own repository, providing development flexibility but also adding overhead. For this reason, **Rete CLI** was created to build TypeScript modules with built-in ESLint and Jest support, reducing boilerplate code and providing basic tools for plugin development and debugging, ultimately saving developers time.

Rete.js provides various handy resources and tools to get you started quickly:

- **Examples**: check out the [Examples](https://retejs.org/examples) page or [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/search?refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=rete.js){rel="nofollow"} for code samples
- **Rete Kit**: easily generate a basic project for your framework of choice using this tool. For more details, visit the [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit) page.
- **Guides**: get hands-on experience by following the [step-by-step guides](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic). This will enable you to explore the existing features and learn how to extend and customize the framework to your needs

There are two easy ways to begin working with the framework: forking [the examples](https://retejs.org/examples) on Codesandbox or creating a local application using [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit). The first option allows for experimentation with functionality, which not always covered in the guides. Alternatively, the second option enables the creation of a local application with specific node editor features for a chosen version of **React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte** or **Lit**. Afterward, following the guides will help familiarize yourself with the framework's features and capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Rete.js, it's important to have an understanding of JavaScript or TypeScript fundamentals. The framework is primarily designed with TypeScript in mind, with examples and guides showcasing code in this language. However, for newcomers to TypeScript or those looking to quickly prototype, it's still possible to use Rete.js directly in JavaScript code.

If TypeScript is your preferred choice, make sure you have TypeScript version 4.7 or higher installed.

## Playgrounds

- [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rete-js-v2-yrzxe5){rel="nofollow"}
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Ni55aN/pen/rNZKejd){rel="nofollow"}

## Creating an application using devkit

Use [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit) to quickly set up a Rete.js application. It lets you select a stack (**React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte** or **Lit**) and the set of features.

## Adding Rete.js to your application

Framework packages are available on NPM and support common formats like ES (.esm.js), CommonJS (.common.js), and UMD (.min.js).

The command below provides an example of how to install the framework packages for the latest version.

```bash
npm i rete rete-area-plugin rete-connection-plugin rete-render-utils rete-react-plugin react react-dom
```

For specific information on the required packages, refer [one of the guides](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic)

## Usage from CDN

Framework packages are also available on numerous CDNs that serve npm packages. To add them to an HTML page, use the following example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete/rete.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-area-plugin/rete-area-plugin.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-connection-plugin/rete-connection-plugin.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-render-utils/rete-render-utils.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-react-plugin/rete-react-plugin.min.js"></script>
```

Use these packages by accessing their namespace, which can be found in the `name` field of `rete.config.ts` file for each package. Make sure to add the required peer dependencies

```js
Rete
ReteAreaPlugin
ReteConnectionPlugin
ReteReactPlugin
```

Furthermore, you can integrate them on platforms like [Codepen](https://codepen.io){rel="nofollow"} using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh){rel="nofollow"}.

# Plugin system

::references
  :::ref-github
  ---
  link: https://github.com/retejs/rete/blob/main/src/scope.ts
  title: Source code
  ---
  :::
::

Plugins offer the ability to add new functionality mostly through a single entry point. They communicate with each other using signals that propagate from parent plugins to child plugins. Since plugins can have multiple child plugins, these signals are passed through in the order they are connected (it can be important when including plugins such as `rete-readonly-plugin`)

::diagram{caption="Architecture" name="plugin-system/architecture"}
::

The following code example demonstrates the creation of two scopes: the parent and the child. Both scopes log signals.

```ts
import { Scope } from 'rete';

const parentScope = new Scope<number>('parent'); // number is produced type
const childScope = new Scope<string, [number]>('child'); // [number] is expected types of parent chain

parentScope.addPipe((context) => { // add pipe to parent scope
  console.log('parent', context); // number

  return context;
});

childScope.addPipe((context) => { // add pipe to child scope
  console.log('child', context); // string | number

  return context;
});

parentScope.use(childScope); // forward all signals to child scope

const returnedNumber = await parentScope.emit(1); // can emit number
const returnedString = await childScope.emit('a'); // can emit string
```

Keep in mind that the order of `use` and `addPipe` affects the order in which the parent and child handlers are called.

Logs:

```log
parent 1
child 1
child a
```

Signals can be modified or prevented in some cases.

::diagram{caption="Prevent and modify" name="plugin-system/addPipe"}
::

```ts
parentScope.addPipe((context) => {
  return context * 2;
});
childScope.addPipe((context) => {
  if (context === 'b') return // prevent propagation of 'b'
  return context;
});

const doubledNumber = await parentScope.emit(1); // 2
const expectedString = await childScope.emit('a'); // 'a'
const expectedUndefined = await childScope.emit('b'); // undefined
```

Static typing is used to ensure that the expected signals of used plugins are compatible with those produced by its parent plugin.

```ts
import { Scope } from 'rete';

const parentScope = new Scope<number>('parent');
const childScope = new Scope<string, [number | boolean]>('child');

parentScope.use(childScope); // Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.ts(2345)
```

Child plugins can access the instance of the parent plugin both for direct access to its interfaces and for producing signals on behalf of the parent plugin

```ts
import { Scope } from 'rete';

class Root extends Scope<number> {
  isRoot = true
}

class Root2 extends Scope<number> {
  isRoot2 = true
}

const parentScope = new Root('parent');
const childScope = new Scope<string, [number]>('child');

parentScope.use(childScope);

const parent = childScope.parentScope(); // Root instance, but Scope from TS perspective
const root = childScope.parentScope<Root>(Root); // Root instance
const wrongInstance = childScope.parentScope<Root2>(Root2); // throws exception
```


# Presets

A preset is a set of pre-built functionality that typically forms the foundation of an editor but can be replaced with another preset from the same category or a custom one.

::diagram{caption="Architecture" name="presets/architecture"}
::

## Data structures

For example, there is a classic editor preset that provides classes such as Node, Connection, Input, Output, and Socket.

```ts
import { ClassicPreset } from 'rete';

const { Node, Connection, Socket, Input, Output, Control } = ClassicPreset
```

## Rendering

In addition, each render plugin has preset for displaying classic nodes based on the data structures mentioned above.

```ts
import { ReactPlugin, Presets as ReactPresets } from 'rete-react-plugin'

const reactPlugin = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ createRoot })

reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.classic.setup())
reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.contextMenu.setup())
```

## Interaction

`rete-connection-plugin` comes with presets, one of which replicates the connection interaction functionality from framework v1. Additionally, an alternative preset with a simpler way to interact with connections has been included.

```ts
import { ConnectionPlugin, Presets as ConnectionPresets } from 'rete-connection-plugin'

const connection = new ConnectionPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>()

connection.addPreset(ConnectionPresets.classic.setup())
```

## Conclusion

In essence, the presets can be used in any scenario that involves the need to implement a particular functionality through the use of one or more alternative approaches.


# Editor

::diagram{caption="NodeEditor" name="editor/node-editor"}
::

`NodeEditor` is a class that implements an interface for interacting with a graph. Similar to other modules, it extends `Scope`: can produce signals and provides the ability to connect plugins.

```ts
import { NodeEditor, BaseSchemes } from 'rete'

type Schemes = BaseSchemes // has Node { id: string } and Connection { id: string, source: string, target: string }

const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>()
```

The `Schemes` type will be used for further type inference purposes.

There is a [classic preset](https://retejs.org/docs/concepts/presets#data-structures) that provides the interfaces for building nodes.

The editor is applicable on both the client and server sides. On the client side, it can provide data for visualization purposes. On the server side, it can provide data for graph processing, for example, through `rete-engine` or other interactions using `rete-structures`.

## Node and Connection management

::diagram{caption="ClassicPreset" name="editor/classic-preset"}
::

We can add nodes as a regular object with a mandatory `id` field, or as nodes from `ClassicPreset`

```ts
import { ClassicPreset } from 'rete'

const node = new ClassicPreset.Node('Label')

node.addOutput('output', new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, 'Title'))

await editor.addNode(node)
```

Removing can be achieved with `id`

```ts
await editor.removeNode(node.id)
```

To create a connection, you can use a basic object with mandatory fields (`id`, `source`, `target`) or a classic preset that requires the source and target nodes to be passed for TypeScript type checking.

```ts
import { ClassicPreset } from 'rete'

const connection = new ClassicPreset.Connection(sourceNode, 'portKey', targetNode, 'portKey')

await editor.addConnection(connection)
```

Removing the connection by `id`

```ts
await editor.removeConnection(connection.id)
```

## Create a 2D area

::diagram{caption="AreaPlugin" name="editor/area"}
::

In order to visualize on HTML, `rete-area-plugin` is necessary. This plugin is responsible for basic features, such as zooming and dragging, and serves as an entry point for other plugins for visualizing and interacting with users

```ts
import { AreaPlugin } from 'rete-area-plugin'

const area = new AreaPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>(container) // container is HTMLElement where the area will be inserted
```

The `AreaExtra` type is necessary for incorporating other signal types, such as rendering various types of elements aside from `node` and `connection`

This plugin includes extensions. Some of them implement the functionality of v1, but with one significant difference - they are optional. For instance, the node selection extension not only supports node selection, but it is expandable (check out [Comments](https://retejs.org/examples/comments) example), but it can also be substituted with an alternative implementation.

```ts
import { AreaExtensions } from 'rete-area-plugin'

AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, AreaExtensions.selector(), {
  accumulating: AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl()
})
```

## Interaction with connections

::diagram{caption="ConnectionPlugin" name="editor/connection"}
::

The `rete-connection-plugin` plugin is responsible for user interaction with connections (creation, deletion)

```ts
import { BidirectFlow, ConnectionPlugin, Presets as ConnectionPresets } from 'rete-connection-plugin'

const connection = new ConnectionPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>()

connection.addPreset(ConnectionPresets.classic.setup())
```

Unlike Rete.js v1, this plugin doesn't render connections.

## Rendering

::diagram{caption="Rendering" name="editor/rendering"}
::

The rendering of the UI is exclusively handled by rendering plugins (with a few exceptions), which provide presets for various kinds of functionality.

Let's take a look at the example using `rete-react-plugin`

```ts
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ReactArea2D, ReactPlugin, Presets as ReactPresets } from 'rete-react-plugin'
import { MinimapExtra } from 'rete-minimap-plugin'
import { ContextMenuExtra } from 'rete-context-menu-plugin'

type AreaExtra =
  | ReactArea2D<Schemes>
  | ContextMenuExtra
  | MinimapExtra

const reactPlugin = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ createRoot })

reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.classic.setup())
reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.contextMenu.setup())
reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.minimap.setup())

area.use(reactPlugin)
```

Every element in the editor, like node, control, socket, or connection, is technically an independent tree of elements, which offers flexibility in combining different rendering frameworks. More information is available in the [Integration](https://retejs.org/docs/concepts/integration) article.


# Engine

::diagram{caption="Architecture" name="engine/architecture"}
::

The `rete-engine` is a package that implements two approaches for processing graph: [Dataflow](https://retejs.org/#dataflow) and [Control flow](https://retejs.org/#control-flow)

### Dataflow

The dataflow approach is focused solely on data, where the target node requests data from incoming nodes. Graph processing proceeds from left to right, passing the output of nodes as input arguments to outgoing nodes.

::diagram{caption="Dataflow" name="engine/dataflow"}
::

This approach is commonly used in products with node editors such as Blender.

The code below represents the basic constructs required for the `DataflowEngine` to work:

- **Nodes must implement a `data` method**: this method accepts data from incoming nodes
- **Connect the engine to the editor**: the engine will register every added node for further processing
- **Fetching node data**: `fetch` initiates a graph traversal starting from the target node and visiting all its predecessors

```ts
import { ClassicPreset } from 'rete-engine'
import { DataflowEngine } from 'rete-engine'

const { Node, Socket } = ClassicPreset

class NodeAdd extends Node<{ left: Socket, right: Socket }, { value: Socket }, { }> {

  constructor() {
    // init controls and ports
  }

  // mandatory method
  data(inputs: { left?: number[], right?: number[] }): { value: number } {
    const left = inputs.left[0] || 0
    const right = inputs.right[0] || 0

  return {
      value: left + right
    }
  }
}

const engine = new DataflowEngine<Schemes>()

editor.use(engine)

const nodeOutput = await engine.fetch(resultNode.id)
```

### Control flow

Control flow is a node traversal approach that allows you to determine how to pass control to the next nodes.

::diagram{caption="Control flow" name="engine/control-flow"}
::

The processing starts at the start node, which specifies how control is passed through its outgoing connections. For instance, it can be a delay or a branching. The closest example is UE4 Blueprints.

```ts
import { ControlFlowEngine } from 'rete-engine'

const { Node, Socket } = ClassicPreset

class Log extends Node<{ enter: Socket }, { out: Socket }, {}> {
  constructor() {
    // init ports
  }

  // mandatory method
  execute(input: 'enter', forward: (output: 'out') => void) {
    console.log('log something')
    forward('out')
  }
}


const engine = new ControlFlowEngine<Schemes>()

editor.use(engine)

engine.execute(startNode.id)
```

## Hybrid

In addition, these approaches can be combined. For example, ports named 'exec' can be used to control flow, while other ports manage data.

```ts
const controlflow = new ControlFlowEngine<Schemes>(node => {
  return {
    inputs: () => ['exec'],
    outputs: () => ['exec']
  }
})
const dataflow = new DataflowEngine<Schemes>(({ inputs, outputs }) => {
  return {
    inputs: () => Object.keys(inputs).filter(name => name !== 'exec'),
    outputs: () => Object.keys(outputs).filter(name => name !== 'exec')
  }
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Dataflow` and `ControlFlow` classes directly, affording more precise control over the graph processing.

```ts
import { ControlFlow, Dataflow } from 'rete-engine'

const control = new ControlFlow(editor)
const dataflow = new Dataflow(editor)

control.add(startNode, {
  inputs: () => [],
  outputs: () => ['exec'],
  async execute(input, forward) {
    const inputs = await dataflow.fetchInputs(startNode.id)

    forward('exec')
  }
})
dataflow.add(startNode, {
  inputs: () => ['data'],
  outputs: () => ['data'],
  data(fetchInputs) {
    const inputs = await fetchInputs()
    const data = {
      data: inputs.data[0] // forward input data (assuming there is only one input connection to port "data")
    }

    return data
  }
})
```

## Conclusion

This engine version incorporates revised approaches to graph processing and addresses the shortcomings of the previous version, which was initially geared towards strict dataflow without recursion support.

When it comes to graph processing, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. In simple cases, you can use `DataflowEngine` and `ControlFlowEngine`, while in more complex cases, you can use `ControlFlow` and `Dataflow` or write your own solution by studying [the source code](https://github.com/retejs/engine){rel="nofollow"} of the `rete-engine` package


# Integration

::diagram{caption="Architecture" name="integration/architecture"}
::

This framework is not bound to any UI rendering framework and can be integrated with the most popular frameworks/libraries such as **Angular**, **Svelte**, **Lit**, **Vue.js**, **React.js**. The following rendering packages are available:

- [`rete-react-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-react-plugin){rel="nofollow"}
- [`rete-vue-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-vue-plugin){rel="nofollow"}
- [`rete-angular-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-angular-plugin){rel="nofollow"}
- [`rete-svelte-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-svelte-plugin){rel="nofollow"}
- [`@retejs/lit-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@retejs/lit-plugin){rel="nofollow"}

The primary objective is to empower you to choose the visualization tools that align with your specific needs. Additionally, if you ever need to use the render plugin for a different framework within your application (such as during a project migration), you can easily do so. Please note that `rete-angular-plugin` is only compatible with Angular applications.

## Classic preset

::diagram{caption="Presets" name="integration/presets"}
::

By default, you can use the classic preset that has built-in components for:

- nodes
- connections
- some controls (numeric or text input fields)

```ts
import { AngularPlugin, AngularArea2D, Presets as AngularPresets } from 'rete-angular-plugin/20'

const angular = new AngularPlugin<Schemes, AngularArea2D<Schemes>>({ injector })

angular.addPreset(AngularPresets.classic.setup())

area.use(angular)
```

The framework allows you to swap out the pre-defined components with any other components as per your needs. The node component, in particular, can be customized extensively. Refer to the [Customization](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react#customization) guide for more details

## Combining render plugins

::diagram{caption="Combine" name="integration/combine"}
::

This framework version has improved approaches for combining various rendering frameworkswhile ensuring TypeScript support. For instance, you can render one node using **Vue.js** and another using **React.js**.

```ts
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ReactArea2D, ReactPlugin, Presets as ReactPresets } from 'rete-react-plugin'
import { VueArea2D, VuePlugin, Presets as VuePresets } from 'rete-vue-plugin'

type AreaExtra =
  | ReactArea2D<Schemes>
  | VueArea2D<Schemes>

const reactPlugin = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ createRoot })
const vuePlugin = new VuePlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>()

reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.classic.setup({ customize: {
  node(data) {
    if (data.payload instanceof AddNode) return null // prevent rendering of AddNode by React.js
    return ReactPresets.classic.Node
  }
} }))
vuePlugin.addPreset(VuePresets.classic.setup({ customize: {
  node() {
    return VuePresets.classic.Node // render all nodes that weren't rendered by previously used render plugin
  }
} }))

// order matters
area.use(reactPlugin)
area.use(vuePlugin)
```

The `AddNode` node in this example is rendered using **Vue.js**, while all other nodes are rendered using **React.js**.

Using multiple frameworks at once may have performance drawbacks, but it can also offer a significant boost to prototyping speed when when time-to-market is critical.


# Basic editor

::alert
This guide features the `rete-react-plugin`. You can use it in any application, regardless of the framework you're using (**React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte** etc.).

Follow this guide to use the corresponding render plugin in your **Angular**, **Svelte** or **Vue.js** application, with reference to the respective guides for [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue) etc.

In order to complete this guide, you can create an application on &#x2A;*[Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io){rel="nofollow"}** by choosing any client application template or set up the application locally.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete rete-area-plugin rete-connection-plugin rete-react-plugin rete-render-utils styled-components react@19 react-dom@19
```

## Defining types and initializing the editor instance

```ts
import { NodeEditor, GetSchemes, ClassicPreset } from "rete";

type Schemes = GetSchemes<
  ClassicPreset.Node,
  ClassicPreset.Connection<ClassicPreset.Node, ClassicPreset.Node>
>;

const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();
```

where `Schemes` is a type that will assist you with type inference during plugin configuration. For more intricate examples, it may be necessary to extend the `ClassicPreset.Node` and `ClassicPreset.Connection` classes.

## Add an arbitrary node

Creating a node that contains one control and the output port. Keep in mind that `addNode` is an asynchronous method.

```ts
const socket = new ClassicPreset.Socket("socket");

const nodeA = new ClassicPreset.Node("A");
nodeA.addControl("a", new ClassicPreset.InputControl("text", {}));
nodeA.addOutput("a", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket));
await editor.addNode(nodeA);
```

## Create an area to render with React.js

Place this code before calling `addNode`:

```ts
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { AreaPlugin } from "rete-area-plugin";
import { ReactPlugin, Presets, ReactArea2D } from "rete-react-plugin";

type AreaExtra = ReactArea2D<Schemes>;

const area = new AreaPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>(container);
const render = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ createRoot });

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup());

editor.use(area);
area.use(render);
```

where

- `container` is the HTMLElement where the editor will be placed
- `AreaExtra` type enables the inclusion of custom viewable elements, as only `node` and `connection` are available by default

## Adding another node

```ts
const nodeB = new ClassicPreset.Node("B");
nodeB.addControl("b", new ClassicPreset.InputControl("text", {}));
nodeB.addInput("b", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket));
await editor.addNode(nodeB);
```

Let's establish connection between these nodes

```ts
await editor.addConnection(new ClassicPreset.Connection(nodeA, "a", nodeB, "b"));
```

## Node positioning

The screen will display two overlapping nodes, but we can adjust the position of the second node.

```ts
await area.translate(nodeB.id, { x: 270, y: 0 });
```

## Interactive connections

This feature enables users to interact with the nodes.

```ts
import { ConnectionPlugin, Presets as ConnectionPresets } from "rete-connection-plugin"

const connection = new ConnectionPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>();

connection.addPreset(ConnectionPresets.classic.setup())

area.use(connection);
```

## Fit viewport

Use the `zoomAt` extension to automatically adjust the viewport to fit all nodes.

```ts
import { AreaExtensions } from "rete-area-plugin";

AreaExtensions.zoomAt(area, editor.getNodes());
```

By default, node dimensions are calculated using `clientWidth`/`clientHeight`. If this method is called right after appending nodes, it might not work correctly until the element is visible on the screen. Instead, you can specify `width`/`height` properties in the node class, as [demonstrated in this step](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/arrange#create-node-base).

## Selectable nodes

Additionally, extensions offer various capabilities, like enabling the user to select nodes.

```ts
AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, AreaExtensions.selector(), {
  accumulating: AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl()
});
```

For further details, check out the [Selectable](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/selectable) guide.

## Nodes order

If your application allows node selection, users may want to view selected nodes without any visual obstructions. To facilitate this, an additional extension is provided that automatically brings the selected node to the front.

```ts
AreaExtensions.simpleNodesOrder(area);
```

This plugin uses a classic preset that includes visual components for nodes, connections, sockets, and input controls. It leverages `styled-components` to design these components.

This plugin can be used in any application, regardless of your stack (**React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, etc.).

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-react-plugin rete-render-utils styled-components
```

If you're using this plugin in an application that doesn't utilize **React.js**, make sure to install the required **React.js** dependencies as well.

```bash
npm i react@19 react-dom@19
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { AreaPlugin } from "rete-area-plugin";
import { ReactPlugin, Presets, ReactArea2D } from "rete-react-plugin";

type AreaExtra = ReactArea2D<Schemes>;

// ....

const render = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ createRoot });

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup());

area.use(render);
```

::alert{type="warning"}
**React 19 Requirement**: When using React 19, passing `createRoot` as a parameter is **mandatory** when initializing ReactPlugin. This is required due to changes in React 19's rendering system.
::

Check out the [Basic](https://retejs.org/examples/basic/react) page for an example of how to use this rendering plugin.

## Using React.js 16-17

In case you're using React.js version 16 or 17, the `createRoot` method is optional

```ts
const render = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>();
```

## "useRete" hook

When working with React app, `useRete` hook eliminates the need for boilerplate code that binds an editor to HTML element. This becomes particularly crucial for dynamic app updates where the old instance of the editor must be removed and replaced with a new one.

```tsx
import { useRete } from 'rete-react-plugin';

function App() {
  const [ref, editor] = useRete(createEditor)

  return <div ref={ref} className="rete"></div>
}
```

where `createEditor` should return object with `destroy` method (usually it has `area.destroy()` call)

## Controls

This plugin provides built-in controls that are displayed based on the following objects:

- `ClassicPreset.InputControl` as `<input type="number" />` or `<input type="text" />`

Simply add the control to the node

```ts
node.addControl('my-control', new ClassicPreset.InputControl("number", {
  initial: 0,
  readonly: false,
  change(value) { }
}))
```

If you want to add different types of controls, you can return the necessary functional component in the `control` handler of `customize` property.

```tsx
render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    control(context) {
      if (context.payload.isButton) {
        return (props: { data: { isButton: true, label: string, onClick: () => void }}) => (
          <button
            onPointerDown={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
            onClick={props.data.onClick}
          >
            {props.data.label}
          </button>
        )
      }
      if (context.payload instanceof ClassicPreset.InputControl) { // don't forget to explicitly specify the built-in Presets.classic.Control
        return Presets.classic.Control;
      }
    }
  }
}));

node.addControl('my-button', { isButton: true, label: 'Click', onClick() {} })
```

This is a simplified version suitable for introductory purposes. For projects, it is recommended to follow the approach demonstrated in [the example](https://retejs.org/examples/controls/react)

Make sure to call `stopPropagation` in `onPointerDown` to prevent the area from intercepting events such as `click`. If you are encountering this issue in React 16 or your interactive elements are added to a custom node instead of a control, try the following solution:

```tsx
import { Drag } from "rete-react-plugin";

<Drag.NoDrag>
  <button>
    {props.data.label}
  </button>
</Drag.NoDrag>
```

Or use a hook to avoid extra nesting

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef(null)

Drag.useNoDrag(ref)

<button ref={ref}>
  {props.data.label}
</button>
```

## Customization

In a similar manner to the approach outlined above, you can replace node, connection, or socket components.

### Node styles

The easiest approach is to extend the current component and use `styled-components` to add extra styles.

```tsx
import { Presets } from "rete-react-plugin";
import { css } from "styled-components";

const myStyles = css<{ selected?: boolean }>`
  background: white;
  ${(props) => props.selected && css`
    border-color: red;
  `}
`;

function StyledNode(props: { data: Schemes['Node'] }) {
  return <Presets.classic.Node styles={() => myStyles} {...props} />;
}

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node() {
      return StyledNode
    }
  }
}))
```

Implementing this will result in all your nodes using `myStyles`.

### Specific nodes

You can add an extra condition to apply these styles only to specific nodes.

```ts
render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node(context) {
      if (context.payload.label === "White") {
        return StyledNode;
      }
      return Presets.classic.Node;
    }
  }
}))

await editor.addNode(new ClassicPreset.Node('White'))
```

### Full node customization

If you want to completely change the node structure, you can implement your own component similar to [Node.tsx](https://github.com/retejs/react-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components/Node.tsx){rel="nofollow"} from the classic preset.

```ts
import { CustomNode } from './CustomNode'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node() {
      return CustomNode
    }
  }
}))
```

The implementation of `CustomNode` is available in the **CustomNode.tsx** file of the [Customization for React.js](https://retejs.org/examples/customization/react) example.

### Full customization of connections

Use **Connection.tsx** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/react-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import { CustomConnection } from './CustomConnection'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    connection() {
      return CustomConnection
    }
  }
}))
```

### Full socket customization

Use **Socket.tsx** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/react-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import { CustomSocket } from './CustomSocket'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    socket() {
      return CustomSocket
    }
  }
}))
```

## Customize context menu

As the context menu components utilize `styled-components`, you can customize their styles by:

```ts
import styled from "styled-components";

const { Menu, Common, Search, Item, Subitems } = Presets.contextMenu

const CustomMenu = styled(Menu)`
  width: 320px;
`
const CustomItem = styled(Item)`
  background: grey;
`

render.addPreset(Presets.contextMenu.setup({
  customize: {
    main: () => CustomMenu,
    item: () => CustomItem,
    common: () => Common,
    search: () => Search,
    subitems: () => Subitems
  }
}))
```

## Other presets

- [context menu](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/context-menu)
- [minimap](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/minimap)
- [reroute](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/reroute)

This plugin offers a classic preset that comes with visual components for nodes, connections, sockets, and input controls.

Supports both versions of Vue.js: 2 and 3

You can use this plugin in any application, irrespective of the application stack (React.js, Vue.js, Angular). However, using SFC requires a bundler with a corresponding template compiler installed, which is a separate topic for discussion.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-vue-plugin rete-render-utils
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { AreaPlugin } from "rete-area-plugin";
import { VuePlugin, Presets, VueArea2D } from "rete-vue-plugin";

type AreaExtra = VueArea2D<Schemes>;

// ....

const render = new VuePlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>();

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup());

area.use(render);
```

Check out the [Vue] page(/examples/basic/vue) page for an example usage of this render plugin.

## Using Vue.js 2

To use the plugin with Vue 2, add `/vue2` to the import statement.

```ts
import { VuePlugin, Presets, VueArea2D } from "rete-vue-plugin/vue2";
```

## Controls

This plugin provides built-in controls that are displayed based on the following objects:

- `ClassicPreset.InputControl` as `<input type="number" />` or `<input type="text" />`

Simply add the control to the node

```ts
node.addControl('my-control', new ClassicPreset.InputControl("number", {
  initial: 0,
  readonly: false,
  change(value) { }
}))
```

If you want to add different types of controls, you can return the necessary component in the `control` handler of `customize` property.

```tsx
import MyButton from './MyButton.vue'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    control(context) {
      if (context.payload.isButton) {
        return MyButton
      }
      if (context.payload instanceof ClassicPreset.InputControl) { // don't forget to explicitly specify the built-in Presets.classic.Control
        return Presets.classic.Control;
      }
    }
  }
}));

node.addControl('my-button', { isButton: true, label: 'Click', onClick() {} })
```

**MyButton.vue**

```vue
<template>
<button
  @pointerdown.stop=""
  @click="data.onClick"
>{{data.label}}</button>
</template>
```

This is a simplified version suitable for introductory purposes. For projects, it is recommended to follow the approach demonstrated in [the example](https://retejs.org/examples/controls/vue)

Make sure to specify `@pointerdown.stop` to prevent the area from intercepting events such as `click`.

## Customization

In a similar manner to the approach outlined above, you can replace node, connection, or socket components.

### Customization of all nodes

If you want to completely change the node structure, you can implement your own component similar to [Node.vue](https://github.com/retejs/vue-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components/Node.vue){rel="nofollow"} from the classic preset

```ts
import CustomNode from './CustomNode.vue'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node() {
      return CustomNode
    }
  }
}))
```

The implementation of `CustomNode` is available in the **CustomNode.vue** file of the [Customization for Vue.js](https://retejs.org/examples/customization/vue) example.

### Specific nodes

You can add an extra condition to apply this component only to specific nodes.

```ts
render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node(context) {
      if (context.payload.label === "Custom") {
        return CustomNode;
      }
      return Presets.classic.Node;
    }
  }
}))

await editor.addNode(new ClassicPreset.Node('White'))
```

### Connection customization

Use **Connection.vue** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/vue-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import CustomConnection from './CustomConnection.vue'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    connection() {
      return CustomConnection
    }
  }
}))
```

### Socket customization

Use **Socket.vue** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/vue-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import CustomSocket from './CustomSocket.vue'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    socket() {
      return CustomSocket
    }
  }
}))
```

## Customize context menu

In order to customize the context menu for this rendering plugin, one can override styles using selectors (and it's important to consider the specificity of selectors in CSS)

```scss
[rete-context-menu] {
  width: 320px !important;
  .block:first-child input {
    background: grey;
  }
  .block.item {
    background: grey;
  }
}
```

## Use Vue.js plugins

Since `rete-vue-plugin` creates independent Vue.js instance for nodes, sockets, controls, etc., it doesn't inherit plugins from your project's main Vue instance. To bridge this gap, the plugin offers a solution: injecting a custom Vue application instance. This capability ensures that any Vue plugins or global components you wish to employ within your Rete-specific Vue components are accessible, enabling seamless sharing between your Vue.js application and Rete.js editor.

### Vue.js 3

The following example demonstrates how to configure custom Vue.js 3 instance:

```ts
import { Presets, VuePlugin } from "rete-vue-plugin";
import { createApp } from "vue";

const render = new VuePlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({
  setup(context) {
    const app = createApp(context);

    app.use(yourPlugin);

    return app;
  },
});
```

where `yourPlugin` is an instance of any plugin (like [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started){rel="nofollow"} or [Vue I18N](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/){rel="nofollow"})

### Vue.js 2

Since the initialization for Vue.js 2 is slightly different, let's take a look at the following example:

```ts
import { Presets, VuePlugin } from "rete-vue-plugin";
import Vue from "vue";

const render = new VuePlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({
  setup(context) {
    const app = new Vue({ ...context, yourPlugin });

    return app;
  },
});
```

where `yourPlugin` is an instance of any plugin (like [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started){rel="nofollow"} or [Vue I18N](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/){rel="nofollow"})

## Other presets

- [context menu](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/context-menu)
- [minimap](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/minimap)
- [reroute](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/reroute)

This plugin offers a classic preset that comes with visual components for nodes, connections, sockets, and input controls.

Compatible with Angular 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20

This plugin is **exclusively** designed for Angular applications as it requires an `Injector` instance, unlike other render plugins. Additionally, the plugin supports Standalone mode in integration starting from Angular 19, with enhanced features in Angular 20.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-angular-plugin rete-render-utils @angular/elements@20
```

**Please note**: this plugin relies on `@angular/elements`, which is based on Web Components. However, Web Components have a limitation - they [cannot be unregistered](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/754){rel="nofollow"}. This limitation may result in the reuse of the initial Angular component instead of creating a new one when a node with the same identifier is added, potentially leading to the use of outdated data within a custom node, such as data from an injected service.

## Plugin connection

This is an example of integration in **Angular 20**, but you can specify a different version (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20) in the import that matches the version of your application.

These versions have been compiled with Ivy.

```ts
import { AreaPlugin } from "rete-area-plugin";
import { AngularPlugin, Presets, AngularArea2D } from "rete-angular-plugin/20";

type AreaExtra = AngularArea2D<Schemes>;

// ....

const render = new AngularPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ injector });

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup());

area.use(render);
```

where `injector` is an instance of `Injector` that can be obtained through dependency injection (DI).

## Use Legacy View Engine

Additionally, the plugin provides support for the legacy engine which can be imported in the following way

```ts
import { AngularPlugin, Presets, AngularArea2D } from "rete-angular-plugin";
```

## Controls

This plugin provides built-in controls that are displayed based on the following objects:

- `ClassicPreset.InputControl` as `<input type="number" />` or `<input type="text" />`

Simply add the control to the node

```ts
node.addControl('my-control', new ClassicPreset.InputControl("number", {
  initial: 0,
  readonly: false,
  change(value) { }
}))
```

If you want to add different types of controls, you can return the necessary component in the `control` handler of `customize` property.

```tsx
import { ControlComponent } from "rete-angular-plugin/20";
import { MyButtonComponent } from './my-button.component'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    control(context) {
      if (context.payload.isButton) {
        return MyButtonComponent
      }
      if (context.payload instanceof ClassicPreset.InputControl) { // don't forget to explicitly specify the built-in ControlComponent
        return ControlComponent
      }
    }
  }
}));

node.addControl('my-button', { isButton: true, label: 'Click', onClick() {} })
```

```ts
import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-button",
  template: `<button
    (pointerdown)="$event.stopPropagation()"
    (click)="data.onClick()"
  >
    {{ data.label }}
  </button>`
})
export class ButtonComponent {
  @Input() data!: { label: string, onClick: () => void };
}

```

This is a simplified version suitable for introductory purposes. For projects, it is recommended to follow the approach demonstrated in [the example](https://retejs.org/examples/controls/angular)

Make sure to specify `(pointerdown)="$event.stopPropagation()"` to prevent the area from intercepting events such as `click`.

## Customization

In a similar manner to the approach outlined above, you can replace node, connection, or socket components.

### Customization of all nodes

If you want to completely change the node structure, you can implement your own component similar to [node](https://github.com/retejs/angular-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components/node){rel="nofollow"} from the classic preset

```ts
import { CustomNodeComponent } from './custom-node.component'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node() {
      return CustomNodeComponent
    }
  }
}))
```

The implementation of `CustomNodeComponent` is available in the **custom-node.component.ts** file of the [Customization for Angular](https://retejs.org/examples/customization/angular) example.

### Specific nodes

You can add an extra condition to apply this component only to specific nodes.

```ts
import { NodeComponent } from "rete-angular-plugin/20";

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node(context) {
      if (context.payload.label === "Custom") {
        return CustomNodeComponent;
      }
      return NodeComponent; // use built-in component
    }
  }
}))

await editor.addNode(new ClassicPreset.Node('White'))
```

### Connection customization

Use **connection** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/angular-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import { CustomConnectionComponent } from './custom-connection.component'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    connection() {
      return CustomConnectionComponent
    }
  }
}))
```

### Socket customization

Use **socket** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/angular-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import { CustomSocketComponent } from './custom-socket.component'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    socket() {
      return CustomSocketComponent
    }
  }
}))
```

## Customize context menu

In order to customize the context menu for this rendering plugin, one can override styles using selectors (and it's important to consider the specificity of selectors in CSS)

```scss
[rete-context-menu] {
  width: 320px;
  context-menu-search input.search {
    background: grey;
  }
  context-menu-item.block {
    background: grey;
  }
}
```

## Angular 20 Features

Angular 20 brings several improvements that enhance the integration with Rete.js:

- **Enhanced Standalone Components**: Improved support for standalone components makes integration more streamlined
- **Better Tree-shaking**: Optimized bundle sizes for applications using rete-angular-plugin
- **Improved Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript support for better development experience
- **Performance Optimizations**: Better change detection and rendering performance

To take advantage of these features, make sure to use the version-specific import:

```ts
import { AngularPlugin, Presets, AngularArea2D } from "rete-angular-plugin/20";
```

## Other presets

- [context menu](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/context-menu)
- [minimap](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/minimap)
- [reroute](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/reroute)

This plugin offers a classic preset that comes with visual components for nodes, connections, sockets, and input controls.

Supports latest versions of Svelte: 5, 4 and 3

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-svelte-plugin rete-render-utils sass
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { AreaPlugin } from "rete-area-plugin";
import { SveltePlugin, Presets, SvelteArea2D } from "rete-svelte-plugin/5"; // or "rete-svelte-plugin" for older versions

type AreaExtra = SvelteArea2D<Schemes>;

// ....

const render = new SveltePlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>();

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup());

area.use(render);
```

Please note that this plugin is intended for client-side use only. Therefore, modules that use it within your `*.svelte` modules need to be dynamically imported.

```ts
onMount(async () => {
  const { createEditor } = await import("./editor");
})
```

Check out the [Svelte](https://retejs.org/examples/basic/svelte) page for an example usage of this render plugin.

## Controls

This plugin provides built-in controls that are displayed based on the following objects:

- `ClassicPreset.InputControl` as `<input type="number" />` or `<input type="text" />`

Simply add the control to the node

```ts
node.addControl('my-control', new ClassicPreset.InputControl("number", {
  initial: 0,
  readonly: false,
  change(value) { }
}))
```

If you want to add different types of controls, you can return the necessary component in the `control` handler of `customize` property.

```tsx
import MyButton from './MyButton.svelte'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    control(context) {
      if (context.payload.isButton) {
        return MyButton
      }
      if (context.payload instanceof ClassicPreset.InputControl) { // don't forget to explicitly specify the built-in Presets.classic.Control
        return Presets.classic.Control;
      }
    }
  }
}));

node.addControl('my-button', { isButton: true, label: 'Click', onClick() {} })
```

**MyButton.svelte**

```svelte
<button
  on:pointerdown|stopPropagation={() => null}
  on:click="data.onClick"
>
  {data.label}
</button>
```

This is a simplified version suitable for introductory purposes. For projects, it is recommended to follow the approach demonstrated in [the example](https://retejs.org/examples/controls/svelte)

Make sure to specify `on:pointerdown|stopPropagation` to prevent the area from intercepting events such as `click`.

## Customization

In a similar manner to the approach outlined above, you can replace node, connection, or socket components.

### Customization of all nodes

If you want to completely change the node structure, you can implement your own component similar to [Node.svelte](https://github.com/retejs/svelte-plugin/blob/main/src/presets/classic/components/Node.svelte){rel="nofollow"} from the classic preset

```ts
import CustomNode from './CustomNode.svelte'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node() {
      return CustomNode
    }
  }
}))
```

The implementation of `CustomNode` is available in the **CustomNode.svelte** file of the [Customization for Svelte](https://retejs.org/examples/customization/svelte) example.

### Specific nodes

You can add an extra condition to apply this component only to specific nodes.

```ts
render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    node(context) {
      if (context.payload.label === "Custom") {
        return CustomNode;
      }
      return Presets.classic.Node;
    }
  }
}))

await editor.addNode(new ClassicPreset.Node('White'))
```

### Connection customization

Use **Connection.svelte** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/svelte-plugin/blob/main/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import CustomConnection from './CustomConnection.svelte'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    connection() {
      return CustomConnection
    }
  }
}))
```

### Socket customization

Use **Socket.svelte** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/svelte-plugin/blob/main/src/presets/classic/components){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts
import CustomSocket from './CustomSocket.svelte'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    socket() {
      return CustomSocket
    }
  }
}))
```

## Customize context menu

In order to customize the context menu for this rendering plugin, one can override styles using selectors (and it's important to consider the specificity of selectors in CSS)

```scss
.rete-context-menu {
  width: 320px !important;
  .block:first-child input {
    background: grey;
  }
  .block.item {
    background: grey;
  }
}
```

```ts
import { MyButtonElement } from './MyButton'

customElements.define("my-button", MyButtonElement);

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    control(context) {
      if (context.payload.isButton) {
        const { payload } = context;

        return () => html`<my-button .data=${payload}></my-button>`;
      }
      if (context.payload instanceof ClassicPreset.InputControl) { // don't forget to explicitly specify the built-in <rete-control>
        return () => html`<rete-control .data=${payload}></rete-control>`;
      }
    }
  }
}));

node.addControl('my-button', { isButton: true, label: 'Click', onClick() {} })
```

**MyButton.ts**

```ts
export class CustomButton extends LitElement {
  static get properties() {
    return {
      data: { type: Object },
    };
  }

  declare data: object;

  render() {
    return html`
      <button
        @pointerdown=${(e: MouseEvent) => e.stopPropagation()}
        @doubleclick=${(e: MouseEvent) => e.stopPropagation()}
        @click=${this.data.onClick}
      >${this.data.label}</button>
    `;
  }
}
```

This is a simplified version suitable for introductory purposes. For projects, it is recommended to follow the approach demonstrated in [the example](https://retejs.org/examples/controls/lit)

Make sure to specify `@pointerdown` and `@doubleclick` to prevent the area from intercepting events such as `@click`.

## Customization

In a similar manner to the approach outlined above, you can replace node, connection, or socket components.

### Customization of all nodes

If you want to completely change the node structure, you can implement your own component similar to [node.ts](https://github.com/retejs/lit-plugin/blob/main/src/presets/classic/components/node.ts){rel="nofollow"} from the classic preset

    }
  }
}))
```

The implementation of `CustomNodeElement` is available in the **CustomNode.ts** file of the [Customization for Lit](https://retejs.org/examples/customization/lit) example.

      }
      return ({ emit }) => html`<rete-node .data=${context.payload} .emit=${emit}></rete-node>`;
    }
  }
}))

await editor.addNode(new ClassicPreset.Node('White'))
```

### Connection customization

Use **connection.ts** as a starting point from the [presets/classic/components](https://github.com/retejs/lit-plugin/blob/main/src/presets/classic/components/connection.ts){rel="nofollow"} directory of the plugin's source code.

```ts

## Prepare nodes

Let's take a look at a simplified example of a graph with two node types: `NumberNode` and `AddNode`. These nodes are built exclusively for processing (on the server-side, e.g.) and don't have any integrations with the user interface. You can find a link to the complete example with the UI at the end of the article.

```ts
const socket = new ClassicPreset.Socket("socket");

class NumberNode extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor(public value: number) {
    super("Number");
    this.addOutput("value", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Number"));
  }

  data(): { value: number } {
    return { value: this.value };
  }
}

class AddNode extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor() {
    super("Add");
    this.addInput("left", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Left"));
    this.addInput("right", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Right"));
    this.addOutput("value", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Number"));
  }

  data(inputs: { left?: number[]; right?: number[] }): { value: number } {
    const { left, right } = inputs;
    const value = (left && left[0] || 0) + (right && right[0] || 0)

    return { value };
  }
}

class Connection<
  A extends Node,
  B extends Node
> extends ClassicPreset.Connection<A, B> {}

type Node = NumberNode | AddNode;
type ConnProps = Connection<NumberNode, AddNode> | Connection<AddNode, AddNode>;
type Schemes = GetSchemes<Node, ConnProps>;
```

## Connect

```ts
import { DataflowEngine } from "rete-engine";
import { NodeEditor } from "rete";

const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();
const engine = new DataflowEngine<Schemes>();

editor.use(engine);
```

## Add nodes and connections

```ts
const a = new NumberNode(1);
const b = new NumberNode(1);
const sum = new AddNode();

const con1 = new Connection(a, "value", c, "left");
const con2 = new Connection(b, "value", c, "right");

await editor.addNode(a);
await editor.addNode(b);
await editor.addNode(sum);

await editor.addConnection(con1);
await editor.addConnection(con2);
```

## Start the processing

Retrieve output data from the `sum` node.

```ts
const result = await engine.fetch(sum.id)
```

The value of `result` will be `{ value: 2 }`, which is the sum of the initial input values of the `sum` node.

If you want to modify `a.value` or `b.value`, you need to clear the cache before processing the graph again. The output values of nodes are cached to avoid repetitive node execution.

```ts
engine.reset() // reset all nodes
// or specific nodes
engine.reset(a.id)
engine.reset(b.id)
```

Additionally, the `data` methods can be async. In such cases, the `sum` node will wait for the `data` methods of its input nodes to complete execution. After all of them have returned a value, the engine will execute the `data` method of the `sum` node

## Prepare nodes

Let's take a simple example of a graph with two types of nodes: `Log` and `Delay`. These nodes can perform specific operations and pass control to outgoing nodes in a certain way

At the end of the article, you can find a link to the full example that includes visual components.

Defining a node class that logs a message and passes control to outgoing nodes via the `exec` port:

```ts
const socket = new ClassicPreset.Socket("socket");

class Log extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor(public message: string) {
    super("Log");

    this.addInput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Exec", true));
    this.addOutput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Exec"));
  }

  execute(input: "exec", forward: (output: "exec") => void) {
    console.log(this.message);
    forward("exec");
  }
}
```

Defining a class that handles delays, where the only purpose is to pass control to outgoing nodes through the `exec` port after a specified timeout:

```ts
class Delay extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor(private seconds: number) {
    super("Delay");
    this.addInput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Exec", true));
    this.addOutput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Exec"));
  }

  execute(input: "exec" | undefined, forward: (output: "exec") => void) {
    setTimeout(() => forward("exec"), seconds * 1000)
  }
}

class Connection<A extends NodeProps, B extends NodeProps> extends ClassicPreset.Connection<A, B> {}

type NodeProps = Start | Log | Delay;
type ConnProps =
  | Connection<Start, Log>
  | Connection<Delay, Log>
  | Connection<Log, Delay>
  | Connection<Log, Log>
  | Connection<Delay, Delay>;
type Schemes = GetSchemes<NodeProps, ConnProps>;
```

## Connect

```ts
import { ControlFlowEngine } from "rete-engine";
import { NodeEditor } from "rete";

const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();
const engine = new ControlFlowEngine<Schemes>();

editor.use(engine);
```

## Add nodes and connections

Let's add a sequence of nodes in the form of Log -> Delay -> Log

```ts
const log1 = new Log("log before delay");
const delay = new Delay(2);
const log2 = new Log("log after delay");

const con2 = new Connection(log1, "exec", delay, "exec");
const con3 = new Connection(delay, "exec", log2, "exec");

await editor.addNode(log1);
await editor.addNode(delay);
await editor.addNode(log2);

await editor.addConnection(con2);
await editor.addConnection(con3);
```

## Execution

The node `log1` serves as the starting point for the graph execution.

```ts
engine.execute(log1.id);
```

This operation triggers the `execute` method of the `Log` class, with `undefined` as the `input` parameter because the node was directly called, without being passed from an incoming node.

Then, calling `forward("exec")` passes control to all the outgoing nodes. In our case, the `Delay` node does the same thing but after a delay using `setTimeout`.

Logs:

```log
"log before delay"
// delay for 2 seconds
"log after delay"
```

# Hybrid Engine

  :::
::

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete rete-engine
```

## Prepare nodes

In order to work properly, all node classes must implement `execute` method for Control flow and `data` method for Dataflow.

The `Start` class is designed to pass control and has a default `data` method that returns an empty object.

```ts
const socket = new ClassicPreset.Socket("socket");

class Start extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor() {
    super("Start");
    this.addOutput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Exec"));
  }

  execute(_: never, forward: (output: "exec") => void) {
    forward("exec");
  }

  data() {
    return {};
  }
}
```

Along with receiving control, the `Log` class can also request data from the incoming nodes through the `message` port using the `fetchInputs` method of the `DataflowEngine` instance.

```ts
class Log extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor() {
    super("Log");

    this.addInput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Exec", true));
    this.addInput("message", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Text"));
    this.addOutput("exec", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Exec"));
  }

  async execute(input: "exec", forward: (output: "exec") => void) {
    const inputs = (await dataflow.fetchInputs(this.id)) as {
      message: string[];
    };

    console.log((inputs.message && inputs.message[0]) || "");

    forward("exec");
  }

  data() {
    return {};
  }
}
```

The `TextNode` class is responsible only for providing data and cannot receive or pass control.

```ts
class TextNode extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor(private text: string) {
    super("Text");
    this.addOutput("value", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Number"));
  }

  execute() {}

  data(): { value: string } {
    return {
      value: this.text
    };
  }
}

class Connection<A extends NodeProps, B extends NodeProps> extends ClassicPreset.Connection<A, B> {}

type NodeProps = Start | Log | TextNode;
type ConnProps = Connection<Start, Log> | Connection<TextNode, Log>;
type Schemes = GetSchemes<NodeProps, ConnProps>;

```

## Connect

```ts
import { NodeEditor } from "rete";
import { DataflowEngine, ControlFlowEngine } from "rete-engine";

const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();
const dataflow = new DataflowEngine<Schemes>(({ inputs, outputs }) => {
  return {
    inputs: () => Object.keys(inputs).filter((name) => name !== "exec"),
    outputs: () => Object.keys(outputs).filter((name) => name !== "exec")
  };
});
const controlflow = new ControlFlowEngine<Schemes>(() => {
  return {
    inputs: () => ["exec"],
    outputs: () => ["exec"]
  };
});

editor.use(dataflow);
editor.use(controlflow);
```

## Add nodes and connections

```ts
const start = new Start();
const text1 = new TextNode("log");
const log1 = new Log();

const con1 = new Connection(start, "exec", log1, "exec");
const con2 = new Connection(text1, "value", log1, "message");

await editor.addNode(start);
await editor.addNode(text1);
await editor.addNode(log1);

await editor.addConnection(con1);
await editor.addConnection(con2);
```

## Execution

The node `start` serves as the starting point for the graph execution.

```ts
engine.execute(start.id);
```

As a result, the `start` node passes control to the `log1` node, which fetches data from the `text1` node using the `fetchInputs` method.

# 3D

::alert
This guide is based on the [Basic](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic) guide. It is recommended to review it for a comprehensive understanding of this guide.
::

  :::ref-example{link="/examples/3d" title="3D"}

This guide outlines how to incorporate the node editor into a 3D scene. It can be achieved by `rete-area-3d-plugin`, which substitutes the standard `rete-area-plugin`.

::diagram{caption="Architecture" name="guides/3d/index"}
::

Powered by Three.js, this plugin creates a scene that contains a camera and two renderers - `CSS3DRenderer` and `WebGLRenderer`. Consequently, 3D objects and native HTML elements are rendered together in a single viewport, enabling overlapping. The primary advantage of utilizing native elements (as opposed to rendering to texture) is the preservation of full interactivity.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

Prior to using this plugin, `three` peer dependency must be installed separately.

```bash
npm i rete-area-3d-plugin three @types/three
```

## Plugin connection

If you have followed the basic guide, you will need to replace the initialization of Area2DPlugin with Area3DPlugin and change some type definitions.

```ts
import { Area3D, Area3DPlugin } from 'rete-area-3d-plugin';

type AreaExtra =
  | Area3D<Schemes>

const area = new Area3DPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>(container);

editor.use(area);
```

Consequently, the container will incorporate both the `<canvas>` element and a container for HTML elements that undergo 3D transformation.

In case your editor has nodes, you can see them in the viewport, but they will not be interactive. To provide visual feedback for node interaction, it should be part of an animation loop and be linked to `Object3D`, which is directly responsible for dragging.

```ts
Area3DExtensions.animate(area)
```

This extension adopts the typical **three.js** approach to animation loops, utilizing the `render()` function along with the `requestAnimationFrame()`.

Additionally, we need to link our nodes and connections with the geometry in the 3D scene to allow for interactive functionality and prevent unwanted overlapping with other objects.

```ts
Area3DExtensions.forms.connection(render);
Area3DExtensions.forms.node(area);
```

During rendering, these extensions produce geometry that accurately replicates the form of nodes and connections.

Now you can interact with the nodes and rotate or move the camera around them. Check out the complete result on the [3D](https://retejs.org/examples/3d) example page.

## Additional extensions

Some extensions available in the `rete-area-plugin` can be utilized solely within the editor, disregarding the viewport and similar factors.

```ts
import { AreaExtensions } from 'rete-area-plugin'

AreaExtensions.showInputControl(area)
AreaExtensions.simpleNodesOrder(area)
AreaExtensions.snapGrid(area, { size: 30 })
AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, AreaExtensions.selector(), { accumulating: AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl() });
```

In this plugin, the following extensions are available:

```ts
import { Area3DExtensions } from 'rete-area-3d-plugin'

Area3DExtensions.forms.comment(area) // creates geometry for comments plugin
Area3DExtensions.forms.reroute(area) // creates geometry for reroute plugin

Area3DExtensions.lookAt(area, editor.getNodes()) // alternative to zoomAt from rete-area-plugin
```

As previously stated, this plugin creates a scene complete with camera and renderers. To access them, you can use the following code:

```ts
const { scene } = area.area

scene.root // three.js' Scene
scene.camera // PerspectiveCamera
scene.renderer.css3d // CSS3DRenderer
scene.renderer.webgl // WebGLRenderer
scene.orbit // OrbitControls
```

For instance, you have the option to deactivate orbital control (`scene.orbit.enabled = false`) and add an alternative one, or adjust the settings of renderers or camera.

You can add 3D objects by accessing the `scene.root`, which is a `Scene` instance in Three.js.

## Custom HTML elements

If you want to include HTML elements within the scene, specifically within the editor's canvas, use the following code:

```ts
area.area.content.add(element)
```

An HTML element will be added to the editor canvas at position zero. To ensure it doesn't overlap with other scene elements, it should have geometry that mirrors its form.

```ts
area.area.content.updateGeometry(element, bufferGeometry)
```

Check out more examples in [the source code](https://github.com/retejs/area-3d-plugin/tree/main/src/extensions/forms){rel="nofollow"}

With regard to other HTML elements, it will maintain its own order, and you can modify it as follows:

```ts
area.area.content.reorder(element, nextElement)
```

Removing element:

```ts
area.area.content.remove(element)
```

## Customization

In case you have customized your nodes or connections, you might discover that they don't match the placeholder in the 3D scene. To adapt them to new forms, you can either implement your own geometry or reuse existing with various arguments.

Example of modifying the border radius of a node:

```ts
Area3DExtensions.forms.node(area, {
  customize(node) {
    return Area3DExtensions.forms.createClassicNodeGeometry(node, {
      borderRadius: 0
    })
  }
})
```

Example of a connection geometry featuring increased width:

```ts
Area3DExtensions.forms.connection(reactRender, {
  customize(path) {
    return Area3DExtensions.forms.createClassicConnectionGeometry(path, 10)
  }
})
```

## Multiple editors

Additionally, the plugin offers the capability to include several editors in a single scene. You can achieve this by creating a main `Area3DPlugin` instance and sharing it with other editors.

```ts
const mainEditor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();
const mainArea = new Area3DPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>(container)

mainEditor.use(mainArea)

const secondaryEditor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();
const secondaryArea = mainArea.share()

secondaryEditor.use(secondaryArea)
```

Within a certain scene, you'll encounter two editors, placed in the same plane and overlapping each other. To separate them, you can change the position and orientation of the second editor.

```ts
const canvas = secondaryArea.area.getCanvas()

canvas.rotateY(Math.PI / 2)
canvas.get(sharedArea)?.translateX(500)
```

# Data structures

Similar to a graph, this framework contains data as nodes and edges. One correction: in the editor's terminology, the graph edges are known as connections.

The `NodeEditor` instance stores this data in a normalized format, specifically as two distinct lists containing objects of the following type:

- `{ id: <string> }` for a nodes
- `{ id: <string>, source: <string>, target: <string> }` for a connections

::diagram{caption="NodeEditor" name="editor/node-editor"}
::

Initializing the editor involves using a basic scheme without any supplementary fields to start with:

```ts
import { NodeEditor, BaseSchemes, getUID } from 'rete'

const editor = new NodeEditor<BaseSchemes>()
```

## Add nodes and connections

When dealing with graph data, you have the option to create arbitrary identifiers for nodes and connections, or utilize the existing ones.

```ts
const a = { id: getUID() }
const b = { id: getUID() }
const connection = { id: getUID(), source: a.id, target: b.id }

await editor.addNode(a)
await editor.addNode(b)
await editor.addConnection(connection)
```

## Retrieve nodes and connections

We can now retrieve a list of newly added nodes and connections

```ts
editor.getNodes() // returns [a, b]
editor.getConnections() // returns [connection]
```

You have all the necessary methods to process the graph, such as retrieving a list of input connections or all incoming nodes, as we will discuss in the following sections.

## Incoming/outgoing connections

::diagram
---
caption: Incoming/outgoing connections
name: guides/data-structures/connections
---
::

The following code shows how to retrieve a list of incoming and outgoing connections for `node`:

```ts
const connections = editor.getConnections()

const incomingConnections = connections.filter(connection => connection.target === node.id)
const outgoingConnections = connections.filter(connection => connection.source === node.id)
```

## Incoming/outgoing nodes

::diagram{caption="Incoming/outgoing nodes" name="guides/data-structures/nodes"}
::

We can use variables from the previous section to retrieve incoming or outgoing nodes:

```ts
const incomers = incomingConnections.map(connection => editor.getNode(connection.source))
const outgoers = outgoingConnections.map(connection => editor.getNode(connection.target))
```

In general, this is sufficient for simple cases, but if there are more than one connections between nodes, we will have to remove duplicates:

```ts
Array.from(new Set(incomers))
Array.from(new Set(outgoers))
```

## Advanced methods

The previously mentioned approaches are fairly flexible, but they require the implementation of more advanced methods on your own. Fortunately, the [`rete-structures` package](https://github.com/retejs/structures){rel="nofollow"} offers such methods divided into 4 categories:

- **Mapping**: iterating through a list of nodes while transforming or filtering it
- **Sets**: techniques for working with graphs as sets, including union, difference and intersection.
- **Subgraph**: graphs that have parent-child relationships between nodes.
- **Traverse**: traversing nodes by their connections, such as retrieving only incoming nodes or all predecessors.

::diagram{caption="rete-structures" name="guides/data-structures/structures"}
::

### Usage

Install the dependency

```bash
npm i rete-structures
```

Use the following import statement and declaration

```ts
import { structures } from 'rete-structures'

const graph = structures(editor)

graph.nodes()
graph.connections()
```

There are other `graph` methods that serve distinct purposes, demonstrated below with code and an interactive preview. The resulting nodes are prominent and the preview allows users to select nodes and observe changes.

The execution of any of the methods usually yields nodes that were not discarded, as well as their connections if both of their nodes are present.

### Traverse

#### Roots

Nodes without incoming connections are known as root nodes

```ts
structures(graph).roots()
```

::structures{#roots}
::

#### Leaves

Leaf nodes are those that have no outgoing connections

```ts
structures(graph).leaves()
```

::structures{#leaves}
::

#### Incomers

Incoming nodes directly connected to the selected node

```ts
structures(graph).incomers(selectedNodeId)
```

::structures{#incomers pick="e"}
::

#### Outgoers

Outgoing nodes directly connected to the selected node

```ts
structures(graph).outgoers(selectedNodeId)
```

::structures{#outgoers pick="a"}
::

#### Predecessors

Every incoming node, as well as its own incoming nodes and so on

```ts
structures(graph).predecessors(selectedNodeId)
```

::structures{#predecessors pick="f"}
::

#### Successors

Every outgoing node, as well as its own outgoing nodes and so on

```ts
structures(graph).successors(selectedNodeId)
```

::structures{#successors pick="c"}
::

### Mapping

#### Filter

Filtering can be applied to both nodes and connections

```ts
structures(graph).filter(Boolean, ({ source, target }) => source === selectedNodeId || target === selectedNodeId)
```

::structures{#filter pick="d"}
::

### Sets

The following examples shows the cases where selected node serves as the second graph.

#### Union

The union of a graph and a node from this graph gives the same graph

```ts
structures(editor).union({ nodes: [selectedNode], connections: [] })
```

::structures{#union pick="d"}
::

#### Difference

By subtracting the node from the graph, you can obtain a new graph without that node

```ts
structures(editor).difference({ nodes: [selectedNode], connections: [] })
```

::structures{#union pick="d"}
::

#### Intersection

By intersecting the graph with the node from this graph, you'll get a new graph that includes only the selected node

```ts
structures(editor).intersection({ nodes: [selectedNode], connections: [] })
```

::structures{#intersection pick="d"}
::

### Subgraph

This category pertains to graphs that contain nodes with a parent-child relationship, specifically, nodes that have a `parent` field defined and are nested within other nodes.

#### Children

The list of direct descendant, namely children

```ts
structures(editor).children((n) => n.id === selectedNodeId);
```

::structures{#children pick="nestedParent"}
::

#### Parent

The list of parents

```ts
structures(editor).parents((n) => n.id === selectedNodeId);
```

::structures{#parent pick="a"}
::

#### Descendants

The list of all descendants, including children, grandchildren and successive generations

```ts
structures(editor).descendants((n) => n.id === selectedNodeId);
```

::structures{#descendants pick="rootParent"}
::

#### Ancestors

The list of all ancestors, from parents to great-grandparents and beyond

```ts
structures(editor).ancestors((n) => n.id === selectedNodeId);
```

::structures{#ancestors pick="a"}
::

#### Orphans

Nodes without a specified `parent` property

```ts
structures(editor).orphans();
```

::structures{#orphans}
::

#### Siblings

Nodes that have a common parent with the selected node, even if it has no parent

```ts
structures(editor).siblings((n) => n.id === selectedNodeId)
```

::structures{#siblings pick="b"}
::

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

Prior to using this plugin, `elkjs` peer dependency must be installed separately.

```bash
npm i rete-auto-arrange-plugin elkjs
```

Additionally, it may be necessary to install `web-worker` if your bundler doesn't recognize this dependency by default

```bash
npm i web-worker
```

## Create the node base

The node's width and height need to be specified as `elkjs` requires these values, especially if the node sizes vary.

```ts
class Node extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  width = 180;
  height = 120;
}

class Connection<N extends Node> extends ClassicPreset.Connection<N, N> {}

type Schemes = GetSchemes<Node, Connection<Node>>;
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { AutoArrangePlugin, Presets as ArrangePresets } from "rete-auto-arrange-plugin";

const arrange = new AutoArrangePlugin<Schemes>();

arrange.addPreset(ArrangePresets.classic.setup());

area.use(arrange);
```

## Arrange added nodes

```ts
await arrange.layout();
```

## Arrange nested nodes

Any node that has the `parent` property will be considered as a nested node within its corresponding parent node, as indicated by the id specified in this field. There are no additional settings required. The [Scopes](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/scopes) guide includes an example of how to use it in practice.

## Animated arrange

If you prefer a seamless transition of nodes position, you can apply an animated `TransitionApplier` with configurable animation duration and timing function

```ts
import { ArrangeAppliers } from "rete-auto-arrange-plugin";

const applier = new ArrangeAppliers.TransitionApplier<Schemes, AreaExtra>({
  duration: 500,
  timingFunction: (t) => t,
  async onTick() {
    // called on every frame update
  }
});

await arrange.layout({ applier })
```

## Arrange options

Additionally, you can make use of [global options for elk.js](https://eclipse.dev/elk/reference/options.html){rel="nofollow"}. For instance, this empowers you to alter the spacing between nodes

```ts
await arrange.layout({
  options: {
    'elk.spacing.nodeNode': 100,
    'elk.layered.spacing.nodeNodeBetweenLayers': 100
  }
});
```

## Selectable nodes

As explained in the [Basic](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic#selectable-nodes) guide, you can enable node selection by using the `selectableNodes` extension

```ts
const selector = AreaExtensions.selector()
const accumulating = AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl()

AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, selector, { accumulating });
```

The code indicates that users can select multiple nodes by holding down the Ctrl key, then these nodes can be moved together

## Selection or deselecting

In addition to user actions, a node can be selected or deselected through the built-in methods of `selectableNodes`

```ts
const selectableNodes = AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, selector, { accumulating });

selectableNodes.select(nodeId) // select a single node, the previous selection will be cleared
selectableNodes.select(nodeId, true) // select a node without clearing previous selections
selectableNodes.unselect(nodeId) // remove the node from the selected li
```

## Selectable custom elements

All elements added to the area can be added to the selector. They can act like nodes: can be selected and moved alongside other elements that are currently selected

Let's take a look at an example of adding an element to the selector

```ts
const id = 'element-id'
const label = 'element-type'

selector.add({
  id,
  label,
  translate(dx, dy) {
    // change position of current element by dx,dy
  },
  unselect() {
    // triggered when removed from selector
    // here you can trigger styles updating
  },
}, accumulating.active())
```

Once this step is completed, the `translate` function will be called every time a selected node or other element is moved.

Before making other selected elements move with the element being dragged, you need to mark the element that the user is directly interacting with.

```ts
selector.pick({ id, label })
```

When an event such as `pointermove` is triggered on your element, it's important to verify that it is a grabbed element, and then apply the offset to all the others.

```ts
if (selector.isPicked({ id, label })) selector.translate(dx, dy)
```

where `dx`, `dy` is an offset of your element within the area's coordinates. Keep in mind that if `transform.k` isn't equal to 1, the values will deviate from the screen coordinates.

This `pick` + `isPicked` approach prevents looping when calling `selector.translate` not only on the `pointermove` event, but also on any position changes of the element through other means.

Removing an element from the selector can be easily achieved by:

```ts
selector.remove({ id, label })
```

## Extend selector

Apart from the `AreaExtensions.selector()` function, you have the option to directly use the `AreaExtensions.Selector` class.

```ts
const selector = new AreaExtensions.Selector()
```

The benefit of using a class-based selector is that it can be expanded and customized to include the functionalities you need, like tracking the selected or unselected elements

```ts
import type { SelectorEntity } from 'rete-area-plugin/_types/extensions/selectable'

class MySelector<E extends SelectorEntity> extends AreaExtensions.Selector<E> {
  add(entity: E, accumulate: boolean): void {
    super.add(entity, accumulate)
    console.log('added', entity)
  }
  remove(entity: E): void {
    super.remove(entity)
    console.log('removed', entity)
  }
}
```

## Getting types ready

Introducing an optional `selected` field to the connection type will allow us to specify programmatically added connections as selected

```ts
class Connection extends ClassicPreset.Connection<
  ClassicPreset.Node,
  ClassicPreset.Node
> {
  selected?: boolean;
}

type Schemes = GetSchemes<ClassicPreset.Node, Connection>;
```

## Custom connection

Our first step is to implement a custom connection that is clickable and capable of changing color when selected.

We will start with the [Connection.tsx](https://github.com/retejs/react-plugin/blob/next/src/presets/classic/components/Connection.tsx){rel="nofollow"} component from the classic preset and enhance its functionality by implementing new features.

We can make the connection more user-friendly by defining a duplicating transparent path.

```ts
import styled from "styled-components";

const HoverPath = styled.path`
  fill: none;
  stroke-width: 15px;
  pointer-events: auto;
  stroke: transparent;
`;
```

We will enhance the existing `Path` component by adding a `selected` prop and modifying the stroke color.

```ts
const Path = styled.path<{ selected?: boolean >`
  stroke: ${(props) => (props.selected ? "rgb(255, 217, 44)" : "steelblue")};
`;

```

The component should return the following template:

```tsx
<Svg
  onPointerDown={(e: PointerEvent) => e.stopPropagation()}
  onClick={props.click}
>
  <HoverPath d={path} />
  <Path selected={props.data.selected} d={path} />
</Svg>
```

The existing connection can be marked as follows:

```ts
connection.selected = true;
area.update("connection", connection.id);
```

## Synchronization of selected connections

Let's get the selector ready

```ts
const selector = AreaExtensions.selector();
const accumulating = AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl();

AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, selector, { accumulating });
```

Adding a connection to the selector can be done in the following way (for instance, by clicking on the connection):

```ts
selector.add({
  id: connection.id,
  label: 'connection',
  translate() {},
  unselect() {
    connection.selected = false;
    area.update("connection", connection.id);
  }
}, accumulating.active())

connection.selected = true;
area.update("connection", connection.id);
```

Now we'll consolidate all of this into a single component using a straightforward closure-based approach (although other methods are preferable in production code), and pass it as a custom connection component

```tsx
function SelectableConnectionBind(props: { data: Schemes["Connection"] }) {
  return (
    <SelectableConnection
      {...props}
      click={() => {
        selector.add({
          /// ...
        })
        // here should be placed here the code for adding to the selector, as shown above
      }}
    />
  );
}

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  customize: {
    connection() {
      return SelectableConnectionBind;
    }
  }
}));
```

This guide provides a more detailed exploration of the functionalities offered by the rete-connection-plugin plugin, enabling user interaction with connections.

When a user clicks on a socket, the connection that trails behind the cursor is referred to as a pseudo-connection, which is is an object with an additional property `isPseudo: true`.

## Presets

You may have already seen the following preset usage, which allows users to add connections by clicking/pressing on an input/output socket and clicking/releasing on an output/input socket:

```ts
connection.addPreset(ConnectionPresets.classic.setup())
```

which is equivalent to the code below:

```ts
import { ClassicFlow } from 'rete-connection-plugin'

connection.addPreset(() => new ClassicFlow())
```

If the input socket is already connected, clicking or pressing on it will remove the connection and substitute it with a pseudo-connection.

### Custom preset

If you prefer an alternative method for adding connections, you can make use of `BidirectFlow`. In this mode, adding a node is done by clicking on the input/output socket and dragging the pseudo-connection onto a socket of the opposite type.

```ts
import { ClassicFlow } from 'rete-connection-plugin'

connection.addPreset(() => new BidirectFlow())
```

Additionally, utilizing the initial socket data, you have the option to select a specific flow or disable interaction with a particular socket altogether

```ts
connection.addPreset(({ nodeId, side, key }) => {
  if (isReadonly(nodeId, side, key)) return undefined
  if (usesBidirect(nodeId, side, key)) return new BidirectFlow()
  return new ClassicFlow()
})
```

If the existing workflows don't meet your needs, you have the option to implement your own solution by referencing [the source code](https://github.com/retejs/connection-plugin/blob/next/src/flow/builtin/bidirect.ts){rel="nofollow"} of the existing ones.

## Enhanced behavior

Enhancing the behavior of existing presets can involve tracking the events `connectionpick` and `connectiondrop`

```ts
connection.addPipe(context => {
  if (context.type === 'connectionpick') { // when the user clicks on the socket
    const { socket } = context.data
  }
  if (context.type === 'connectiondrop') { // when the user clicks on the socket or any area
    const { socket, initial, created } = context.data
  }
  return context
})
```

The `connectionpick` event can be prevented

```ts
connection.addPipe(context => {
  if (context.type === 'connectionpick') {
    if (readonly) return
  }
  return context
})
```

## User-created connection

By default, when a user creates connections using the UI, the plugin adds the connection as an object, rather than an instance of a class, such as `ClassicPreset.Connection`. If you want to customize the process of adding these connection, specify the `makeConnection` option in `ClassicFlow` or `BidirectFlow`.

```ts
import { getSourceTarget } from 'rete-connection-plugin'

connection.addPreset(() => new ClassicFlow({
  makeConnection(from, to, context) {
    const [source, target] = getSourceTarget(from, to) || [null, null];
    const { editor } = context;

    if (source && target) {
      editor.addConnection(
        new MyConnection(
          editor.getNode(source.nodeId),
          source.key,
          editor.getNode(target.nodeId),
          target.key
        )
      );
      return true; // ensure that the connection has been successfully added
    }
  }
}))
```

Additionally, the usage of `getSourceTarget` is essential in this case, as the `from` and `to` options carry data about the initial and final sockets, which might not necessarily match the output and input sockets.

## Configure connection start/end positions

Every connection is associated with a starting and ending point, directly connected to a socket (excluding pseudo-connections where end point depends on the cursor position). By default, the right side of the output socket serves as the starting point, while the left side of the input socket serves as the starting point. Modifying the socket size will cause a shift in the starting/ending point of the connection.

To configure the start and end positions of the connection, you can provide `getDOMSocketPosition` with these offset coordinates relative to the socket center. This method is used by default when the `socketPositionWatcher` option is not specified.

```ts
import { getDOMSocketPosition } from 'rete-render-utils'

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  socketPositionWatcher: getDOMSocketPosition({
    offset({ x, y }, nodeId, side, key) {

      return {
        x: x + 10 * (side === 'input' ? -1 : 1),
        y: y
      }
    },
  })
}))
```

In this scenario, socket position calculation relies on DOM elements. There are cases when such an approach may prove inefficient due to performance or other implementation nuances (for instance, in the [LOD example](https://retejs.org/examples/lod) where displaying connections is required even when the actual sockets are not present in the DOM).

In order to make use of your calculation approach for connection start/end positions, you can extend the abstract class `BaseSocketPosition` and implement the `calculatePosition` method.

```ts
import { BaseSocketPosition } from 'rete-render-utils'

type Position = { x: number, y: number }
type Side = 'input' | 'output'

export class ComputedSocketPosition<S extends Schemes, K> extends BaseSocketPosition<S, K> {
  async calculatePosition(nodeId: string, side: Side, key: string): Promise<Position | null> {
    if (!this.area) return null

    return {
      x: side === 'input' ? 0 : getNodeWith(nodeId)
      y: 0
    }
  }
}

render.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup({
  socketPositionWatcher: new ComputedSocketPosition()
}))
```

where `calculatePosition` is expected to return the position relative to the node's position, or `null` if it cannot be calculated

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-context-menu-plugin
```

## Prepare nodes

To improve convenience and code reusability, it is recommended to create separate classes for nodes:

```ts
class NodeA extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor(socket: ClassicPreset.Socket) {
    super("NodeA");

    this.addControl("port", new ClassicPreset.InputControl("text", {}));
    this.addOutput("port", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket));
  }
}

/// class NodeB extends ...

type Node = NodeA | NodeB;
type Schemes = GetSchemes<Node, Connection<Node, Node>>;
```

## Plugin connection

For a simple solution, use the classic preset and specify a list of labeled items along with a function that returns the required node

```ts
import { ContextMenuExtra, ContextMenuPlugin, Presets as ContextMenuPresets } from "rete-context-menu-plugin";

type AreaExtra = ReactArea2D<Schemes> | ContextMenuExtra;

const contextMenu = new ContextMenuPlugin<Schemes>({
  items: ContextMenuPresets.classic.setup([
    ["NodeA", () => new NodeA(socket)],
    ["NodeB", () => new NodeB(socket)]
  ])
});

area.use(contextMenu);
```

But this is not sufficient as the render plugin is responsible for visualization

## Rendering the context menu

Currently, the visualization of the context menu is possible using rendering plugins for **React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte** and **Lit**.

```ts
import { Presets } from "rete-react-plugin"; // or  rete-vue-plugin, rete-angular-plugin, rete-svelte-plugin, @retejs/lit-plugin

render.addPreset(Presets.contextMenu.setup());
```

For a comprehensive guide on how to connect a specific renderer plugin to your stack version, please follow the guide for
[React.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue), [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte) or [Lit](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/lit)

Clicking on the free space opens up a menu that displays the available nodes for creation, or simply click on an existing node to delete it.

## Subitems

In order to specify node item as subitem, you can use the same definition using an array instead of a factory function:

```ts
const contextMenu = new ContextMenuPlugin<Schemes>({
  items: ContextMenuPresets.classic.setup([
    ["Math", [
      ["Number", () => new NumberNode()],
    ]]
  ])
})
```

## Built-in options for nodes and connections

All nodes and connections have a `Delete` option in their context menu. This option allows you to delete a node, removing its connections first, or delete individual connections.

Another option that you won't see by default on nodes is `Clone`. It appears for nodes that have a `clone` method. For example:

```ts
class NodeA extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  clone() {
    return new NodeA()
  }
}
```

## Custom preset

While the classic preset lets you briefly specify items for the main menu and node-specific menu, it might not offer enough flexibility. In such cases, you can define your own menu items:

```ts
const contextMenu = new ContextMenuPlugin<Schemes>({
  items(context, plugin) {
    if (context === 'root') {
      return {
        searchBar: false,
        list: [
          { label: 'Custom', key: '1', handler: () => console.log('Custom') },
          {
            label: 'Collection', key: '1', handler: () => null,
            subitems: [
              { label: 'Subitem', key: '1', handler: () => console.log('Subitem') }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    return {
      searchBar: false,
      list: []
    }
  }
})
```

where `context` is `'root'`, node instance or connection instance

## Open the menu programmatically #{trigger-context-menu}

To manually open the context menu, you need to create a `PointerEvent` with the required coordinates and call the `area.emit()` method:

```ts
const event = new PointerEvent('contextmenu', {
  clientX: x,
  clientY: y,
})

await area.emit({ type: 'contextmenu', data: { event, context } })
```

where

- `x`, `y` are numerical values (for example, the cursor coordinates, which you should extract separately),
- `context` can be `'root'` or an instance of a node, connection, or other elements in your editor.

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { ReadonlyPlugin } from "rete-readonly-plugin";

const readonly = new ReadonlyPlugin<Schemes>();

editor.use(readonly.root);
editor.use(area);
area.use(readonly.area);
area.use(render);
```

Make sure to follow the order to connect `readonly.root` and `readonly.area` before any other plugins.

## Enable

The plugin allows modifications to the editor by default, giving you the ability to establish the editor's initial appearance using methods such as `addNode`.

Use the following code to activate it:

```ts
readonly.enable();
```

## Disable

Disabling can be done in a similar way:

```ts
readonly.disable();
```

## Controls

When referring to the in-built controls provided by the framework, like `ClassicPreset.InputControl`, it's important to specify the readonly feature individually in the below manner:

```ts
new ClassicPreset.InputControl('text', { readonly: true })
```

Since other controls can be custom, it is up to the developer to implement their "read-only" capability.

## Disable connection manipulation

Finally, if you have completed the [Basic](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic) guide, make sure to remove the `ConnectionPlugin` import.

```ts
area.use(connection); // should be removed
```

# Modules

This guide outlines the key aspects of building **Module** nodes that process nested graphs, considering the available **Input** and **Output** nodes.

This guide exclusively relies on [Dataflow](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/processing/dataflow) approach to streamline code comprehension. Once you have gone through this guide and the example provided, you should be able to implement Control flow using the instructions in the [Control flow](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/processing/control-flow) guide.

## Prepare nodes

The core idea behind modules is to create distinct graphs featuring **Input** and **Output** nodes. The next step is to create a dedicated **Module** node that reflects the ports based on the nodes of the relevant type specified in the graph.

To begin, let's create a node that will serve as our input point:

```ts
export class InputNode extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  public value = null;

  constructor(public key: string) {
    super("Input");

    this.addOutput("value", new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, "Number"));
  }

  data() {
    return { value: this.value };
  }
}
```

The user-defined `key` is crucial to associate it with the input port of **Module** node. Also, we need to specify `value` property to inject the input data.

In order for a module to have any use, an **Output** node is necessary

```ts
export class OutputNode extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  constructor(public key: string) {
    super("Output");

    this.addInput("value", new ClassicPreset.Input(socket, "Number"));
  }

  data() {
    return {};
  }
}
```

In this instance, `data` method returns an empty object as the input data can be obtained through the `fetchInputs` method without the node's execution being necessary.

The **Module** node, which serves as a portal into a nested graph and displays input and output ports, is the most complex node. Let's look at a simplified example:

```ts
export class ModuleNode {
  module: null | Module<Schemes> = null;

  constructor(path: string) {
    super("Module");

    this.setModule(path);
  }

  public async setModule(path: string) {
    this.module = findModule(path);

    await removeNodeConnections(this.id);

    if (this.module) {
      const { inputs, outputs } = this.module.getPorts();

      syncPorts(this, inputs, outputs);
    } else {
      syncPorts(this, [], []);
    }
  }

  async data(inputs: Record<string, any>) {
    const data = await this.module?.exec(inputs);

    return data || {};
  }
}
```

where

- `findModule` function returns an object representing a module, allowing access to its ports for display and the execution of a nested graph
- `syncPorts` updates input and output ports by removing outdated ones and adding new ones
- `removeNodeConnections` function deletes all connections, allowing us to remove ports if we need to switch modules

Keep in mind that making any dynamic changes to nodes, as seen in this example with `syncPorts`, requires calling `area.update('node', node.id)`.

To prevent conflicting calls from multiple **Module** nodes using the same nested graph, make sure to initialize a new editor and engine within the `module.exec` method.

## Nested graph execution

Here's a simplified example of how a nested graph processor can be implemented:

```ts
function findModule(path: string) {
  return {
    getPorts() {
      const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();

      await importGraphByPath(path, editor);

      const nodes = editor.getNodes();
      const inputs = nodes
        .filter((n): n is InputNode => n instanceof InputNode)
        .map((n) => n.key);
      const outputs = nodes
        .filter((n): n is OutputNode => n instanceof OutputNode)
        .map((n) => n.key);

      return {
        inputs,
        outputs
      };
    },
    exec: async (inputData: Record<string, any>) => {
      const engine = new DataflowEngine<Schemes>();
      const editor = new NodeEditor<Schemes>();

      editor.use(engine);

      await importGraphByPath(path, editor);

      const nodes = editor.getNodes();

      injectInputs(nodes, inputData);

      return retrieveOutputs(nodes, engine);
    }
  };
```

where

- `getPorts` retrieves the keys for both **Input** and **Output** nodes and returns them
- `importGraphByPath` is supposed to load the essential nodes and connections for your module into the editor

Each call creates a new instance of the editor to avoid conflicts when processing the graph.

The following method involves injecting the input data of the **Module** node into the **Input** nodes of the nested graph.

```ts
function injectInputs(nodes: Schemes["Node"][], inputData: Record<string, any>) {
    const inputNodes = nodes.filter(node => node instanceof InputNode);

    inputNodes.forEach((node) => {
      // keep in mind that there may be no input connections, and we assume there's a maximum of one connection possible
      node.value = inputData[node.key] && inputData[node.key][0];
    });
  }
```

Once the input data has been injected, the next step is to retrieve the output from the nodes:

```ts
async function retrieveOutputs(nodes: Schemes["Node"][], engine: DataflowEngine<Schemes>) {
  const outputNodes = nodes.filter(node => node instanceof OutputNode);

 // can be processed concurrently
  const outputs = await Promise.all(outputNodes.map(async node => {
    const data = await engine.fetchInputs(node.id);

    // we consider only the data from the first connection as there can be at most one input connection
    return [node.key, data.value[0]] as const;
  }));

  return Object.fromEntries(outputs);
}
```

# Scopes

::alert
This guide is based on the [Basic](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic) guide. It is recommended to review it for a comprehensive understanding of this guide.
::

::references
  :::ref-example{link="/examples/scopes" title="Scopes"}

  :::

  :::ref-github{link="https://github.com/retejs/scopes-plugin" title="Plugin"}
  :::
::

The `rete-scopes-plugin` plugin provides features for building a node editor with nested nodes, also known as a subgraph. This plugin is categorized as [advanced](https://retejs.org/docs/licensing).

This approach involves using nodes as parent elements for other nodes. This enables the movement of a parent node to trigger the movement of all of its child nodes, and the movement of child nodes to adjust the size of their parent nodes. The nesting can extend to more than one level.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-scopes-plugin
```

## Prepare nodes

The plugin requires node sizes to be explicitly specified:

```ts
class Node extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  width = 190;
  height = 120;
  parent?: string
}
class Connection<N extends Node> extends ClassicPreset.Connection<N, N> {}

type Schemes = GetSchemes<Node, Connection<Node>>;
```

The purpose of this is to enable dynamic resizing of the node's sizes if it has nested nodes.

Additionally, it's suggested to specify an optional `parent` field to programmatically designate parent nodes.

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { ScopesPlugin, Presets as ScopesPresets } from 'rete-scopes-plugin'

const scopes = new ScopesPlugin<Schemes>()

scopes.addPreset(ScopesPresets.classic.setup())

area.use(scopes)
```

This code relies on a classic preset that offers functionality for user-scope interactions. To select a node and assign it as a parent, the user may long-press the node and drag it over another node.

## Adding nodes

Let's add a couple of nodes, with one serving as a parent:

```ts
const node1 = new Node('A');
const parent1 = new Node('Parent');

node1.parent = parent1.id; // specify node1 as nested into parent1

await editor.addNode(parent1); // make sure to add the parent node before adding its child
await editor.addNode(node1);
```

## Nodes order

Bu default, the plugin is set up to use its own node ordering. If you followed the [Basic](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/basic) guide, you need to remove `AreaExtensions.simpleNodesOrder`

```ts
AreaExtensions.simpleNodesOrder(area);
```

The ordering of nested nodes is a bit different as parent nodes shouldn't overlap its child nodes. When bringing node to front or adding child nodes to it, the order of child nodes is adapted (by `reordered` event)

## Arrange nodes

The same [Arrange nodes](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/arrange) guide can be used for automated positioning of nodes in relation to one another, as the plugin used within also supports nested nodes.

## Dynamically changing relationships

After the nodes have been added to the editor, to change the bindings between nodes, in addition to changing `node.parent` you need to explicitly call the update method

```ts
// previously parent1.id was assigned
node1.parent = undefined;
await scopes.update(parent1.id)
```

## Change the parent node padding

By default, all nodes have the same padding. You can find these values in [the API documentation](https://retejs.org/docs/api/rete-scopes-plugin#props). The padding can be customized for each node individually using the `padding` option.

```ts
const scopes = new ScopesPlugin<Schemes>({
  padding: nodeId => ({ top: 40, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20 })
});
```

## Excluding nodes

The `exclude` option allows you to exclude specific nodes from being processed by the plugin. This can be useful when you want certain nodes not to affect the size of the parent node.

```ts
const scopes = new ScopesPlugin<Schemes>({
  exclude: nodeId => excludedNodes.includes(nodeId)
});
```

## Changing parent node size

The generated sizes of parent nodes can be customized for specific nodes using the `size` option. This functionality is useful, for example, when child nodes have been removed, and you need to set a new size to display the layout correctly.

```ts
const scopes = new ScopesPlugin<Schemes>({
  size: (nodeId, size) => ({ width: size.width, height: 100 })
});
```

# Import/export

Out of the box, the editor can handle any JS objects as nodes and connections, as long as they include a mandatory `id` field for both. Additionally, connections must have `source` and `target` fields. These objects can be either plain data objects or objects that include methods. Check out the [Data structures](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/data-structures) guide for details.

The current version of the editor doesn't support importing/exporting by default due to some limitations:

- The process of serializing nodes/connections to JSON can be challenging
- The import order of nodes may vary depending on how your graph is structured

## Valid JSON objects

Suppose we have a straightforward example where the node is a valid JSON object

```ts
import { NodeEditor, BaseSchemes, getUID } from 'rete'

const editor = new NodeEditor<BaseSchemes>()

const node = { id: getUID(), label: 'Label' }

await editor.addNode(node)
```

In this case, we can easily export such nodes into JSON to save them in a database, for instance.

## Non-valid JSON objects

Objects that aren't valid JSON, such as instances of classes, objects with functions, or objects with cyclic references pose a challenge. Discarding them would mean losing the advantages that come with using JS.

For instance, node classes can be used to create nodes, allowing for more reliable and convenient interaction through methods, and providing the flexibility to use different paradigms.

```ts
import { ClassicPreset } from 'rete'

const node = new ClassicPreset.Node('Label')

node.addOutput('port', new ClassicPreset.Output(socket, 'Label'))

await editor.addNode(node)
```

While serialization and deserialization might be one way to convert such objects into valid JSON, this approach may not work in complex scenarios.

## Exporting and importing nodes

If you want to export a graph, you can use the following code as a reference. Please note that this is not a fully functional code, but rather an approximation to help you implement your own import/export functionality according to your specific requirements.

```ts
const data = { nodes: [] }
const nodes = editor.getNodes()

for (const node of nodes) {
  data.nodes.push({
    id: node.id,
    label: node.label,
    inputs: /// ....
    controls: /// ....
    outputs: /// ....
  })
}
```

In order to revert the transformation, we must initialize node instances, inputs, outputs, and controls based on the objects provided.

```ts
for (const { id, label, inputs, outputs, controls } of data.nodes) {
  const node = new ClassicPreset.Node(label);

  node.id = id;

  /// ... inputs
  /// ... controls
  /// ... outputs

  await editor.addNode(node)
}
```

The complete example can be found [at the link](https://codesandbox.io/s/rete-js-v2-import-export-999y8z?file=/src/index.ts:3276-3465){rel="nofollow"}. Note that this example has been simplified for ease of understanding.

Additionally, importing or exporting inputs and outputs may not always be necessary if they are static and we know the node type. In such cases, we can simply save the node name and relevant data, which can be used to create instances of nodes with pre-defined ports. Check out the [3D Configurator](https://retejs.org/examples/3d-configurator) and the [Modules](https://retejs.org/examples/modules) examples with implementation of this approach.

## Import nodes order

Another challenge during graph import could be the order in which nodes need to be imported. In a simple cases, the order will be the same as the order in which they were added to the editor.

```ts
const graph = /// loaded JSON-valid object from DB

for (const node of graph.nodes) {
  await editor.addNode(node)
}
```

When dealing with more complex graphs, the order of adding nodes can vary. For instance, in a graph with nested nodes, it might be necessary to add parent nodes prior to child nodes. Moreover, it's quite possible that a user may create a child node before its parent node while working in the editor.

Let's take a look at an example of importing a graph where certain nodes have `parent` field indicating their association with another node. As a result, these nodes must be imported after their parent node has been created.

```ts
async function importForParent(nodes, parent = undefined) {
  const nodes = nodes.filter(node => node.parent === parent)

  for (const node of nodes) {
    await editor.addNode(node)
    await importForParent(nodes, node.id)
  }
}

const graph = /// loaded JSON-valid object from DB

await importForParent(graph.nodes)
```

Since this approach is more complex and there are multiple ways to do it, the import method will vary depending on your specific use case.


# Validation

::references
  :::ref-example{link="/examples/chatbot" title="Chatbot"}
  :::
::

The framework provides a flexible plugin and message system, which enables you to extend the functionality of various components and manage their behavior. This can be achieved by using pipes for specific message types.

## Nodes validation

Validation will be implemented for adding nodes, where nodes of a certain type will be prevented until the starting node is added

```ts
editor.addPipe(context => {
  if (context.type === 'nodecreate') {
    if (context.data instanceof EndNode) {
      const hasBeginNode = editor.getNodes().some(n => n instanceof BeginNode)

      if (!hasBeginNode) {
        alert('cannot add EndNode until BeginNode is added')
        return
      }
    }
  }
  return context
})
```

where `EndNode` and `BeginNode` are classes that extend `ClassicPreset.Node`.

This particular case utilized a method of preventing message propagation by specifying `return` with no value. This technique is appropriate for types like `nodecreate`, `noderemove`, `connectioncreate` and `connectionremove`.

## Connections validation

The same principle can be used to prevent messages of `connectioncreate` type.

```ts
editor.addPipe((context) => {
  if (context.type === "connectioncreate") {
    if (!canCreateConnection(editor, context.data)) {
      alert("Sockets are not compatible");
      return;
    }
  }
  return context;
});
```

where `canCreateConnection` is any function that takes a connection instance `context.data` and returns a boolean.

Let's take the [Chatbot](https://retejs.org/examples/chatbot) example, particularly the modules `chatbot/utils.ts` and `chatbot/sockets.ts`, and apply the same approach to our `canCreateConnection` function. First, we'll implement advanced sockets:

```ts
import { ClassicPreset } from "rete";

export class ActionSocket extends ClassicPreset.Socket {
  constructor() {
    super("Action");
  }

  isCompatibleWith(socket: ClassicPreset.Socket) {
    return socket instanceof ActionSocket;
  }
}

export class TextSocket extends ClassicPreset.Socket {
  constructor() {
    super("Text");
  }

  isCompatibleWith(socket: ClassicPreset.Socket) {
    return socket instanceof TextSocket;
  }
}
```

by using `isCompatibleWith` method, socket types are able to specify which other socket types they are compatible.

After that, we will implement our function which takes a connection as an argument, returns the corresponding sockets from the nodes, and checks them for compatibility.

```ts
export function canCreateConnection(editor: NodeEditor<Schemes>, connection: Schemes["Connection"]) {
  const { source, target } = getConnectionSockets(editor, connection);

  return source && target && source.isCompatibleWith(target)
}
```

where `getConnectionSockets` function was taken from the aforementioned example.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-minimap-plugin
```

## Prepare nodes

Predefined node sizes are necessary for the minimap plugin as they are displayed on the minimap with their respective dimensions.

```ts
class Node extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  width = 190;
  height = 120;
}
class Connection<N extends Node> extends ClassicPreset.Connection<N, N> {}

type Schemes = GetSchemes<Node, Connection<Node>>;
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { MinimapExtra, MinimapPlugin } from "rete-minimap-plugin";

type AreaExtra =
  // ...
  | MinimapExtra

const minimap = new MinimapPlugin<Schemes>()();

area.use(minimap);
```

But this is not sufficient as the render plugin is responsible for visualization

## Rendering the minimap

Currently, the visualization of the minimap is possible using rendering plugins for **React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte** and **Lit**.

```ts
import { Presets } from "rete-react-plugin"; // or  rete-vue-plugin, rete-angular-plugin, rete-svelte-plugin, @retejs/lit-plugin

render.addPreset(Presets.minimap.setup({ size: 200 }));
```

For a comprehensive guide on how to connect a specific renderer plugin to your stack version, please follow the guide for
[React.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue), [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte) or [Lit](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/lit)

The minimap is automatically inserted into your editor and has absolute positioning. If your editor is smaller than the viewport, your editor's container should have `position: relative`.

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-dock-plugin
```

## Plugin connection

Currently, the only preset available is the classic preset, which enables adding nodes to the editor by dragging their previews into the editor area.

```ts
import { DockPlugin, DockPresets } from "rete-dock-plugin";

const dock = new DockPlugin<Schemes>();

dock.addPreset(DockPresets.classic.setup({ area, size: 100, scale: 0.6 }));

area.use(dock);
```

## Adding nodes

In order to display node previews, you need to specify a function that returns a node instance. This function is called when a node is added to the Dock menu or dragged onto the editor area.

```ts
dock.add(() => new NodeA());
dock.add(() => new NodeB());
```

## Add at a specific position

Inserting a node at the 3rd position (2nd index)

```ts
dock.add(() => new NodeA(), 2);
```

## Remove nodes

Use the same function passed to `add` to remove the added node

```ts
const createNodeA = () => new NodeA()


dock.add(createNodeA);
dock.remove(createNodeA);
```

const pathPlugin = new ConnectionPathPlugin<Schemes, Area2D<Schemes>>({
  curve: () => curveStep
});

render.use(pathPlugin);
```

## Connection-specific path

The `curve` option takes a callback function with the connection instance as the first parameter, allowing you to customize the path type.

```ts
import { curveStep, curveMonotoneX, curveLinear, CurveFactory } from "d3-shape";

class Connection extends ClassicPreset.Connection<
  ClassicPreset.Node,
  ClassicPreset.Node
> {
  curve?: CurveFactory;
}

const pathPlugin = new ConnectionPathPlugin<Schemes, Area2D<Schemes>>({
  curve: (connection) => connection.curve || curveStep
});

const monotoneConnection = new Connection(a, "port", b, "port");
const linearConnection = new Connection(a, "port", b, "port");

monotoneConnection.curve = curveMonotoneX;
linearConnection.curve = curveLinear;
```

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-connection-reroute-plugin
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { ReroutePlugin, RerouteExtra } from "rete-connection-reroute-plugin";

type AreaExtra =
  | Area2D<Schemes> // this type is mandatory
  | ReactArea2D<Schemes>
  | RerouteExtra;

const reroutePlugin = new ReroutePlugin<Schemes>();

render.use(reroutePlugin)
```

The plugin is connected, but you need also connect a visualization preset to render the pins

## Rendering

Currently, the visualization of the reroute pins is possible using rendering plugins for **React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte** and **Lit**.

```ts
import { Presets } from "rete-react-plugin"; // or  rete-vue-plugin, rete-angular-plugin, rete-svelte-plugin, @retejs/lit-plugin

render.addPreset(Presets.reroute.setup({
  contextMenu(id) {
    reroutePlugin.remove(id);
  },
  translate(id, dx, dy) {
    reroutePlugin.translate(id, dx, dy);
  }
}));
```

For a comprehensive guide on how to connect a specific renderer plugin to your stack version, please follow the guide for
[React.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue), [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte) or [Lit](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/lit)

## Selectable Pins

As explained in the [Selectable](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/selectable) guide, you can adjust the selection of all types of elements.

The following code must be used to incorporate pins to the selection system:

```ts
import { RerouteExtensions } from "rete-connection-reroute-plugin";

const selector = AreaExtensions.selector();
const accumulating = AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl();

AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, selector, { accumulating });
RerouteExtensions.selectablePins(reroutePlugin, selector, accumulating);

render.addPreset(Presets.reroute.setup({
  pointerdown(id) {
    reroutePlugin.unselect(id);
    reroutePlugin.select(id);
  },
  // keep contextMenu and translate from the code above
}));

```

where

- `RerouteExtensions.selectablePins` is a compact extension that adds or removes pins to/from the registry of selected elements, and enables their movement.
- `pointerdown` event is triggered upon clicking a pin and designates it as the selected pin

# Undo/Redo

  :::

  :::ref-github{link="https://github.com/retejs/history-plugin" title="Plugin"}
  :::
::

## Install dependencies

::kit
::

```bash
npm i rete-history-plugin
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { HistoryPlugin, HistoryActions } from "rete-history-plugin";

const history = new HistoryPlugin<Schemes, HistoryActions<Schemes>>();

area.use(history);
```

## Classic preset

Similar to the majority of plugins, it relies on a preset to unlock its complete functionality.

```ts
import { Presets } from "rete-history-plugin";

history.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup())
```

It is responsible for tracking the history of adding, removing, or translating nodes, as well as tracking the adding and removing of connections.

## Usage

The plugin doesn't track user actions by default, such as keyboard shortcuts. To enable user interaction, you can implement usage of `undo`/`redo` methods on your own

```ts
await history.undo()
await history.redo()
```

Alternatively, you can use the default extension that tracks the `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` shortcuts

```ts
import { HistoryExtensions } from "rete-history-plugin";

HistoryExtensions.keyboard(history);
```

## History management

If you need additional functionality beyond node and connection tracking, you have the option to create custom actions and add them to the history

```ts
class MyAction implements HistoryAction {
  undo(): void | Promise<void> {
    // undo action
  }
  redo(): void | Promise<void> {
    // redo action
  }
}

const history = new HistoryPlugin<Schemes, HistoryActions<Schemes> | MyAction>();

const myAction = new MyAction()

history.add(myAction)
```

To retrieve a history list, use the `getHistorySnapshot` or `getRecent` methods (please note that modifying the history directly is not possible)

```ts
const list = history.getHistorySnapshot()
const recentFor1s = history.getRecent(1000)
```

By using the latest method, we retrieve a list of actions within the past second. Since these actions are time-dependent, the plugin can intelligently group them together, reducing the need for users to repeatedly press 'Ctrl + Z' when multiple actions occur within a short time frame. This is particularly useful when a user deletes a node, triggering the automatic removal of its associated connections.

Additionally, you can configure the timing as follows, where `200` is the default time threshold in milliseconds. If the time interval between adjacent actions is shorter than the specified time, the plugin will consider them to be part of the same group.

```ts
const history = new HistoryPlugin<Schemes>({ timing: 200 });
```

In order to make the undo or redo process independent of time constraints between actions, you can adopt the following method:

```ts
// action 1
// action 2
history.separate() // or myAction.separated = true
// action 3
```

In this way, when the `undo` command is triggered for the first time, it will only undo the third action, even the time interval between it and the preceding action is less than 200 milliseconds.

type Schemes = GetSchemes<Node, Connection<Node>>;
```

## Plugin connection

```ts
import { CommentPlugin } from "rete-comment-plugin";

const comment = new CommentPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>();

area.use(comment);
```

## Add comments programmatically

Adding an inline comment

```ts
comment.addInline("Inline comment text", [360, -20], node.dd);
```

where `[360, -20]` is the position of the comment, which can be placed freely in relation to the `node` it is attached to.

Adding a frame comment

```ts
comment.addFrame("Frame comment text", [node.id]);
```

where `[node.id]` refers to the nodes that are covered by this comment

## Selectable comments

```ts
import { CommentExtensions } from "rete-comment-plugin";

const selector = AreaExtensions.selector();
const accumulating = AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl();

CommentExtensions.selectable(comment, selector, accumulating);
```

## Edit comment text

The comment text can be edited by RMB. By default, a prompt with an input field will be displayed, but you can customize this.

```ts
const comment = new CommentPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({
  edit: async (comment) => {
    return prompt('Edit comment', comment.text)
  }
});
```

where the `edit` property must accept an asynchronous function that returns the text for the comment.

In client applications, you may frequently encounter two issues: resource-intensive operations and low FPS. The former is caused by synchronous operations such as executing resource-intensive JS code or some browser APIs that block the main thread. The latter is often attributed to the direct rendering of elements by the browser - the more complex and numerous they are, the more time it takes for the browser to create the layout and render them.

In the context of this framework, the following approaches can be adopted to minimize the impact of the aforementioned issues:

## Connect plugins only when needed

In the case of transforming a graph where intermediate results aren't visualized, it may be unnecessary to connect additional plugins. Instead, copy the transformed result to a new editor that already has all required plugins connected.

## Simplifying nodes at a specific zoom level

This technique is particularly useful when visualizing a large number of nodes. In such cases, the bottleneck is typically the browser's rendering of elements when all nodes are visible in the viewport

Usually, if many nodes are displayed in the viewport, the zoom level is quite low and each node occupies a relatively small area. Consequently, these nodes can be replaced with content-free rectangles of the same size, reducing the cost of rendering while maintaining a good UX

The LOD (Level of Detail) technique, commonly used in 3D visualization, can also be applied here. Check out the [LOD](https://retejs.org/examples/lod) example.


# Quality assurance

  :::ref-external{link="https://playwright.dev/" title="Playwright"}
  :::
::

There are two kinds of tests in this project - unit and E2E

Unit tests are used to test individual modules within a package. While this approach is fast, it doesn't guarantee that the entire product functions correctly from a user's perspective.

On the other hand, E2E tests enable comprehensive testing of the product from the user's point of view. We rely on **Playwright** for E2E testing, which is integrated into `rete-qa` package and comes equipped with a set of UI tests for basic framework features.

Guidelines for writing tests:

- **keep it simple**: create tests that are easy to write and read
- **don't focus too much on code coverage metrics**: use them as reference but avoid drawing conclusions solely based on test coverage %
- **test one thing at a time**: this will help you locate issues more easily
- **cover edge cases**: ensures reliability of tests

## Rete QA tool

The main purpose of this tool is to conduct regression UI testing on different combinations of supported features, which are presented as individual packages and various integrations with UI frameworks.

::diagram{caption="Architecture" name="qa/index"}
::

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev){rel="nofollow"} serves as the underlying technology for this testing tool and enables it to conduct tests in three different browser types: **Chromium**, **Firefox**, **WebKit**.

Additionally, we test our framework on various versions of commonly used UI frameworks, such as Angular, Svelte, Vue.js, and React.js. This gives us **51** test runs across different environments as we have a matrix of browsers and framework versions

::rete-qa-sheet{:browsers="browsers" :stacks="stacks" title="Browser \ Stack"}
::

### Installation

```bash
npm i -g rete-qa
```

Don't forget to install the additional system dependencies as per the [Playwright's instructions](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#introduction){rel="nofollow"}.

### Initialization

Run the command and wait until the projects are generated for various frameworks and their dependencies are installed

```bash
rete-qa init --deps-alias dependencies.json
```

where `dependencies.json` (optional) is a JSON file, which should contain a mapping of dependencies

Dependencies are typically installed from npmjs using `latest` tag, but you can specify a different version by providing `name@version` or path to the tarball. For example, you can substitute a plugin with your own version of the plugin that has not yet been published

```json
{
  "my-rete-plugin": "../my-plugin/my-rete-plugin-1.0.0.tgz"
}
```

### Run tests

Run the tests for provided stacks (**React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte**) and different browsers (**Chromium**, **Firefox**, **WebKit**)

```bash
rete-qa test
```


# Development

This documentation article is for developers who are looking to develop new plugins, improve existing ones, or debug them.

## Rete CLI

Rete CLI is a development tool that includes TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest for plugin building without the need for environment setup. It uses Rollup for building and has pre-configured Babel presets for TypeScript support.

Check out the [Rete CLI](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-cli) article for details.

## Rete Kit

This tool aims to enhance efficiency during plugin or project development using the framework. It provides several features, such as instant plugin structure creation, project creation and batch build for dependencies.

Check out the [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit) article for details.

## Style guide

ESLint is used to ensure code style consistency across all packages. The configuration is provided by [Rete CLI](https://retejs.org/#rete-cli) and comprises rules that are deemed more suitable by the maintainers. If necessary, you can customize the configuration by adding required rules

Although linters are helpful, there are some cases they may miss. To supplement this, we have included a list of recommendations:

- **Use comment with purpose**: prioritize refactoring your code to be more clear and concise before relying on comments to explain it
- **Simplicity**: strive for a balance between code reuse and the amount of boilerplate code. While boilerplate code may seem redundant, it is often more appropriate than overly complicated solutions that can obscure the code's purpose
- **Handling errors and exceptions**: always handle errors and exceptions properly, providing users with useful information about the issue. Ensure that any exceptions thrown do not hinder the application's performance and are gracefully handled whenever possible
- **Performance**: the code should be optimized to ensure there are no significant freezes with large data sets, but it's equally important to maintain code readability and ease of maintenance rather than focusing solely on micro-optimizations

Rete CLI is a building tool with built-in support for TypeScript and ESLint along with predefined rules. Additionally, it includes Jest. These features make it simple to start building new plugins without having to setup your own environment for building, linting, and testing.

The build feature is based on Rollup and comes with pre-configured Babel presets for TypeScript support.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g rete-cli
```

## Building the project

The first step is to create a configuration file called `rete.config.ts`

```ts
import { ReteOptions } from 'rete-cli'

export default<ReteOptions>{
  input: 'src/index.ts', // path to entry script
  name: 'Namespace' // namespace for UMD bundles
}
```

Run the command

```bash
rete build --config rete.config.ts
```

The generated `dist` directory is publish-ready and includes all required bundles, type definitions, README.md, and package.json files with their corresponding paths.

The `--watch` option can be used to trigger automatic project building upon save, while the `--outputs` option allows you to specify multiple output paths separated by commas for the build destination.

## Create an advanced configuration

Let's take a look at several configuration options that are supported:

- connect Rollup plugins
- specify third-party dependencies that shouldn't be bundled
- specify output path
- connect Babel plugins and presets

```ts
import { ReteOptions } from 'rete-cli'

export default <ReteOptions>[ // config with multiple entries
  {
    input: 'src/foo/index.ts',
    name: 'Namespace'
    babel: {
      presets: [
        require('@babel/preset-env'), // used by default, but should be declared when you specifies 'presets'
        require('@babel/preset-typescript'), // used by default
        require('@babel/preset-react'),
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    input: 'src/bar/index.ts',
    name: 'Namespace'
    globals: {
      'rete': 'Rete',
    },
    plugins: [ // specify Rollup plugins
      commonjs(),
    ],
    babel: {
      plugins: [
        // include Babel plugins
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

## Linting

By default, running `rete build` command includes a linting step prior to generating the bundles. However, you can also perform linting independently by running a separate command.

```bash
rete lint
```

The purpose of this tool is to improve efficiency when developing plugins or projects using this framework.

It offers the following features:

- **Plugin creating**: use this feature to create a basic plugin structure instantly, without the need for setting up a build system, linter, or test runner
- **Application creation**: choose the framework to build your application, specify the version and desired features and get a ready-to-use application to jumpstart your development process
- **Batch build**: select copies of repositories containing the source code of the plugins being developed and this tool will start building them in a watch mode, as well as synchronizing their dependencies

## Install

```bash
npm i -g rete-kit
```

## Create an application

Inquirer mode

```bash
rete-kit app
```

Or, you can specify the options

```bash
rete-kit app --name <name> --stack <stack> --stack-version <version> --features <features> --deps-alias <deps-alias>
```

where

- `<stack>` option lets you choose `angular`, `vue`, `vue-vite`, `react`, `react-vite`, `svelte`, `lit-vite`, `vite`, `next` or `nuxt`
- `<features>` is a comma-separated list of the Rete.js editor features
- `<deps-alias>` is a JSON file that maps dependencies. By default, it installs the latest version from npmjs, but you can specify a different version using the format `name@version` or a path to the tarball

Additionally, re-executing the command with the same `name`, `stack`, and `stack-version` options enables you to apply supplementary features without having to recreate the application.

After completion, you will have a directory with an application that can usually be started using the command `npm run start` (depending on the stack). When opening the application, you can to specifying a query parameter `template` in the URL with the following values:

- `default`: default, a classic graph with dataflow example
- `perf`: a graph with a large number of nodes, which can be adjusted using `cols` and `rows` parameters
- `customization`: custom nodes and connections specific for each render plugin
- `3d`: three.js-based scene with an integrated editor using [`rete-area-3d-plugin`](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/3d).

For instance, an Angular customization template can be available at <http://localhost:4200/?template=customization>{rel="nofollow"}.

## Plugin creation

You can easily create a plugin within your codebase by following the example of other plugins and extending `Scope`, without the need to build it as a separate package.

In case you want to develop a plugin as a separate package, use this command:

```bash
rete-kit plugin --name <plugin name>
```

where `<plugin name>` is a string that will be transformed into different formats and used in the templates, such as `rete.config.ts` and the `package.json` name.

The generated plugin includes all the essential configs, allowing you to start working with the source code immediately.

## Building dependencies for development

Developing modules that are separated into different packages is a challenging process. In contrast to a single codebase where the build system can detect changes in the directory and apply hot reload, developers need to manually set up the build of each dependency they work on and insert the changes into the project.

Basically, `npm link` and a bash scripts can be used to build required modules in watch mode. However, `npm link` has certain limitations that might not be immediately noticeable. These limitations can stem from the shared dependencies of the project and the dependencies we're working on.

The `rete-kit build` command was created to address such issues. It has two modes:

- **building all project dependencies**: specify your project's path. The tool scans the current directory recursively (up to two levels deep) for repositories that contain the `rete` dependency. In the watch mode, it directly builds them into the `node_modules` directory where they are used

```bash
rete-kit build --for ./my-project
```

- **performing a build of specific directories**: specify the directories containing the source code for dependencies that should be included during the build process using `--folders` option. Similar to the first mode, the resulting build will be inserted into the `node_modules` directory of the target

```bash
rete-kit build --folders my-plugin-1,my-plugin-1,my-project
```

Please note that to use the hot reload feature to its fullest, you will need to disable the cache for the relevant dependencies. Otherwise, any changes made will not be applied on the fly. To accomplish this in Webpack, you can specify `snapshot.managedPaths`. If the project still doesn't update, it may be necessary to manually clear the cache of compiled modules.


# Troubleshooting

## Check the documentation

First, take a look at the framework documentation. Frequently, common problems are addressed in the documentation, and you may find a solution to your problem by utilizing the search function on the website or documentation

## Explore community resources

When the documentation falls short, explore community resources. Search for answers on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/cxSFkPZdsV){rel="nofollow"} and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aretejs\&type=issues){rel="nofollow"}

## Check your dependencies

Ensure that you're using the latest package versions. Updates frequently include bug fixes and enhancements that can potentially resolve the problem at hand.

Additionally, ensure that dependencies use their peer dependencies correctly. Avoid situations where your application is using multiple copies of the same dependency (for example, via `npm link`), which may lead to incorrect behavior of operators such as `instanceof`.

## Debugging

Leverage your browser's devtools to debug the issue. The console is an effective tool for diagnosing errors, warnings, and other issues. Additionally, you can take advantage of breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, or logpoints to facilitate the debugging process. In case of extreme difficulty, you can clone the repository, make modifications for debugging purposes, and build it in development mode for your project using the [Rete CLI](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-cli)

## Reproduce the issue

Build a minimal example that reproduces the problem you're facing. This can assist in identifying the issue's origin. External factors may frequently be the cause of the problem, since JS allows you to delve into implementation details and patch them

## Ask for help

If you have followed all the preceding steps and are still unable to find a solution, don't hesitate to seek help from the community. Make sure to include a live example that reproduces the problem or your attempts to achieve the desired outcome.


# Licensing

The MIT license applied to most framework packages permits you to use them without any limitations in personal and commercial projects alike.

Certain plugins are classified as advanced and currently have only a CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license. These include:

- [rete-structures](https://github.com/retejs/structures){rel="nofollow"}
- [rete-scopes-plugin](https://github.com/retejs/scopes-plugin){rel="nofollow"}

They plugins are freely available for use in personal, non-commercial projects. Commercial use is currently not permitted due to the absence of a dual licensing model. However, as this functionality isn't primary, you are free to utilize other available features of the framework and develop additional custom solution.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us at <info@retejs.org>

When making changes to the code, keep in mind any potential breaking changes and try to use plugins to extend functionality whenever possible instead of modifying the existing code. This approach aligns with the project architecture's goal of minimizing the need for core code changes.

Check out the [Development](https://retejs.org/docs/development) page for a more in-depth guide on developing plugins.

      },
      move: () => true
    }))
  ```
  :::

  :::qa{question="How can I retrieve the position of a node?"}
  The position is stored within a `NodeView` instance.
  
  ```ts
    const view = area.nodeViews.get(nodeId)
  
    if (view) {
      view.position // { x, y }
    }
  ```
  
  Keep in mind that the `NodeView` instance may not exist, for example if it hasn't yet been added. In such cases, it's preferable to handle this gracefully (throw an exception only when necessary)

  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: prevent-node-movement-on-control
  question: Is there way to prevent nodes from being moved while interacting with controls?
  ---
  You need to stop propagation of the `pointerdown` event.
  
  Check the relevant render plugin guide for controls: [React.js](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/react#controls), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/vue#controls), [Angular](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/angular#controls), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/svelte#controls), [Lit](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/lit#controls)
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: click-event-doesnt-work-on-control
  question: Why doesn't the control capture click/pointer events?
  ---
  By default, the area captures these events, so you need to stop the propagation of `pointerdown` event to prevent this
  
  Check the relevant render plugin guide for controls: [React.js](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/react#controls), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/vue#controls), [Angular](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/angular#controls), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/svelte#controls), [Lit](https://retejs.org/guides/renderers/lit#controls)
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: user-select
  question: Is there a way to make the text within a node selectable?
  ---
  By default, a node is configured with the CSS property `user-select: none` to prevent conflict between text selection and node dragging.
  
  Therefore, to enable text selection within a custom node component, you need to specify `user-select: all` property for the desired element within the node. Additionally, ensure you call `e.stopPropagation()` on the \`pointerdown\`\` event to prevent text selection interruptions while dragging.
  :::

  :::qa{#nodepicked question="How to detect click on the node?"}
  Whenever a user clicks on the node, the `nodepicked` event is fired:
  
  ```ts
  area.addPipe(context => {
    if (context.type === 'nodepicked') {
      const node = editor.getNode(context.data.id)
  
    }
    return context
  })
  ```
  
  In case you need to track not only click, but also node selections, you have the option [to extend the selector](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/selectable#extend-selector) to observe selected elements (not just nodes) within the editor
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: add-inputs-outputs-controls-dynamically
  question: How to add inputs, outputs or controls dynamically?
  ---
  You can add them as usual using the `addInput`/`addOutput`/`AddControl` methods, and then force a node update
  
  ```ts
  const area = new AreaPlugin(container)
  
  area.update('node', node.id)
  ```
  :::

  :::qa{#add-control-to-output question="How to add a control to the output?"}
  The process of adding such elements requires the creation of a custom node.
  
  Check out the relevant customization guide for [React.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue#customization), [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular#customization), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte#customization) or [Lit](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/lit#customization).
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: undirected-graph
  question: How to create an undirected graph with nodes that don't have
    input/output sockets?
  ---
  You can use the classic preset with custom nodes and a unified socket for both input and output port.
  
  Check out the [Undirected](https://retejs.org/examples/undirected) example

  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: order-inputs-controls-outputs
  question: How to change the order of inputs/controls/outputs?
  ---
  The classic rendering preset offers the flexibility to specify an optional `index` field for inputs, outputs or controls. This feature enables you to change the order of these elements within their lists.
  
  ```ts
  const input = new ClassicPreset.Input(socket)
  const output = new ClassicPreset.Output(socket)
  const control = new ClassicPreset.InputControl('text')
  
  input.index = 0;
  output.index = 0;
  control.index = 0;
  ```
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: align-inputs-outputs
  question: How to change the alignment of inputs/outputs?
  ---
  The process of changing the node layout requires the creation of a custom node.
  
  Check out the relevant customization guide for [React.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue#customization), [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular#customization), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte#customization) or [Lit](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/lit#customization).
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: render-vanilla-js
  question: Is it possible to render UI using vanilla JS exclusively, without
    resorting to frameworks?
  ---
  In short, it is possible, but there is no plugin available for this approach since it doesn't offer significant advantages in comparison to the development costs
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: update-rete-deps
  question: What is the best way to update all `rete` related dependencies?
  ---
  If you don't want to update all of your dependencies at once with `npm update`, you can selectively update those that begin with `rete` using a regular expression
  
  ```bash
  npx npm-check-updates /^rete/ --target @latest -u
  ```
  :::

  :::qa{#loop-connections question="How to display a loop connection?"}
  All available rendering plugins can display a loop connection if it has specified `isLoop` property
  
  ```ts
  class Connection extends ClassicPreset.Connection {
    isLoop = false
  }
  
  const connection = new Connection(source, output, target, input)
  
  connection.isLoop = true
  ```
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: minimum-ts-version
  question: What is the minimal TypeScript version required?
  ---
  The minimum required TypeScript version is 4.7.
  
  Otherwise, you might encounter the error `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite. ts(2589)` when using the `use` method. If you can't use a later version for some reason, the only solution is to use `@ts-ignore`.
  
  For example, when creating an Angular 12 application with [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit), a version 4.7 higher than the officially supported one is installed.
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: zoom-area
  question: How can I change the editor's zoom level programmatically?
  ---
  Using the `area.zoom` method enables you to specify the desired zoom level and the offset points for aligning the zoom
  
  ```ts
  await area.area.zoom(0.8, 0, 0);
  ```
  
  In the given example, the zoom will be decreased with respect to the top left boundary. If you want to modify the zoom relative to the center of the viewport, refer to the following code
  
  ```ts
  const delta = 0.2;
  const { k } = area.area.transform;
  const box = area.container.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = box.width / 2 / k;
  const y = box.height / 2 / k;
  
  area.area.zoom(k * (1 - delta), x * delta, y * delta);
  ```
  :::

  :::qa{#translate-area question="How can I modify the position of the area?"}
  By utilizing the `area.translate` method, you can change the coordinates as follows
  
  ```ts
  await area.area.translate(100, 20)
  ```
  
  Change in position relative to current coordinates
  
  ```ts
  const { x, y } = area.area.transform
  await area.area.translate(x + 100, y + 20)
  ```
  
  Change the editor's position considering the zoom factor
  
  ```ts
  const { k } = area.area.transform
  
  await area.area.translate(100 * k, 20 * k)
  ```
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: different-stack
  question: What if my app uses different stack and isn't based on React.js,
    Vue.js, or Angular?
  ---
  In case you're using a framework other than React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte or Lit (for which Rete.js provides a rendering plugin), you have the option to utilize the [React.js plugin](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react) to render nodes and other editor elements.
  
  For a quick start, you can create a React.js application using [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit), copy the code of the editor from `src/rete/default.tsx`, install the relevant dependencies in your project and call `createEditor`, providing the HTMLElement container created by your application.
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: viewport-center
  question: How can I retrieve the coordinates of the viewport center?
  ---
  First of all, you need to obtain the viewport center in screen coordinates using `getBoundingClientRect`. Afterward, you should transform them into editor coordinates by applying the zoom factor `k` and offset it relative to area's position.
  
  ```ts
  const area = new AreaPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>(container)
  
  const { x, y, k } = area.area.transform
  const box = area.container.getBoundingClientRect()
  const halfWidth = box.width / 2 / k
  const halfHeight = box.height / 2 / k
  
  return { x: halfWidth - x / k, y: halfHeight - y / k }
  ```
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: sockets-warning
  question: What does the warning 'Found more than one element for socket with
    same key and side' mean?
  ---
  The warning "Found more than one element for socket with same key and side" means that there are duplicate sockets in the editor that were not properly removed after an update, or due to an asynchronous approach when unmounting components by different UI frameworks, the lifecycle of old and new ones overlaps.
  
  In the first case, when the number of these warnings constantly accumulates, you most likely have a memory leak problem because some custom node was not correctly unmounted.
  
  In the second case, the warning can be avoided by adding a delay between removing the scheme/node and mounting a new one with the same identifiers. In the worst case, this warning should not indicate memory leak issues, so you can ignore it.
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: select-deselect-event
  question: How to track the select or deselect event of a node?
  ---
  The framework does not have a reserved event for this. Instead, you can \[/docs/guides/selectable#extend-selector]\(extend the selector) by triggering events in the relevant methods.
  :::

  :::qa{#handle-dblclick question="How to handle double-click events on nodes?"}
  Create a custom node component with a `dblclick` event handler.
  
  Check out the customization guide for your renderer: [React.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/vue#customization), [Angular](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/angular#customization), [Svelte](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/svelte#customization) or [Lit](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/renderers/lit#customization).
  
  **Important:** If your custom node contains nested interactive elements (buttons, inputs, etc.), make sure to prevent event propagation to avoid conflicts with the node's double-click handler.
  :::

  :::qa
  ---
  id: dblclick-prevent-zoom
  question: How to prevent/disable zoom on dblclick?
  ---
  ```ts
    area.addPipe(context => {
      if (context.type ===  'zoom' && context.data.source === 'dblclick') return
      return context
    })

## Connecting plugins

::side-by-side
#left
Connect the plugin by importing it by default import.

The second parameter is used for passing the plugin's options/parameters:

```ts
// v1
import HistoryPlugin from 'rete-history-plugin';

editor.use(HistoryPlugin, { keyboard: true });
```

#right
All plugins are implemented as classes and can be extended, providing flexible customization without modifying the core.

```ts
// v2
import { HistoryPlugin, HistoryExtensions, Presets } from 'rete-history-plugin'

const history = new HistoryPlugin<Schemes>()

history.addPreset(Presets.classic.setup())

HistoryExtensions.keyboard(history)

area.use(history)
```
::

## Creating nodes

::side-by-side
#left
In the v1, nodes are generated via components that were registered within the editor, which enabled the creation of numerous instances of nodes belonging to the same Component type.

```ts
// v1
class NumComponent extends Rete.Component {
  constructor(){
    super("Number");
  }

  builder(node) {
    node.addControl(new NumControl('num'))
    node.addOutput(new Rete.Output('num', "Number", numSocket))

    return node
  }
}

const numComponent = new NumComponent()
editor.register(numComponent);

const node = await numComponent.createNode({ num: 2 });
```

#right
The current version doesn't include Component as an abstraction, but you can implement similar approach if needed.

```ts
// v2
const node = new ClassicPreset.Node('Number')

node.addControl('num', new NumControl('num'))
node.addOutput('num', new ClassicPreset.Output(numSocket, "Number"));

await editor.addNode(node)
```
::

## Saving data in a node

::side-by-side
#left
The data can be saved using method `putData`. It is expected that the data should be in a valid JSON format, as it may be used for import/export.

```ts
// v1
node.putData('myData', 'data')
control.putData('myData', 'data') // where control is part of node
```

#right
There are no rigid import/export guidelines to follow in the current version, which means you have complete flexibility in how you store your data in nodes.

```ts
// v2
class MyNode extends ClassicPreset.Node {
  myData = 'data'
}
```
::

## Import/export

::side-by-side
#left
Because of the limitations mentioned earlier, the editor can be effortlessly exported and imported.

```ts
// v1
const data = editor.toJSON();
await editor.fromJSON(data);
```

#right
The current version incorporates a revised approach that requires implementation, as demonstrated in [Import/export](https://retejs.org/docs/guides/import-export).
::

## Selectable nodes

::side-by-side
#left
Selecting elements is a feature integrated within the editor

```ts
// v1
editor.selected.list

editor.selected.add(node, accumulate)
```

The downside to this implementation is its incapability to support anything other than node selection.

#right
The selection of nodes (and other elements) looks like:

```ts
// v2
const selector = AreaExtensions.selector()
const accumulating = AreaExtensions.accumulateOnCtrl()

const nodeSelector = AreaExtensions.selectableNodes(area, selector, { accumulating });

editor.getNodes().filter(node => node.selected)
nodeSelector.select(add.id)
```
::

## Events listening

::side-by-side
#left
The typical way to listen to events that can be prevented

```ts
// v1
editor.on('nodecreate', node => {
 return node.canCreate
});
```

#right
The current version uses a specific kind of signal implementation that involves object-based signals. Additionally, pipes are used to either manipulate these objects or prevent signal propagation.

```ts
// v2
editor.addPipe(context => {
  if (context.type === 'nodecreate') return
  return context
})
```

::

## Validate connections

::side-by-side
#left
There is a built-in connection validation based on socket compatibility

```ts
// v1
const anyTypeSocket = new Rete.Socket('Any type');

numSocket.combineWith(anyTypeSocket);
```

This approach is simple but has some limitations.

#right
Connection validation can be implemented independently, that provides more flexibility.

```ts
// v2
editor.addPipe(context => {
  if (context.type === 'connectioncreate') {
    if (canCreateConnection(context.data)) return false
  }
  return context
})
```
::

## Engine (dataflow)

::side-by-side
#left
The component with defined `worker` method should be registered

```ts
// v1
const engine = new Rete.Engine('demo@0.1.0');

engine.register(myComponent);
```

Define `worker` method of the component

```ts
// v1
worker(node, inputs, outputs){
  outputs['num'] = node.data.num;
}
```

Trigger the processing

```ts
// v1
await engine.process(data);
```

#right
Create the `DataflowEngine` instance to connect to the editor. Unlike the first version, there is no need to pass `data` with nodes and connections.

```ts
// v2
import { DataflowEngine } from 'rete-engine'

const engine = new DataflowEngine<Schemes>()

editor.use(engine)
```

Node method example

```ts
// v2
data(inputs) {
  const { left, right } = inputs

  return { sum: left[0] + right[0] }
}
```

Start the processing

```ts
// v2
engine.fetch(node.id)
```
::

## Task plugin (control flow)

::side-by-side
#left
This approach is implemented using the `rete-task-plugin` and based on the `Rete.Engine`. Therefore, it has the aforementioned limitations

```ts
// v1
import TaskPlugin from 'rete-task-plugin';

editor.use(TaskPlugin);
```

Component's constructor has specified outputs that are intended for control flow or dataflow

```ts
// v1
this.task = {
    outputs: { exec: 'option', data: 'output' },
    init(task) {
        task.run('any data');
        task.reset();
    }
}
```

Define the `worker` method, which returns data and specifies closed output ports for control flow

```ts
// v1
worker(node, inputs, data) {
    this.closed = ['exec'];
    return { data }
}
```

#right
The `rete-engine` package is used, which has a separate implementation of the engine for control flow

```ts
// v2
import { ControlFlowEngine } from 'rete-engine'

const engine = new ControlFlowEngine<Schemes>()

editor.use(engine)
```

By default, all ports are configured to pass control, but you can designate certain ones for this

```ts
// v2
const engine = new ControlFlowEngine<Schemes>(() => {
  return {
    inputs: () => ["exec"],
    outputs: () => ["exec"]
  };
});
```

The following serves as the node method:

```ts
// v2
execute(input: 'exec', forward: (output: 'exec') => void) {
  forward('exec')
}
```

Unlike the previous version, this approach is completely decoupled from the dataflow. Nevertheless, it can be used in conjunction with `DataflowEngine`.

```ts
// v2
async execute(input: 'exec', forward: (output: 'exec') => void) {
  const inputs = await dataflow.fetchInputs(this.id)

  forward('exec')
}
```
::

## Render plugins

As a demonstration, we have opted to use `rete-react-render-plugin`

::side-by-side
#left
```ts
// v1
import ReactRenderPlugin from 'rete-react-render-plugin';

editor.use(ReactRenderPlugin)
```

#right
```ts
// v2
import { ReactPlugin } from 'rete-react-plugin'
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const reactPlugin = new ReactPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>({ createRoot })

area.use(reactPlugin)
```
::

### Custom nodes and controls

::side-by-side
#left
The following code is used to specify the components needed for specific nodes and controls

```ts
// v1
class AddComponent extends Rete.Component {
  constructor() {
    super("Add");
    this.data.component = MyNode;
  }
}

class MyControl extends Rete.Control {
  constructor(emitter, key, name) {
    super(key);
    this.render = 'react';
    this.component = MyReactControl;
    this.props = { emitter, name };
  }
}
```

Alternatively, component can be specified for all nodes

```ts
// v1
editor.use(ReactRenderPlugin, { component: MyNode });
```

#right
In this version, the components to be visualized are defined in the classic preset that is connected

```ts
// v2
reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.classic.setup({ customize: {
  node(data) {
    return MyNode
  },
  control() {
    return MyReactControl
  }
}}))
```

This approach offers greater flexibility, enabling you to define additional conditions within the handlers
::

## Translate nodes

::side-by-side
#left
Retrieve the view of the node and execute its `translate` method

```ts
// v1
editor.view.nodes.get(node).translate(x, y)
```

#right
The plugin instance contains `translate` method that only needs the node identifier.

```ts
// v2
await area.translate(node.id, { x, y })
```
::

## Arrange nodes

::side-by-side
#left
The plugin offers approach for positioning nodes, but its functionality is significantly restricted.

```ts
// v1
import AutoArrangePlugin from 'rete-auto-arrange-plugin';

editor.use(AutoArrangePlugin, {});

editor.trigger('arrange');
```

#right
The plugin leverages the advanced functionality of the `elkjs` package.

```ts
// v2
import { AutoArrangePlugin, Presets as ArrangePresets } from "rete-auto-arrange-plugin";

const arrange = new AutoArrangePlugin<Schemes>();

arrange.addPreset(ArrangePresets.classic.setup());

area.use(arrange);

await arrange.layout()
```
::

## Fit viewport

::side-by-side
#left
The `zoomAt` method requires an editor instance that is responsible for visualization

```ts
// v1
import AreaPlugin from "rete-area-plugin";

AreaPlugin.zoomAt(editor);
```

#right
For visualization purposes in this version, an instance of `AreaPlugin` is required.

```ts
// v2
import { AreaExtensions } from "rete-area-plugin";

AreaExtensions.zoomAt(area, editor.getNodes());
```

This example showcases a data processing pipeline using `rete-engine`, where data flows from left to right through nodes.

Each node features a `data` method, which receives arrays of incoming data from their respective input sockets and delivers an object containing data corresponding to the output sockets. To initiate their execution, you can make use of the `engine.fetch` method by specifying the identifier of the target node. Consequently, the engine will execute all predecessors recursively, extracting their output data and delivering it to the specified node.

This example showcases an executing of schema via control flow using `rete-engine`, where each node dynamically decides which of its outgoing nodes will receive control.

Each node features an `execute` method that takes an input port key as a control source, and a function for conveying control to outgoing nodes through a defined output port. To initiate the execution of the flow, you can use `engine.execute` method, specifying the identifier of the starting node. Consequently, the outgoing nodes will be executed sequentially, starting from the designated node.

- Selectable connections
- Unified port for connections
- Removal of connections with a designated button located in the middle of the path
- Connections represented by straight lines and loops with markers at the end

::pro-example{src="https://retejs-undirected.netlify.app"}
::

The classic preset is used for rendering, which involves splitting into input and output ports, but in this case, a trick is employed to pack them into a single unified socket, represented by a transparent circle slightly larger in radius than its node. Custom components are used to represent the nodes and connections. The `rete-connection-path-plugin` plugin is used for setting up connection path and marker. Instead of `getDOMSocketPosition`, a custom socket position calculator is used to ensure that the beginning and end of the connection coincide with the node's border.

Approximately 50% of the example's source code relies on the stack and is available for React.js and Angular. If you're using a different stack, you can migrate the necessary components by referencing the source code or request their implementation through GitHub Issues in the appropriate repository.

Automated node arrangement, or commonly referred to as layouting, enables the positioning of nodes in relation to each other, considering their connections. This is achieved through a specialized plugin that utilizes [elk.js](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs){rel="nofollow"} to calculate node positions.

Additionally, it offers extensive customization capabilities, allowing users to configure node placement through various options and an applier to assign the calculated positions to nodes (e.g incorporating animations).

::kit

# Insert node

In this scenario, the user can insert the node into connection between other nodes. The implementation replaces the connection with two new connections when the selected node is dropped onto the connection.

After adding the connection, the graph is arranged with animation.

::kit

Use the `insert-node` directory and call `insertableNodes` with proper arguments to integrate this feature into your application.


# Magnetic connection

The given example showcases a technique to enhance UX by enlarging the connection dropping area. This means that users do not have to aim directly at the socket to make a connection, particularly when the socket is small or the zoom level is low.

::kit

There are two types of editors available here: the materials editor (on the left) and the geometry editor (on the right). They are quite simple and designed for customizing the frame for the painting. Each editor has its own contextual menu. You can navigate the scene in two ways: through pointer capture mode or orbital control mode, which also allows you to edit schemes.

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
