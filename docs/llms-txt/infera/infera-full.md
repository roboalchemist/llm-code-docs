# Challenges and Solutions



## Challenges

### AI Censorship

New models are developed in secret and most users has little or no influence in the ethics or the decisions powering the LLMs. With the current standard of centralized decision making with ai models, users have no impact on the development and direction of the model, but the model has a direct impact on users themselves.

1.  **Limiting Freedom of Speech** \
    The current regime of available LLMs are heavily censored within the industry. Infera Network aims to build an LLM for all to use and contribute to - without censorship.

2.  **Manipulation of Information** \
    Due to non-deterministic nature of LLMs they have been historically centralized for “safety” reasons.

3.  **Impact on Innovation** \
    By limiting the use cases of AI through censorship, we hold back innovation. Uncensored AI will push the world forward.

### GPU usage for AI inference

While the AI community is heavily focused on addressing challenges in data handling and model training, a significantly greater opportunity lies within the inference sector, potentially exceeding current focuses by an order of magnitude. The prevalent model of renting GPUs by the hour is not aligned with developers’ needs, who prefer a pay-per-use approach for querying existing open-source models. Our initiative introduces a groundbreaking open-source model, co-developed with the community, enabling us to offer decentralized nodes. This allows developers to access computational power for inference tasks beyond traditional data center constraints, substantially reducing costs.

Currently, the technology required to parallelize and train models across thousands of globally distributed GPUs is still under development. However, inference tasks, which form the backbone of real-world AI applications, usually require only a single GPU. Unlike training, inference processes do not benefit from, nor necessitate, multi-GPU setups; even in environments designed for parallel operations, inference tasks are typically handled by a singular core. This distinction underscores the efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of our decentralized approach for inference, marking a pivotal advancement in making AI more accessible and economically viable for developers worldwide.

### Data Center GPU Cost

Nvidia H100 GPUs sell for \~\$40,000 USD which are specific to data centers.

Nvidia RTX 4090 GPUs sell for \~\$2,500 which can be used in the home.

The cost disparity in utilizing data centers for AI applications is profound, often exceeding a 10x difference. We recognize an immense opportunity in harnessing idle GPUs found within personal home computers. By tapping into this dormant resource, we can drastically lower the cost per inference for developers, unlocking a new realm of efficiency and affordability in AI development.

### It is not enough to just buy a GPU

While it's possible for individuals to run a model on their own, scaling this operation presents a significant challenge. At present, the primary means to surmount this barrier to entry involves leveraging GPUs housed within data centers and learning complex tech stacks in order to even start simple model inferencing.

## Solutions

### Community Aligned Development and Open-source models

For each model we develop, our approach begins with our user community, prioritizing their needs and working backwards from there. Our commitment is to operate transparently, ensuring that all decisions are made with community consensus and support. We endeavor to co-create new models alongside our token holders, ensuring that these innovations align with community standards and expectations.

### Decentralized nodes for inference

Decentralizing inference through networked GPUs offers a transformative approach akin to data center capabilities but without the associated costs. A single 4090 GPU, capable of handling multiple concurrent requests with rapid token streaming, exemplifies this potential. By interconnecting these powerful GPUs globally, we can establish a decentralized system for Large Language Model (LLM) inference that rivals traditional data center performance. This system leverages the untapped power of idle GPUs worldwide, offering data center-level infrastructure at a fraction of the cost.

Transitioning to a decentralized model is straightforward, relying on readily available tools and a clear methodology:

1.  **Requests Allocation:** \
    Infera will distribute requests from the mempool to ecosystem nodes in a randomized manner, ensuring each request is handled by at least three different nodes to foster redundancy and reliability.
2.  **Output Verification:** \
    Outputs from nodes will be assessed using a semantic similarity score to evaluate their accuracy. Outputs that surpass a specific threshold will be deemed verified, ensuring high-quality responses.
3.  **Settlement and Response:** \
    Verified responses will be conclusively recorded on the blockchain, with a randomly selected response sent back to the requester, completing the cycle of decentralized inference.

### Unlocking Latent GPU Supply

Leveraging the untapped potential of idle GPUs, we unlock new revenue opportunities for individuals who previously had no means to monetize their hardware. This initiative introduces a compelling revenue stream for GPU owners, enabling them to recoup some of their hardware investment costs.

As part of our strategic roadmap, Infera is set to release a downloadable node compatible with any GPU. This node is designed to intelligently utilize the GPU only during idle periods. For instance, Infera’s operations are paused while you engage in GPU-intensive activities, such as gaming. Conversely, when your computer is on but not in use—like during the night—Infera activates to perform AI inference tasks. This operation not only supports the network’s AI capabilities but also compensates the node operators with \$INFER tokens, seamlessly turning idle time into valuable assets.

Additionally, the plug and play aspect of Infera allows immediate usage of your hardware, without spending your own time to learn how to do so.

The rapid growth of AI has led to increased demand for scalable and efficient inference solutions. AI ecosystems face challenges such as high costs, single points of failure, and privacy concerns. Current AI inference solutions are hindered by scalability issues and high operational costs, with some offering flexibility in AI model inference while others remain closed-source. Infera addresses these challenges by decentralizing AI inference through distributing a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution. Utilizing a decentralized network, Infera distributes AI inference tasks to worker nodes. Worker nodes are Infera ecosystem participants that earn INFER tokens through supplying the network with compute power. This architecture enhances the network’s reliability and performance by distributing work through-out a network without relying on a single node. Leveraging blockchain technology, Infera offers a platform and access to on-chain AI inference for developers working with blockchains. Additionally, Infera is launching a Layer 3 dedicated to on-chain inference work and an SDK to provide a cost-effective and scalable solution. This enables developers to build AI-powered applications for both on-chain and off-chain use cases.

## 1. Introduction

***

### 1.1. Problem & Innovations

AI inference is the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data, typically in real-time environments. With AI inference demand increasing due to user adoption, a multitude of problems surrounding AI have emerged.

**Model Restrictions** - Centralized AI inference providers often impose limitations on the customization and deployment of AI models. This restricts users’ ability to fine-tune models for specific applications and hampers innovation.

**Economic Barriers** - High costs associated with AI inference services and the necessary hardware infrastructure present significant barriers to entry, especially for startups and individual developers.

**On-Chain Verification** - Having on-chain verification allows for the development of on-chain AI agents. However, posting large volumes of inference data on-chain is impractical due to high costs and scalability issues. This limits the feasibility of fully decentralized AI solutions that require frequent data access and updates.

**Accessibility & Privacy** - Access to advanced AI inference remains limited to well-funded organizations and specialized tech companies, creating a disparity in AI innovation and application across different sectors unless those enterprises have their own proprietary solution.

While infrastructure is becoming more abundant, key barriers still hinder the development of applications leveraging AI inference. By addressing key challenges such as model restrictions, on-chain storage, and accessibility, we envisions users using AI inference to build tools users will be able to overcome the current issues surrounding access to AI inference.

### 1.2. Vision and Mission

Infera aims to democratize AI inference through a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that leverages global computational resources. Our vision includes on-chain verification mechanisms for transparent, auditable AI computations, creating a trustless environment for reliable AI systems. Infera’s AI agent framework enables developers to build sophisticated, autonomous agents that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact within our ecosystem. This paves the way for a new generation of decentralized applications powered by verifiable, autonomous AI.

## 2. Architecture Overview

***

### 2.1 Inference Network

The network bundles computational tasks submitted by users which are then dynamically distributed among participating nodes. Nodes will be able to perform inference and pick up failed jobs from other nodes. This prevents issues with single points of failure and increases network stability for users and developers. The decentralized architecture facilitates communications between nodes, enabling efficient distribution and execution of AI inference tasks across the network.

<Frame caption="Diagram 1 - Infera's inference network architecture">
  <img width="100%" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/infera-a106b685/images/litepaper/diagram-1.jpg" />
</Frame>

***

Participants within the network include users and node runners. Demand is driven by users while node runners comprise the supply side of the network. Node runners are responsible for ensuring their GPUs and CPUs supplied have a stable operating environment to handle the inference requests generated by the users. Users will be able to access Infera through the SDK and API, accessing the inference network. Inputs submitted by users are sent to the load balancer from the API gateway, and are then routed to node runners. Users are able to obtain their results from the API Gateway

To incentivize participation, nodes contributing computational resources are rewarded with INFER tokens. This reward system encourages node workers to have stable uptimes to maintain a robust and active network. Additionally, the decentralized approach allows for greater flexibility and customization, including tools allowing users to deploy and fine-tune AI models to meet specific requirements without the constraints imposed by centralized providers.

### 2.2. Load Balancing

User inputs are dynamically distributed as batched tasks across active nodes on the network. By preventing overloading of individual nodes with the load balancer, Infera can maintain consistent performance even as the volume of tasks increases. The load balancer continuously monitors node performance and current workloads, adjusting the distribution of tasks in real-time. Infera will also be backstopping the network by providing worker nodes to the ecosystem to ensure that inference tasks on the network are completed.

Additionally, the load balancer is able to pick up dropped jobs from nodes and redistribute it across the network as a built-in redundancy to ensure that the network remains operational even in the event of node failures. If a node goes offline or experiences issues, the load balancer can quickly redistribute its tasks to other nodes, maintaining continuous operation and preventing disruptions.

### 2.3. On-chain Verification & Structure

A verified inference function (VIF) is a cryptographic primitive that produces a verifiable inference output from a given input and secret key. VIFs can provide proof that specific inference computations were performed correctly by generating verifiable random outputs associated with the computation. This proof can be stored and accessed on-chain, allowing anyone to verify that the inference results are genuine.To significantly reduce the cost of on-chain inference compared to existing methods, INFER will be implemented as the gas token for Infera’s L3. This significantly reduces cost to use the network while also providing a dedicated environment for users to build on top of Infera.

## 3. Role of INFER Token

### 3.1. Gas Token for Transactions

INFER serves as the gas token for the L3, providing a cost-effective transaction mechanism compared to L2s and Ethereum mainnet. This approach is crucial for the network’s economic viability, given the high volume of AI inference transactions. By using a dedicated L3 for on-chain inference, users avoid competition for blockspace on other chains, while still covering computational costs with INFER tokens for all transaction types.

### 3.2.Node Participation Rewards

Node participation is critical to the Infera network's functionality and scalability. To incentivize participation, Infera rewards node operators with INFER tokens for their contributions. These rewards are given to nodes that contribute to the network for AI inference task completion, ensuring that there is sufficient computational power to meet demand.

The reward mechanism operates on a performance-based model, evaluating nodes on their uptime, reliability, and task volume. Rewarding nodes with INFER tokens incentivizes continuous participation and aligns operator interests. This mechanism also enables node runners to operate on the L3 when contributing inference to the network. A smart contract will be responsible for the distribution of rewards based on historical node performance.

### 3.3 Distribution & Staking Mechanism

INFER is distributed to node runners through our smart contract and off-chain tracking system. This approach allows for a flexible and scalable reward system during the early stages of network deployment. Nodes report their operational metrics to the off-chain system, which then calculates the appropriate rewards.

As the network matures, Infera will transition to a more decentralized and trustless model by integrating on-chain verified staking-based rewards. Node operators will be required to stake a certain amount of INFER tokens to their node. This staking mechanism serves a dual purpose: it secures the network by ensuring that node operators have a vested interest in maintaining its integrity and it enhances the transparency and security of the reward distribution process.

## 4. AI Inference Verification and Performance

### 4.1. Off-Chain Verification Using Vector Similarity

Infera employs cosine similarity for verifying AI inference results off-chain, a method that is both efficient and accurate in ensuring the integrity of non-deterministic AI outputs. This technique is particularly useful for comparing the similarity between two outputs, ensuring that the results of AI computations remain consistent and reliable.

**Cosine Similarity Mechanism** - Cosine similarity calculates the similarity between two non-zero vectors by measuring the cosine of the angle between them. For AI inference, the vectors represent the model’s output features. A cosine similarity close to 1 indicates that the two vectors are nearly identical, confirming the consistency of the AI inference. This method is highly effective in handling the inherent variability in AI outputs, particularly for non-deterministic models that may produce slightly different results due to stochastic processes.

**Implementation in Infera** - Infera's off-chain verification process involves comparing the inference results from multiple nodes. When a node completes an inference task, it generates a vector representing the output. This vector is then compared to vectors produced by other nodes for the same task. If the cosine similarity between these vectors is above a predefined threshold, the result is considered verified. This approach ensures that only consistent and accurate inference results are committed to the blockchain, maintaining the integrity of the system.

### 4.2. Node Slashing

To maintain the integrity and reliability of the Infera network, nodes will be required to stake an amount of INFER tokens to be eligible for earning emission rewards.

**Staking and Slashing Mechanism** - Nodes that participate in the AI inference process must stake a predetermined amount of INFER tokens. This staked amount acts as collateral, which can be forfeited if the node fails to meet the required performance standards. Specifically, nodes that provide inference outputs that do not fall within the acceptable safety margin, as determined by cosine similarity, will be subject to slashing. This means a portion of their staked tokens will be deducted as a penalty for producing unreliable results.

**Performance Monitoring** - In addition to the staking requirement, a reputation mechanism is in place to continuously monitor node performance. Nodes are evaluated based on their uptime, the accuracy of their inference outputs, and their overall contribution to the network. This reputation score is crucial in maintaining a high standard of reliability and trust within the network. Nodes that consistently underperform or produce outputs with low cosine similarity scores will see their reputation scores decline.

**Consequences of Poor Performance** - Nodes with poor performance are penalized through the slashing mechanism. If a node's outputs frequently fall outside the acceptable range, indicating a significant deviation from the expected results, it will face incremental slashing penalties. This ensures that only nodes that consistently meet the network’s performance standards can continue to participate and earn rewards.

**Reputation and Ejection** - Should a node's reputation score fall below a certain threshold due to repeated poor performance or malicious behavior, it will be ejected from the network. This ejection process ensures that the Infera network remains robust and secure by removing unreliable or compromised nodes. The reputation mechanism thus acts as a self-regulating system that maintains the quality and reliability of the network over time.

**Transparency and Fairness** - The staking, slashing, and reputation mechanisms are all governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness in their execution. These smart contracts automatically enforce the rules without the need for human intervention, reducing the risk of bias or error.

### 4.3. Infera API and SDK

The Infera API and SDK constitute the primary interface for accessing our decentralized AI inference network. Our initial release focuses on a Python SDK, chosen for its widespread adoption in the AI and data science communities. The API design allows for developers to access the network of available nodes to perform inference work for AI applications built on top of the network. Future development will extend support to other programming languages, with JavaScript being the next target platform to broaden accessibility for web-based applications. Metrics for Success

*   Number of API calls and SDK downloads.
*   Developer satisfaction and engagement levels.
*   Growth in the number and quality of third-party applications and services built on Infera.

Follow this [guide](https://medium.com/@alex_85908/how-to-link-a-node-to-your-infera-account-d2f746e52fa2) to learn how to properly link your nodes.


# Linux

Installing the Infera Node CLI program on Linux.

## Prerequisites

You **MUST** have a **GPU** to run an **Infera Node**.

<Warning>Minimum requirements for the node are 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM. A node will run with less RAM, but will get significantly less or no jobs.</Warning>

## Installing Infera

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install and Run Ollama">
    [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is required to run an **Infera Node**.

    You can download it from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.com/download).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Infera Lite browser extension">
    1.  Open the Chrome Browser (if you do not have Chrome installed, download it [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/))
    2.  Go to the [Infera Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/infera-lite/ffoccnmddajjohmmkccnkobelobgcdmp) extension on the Chrome Web Store.
    3.  Click **"Add to your Chrome"** to install the extension in your browser.

    <Note>For Linux installation, the Infera Lite extension is not required. Nodes can run fully in CLI and be linked using CLI management commands which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@alex_85908/node-management-in-cli-be725a90d1c8). Use the extension if you are more comfortable with a graphical interface</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open your terminal">
    Open the **Terminal** application on your Linux system. You can usually find it in your applications menu or by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download the installation script">
    Copy paste the following commands in your command line and press enter to install your Infera node. The first command removes previous installations of infera if they are present.

    #### For Linux with Intel

    ```bash
    curl -sSL http://downloads.infera.org/infera-linux-intel.sh | bash
    ```

    #### For Linux with AMD

    ```bash
    curl -sSL http://downloads.infera.org/infera-linux-amd.sh | bash
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running an Infera Node">
    After installing, run the following command to start your node:

    ```bash
    init-infera
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify that your Infera Node is running">
    If your node is running correctly, your terminal will display a message like this:

    <img width="100%" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/infera-a106b685/images/node/node-running.png" />

    Click on the Infera Lite extension in Chrome while your node is running to monitor your node.

    If your node is running, the extension should automatically detect your node.

    Go to the [Infera Lite Guide](/node/infera-lite) to learn more about how you can use the extension to monitor your node.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link the Node">
    If this is your first time, you may see a message saying

    ```
    ERROR: node verification failed
    ```

    This is because you must link your node to your **Infera Account**. Linking your node to your account is neccessary to withdraw tokens earned from completing jobs on the network.

    To link your node, follow the [Link Node to Account](https://medium.com/@alex_85908/how-to-link-a-node-to-your-infera-account-d2f746e52fa2). This must be done once for every node you run.

    **If you have already linked your node**, it should just start up and you will see messages in terminal counting uptime. That means your node is running!

    **If your node gets a job**, you will see a message saying Starting job in terminal.
  </Step>

## How does it work?

<img width="100%" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/infera-a106b685/images/node/node-diagram-white.png" />

*   Nodes listen for inference requests broadcasted from the load balancer.
*   When a job is received, the input is passed to the node's inference engine.
*   Post-inference, the results are verified with similar outputs from reference nodes.
*   Results are then routed back to the load balancer alongside the verification results.

***

## Why run an Infera Node?

### Troubleshooting

*   If the installation script fails, ensure your internet connection is active.
*   Make sure you have the latest version of Ollama running before starting the Infera node.
*   If you see this in your terminal ![terminal](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*EMkDt5nCEBCMIC62NQoXFQ.jpeg)
    It is NOT an error or an issue at all. This is your chrome extension prompting server for data like points, uptime and other data. Nothing needs to be done about it.
*   If it's stuck on “Uvicorn running” try to close the exe and run it again. Sometimes it helps running the exe as an Administrator but should be fine just relaunching the app.
*   Windows firewall might also pop up, allow running infera-windows.exe in the pop-up or add it to exceptions of your anti-virus software.
*   Make sure your extension has ACTIVE status on the first page. If it doesn't, try pressing the huge Infera logo on the same page
