<Note>
  This API documentation is meant for developers who want to build on top of Infera. If you are only looking to run a node, learn more about that [here](/node/quickstart)
</Note>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an **api-key** that can only be granted by talking to a member of the developer team. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/infera) and tell us what you want to build, an api-key will be supplied!
