# Multi-Subsite Architecture

The Lynx website operates as a collection of "mini-subsites" (e.g., **Lynx**, **ReactLynx**, **Rspeedy**) housed within a single repository. This architecture allows each subsite to have its own identity (logo, home page, sidebar) while sharing common documentation and infrastructure.

## Configuration

The central configuration for subsites is located in [`shared-route-config.ts`](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-website/blob/main/shared-route-config.ts). This file acts as the single source of truth for:

1. **Subsite Metadata**: Defines the list of available subsites.
2. **Shared Routes**: Defines which documentation sections are shared across subsites.

### `SubsiteConfig`

Each subsite is defined by a `SubsiteConfig` object:

```typescript
export type SubsiteConfig = {
  value: string; // Unique ID (e.g., 'guide')
  label: string; // Display name (e.g., 'Lynx')
  description: string; // Short description
  home: string; // Root path (e.g., '/')
  url: string; // Landing page URL
  logo: {
    // Logo assets
    light: string;
    dark: string;
  };
};
```

## Adding a New Subsite

To add a new subsite (e.g., `my-framework`):

1. **Create Directory**: Create `docs/en/my-framework/` (and `docs/zh/my-framework/`).
2. **Update Config**: Add a new entry to `SUBSITES_CONFIG` in `shared-route-config.ts`.
   ```typescript
   {
     value: 'my-framework',
     label: 'My Framework',
     // ...
   }
   ```
3. **Configure Sidebar**: Create `docs/en/my-framework/_meta.json` to define its specific sidebar structure.

## Shared Documentation

To avoid duplicating content (like "Quick Start" guides) across multiple subsites, we use a shared documentation system.

### How it Works

1. **Source of Truth**: Shared files are physically located in `docs/en/guide/start/`.
2. **Virtual Routes**: The `sharedSidebarPlugin` in `rspress.config.ts` dynamically creates virtual pages for other subsites (e.g., `react/start/quick-start`) that point to the same content.
3. **Unified Sidebar**: The `BeforeSidebar` component (in `theme/BeforeSidebar.tsx`) automatically injects the shared "Start" section into the sidebar of every subsite.

### Managing Shared Content

To modify which files are shared, update `SHARED_DOC_TITLES` in `shared-route-config.ts`.

```typescript
const SHARED_DOC_TITLES = {
  'quick-start': { en: 'Quick Start', zh: '快速上手' },
  // ...
};
```

## Subsite UI

The subsite navigation and identity are handled by custom theme components:

- **`SubsiteSelect`** (`theme/BeforeSidebar.tsx`): The dropdown menu at the top of the sidebar allows users to switch between subsites.
- **`SubsiteLogo`** (`theme/subsite-ui.tsx`): Renders the correct logo for the current subsite and theme mode.

These components read directly from `SUBSITES_CONFIG`, so any changes there are immediately reflected in the UI.
