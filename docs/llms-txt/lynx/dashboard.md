This guide explains how to use the Lynx API Status Dashboard to explore API compatibility across different platforms.

![API Status Dashboard Overview](/api-status-help/api-status-main.png)

***

## 1. Select Platform

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find the **Platform Selector** which allows you to select one or multiple platforms to view their specific API coverage.

### Native Platforms

- **Android** - Mobile Android platform
- **iOS** - Apple iOS platform
- **Harmony** - HarmonyOS platform
- **Web** - Web Lynx implementation

Use the checkboxes to select multiple platforms simultaneously. The dashboard will update to show coverage statistics for the combined selection.

### Clay Platforms

Click the **Clay** toggle button to reveal additional Clay platform options:

![Clay Platforms Expanded](/api-status-help/api-status-clay-platforms.png)

Clay platforms include:

- **Clay (Android)** - Clay running on Android
- **Clay (iOS)** - Clay running on iOS
- **Clay (macOS)** - Clay running on macOS
- **Clay (Windows)** - Clay running on Windows

***

## 2. Search, Filter, and View APIs

### Search Box

Use the search box to quickly find specific APIs by name or description. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial text.

**Examples:**

- Search `image` to find all image-related APIs
- Search `scroll` to find scrolling functionality
- Search `animation` to find animation APIs

### Category Filter

The first dropdown allows you to filter APIs by category:

- **All** - Show all categories
- **ELEMENT** - Element-related APIs
- **CSS** - CSS property support
- **API** - JavaScript API methods

### State Filter

The second dropdown filters APIs by their support status on the selected platform:

- **All** - Show all APIs
- **Supported** - Only show supported APIs
- **Unsupported** - Only show unsupported APIs

### API List

The API list displays all matching APIs in a two-column grid layout. Each API item shows:

- **Category badge** (e.g., `ELEMENT`, `CSS`, `API`)
- **API name** (e.g., `commonality`, `image.loop-count`)
- **Color coding**:
  - 🟢 **Green background** - API is supported on all selected platforms
  - 🟡 **Yellow background** - API is partially supported (supported on some but not all selected platforms)
  - 🔴 **Red background** - API is not supported on any selected platform

For partially supported APIs, a small indicator (e.g., "2/3") shows how many of the selected platforms support that feature.

By default, only the first 100 results are shown for performance. Click **"Show All"** to display all matching results.

### API Detail Drawer

Click on any API item to open the detailed compatibility drawer:

![API Detail Drawer](/api-status-help/api-status-drawer.png)

The drawer shows a compatibility table with:

- **Rows** - Each sub-API or property
- **Columns** - All platforms (Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, macOS, Windows, Web)

| Icon           | Meaning                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✓ with version | Supported since that version |
| ✗ No           | Not supported                |
| ?              | Support status unknown       |

Click the **"View source"** link to see the raw compatibility data in the GitHub repository.

## 3. View Platform Coverage and Trends

The bottom section shows platform statistics and historical trends:

![Coverage Card and Trend Chart](/api-status-help/api-status-coverage-trend.png)

### Coverage Card (Left)

- **Percentage** - Overall API coverage (e.g., 87%)
- **Fraction** - Exact count (e.g., 945 / 1,092)
- **Progress bar** - Visual representation with platform-specific color

### Trend Chart (Right)

- **X-axis** - Lynx versions (e.g., 2.14 → 3.4)
- **Y-axis** - API coverage percentage
- **Line** - Coverage progression over time

This helps you understand how API support has improved across versions.

### Category Table

The **Coverage** section provides a breakdown by API category:

![Category Table with Expanded View](/api-status-help/api-status-category-expanded.png)

| Column   | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Category | API category name (e.g., Elements, CSS) |
| Coverage | Percentage and count of supported APIs  |
| Missing  | Number of unsupported APIs (if any)     |

**Highlight Modes:**

- **Highlight Good** (Green mode) - Emphasizes high coverage categories
- **Highlight Gap** (Red mode) - Emphasizes low coverage categories

Click on any category row to expand it and see the individual APIs. Unsupported APIs are highlighted in red for easy identification.

***

## 4. Recently Added APIs

The **Recently Added** section lists APIs that were recently added to Lynx, grouped by version.

![Recently Added APIs by Version](/api-status-help/api-status-recently-added.png)

Each version group shows:

- **Version number** (e.g., v3.5, v3.4, v2.18)
- **API count** for the selected platform
- **List of APIs** added in that version

This is useful for tracking new features in each Lynx release.

***

## Tips

1. **Start with platform selection** - Choose your target platforms (one or more) first to see relevant coverage data.
2. **Use Colorblind Mode** - Toggle the **Colorblind Mode** switch in the sidebar footer to enable a high-contrast Blue/Orange theme for better accessibility.
3. **Use search for specific APIs** - If you know the API name, search is faster than scrolling.
4. **Check the drawer for details** - The compatibility table shows version-specific information.
5. **Monitor trends** - Use the trend chart to understand coverage improvements over time.
6. **Toggle Clay for desktop** - Enable Clay platforms if you're building cross-platform desktop apps.
