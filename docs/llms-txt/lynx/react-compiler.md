# React Compiler <Experimental />

[React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) can optimize components at compile time, eliminating the need to manually use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `memo`. You can use React Compiler in ReactLynx to enhance your application's performance.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to enable React Compiler for ReactLynx in Rspeedy:

1. Install the runtime dependency for React Compiler:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react-compiler-runtime@rc" />

2. Install the build-time dependencies for React Compiler:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rsbuild/plugin-babel babel-plugin-react-compiler@rc" />

3. Enable React Compiler in the lynx.config.js configuration:

:::warning

Currently ReactLynx only supports target to version 17.

:::

```js title="lynx.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from '@lynx-js/rspeedy';
import { pluginBabel } from '@rsbuild/plugin-babel';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    pluginBabel({
      include: /\.(?:jsx|tsx)$/,
      babelLoaderOptions(opts) {
        opts.plugins?.unshift([
          'babel-plugin-react-compiler',
          // See https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/configuration for config
          {
            // ReactLynx only supports target to version 17
            target: '17',
          },
        ]);
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

4. To maximize the benefits of React Compiler, it is recommended to configure the ESLint rule `react-hooks/react-compiler` to detect code that cannot be optimized. Please refer to [React Compiler - ESLint Integration](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation#eslint-integration) for configuration details.

## Performance Considerations

The React Compiler automatically analyzes your components and injects memoization logic, reducing the need for manual optimizations like `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo`. This simplifies your codebase and can deliver significant performance gains during subsequent re-renders, particularly in update-heavy interfaces.

Because the compiler introduces additional runtime logic, it may slightly affect [IFR](/guide/interaction/ifr.md) performance or initial background-thread rendering. We recommend enabling React Compiler in cases where initial IFR performance is less critical, or where re-render efficiency and developer experience are the higher priorities.

We’re actively evaluating its impact in ReactLynx and welcome your experiments and feedback to help guide future improvements.
