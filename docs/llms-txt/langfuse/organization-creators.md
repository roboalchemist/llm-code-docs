# Allowlist of organization creators

<Callout type="info">

This is only available in the Enterprise Edition. Please add your [license key](/self-hosting/license-key) to activate it.

</Callout>

By default, all users who have access to a Langfuse instance can create new organizations.

If you want to restrict organization creation to a specific set of users, you can use the `LANGFUSE_ALLOWED_ORGANIZATION_CREATORS` environment variable. In some organizations, there is a certain set of users who create new organizations and then provision access to the single organization or project via [RBAC](/docs/rbac).

```bash filename=".env"
LANGFUSE_ALLOWED_ORGANIZATION_CREATORS=user1@langfuse.com,user2@langfuse.com
```
