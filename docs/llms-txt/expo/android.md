# Submit to the Google Play Store

Learn how to submit your app to the Google Play Store from your computer and CI/CD services.

This guide outlines how to submit your app to the Google Play Store from your computer or from a CI/CD service.

## Submitting your app from your computer

Prerequisites

7 requirements

1.

Sign up for a Google Play Developer account

A Google Play Developer account is required to submit your app to the Google Play Store. You can sign up for a Google Play Developer account on the [Google Play Console sign-up page](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).

2.

Create an app on Google Play Console

Create an app by clicking **Create app** in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).

3.

Create a Google Service Account

EAS requires you to upload and configure a Google Service Account Key to submit your Android app to the Google Play Store. You can create one with the [uploading a Google Service Account Key for Play Store submissions with EAS](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/creating-google-service-account.md) guide.

4.

Install EAS CLI and authenticate with your Expo account

Install EAS CLI and login with your Expo account:

```sh
npm install -g eas-cli && eas login
```

5.

Include a package name in app.json

Include your app's package name in **app.json**:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
  }
}
```

6.

Build a production app

You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction):

```sh
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform android --profile production --local` or with Android Studio.

7.

Upload your app manually at least once

You have to upload your app manually at least once. This is a limitation of the Google Play Store API.

Learn how with the [first submission of an Android app](https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission) guide.

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can start the submission process.

Run the following command to submit a build to the Google Play Store:

```sh
eas submit --platform android
```

The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app. You can configure the submission process by adding a submission profile in **eas.json**. Learn about all the options you can provide in the [eas.json reference](/eas/json#android-specific-options-1).

To speed up the submission process, you can use the `--auto-submit` flag to automatically submit a build after it's built:

```sh
eas build --platform android --auto-submit
```

Learn more about the `--auto-submit` flag in the [automate submissions](/build/automate-submissions) guide.

Include your app's package name in **app.json**:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
  }
}
```

6.

Upload your Google Service Account key to EAS dashboard

Then, you need to upload your Google Service Account key to EAS dashboard under project's credentials.

-   Go to your project's EAS dashboard, click **Credentials**, and under **Android**, click your app's **Application identifier**.
-   Under **Service Credentials**, click **Add a Google Service Account Key**.
-   Under **Change Google Service Account Key**, ensure **Upload new key** is selected and upload the downloaded JSON key. This will add the key to your project's credentials.

7.

Build a production app

You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction):

```sh
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform android --profile production --local` or with Android Studio.

8.

You have to upload your app manually at least once. This is a limitation of the Google Play Store API.

Learn how with the [first submission of an Android app](https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission) guide.

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline to submit your app to the Google Play Store.

### Use EAS Workflows CI/CD

You can use [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started) to build and submit your app automatically.

1.  Create a workflow file named **.eas/workflows/submit-android.yml** at the root of your project.
    
2.  Inside **submit-android.yml**, you can use the following workflow to kick off a job that submits an Android app:
    
    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches: ['main']
    
    jobs:
      build_android:
        name: Build Android app
        type: build
        params:
          platform: android
          profile: production
    
      submit_android:
        name: Submit to Google Play Store
        needs: [build_android]
        type: submit
        params:
          profile: production
          build_id: ${{ needs.build_android.outputs.build_id }}
    ```
    
    The workflow above will build the Android app and then submit it to the Google Play Store.
    

### Use other CI/CD services

You can use other CI/CD services to submit your app with EAS Submit, like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and more by running the following command:

```sh
eas submit --platform android --profile production
```

This command requires a [personal access token](/accounts/programmatic-access#personal-access-tokens) to authenticate with your Expo account. Once you have one, provide the `EXPO_TOKEN` environment variable in the CI/CD service, which will allow the `eas submit` command to run.
