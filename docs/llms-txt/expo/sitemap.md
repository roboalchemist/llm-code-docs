# Sitemap

Learn how to use the sitemap to debug your app with Expo Router.

On native, you can use the [`uri-scheme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme) CLI to test opening native links on a device.

For example, if you want to launch the Expo Go app on iOS to the `/form-sheet` route, run:

```sh
npx uri-scheme open exp://192.168.87.39:19000/--/form-sheet --ios
```

> Replace `192.168.87.39:19000` with the IP address shown when running `npx expo start`.

You can also search for links directly in a browser like Safari or Chrome to test deep linking on physical devices. Learn more about [testing deep links](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking).

## Sitemap

Expo Router currently injects a **/_sitemap** automatically that provides a list of all routes in the app. This is useful for debugging.

The sitemap can be removed by adding `sitemap: false` to the `expo-router` config plugin in the app config:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      {
        "sitemap": false
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```
