# Schema for EAS Metadata

A reference of store config in EAS Metadata.

> **EAS Metadata** is in beta and subject to breaking changes.

The store config in EAS Metadata contains information that otherwise would be provided manually through the app store dashboards. This document outlines the structure of the object in your store config.

> If you use the [VS Code Expo Tools extension](https://github.com/expo/vscode-expo#readme), you get all this information through auto-complete, suggestions, and warnings in your editor.

## Config schema

An essential property in the store config object is the `configVersion` property. App stores might require more or change existing information structures to publish your app. This property helps versioning changes that are not backward compatible.

EAS Metadata _currently_ only supports the Apple App Store.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `configVersion` | `number`. enum: 0 | The EAS Metadata store configuration schema version. |
| `apple` | `object`. | All configurable properties for the App Store. |
| `version` | `string`. | The app version to use when syncing all metadata defined in the store config. EAS Metadata selects the latest available version in the app stores by default. |
| `copyright` | `string`. | The name of the person or entity that owns the exclusive rights to the app, preceded by the year the rights were obtained. (for example, "2008 Acme Inc.") |
| `advisory` | [AppleAdvisory](#apple-advisory). | The App Store questionnaire to determine the app's age rating. |
| `categories` | [AppleCategories](#apple-categories). | App Store categories for the app. You can add primary, secondary, and possible subcategories. |
| `info` | Map<[AppleLanguage](#apple-info), [AppleInfo](#apple-info)\>. | The localized App Store presence of your app. |
| `release` | [AppleRelease](#apple-release). | The app release strategy for the selected version. |
| `review` | [AppleReview](#apple-review). | All required information to review the app for the App Store review team, including contact info and credentials. (if applicable) |

### Apple advisory

Apple uses a complex questionnaire to determine the app's [age rating](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev599d50efb). Parental controls on the App Store use this calculated age rating. EAS Metadata uses the least restrictive answer for each of these questions by default.

### Apple release

There are multiple strategies to put the app in the hands of your users. You can release the app automatically after store approval or gradually release an update to your users.

Automatic release after 25th of December, 2022 (UTC)

```json
{
  "configVersion": 0,
  "apple": {
    "release": {
      "automaticRelease": "2022-12-25T00:00:00+00:00"
