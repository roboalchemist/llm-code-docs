# Custom build configuration schema

A reference of configuration options for custom builds with EAS Build.

Creating custom builds for EAS Build helps customize the build process for your project.

## YAML syntax for custom builds

Custom build config files are stored inside the **.eas/build** directory path. They use YAML syntax and must have a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension. If you are new to YAML or want to learn more about the syntax, see [Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

## `build`

Defined to describe a custom build configuration. All config options to create a custom build are specified under it.

### `name`

The name of your custom build that is used to identify it in the build logs. EAS Build uses this property to display the name of your build in the dashboard.

For example, the build name is `Run tests`:

```yaml
build:
  name: Run tests
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - run:
        name: Install dependencies
        command: npm install
```

### `steps`

Steps are used to describe a list of actions, either in the form of commands or function calls. These actions are executed when a custom build runs on EAS Build. You can define single or multiple steps in a build config. However, it is **required** to define at least one step per build.

Each step is configured with the following properties:

#### `steps[].run`

The `run` key is used to trigger a set of instructions. For example, a `run` key is used to install dependencies using the `npm install` command:

```yaml
build:
  name: Install npm dependencies
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - run:
        name: Install dependencies
        command: npm install
```

You can also use `steps[].run` to execute single or multiline shell commands:

```yaml
build:
  name: Run inline shell commands
  steps:
    - run: echo "Hello world"
    - run: |
        echo "Multiline"
        echo "bash commands"
```

#### Use a single step

For example, a build config with the following `steps` will print "Hello world":

```yaml
build:
  name: Greeting
  steps:
    - run: echo "Hello world"
```

> **Note:** `-` before `run` counts as indentation.

#### Use multiple steps

When multiple `steps` are defined, they are executed sequentially. For example, a build config with the following `steps` will first check out the project, install npm dependencies, and then run a command to run tests:

```yaml
build:
  name: Run tests
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - run:
        name: Install dependencies
        command: npm install
    - run:
        name: Run tests
        command: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          npm test
```

#### Sharing environment variables with other steps

Environment variables exported (using `export`) in one step's `command` are not automatically exposed to other steps. To share an environment variable with other steps, use the `set-env` executable.

`set-env` expects to be called with two arguments: environment variable's name and value. For example, `set-env NPM_TOKEN "abcdef"` will expose `$NPM_TOKEN` variable with value `abcdef` to other steps.

> **Note:** Variables shared with `set-env` are not automatically exported locally. You need to call `export` yourself.

```yaml
build:
  name: Shared environment variable example
  steps:
    - run:
        name: Set environment variables
        command: |
          set -x

          # Set variable
          ENV_TEST_LOCAL="present-only-in-current-shell-context"
          # Set and export variable
          export ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT="present-in-current-step"
          # Set shared variable
          set-env ENV_TEST_SET_ENV "present-in-following-steps"

          # Will print "ENV_TEST_LOCAL: present-only-in-current-shell-context"
          # because current shell has access to this local variable.
          echo "ENV_TEST_LOCAL: $ENV_TEST_LOCAL"

          # Will print "ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT: present-in-current-step"
          # because export also sets the local variable value.
          echo "ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT: $ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT"

          # Will "ENV_TEST_SET_ENV: "
          # because set-env does not set or export variables.
          echo "ENV_TEST_SET_ENV: $ENV_TEST_SET_ENV"

          # Will only print LOCALLY_EXPORTED_ENV,
          # because it is the only export-ed variable.
          env | grep ENV_TEST_
    - run:
        name: Check variables values in next step
        command: |
          set -x

          # Will print "ENV_TEST_LOCAL: ", because ENV_TEST_LOCAL
          # is only a local variable in previous step.
          echo "ENV_TEST_LOCAL: $ENV_TEST_LOCAL"

          # Will print "ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT: "
          # because export does not share a variable to other steps.
          echo "ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT: $ENV_TEST_LOCAL_EXPORT"

          # Will print "ENV_TEST_SET_ENV: present-in-following-steps"
          # because set-env "exported" variable to other steps.
          echo "ENV_TEST_SET_ENV: $ENV_TEST_SET_ENV"

          # Will only print ENV_TEST_SET_ENV,
          # because set-env "exported" it to other steps.
          env | grep ENV_TEST_
```

#### `steps[].run.name`

The name used in build logs to display the name of the step.

#### `steps[].run.command`

The `command` defines a custom shell command to run when a step is executed. It is **required** to define a command for each step. It can be a multiline shell command:

```yaml
build:
  name: Run tests
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - run:
        name: Run tests
        command: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          npm test
```

#### `steps[].run.working_directory`

The `working_directory` is used to define an existing directory from the project's root directory. After an existing path is defined in a step, using it changes the current directory for that step. For example, a step is created to list all the assets inside the **assets** directory, which is a directory in your Expo project. The `working_directory` is set to `assets`:

```yaml
build:
  name: Demo
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - run:
        name: List assets
        working_directory: assets
        command: ls -la
```

#### `steps[].run.shell`

Used to define the default executable shell for a step. For example, the step's shell is set to `/bin/sh`:

```yaml
build:
  name: Demo
  steps:
    - run:
        shell: /bin/sh
        command: |
          echo "Steps can use another shell"
          ps -p $$
```

#### `steps[].run.inputs`

Input values are provided to a step. For example, you can use `input` to provide a value:

```yaml
build:
  name: Demo
  steps:
    - run:
        name: Say Hi
        inputs:
          name: Expo
        command: echo "Hi, ${ inputs.name }!"
```

#### `steps[].run.outputs`

An output value is expected during a step. For example, a step has an output value of `Hello world`:

```yaml
build:
  name: Demo
  steps:
    - run:
        name: Produce output
        outputs: [value]
        command: |
          echo "Producing output for another step"
          set-output value "Output from another step..."
```

#### `steps[].run.outputs.required`

An output value can use a boolean to indicate if the output value is required or not. For example, a function does not have a required output value:

```yaml
build:
  name: Demo
  steps:
    - run:
        name: Produce another output
        id: id456
        outputs:
          - required_param
          - name: optional_param
            required: false
        command: |
          echo "Producing more output"
          set-output required_param "abc 123 456"
```

#### `steps[].run.id`

Defining an `id` for a step allows:

-   Calling the same function that produces one or more outputs multiple times
-   Using the output from one step to another

#### Call the same function one or more times

For example, the following function generates a random number:

```yaml
functions:
  random:
    name: Generate random number
    outputs: [value]
    command: set-output value `random_number`
```

In a build config, let's use the `random` function to generate two random numbers and print them:

```yaml
build:
  name: Functions Demo
  steps:
    - random:
        id: random_1
    - random:
        id: random_2
    - run:
        name: Print random numbers
        inputs:
          random_1: ${ steps.random_1.value }
          random_2: ${ steps.random_2.value }
        command: |
          echo "${ inputs.random_1 }"
          echo "${ inputs.random_2 }"
```

#### Use output from one step to another

For example, the following build config demonstrates how to use output from one step to another:

```yaml
build:
  name: Outputs demo
  steps:
    - run:
        name: Produce output
        id: id123 # <---- !!!
        outputs: [foo]
        command: |
          echo "Producing output for another step"
          set-output foo bar
    - run:
        name: Use output from another step
        inputs:
          foo: ${ steps.id123.foo }
        command: |
          echo "foo = \"${ inputs.foo }\""
```

## `functions`

Defined to describe a reusable function that can be used in a build config. All config options to create a function are specified with the following properties:

### `functions.[function_name]`

The `[function_name]` is the name of a function that you define to identify it in the `build.steps`. For example, you can define a function with the name `greetings`:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
```

### `functions.[function_name].name`

The name that is used in build logs to display the name of the function. For example, a function with the display name `Say Hi!`:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
```

### `functions.[function_name].inputs`

Input values are provided to a function.

#### `inputs[].name`

The name of the input value. It is used as an identifier to access the input value such as in bash command interpolation.

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    inputs:
      - name: name
        default_value: Hello world
    command: echo "${ inputs.name }!"
```

#### `inputs[].required`

Boolean to indicate if the input value is required or not. For example, a function does not have a required value:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    inputs:
      - name: name
        required: false
```

#### `inputs[].type`

The type of the input value. It can be either `string`, `num` or `json`.

Input values set in the function call as well as `default_value` and `allowed_values` for the function are validated against the type.

The default input `type` is `string`.

For example, a function has an input value of type `string`:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    inputs:
      - name: name
        type: string
      - name: age
        type: num
      - name: other_data
        type: json
```

#### `inputs[].default_value`

You can use `default_value` to provide one default input. For example, a function has a default value of `Hello world`:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    inputs:
      - name: name
        default_value: Hello world
```

#### `inputs[].allowed_values`

You can use `allowed_values` to provide multiple values in an array. For example, a function has multiple allowed values:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    inputs:
      - name: name
        default_value: Hello world
        allowed_values: [Hi, Hello, Hey]
        type: string
```

#### Multiple input values

Multiple input values can be provided to a function.

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    inputs:
      - name: name
        default_value: Expo
      - name: greeting
        default_value: Hi
        allowed_values: [Hi, Hello]
    command: echo "${ inputs.greeting }, ${ inputs.name }!"
```

### `functions.[function_name].outputs`

An output value is expected from a function. For example, a function has an output value of `Hello world`:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    outputs: [value]
    command: set-output value "Hello world"
```

#### `outputs[].name`

The name of the output value. It is used as an identifier to access the output value in another step:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    outputs:
      - name: name
```

#### `outputs[].required`

Boolean to indicate if the output value is required or not. For example, a function does not have a required output value:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    outputs:
      - name: value
        required: false
```

### `functions.[function_name].command`

Used to define the command to run when a function is executed, if you wish the function to be a simple shell script. Each function is **required** to define either a `command` or a `path` to JS/TS module implementing the function. For example, the command `echo "Hello world"` is used to print a message:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    command: echo "Hi!"
```

### `functions.[function_name].path`

Used to define the path to a JavaScript/TypeScript module implementing the function. Each function is **required** to define either a `command` or a `path` property. For example, the path `./greetings` is used to execute a `greetings` function declared in the `greetings` module:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    path: ./greetings
```

> [Learn more about building and using custom TypeScript/JavaScript functions](/custom-builds/functions).

### `functions.[function_name].shell`

Used to define the default executable shell for a step where a function is executed. For example, the step's shell is set to `/bin/sh`:

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    shell: /bin/sh
    command: echo "Hi!"
```

### `functions.[function_name].supported_platforms`

Used to define the supported platforms for a function. Defaults to all platforms. Allowed platforms: `darwin`, `linux`.

For example, the function's supported platform is `darwin` (macOS):

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    name: Say Hi!
    supported_platforms: [darwin]
    command: echo "Hi!"
```

## `import`

A config file path list used to import functions from other config files. Imported files cannot have the `build` section.

For example, the following build config imports two files and calls two imported functions - `say_hi` and `say_bye`.

```yaml
import:
  - common-functions.yml
  - another-file.yml

build:
  steps:
    - say_hi
    - say_bye
```

```yaml
functions:
  say_hi:
    name: Say Hi!
    command: echo "Hi!"
```

```yaml
functions:
  say_bye:
    name: Say bye :(
    command: echo "Bye!"
```

## Functions

### Built-in EAS functions

EAS provides a set of built-in reusable functions that you can use in a build config without defining the function definition.

> **Tip:** Any function that is built-in and provided by EAS must start with the `eas/` prefix.

#### `eas/build`

The all-in-one function that encapsulates the entire EAS Build build process. It resolves the best build configuration based on your build profile's settings from [**eas.json**](/eas/json).

It's ideal for people who want to have the build done without worrying about altering and configuring the build process manually. It can be a great starting point for your custom build configuration if you are interested in using other custom steps before or after the build process and you don't want to change the build process itself.

```yaml
build:
  name: Run a build using a single command
  steps:
    - eas/build
```

To have more control over the build process and customize it as per your requirements, see the following custom functions and steps that run in the background by `eas/build`. They are executed as a build process based on your build profile's configuration.

You can replace the `eas/build` command call by using these steps in your YAML configuration file:

[ios-simulator-build.yml](https://github.com/expo/eas-custom-builds-example/blob/main/.eas/build/ios-simulator-build.yml) — View the steps executed behind the scenes by the \`eas/build\` function for an iOS simulator build in our example repository.

[ios-credentials-build.yml](https://github.com/expo/eas-custom-builds-example/blob/main/.eas/build/ios-build-with-credentials.yml) — View the steps executed behind the scenes by the \`eas/build\` function for an iOS build with credentials in our example repository.

[android-build-without-credentials.yml](https://github.com/expo/eas-custom-builds-example/blob/main/.eas/build/android-build-without-credentials.yml) — View the steps executed behind the scenes by the \`eas/build\` function for an Android build without credentials in our example repository.

[android-build-with-credentials.yml](https://github.com/expo/eas-custom-builds-example/blob/main/.eas/build/android-build-with-credentials.yml) — View the steps executed behind the scenes by the \`eas/build\` function for an Android build with credentials in our example repository.

##### Known limitations

-   It doesn't accept any inputs, and the resolved build process will be configured based on your build profile from [**eas.json**](/eas/json).
-   The build process produced by `eas/build` is not configurable and you can't customize it. If you need to customize the build process, use the subset of functions and steps that are executed behind the scenes by this function and configure them manually in the YAML configuration file, as shown in the examples above.

#### `eas/maestro_test`

All-in-one function that installs Maestro, prepares a testing environment (Android Emulator or iOS Simulator), and tests the app.

> Your project must be configured to use the old Build Infrastructure to start Android Emulator. Go to [Project settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject%5D/settings) to configure. See [this changelog post](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/08-29-c3d-default) for more information.

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flow_path` | `string` | Path (or multiple paths, each in a separate line) to [Maestro flows](https://docs.maestro.dev/getting-started/writing-your-first-flow) to run. |
| `app_path` | `string` | Path (or regex pattern) to the emulator/simulator app that should be tested. If not provided, it defaults to **android/app/build/outputs/\*\*/\*.apk** for Android and to **ios/build/Build/Products/\*simulator/\*.app** for iOS. |

```yaml
build:
  name: Build and test
  steps:
    - eas/build
    - eas/maestro_test:
        inputs:
          flow_path: |
            maestro/sign_in.yml
            maestro/create_post.yml
            maestro/sign_out.yml
```

```yaml
build:
  name: Build and test iOS simulator app
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - eas/maestro_test:
        app_path: ./fixtures/my_app.app
        inputs:
          flow_path: |
            maestro/sign_in.yml
            maestro/create_post.yml
            maestro/sign_out.yml
```

```yaml
build:
  name: Build and test Android emulator app
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - eas/maestro_test:
        app_path: ./fixtures/my_app.apk
        inputs:
          flow_path: |
            maestro/sign_in.yml
            maestro/create_post.yml
            maestro/sign_out.yml
```

Behind the scenes, it uses:

-   [`eas/install_maestro`](/custom-builds/schema#easinstall_maestro) to install Maestro
-   [`eas/start_android_emulator`](/custom-builds/schema#easstart_android_emulator) to start an Android Emulator if needed
-   [`eas/start_ios_simulator`](/custom-builds/schema#easstart_ios_simulator) to start an iOS Simulator if needed
-   Custom `run` to install **.apk** to the running Android Emulator and **.app** to iOS Simulator
-   Series of `run` to execute `maestro test` for each of the provided flows
-   [`eas/upload_artifact`](/custom-builds/schema#easupload_artifact) to upload Maestro test artifacts as build artifact

> We have observed that Maestro tests often time out if run on images with Xcode 15.0 or 15.2. Use the `latest` image to avoid any issues.

If you need to customize the Maestro version, run a specific Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, or upload multiple build artifacts you will need to write this series of steps yourself.

#### `eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts`

> **You can currently upload each artifact type only once per build job.**  
> If you use [`eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts`](/custom-builds/schema#easfind_and_upload_build_artifacts) while having [`buildArtifactPaths`](/eas/json#buildartifactpaths) configured in your build profile and the step finds and uploads some build artifacts, any following `eas/upload_artifact` step will fail.  
> To solve this, for now, we recommend removing `buildArtifactPaths` from custom build's profiles and uploading artifacts manually with `eas/upload_artifact` in the YAML if you need to call it there.

Automatically finds and uploads application archive, additional build artifacts, and Xcode logs from the default locations and using the [`buildArtifactPaths`](/eas/json#buildartifactpaths) configuration. Uploads found artifacts to the EAS servers.

```yaml
build:
  name: Build iOS app
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - eas/install_node_modules
    - eas/resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials:
        id: resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials
    - eas/prebuild:
        inputs:

#### `eas/upload_artifact`

Uploads build artifacts from provided paths.

> **You can currently upload each artifact type only once per build job.**  
> If you use [`eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts`](/custom-builds/schema#easfind_and_upload_build_artifacts) while having [`buildArtifactPaths`](/eas/json#buildartifactpaths) configured in your build profile and the step finds and uploads some build artifacts, any following `eas/upload_artifact` step will fail.  
> To solve this, for now, we recommend removing `buildArtifactPaths` from custom build's profiles and uploading artifacts manually with `eas/upload_artifact` in the YAML if you need to call it there.

For example, a build config with the following `steps` will upload an artifact to the EAS servers:

```yaml
build:
  name: Upload artifacts
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    # - ...
    - eas/upload_artifact:
        name: Upload application archive
        inputs:
          path: fixtures/app-debug.apk
    - eas/upload_artifact:
        name: Upload artifacts
        inputs:
          type: build-artifact
          path: |
            assets/*.jpg
            assets/*.png
```

| Input | Type | Description |

#### `eas/start_android_emulator`

Starts an Android Emulator you can use to test your apps on. Only available when running a build for Android.

> Your project must be configured to use the old Build Infrastructure to start Android Emulator. Go to [Project settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject%5D/settings) to configure. See [this changelog post](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/08-29-c3d-default) for more information.

```yaml
build:
  name: Build and test
  steps:
    - eas/build
    - eas/start_android_emulator:
        inputs:
          system_image_package: system-images;android-30;default;x86_64
    # ... Maestro setup and tests
```

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `device_name` | `string` | Name for the created device. You can customize it if starting multiple emulators. |
| `system_image_package` | `string` | Android package path to use for the emulator. For example, `system-images;android-30;default;x86_64`.To get a list of available system images, run [`sdkmanager --list`](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdkmanager#list) on a local computer. VMs run on x86_64 architecture, so always choose `x86_64` package variants. The [`sdkmanager` tool](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdkmanager) comes from Android SDK command-line tools. |

#### `eas/send_slack_message`

Sends a specified message to a configured [Slack webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks), which then posts it in the related Slack channel. The message can be specified as plain text or as a [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) message. With both cases, you can reference build job properties and [use other steps outputs](/custom-builds/schema#use-output-from-one-step-to-another) in the message for dynamic evaluation. For example, `'Build URL: ${ eas.job.expoBuildUrl }'`, `Build finished with status: ${ steps.run_fastlane.status_text }`, `Build failed with error: ${ steps.run_gradle.error_text }`. Either "message" or "payload" has to be specified, but not both.

### Using built-in EAS functions to build an app

Using the built-in EAS functions you can recreate the default EAS Build process for different build types.

For example, to trigger a build that creates internal distribution build for Android and a simulator build for iOS you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  ... 
  "build": {
    ... 
    "developmentBuild": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "config": "development-build-android.yml"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true,
        "config": "development-build-ios.yml"
      }
    }
    ... 
  }
  ... 
}
```

```yaml
build:
  name: Simple internal distribution Android build
  steps:
    - eas/checkout

    - eas/install_node_modules

    - eas/prebuild

    - eas/inject_android_credentials

    - eas/run_gradle

    - eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts
```

```yaml
build:
  name: Simple simulator iOS build
  steps:
    - eas/checkout

    - eas/install_node_modules

    - eas/prebuild

    - run:
        name: Install pods
        working_directory: ./ios
        command: pod install

    - eas/generate_gymfile_from_template

    - eas/run_fastlane

    - eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts
```

To create a Google Play Store build for Android and an Apple App Store build for iOS you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  ... 
  "build": {
    ... 
    "productionBuild": {
      "android": {
        "config": "production-build-android.yml"
      },
      "ios": {
        "config": "production-build-ios.yml"
      }
    }
    ... 
  }
  ... 
}
```

```yaml
build:
  name: Customized Android Play Store build example
  steps:
    - eas/checkout

    - eas/install_node_modules

    - eas/prebuild

    - eas/inject_android_credentials

    - eas/run_gradle

    - eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts
```

```yaml
build:
  name: Customized iOS App Store build example
  steps:
    - eas/checkout

    - eas/install_node_modules

    - eas/resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials:
        id: resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials

    - eas/prebuild:
        inputs:
          apple_team_id: ${ steps.resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials.apple_team_id }

    - run:
        name: Install pods
        working_directory: ./ios
        command: pod install

    - eas/configure_ios_credentials

    - eas/generate_gymfile_from_template:
        inputs:
          credentials: ${ eas.job.secrets.buildCredentials }

    - eas/run_fastlane

    - eas/find_and_upload_build_artifacts
```

Check out the **example repository** for more detailed examples:

[Custom build example repository](https://github.com/expo/eas-custom-builds-example/tree/main) — A custom EAS Build example that includes examples for custom builds such as setting up functions, using environment variables, uploading artifacts, and more.

### Use a reusable function in a `build`

For example, a custom build config with the following reusable function contains a single command to print a message that is echoed.

```yaml
functions:
  greetings:
    - name: name
      default_value: Hello world
    inputs: [value]
    command: echo "${ inputs.name }, { inputs.value }"
```

The above function can be used in a `build` as follows:

```yaml
build:
  name: Functions Demo
  steps:
    - greetings:
        inputs:
          value: Expo
```

> **Tip:** `build.steps` can execute multiple reusable `functions` sequentially.

## Override values in a `build`

You can override values for the following properties:

-   `working_directory`
-   `name`
-   `shell`

For example, a reusable function called `list_files`:

```yaml
functions:
  list_files:
    name: List files
    command: ls -la
```

When `list_files` is called in a build config, it lists all files in the root directory of a project:

```yaml
build:
  name: List files
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - list_files
```

You can use the `working_directory` property to override the behavior in the function call to list the files in a different directory by specifying the path to that directory:

```yaml
build:
  name: List files
    steps:
      - eas/checkout
      - list_files:
          working_directory: /a/b/c
```
