# Expo KeepAwake

A React component that prevents the screen from sleeping when rendered.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-keep-awake` provides a React hook that prevents the screen from sleeping and a pair of functions to enable this behavior imperatively.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-keep-awake
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Example: hook

```jsx
import { useKeepAwake } from 'expo-keep-awake';
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function KeepAwakeExample() {
  useKeepAwake();
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>This screen will never sleep!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Example: functions

```jsx
import { activateKeepAwake, deactivateKeepAwake } from 'expo-keep-awake';
import React from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';

export default class KeepAwakeExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Button onPress={this._activate} title="Activate" />
        <Button onPress={this._deactivate} title="Deactivate" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  _activate = () => {
    activateKeepAwake();
    alert('Activated!');
  };

  _deactivate = () => {
    deactivateKeepAwake();
    alert('Deactivated!');
  };
}
```

## API

```js
import * as KeepAwake from 'expo-keep-awake';
```

## Constants

### `KeepAwake.ExpoKeepAwakeTag`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `'ExpoKeepAwakeDefaultTag'`

Default tag, used when no tag has been specified in keep awake method calls.

## Hooks

### `useKeepAwake(tag, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag`(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, an ID unique to the owner component is used. |
| `options`(optional) | [KeepAwakeOptions](#keepawakeoptions) | Additional options for the keep awake hook. |

  

A React hook to keep the screen awake for as long as the owner component is mounted. The optionally provided `tag` argument is used when activating and deactivating the keep-awake feature. If unspecified, an ID unique to the owner component is used. See the documentation for `activateKeepAwakeAsync` below to learn more about the `tag` argument.

Returns: `void`

## Methods

> **Deprecated:** use `activateKeepAwakeAsync` instead.

### `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwake(tag)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag`(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, the default tag is used. Default: `ExpoKeepAwakeTag` |

  

Prevents the screen from sleeping until `deactivateKeepAwake` is called with the same `tag` value.

If the `tag` argument is specified, the screen will not sleep until you call `deactivateKeepAwake` with the same `tag` argument. When using multiple `tags` for activation you'll have to deactivate each one in order to re-enable screen sleep. If tag is unspecified, the default `tag` is used.

Web support [is limited](https://caniuse.com/wake-lock).

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwakeAsync(tag)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
