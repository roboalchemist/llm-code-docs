# react-native-maps

A library that provides a Map component that uses Google Maps on Android and Apple Maps or Google Maps on iOS.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`react-native-maps` provides a Map component that uses Google Maps on Android and Apple Maps or Google Maps on iOS.

No additional setup is required when testing your project using Expo Go. However, **to deploy the app binary on app stores** additional steps are required for Google Maps. For more information, see the [instructions below](/versions/latest/sdk/map-view#deploy-app-with-google-maps).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-maps
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## Usage

See full documentation at [`react-native-maps/react-native-maps`](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MapView from 'react-native-maps';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <MapView style={styles.map} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  map: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
});
```

## Deploy app with Google Maps

### Android

> If you have already registered a project for another Google service on Android, such as Google Sign In, you enable the **Maps SDK for Android** on your project and jump to step 4.

#### Register a Google Cloud API project and enable the Maps SDK for Android

-   Open your browser to the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and create a project.
-   Once it's created, go to the project and enable the **Maps SDK for Android**.

#### Copy your app's SHA-1 certificate fingerprint

-   **If you are deploying your app to the Google Play Store**, you'll need to [upload your app binary to Google Play console](/submit/android) at least once. This is required for Google to generate your app signing credentials.
-   Go to the **[Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) > (your app) > Test and release > App integrity > Play app signing > Settings > App signing key certificate**.
-   Copy the value of **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**.

#### Create an API key

-   Go to [Google Cloud Credential manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials**, then **API Key**.
-   In the modal, click **Edit API key**.
-   Under **Key restrictions** > **Application restrictions**, choose **Android apps**.
-   Under **Restrict usage to your Android apps**, click **Add an item**.
-   Add your `android.package` from **app.json** (for example: `com.company.myapp`) to the package name field.
-   Then, add the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint's** value from step 2.
-   Click **Done** and then click **Save**.

#### Add the API key to your project

Since you are using Google as the map provider, you need to add the API key to the `react-native-maps` [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). Copy your **API Key** into your project to either a **.env** file or copy it directly and then add it to your app config under the `plugins.react-native-maps.androidGoogleMapsApiKey` field like:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-maps",
        {
          "androidGoogleMapsApiKey": "process.env.YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

-   In your code, import `{ PROVIDER_GOOGLE }` from `react-native-maps` and add the property `provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}` to your `<MapView>`. This property works on both Android and iOS.
-   Rebuild the app binary (or re-submit to the Google Play Store in case your app is already uploaded). An easy way to test if the configuration was successful is to do an [emulator build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build#build-the-native-app-ios-simulator).

### iOS

> If you have already registered a project for another Google service on iOS, such as Google Sign In, you enable the **Maps SDK for iOS** on your project and jump to step 3.

#### Register a Google Cloud API project and enable the Maps SDK for iOS

-   Open your browser to the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and create a project.
-   Then, go to the project, click **Enable APIs and Services** and enable the **Maps SDK for iOS**.

#### Create an API key

-   Go to [Google Cloud Credential manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials**, then **API Key**.
-   In the modal, click **Edit API key**.
-   Under **Key restrictions** > **Application restrictions**, choose **iOS apps**.
-   Under **Accept requests from an iOS application with one of these bundle identifiers**, click the **Add an item** button.
-   Add your `ios.bundleIdentifier` from **app.json** (for example: `com.company.myapp`) to the bundle ID field.
-   Click **Done** and then click **Save**.

#### Add the API key to your project

Since you are using Google as the map provider, you need to add the API key to the `react-native-maps` [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). Copy your **API Key** into your project to either a **.env** file or copy it directly and then add it to your app config under the `plugins.react-native-maps.iosGoogleMapsApiKey` field like:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-maps",
        {
          "iosGoogleMapsApiKey": "process.env.YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

-   In your code, import `{ PROVIDER_GOOGLE }` from `react-native-maps` and add the property `provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}` to your `<MapView>`. This property works on both Android and iOS.
-   Rebuild the app binary. An easy way to test if the configuration was successful is to do a [simulator build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build#build-the-native-app-ios-simulator).
