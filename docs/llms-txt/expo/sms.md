# Expo SMS

A library that provides access to the system's UI/app for sending SMS messages.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-sms` provides access to the system's UI/app for sending SMS messages.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sms
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## API

```js
import * as SMS from 'expo-sms';
```

## Methods

### `SMS.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determines whether SMS is available. Always returns `false` in the iOS simulator, and in browser.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise that fulfils with a `boolean`, indicating whether SMS is available on this device.

Example

```ts
const isAvailable = await SMS.isAvailableAsync();
if (isAvailable) {
  // do your SMS stuff here
} else {
  // misfortune... there's no SMS available on this device
}
```

### `SMS.sendSMSAsync(addresses, message, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `addresses` | `string | string[]` | An array of addresses (phone numbers) or single address passed as strings. Those would appear as recipients of the prepared message. |
| `message` | `string` | Message to be sent. |
| `options`(optional) | [SMSOptions](#smsoptions) | A `SMSOptions` object defining additional SMS configuration options. |

  

Opens the default UI/app for sending SMS messages with prefilled addresses and message.

Returns: `Promise<smsresponse>`

Returns a Promise that fulfils with the SMS action is invoked by the user, with corresponding result:

-   If the user cancelled the SMS sending process: `{ result: 'cancelled' }`.
-   If the user has sent/scheduled message for sending: `{ result: 'sent' }`.
-   If the status of the SMS message cannot be determined: `{ result: 'unknown' }`.

Android does not provide information about the status of the SMS message, so on Android devices the Promise will always resolve with `{ result: 'unknown' }`.

> Note: The only feedback collected by this module is whether any message has been sent. That means we do not check actual content of message nor recipients list.

Example

```ts
const { result } = await SMS.sendSMSAsync(
  ['0123456789', '9876543210'],
  'My sample HelloWorld message',
  {
    attachments: {
      uri: 'path/myfile.png',
      mimeType: 'image/png',
      filename: 'myfile.png',
    },
  }
);
```

| --- | --- | --- |
| filename | `string` | The filename of the attachment. |
| mimeType | `string` | The mime type of the attachment such as `image/png`. |
