# Distribution: Overview

An overview of submitting an app to the app stores or with the internal distribution.

Get your app into the hands of users by submitting it to the app stores or with [Internal Distribution](/build/internal-distribution).

```sh
npm i -g eas-cli
eas build --auto-submit
eas submit
```

You can run `eas build --auto-submit` with [EAS CLI](/eas) to build your app and automatically upload the binary for distribution on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

This automatically manages **all native code signing** for Android and iOS for any React Native app. Advanced features such as payments, notifications, universal links, and iCloud can be automatically enabled based on your [config plugins](/config-plugins/introduction) or native entitlements, meaning no more wrestling with slow portals to get libraries set up correctly.
