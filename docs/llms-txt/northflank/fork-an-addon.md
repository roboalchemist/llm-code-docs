# Fork an addon

You can fork an addon to create a duplicate of an existing addon. You can use this to easily clone an addon for development and testing, or to safely migrate to an addon with a different major version or configuration.

You can create a duplicate of an existing addon manually, or in a template. The newly forked addon may have a newer minor version than the source backup, but must have the same major version.

Forking is currently available for the following addons:

- PostgreSQL

- MongoDB

- MySQL

## Create an addon from a backup

You can fork an addon by creating an addon of the same type. You must have an existing addon that contains a disk backup of the same major version as the fork addon.

In the advanced section of addon creation, expand the fork existing addon option. Select the addon you want to clone, and select the disk backup to use when creating the new forked addon. Click create addon and your forked addon will begin provisioning with the data from your source addon.

Your newly-forked addon will display the source addon it was created from, but will be entirely separate from the source addon.

## Fork an addon in a template

You can create a backup of an existing addon and fork it in a [template](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/infrastructure-as-code/write-a-template). This is particularly useful in preview environments, where you may want to use existing data to preview your changes or test a migration, without potentially corrupting your existing databases.

You can use the run backup node to schedule a disk backup of an addon, and open fork existing addon in an addon node to enter the source addon and backup. If your addon already contains usable backups, for example from a [backup schedule](backup-restore-and-import-data#schedule-backups), you can use `latest` as the `backupId` to fork from the most recent backup.

Below is an example of taking a backup and using the reference (`${refs.sourceData}`) to get the addon (`addonId`) and the backup (`id`). You can ensure the new addon is the same version as the source backup by using the reference property `config.addonVersion`.
