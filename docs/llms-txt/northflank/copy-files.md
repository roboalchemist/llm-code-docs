# Copy files

Northflank allows you to download resources from your running workloads (services or jobs) and upload resources from your local machine to workloads.

File and directory copy is available via the [Northflank CLI](/docs/v1/api/use-the-cli) or [JavaScript client](/docs/v1/api/use-the-javascript-client) and enables you to copy single files or entire directories.

## Copy files using the CLI

You can easily transfer files and directories using the [Northflank CLI](/docs/v1/api/use-the-cli).

- To upload a single file to a running service:

```bash
northflank upload service file --projectId [project-name] --service [service-name] --localPath test.txt --remotePath test-file.txt
```

- To upload a directory to a running service:

```bash
northflank upload service file --projectId [project-name] --service [service-name] --localPath my-directory/ --remotePath /home/my-directory
```

- To download a directory from a running service:

```bash
northflank download service file --projectId [project-name] --service [service-name] --localPath my-directory --remotePath /home/my-directory
```

For jobs, the analog commands can be used: `northflank [download|upload] job file <args>`

> [!note] 
> If the target directory does not exist, it will be created.
Some arguments are optional in specific scenarios:

- For downloads, the `--localPath` argument can be omitted. In this case the current working directory from which the CLI is started is used to stored the downloaded files.

- For uploads, the `--remotePath` argument can be omitted. In this case the default home directory of the container user is used to stored the downloaded files.

Refer to the command help for a full view of all allowed CLI arguments:

`northflank upload service file --help`

## Copy files with the JavaScript client

The [JavaScript client](/docs/v1/api/use-the-javascript-client) provides functionality which allows copying file and directories programmatically.
To copy files, the JS client exposes upload and download modules which expect a localPath and a remotePath:

```js
const res = await apiClient.upload.service.files({ projectId, serviceId }, { localPath, remotePath, });
```

```js
const res = await apiClient.download.service.files({ projectId, serviceId }, { localPath, remotePath, });
```

Both commands can be used for services and jobs.
