    # How to generate an API Key?

    - **Organization dropdown** > **Organization Settings** > **API Keys**


    # JSON:API Specification

    Rootly is using **JSON:API** (https://jsonapi.org) specification:

    - JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources
    be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.

    - JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the
    amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is
    achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

    - JSON:API requires use of the JSON:API media type
    (**application/vnd.api+json**) for exchanging data.


    # Authentication and Requests

    We use standard HTTP Authentication over HTTPS to authorize your requests.

    ```
      curl --request GET \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \

    --url https://api.rootly.com/v1/incidents

    ```


    <br/>


    # Rate limiting

    - There is a default limit of **5** **GET**, **HEAD**, and **OPTIONS** calls
    **per API key** every **60 seconds** (0 hours). The limit is calculated over
    a **0-hour sliding window** looking back from the current time. While the
    limit can be configured to support higher thresholds, you must first contact
    your **Rootly Customer Success Manager** to make any adjustments.

    - There is a default limit of **3** **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH** or
    **DELETE** calls **per API key** every **60 seconds** (0 hours). The limit
    is calculated over a **0-hour sliding window** looking back from the current
    time. While the limit can be configured to support higher thresholds, you
    must first contact your **Rootly Customer Success Manager** to make any
    adjustments.

    - When rate limits are exceeded, the API will return a **429 Too Many
    Requests** HTTP status code with the response: `{"error": "Rate limit
    exceeded. Try again later."}`

    - **X-RateLimit headers** are included in every API response, providing
    real-time rate limit information:
      - **X-RateLimit-Limit** - The maximum number of requests permitted and the time window (e.g., "1000, 1000;window=3600" for 1000 requests per hour)
      - **X-RateLimit-Remaining** - The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window
      - **X-RateLimit-Used** - The number of requests already made in the current window
      - **X-RateLimit-Reset** - The time at which the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch seconds

    # Pagination

    - Pagination is supported for all endpoints that return a collection of
    items.

    - Pagination is controlled by the **page** query parameter


    ## Example

    ```
      curl --request GET \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \

    --url https://api.rootly.com/v1/incidents?page[number]=1&page[size]=10
