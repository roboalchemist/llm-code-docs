# Introducing "Voice Usage"

In this release, a new usage report  `Voice Usage` has been introduced in the `Settings` section.

This page helps you to track the anticipated voice billing usage associated with the company’s license configuration. It allows you to track monthly incoming and outgoing calls on your account and export usage reports for further analysis.

Click your `Profile` icon at the top-right corner, navigate to `Settings -> Usage Reports` to access the `Voice Usage` option.&#x20;
