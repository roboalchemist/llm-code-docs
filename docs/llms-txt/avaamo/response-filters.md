# Response filters

You can configure response filters based on the user properties, such as location, manager status, or exempt/non-exempt status. Later, you can use these response filters to filter skill responses for the same user intent in an agent. \
\
**Example**: In an HR agent, consider the user query "When is the year-end bonus paid?". Bonus paid for Indian and US employees can be different. You can define multiple responses for an intent based on user properties, so the agent’s response differs for an Indian user and a US user.
