### **Pre-Call**

* The agent logs in to the Agent Assist widget, ensuring they are ready to handle incoming calls. Refer [Login to Avaamo Agent Assist](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/get-started/login-to-avaamo-agent-assist), for more information.

### **On-Call**

* The agent receives an incoming call from a user. Refer [Handling New Call Transcripts](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/transcripts-view#handling-new-call-transcripts), for more information.
* As the user begins asking their query, the agent listens and responds accordingly.
* The agent utilizes the [Knowledge Assist](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/knowledge-assist) and [Recommendations](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/recommendations) tabs to access relevant information and provide accurate responses.
* Agent Assist analyzes the user’s sentiment in real-time and displays it within the transcript, helping the agent adjust their tone or response to align with the user's mood.
* A live conversation transcript is available, allowing the agent to reference key details during the call.

### **Post-Call**

* After the call ends, the widget automatically redirects to the [Summary](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/summary) tab.
* The agent reviews the summary of the last attended call, which includes key points and decisions.
* The agent can transfer the summary directly to the integrated CRM or modify it before finalizing the entry.
