# View job version history

You can view different versions of a job by clicking the dropdown option located at the top-right corner of the job.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This option is available only for `SharePoint`, `ServiceNow`, and `Website` connectors.
{% endhint %}

This feature is handy if you have used **Auto sync** or **Sync Now**. It allows you to access the history of article synchronizations for the job. By comparing different versions, you can identify what content has been updated, added, or changed over time. This helps ensure that you always have a clear record of changes and can track updates efficiently.

To view different versions of a job:

1. Navigate to the **Jobs** list and select the job you want to review.
2. Locate the dropdown menu at the top-right corner of the page. Click the dropdown and choose a version from the list of available options.\
   The selected version of the job, along with its ingested articles or documents, is displayed.
