# Summary

The `Call Summarization` feature in Avaamo Agent Assist streamlines post-call workflows by generating concise summaries of long conversations. This capability is designed to help agents quickly capture essential details and decisions, ensuring that important information is easily accessible for future reference.

This saves agents time, enhances information accuracy, and ensures that key insights are preserved for future use, improving both customer service and record-keeping efficiency.

Once a call ends, `Agent Assist` automatically generates a summary of the entire conversation. The summary includes the following elements:

* **Caller Name**: Identifies the name of the caller from the conversation.
* **Call Reasons**: Lists one or more reasons for the caller’s contact with the helpdesk.
* **Call Tags**: Assign labels to categorize each conversation for better insights and quick retrieval of call records.
* **Agent Actions**: Documents the various actions the agent performed during the call, such as verifying the user, looking up a patient record, or sending a nurse.
* **Agent Promises**: Records any commitments you made that require follow-up, outlining action items to be fulfilled for the caller after the call concludes.
* **Call Sentiment**: Displays the overall sentiment detected during the call. This sentiment reflects how the conversation progressed and concluded; a call that ends positively shows a positive sentiment, while a call that does not end well may be marked as negative.
* **Summary**: Provides a brief overview generated by Agent Assist, capturing the key points of the conversation while excluding any sensitive information.

**How to use Call Summarization:**

After a call ends, Agent Assist automatically generates a summary within a few seconds and redirects the agent to the **Summary** tab. Here, agents can review, edit, and take action on the call summary.

1. **View Call Summary**: The Summary tab displays an overview of the agent's most recent call.&#x20;
2. **Provide Feedback on Summary**: Agents have the option to give [feedback](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/..#feedback-on-the-summary) on the summary, contributing to improved accuracy and relevance in future summaries.
3. **Edit Summary**: Agents can customize the summary by clicking the [Edit Summary ](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/..#editing-the-summary)button, allowing them to make necessary adjustments to ensure accuracy and relevance.
4. **Add Summary to CRM**: By selecting the [Add to CRM](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/..#pushing-the-summary-into-the-ticket) button, agents can directly transfer the summary to a ticket within their CRM system, streamlining post-call documentation.
5. **Copy Summary**: The summary can be [copied and pasted](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/agent-assist-widget/ai-assist-view/..#copy-to-clipboard) as text for use in other applications or notes, enabling easy sharing and reference.

#### **Feedback on the Summary**

You can provide feedback on the automatically generated summary, which is recorded for analytics and reporting. If the summary meets your expectations, you can give it a positive (thumbs up) rating, indicating that the details were captured accurately with no significant gaps.

If you provide negative feedback, you are prompted to include specific comments explaining any issues or gaps you noticed. This feedback helps improve the tool through continuous training, identifying areas that need enhancement.

#### **Pushing the Summary into the Ticket**

The summary generated by Agent Assist can be directly pushed into the ticket associated with the call, thanks to API integration with systems like Salesforce or ServiceNow. This allows for a seamless, one-click process to update the ticket with the call summary.

To add the summary to a Salesforce or ServiceNow ticket:

* Simply click on the `Add to CRM` button located at the bottom of the Summary view.
* After confirming this action, the summary adds to the corresponding Interaction or Case fields in ServiceNow

#### **Copy to Clipboard**

If you prefer not to use the `Add to CRM` option, you can manually copy the summary using the `Copy to Clipboard` feature. This option is available in the top-right corner of the Summary view. When clicked, it copies the entire summary as formatted text, which can then be pasted into a text editor or manually into the ticket.
