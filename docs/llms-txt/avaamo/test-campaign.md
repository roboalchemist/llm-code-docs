# Test campaign

Before launching the campaign to a wider audience, it is recommended to do a test run with a list of test recipients. See [Create recipient list](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/recipient-lists#create-a-new-recipient-list), for more information on creating a test recipient list using the **Test recipient list** toggle.

You can test a campaign right after creating a campaign or using the **Test** option in the extended menu of the **Actions** column.

### Test your campaign

In the **Test campaign** pop-up window, pick a test recipient list from the dropdown. Only those recipient lists that are enabled for testing are listed in the dropdown. See [Create recipient list](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/recipient-lists#create-a-new-recipient-list), for more information on creating a test recipient list using the **Test recipient list** toggle.

When you pick a recipient list,

* A list of users to whom a test message is sent is displayed. This list is picked from the recipient list CSV file.&#x20;
* SMS sent status - indicating whether the message is sent or not is displayed. When you load a recipient list, the status is `Pending`.

* Click **Test**. The **SMS sent** column is updated  `Yes` for all the numbers where the message is sent successfully.  When the SMS message is not sent successfully, the **SMS sent** column is updated  `No` and you can click **?** icon to know the specific reason for failure.
