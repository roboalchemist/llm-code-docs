# Intro Outro Messages

Intro Outro messages are friendly messages that you would want the agent to display before and after answering a question. The purpose of these messages is to make the conversation experience engaging and pleasant with the user. &#x20;

For example, when asked a question, you can configure the agent to say something like "Sure, I can help you with that" before answering the question.
