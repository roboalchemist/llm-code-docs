# Add language translations

All the languages configured in the agent are displayed in the **Configuration -> Language** page. Here, you can add language translations that are used in the agent response based on the detected language of the user.

### Key points

* The translations specified in the node level for the same text always take precedence over the skill-level translations. See [Language-specific responses](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-skills/using-dialog-designer/create-new-skill/build-skill-responses/skill-message-window-overview#language-specific-responses), for more information.
* Multiple developers can work on language packs simultaneously in the Q\&A skill.  Each language pack can be saved independently. As a best practice, it is recommended that individual developers work on a single language pack independently. It helps to easily manage and maintain language packs.
* See [Parallel development (QA & Smalltalk) FAQs](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/ref/parallel-development-qa-and-smalltalk-faqs), for common FAQs around parallel development of QA and Smalltalk skills.
