# Keeping content updated

If Answers skill is integrated with a content source or a CMS, there are two ways to keep the knowledge base updated whenever there are changes in the source content:

* If you use webhooks to integrate with your content source, the webhooks updates the Answers skill knowledge base whenever the source content is updated.
* Cron jobs can be configured to run periodically to look through the indexes or sitemaps of the content source to identify the content that has been updated and subsequently update the Answers skill knowledge base. Detailed information on how to configure cron jobs is available within the document parsing utility<mark style="color:red;">.</mark>
