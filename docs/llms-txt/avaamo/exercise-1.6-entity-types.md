# Exercise 1.5: Entity types

In the Agent menu, click *Entity types* to observe and see the entities that the Agent is using. In our example we see that the agent is using the following entities:

* Pizza Size
* Pizza Toppings
* US cities
* US States
* Stock Symbol
* Stock Name

Let’s try to edit some entity types and add some alternate values.

* Click the entity type Pizza Size and add value - Extra large. Our agent will now understand that extra large is a pizza size.
* To this extra-large entity type add alternate values as shown below.

* Save the changes in your agent.

### **Testing your Updated Entities**

Now that we have made so many changes to our Agent, let’s open up the Agent Simulator and ask some questions. Try incorporating the new entity types in your queries to see if the agent is able to understand the changes you have made.
