# Exercise 11.2: Company Skill Store

The Company skill store contains a collection of all published skills available in your company skill store across certain user-defined categories.&#x20;

Avaamo Platform also allows you to group your company skills into different categories. By default, four categories are available - Category A, Category B, Category C, and Category D. Based on how you want to organize these skills, you can create your own categories and add them as well.
