# About Avaamo Conversational AI Platform

A **virtual** **agent** is an application that simulates a "human interaction". Using the **Avaamo Platform**, you can design, develop, test, and deploy enterprise **agents** catering to a wide spectrum of industries such as Banking, Insurance, Healthcare, and Telco (to name a few) enabling better customer engagement and satisfaction. This can be as simple as placing a pizza order to querying about a new insurance policy or checking bank loan status.

### Build an agent

Avaamo Platform provides an end-to-end environment with various tools for building enterprise agents right from its inception to production:

* [Plan your development process](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/plan-your-development-process-agent-life-cycle): Typically, any agent goes through different stages in its life cycle  - **Development, Testing, Staging, and Production**. You can leverage the Avaamo Platform to iteratively design and build agents through all these different stages of the life cycle followed in any enterprise product development.&#x20;
* [Build agents](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents): Use the interactive and robust UI of the Avaamo Platform to create agents, add skills to the agent, and configure agents with just a few clicks.
* [Test agents](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/test-agents): Use the Simulator and Regression Testing tools built in the Avaamo Platform to test your agents at each step as you build the agents.
* [Deploy agents](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/deploy): The agents can be deployed across multiple channels such as Facebook, Skype, Amazon Alexa (to name a few) enabling better customer engagement and satisfaction.
* [Monitor agents](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/monitor-and-analyze): Monitor the performance of your agent on different channels using analytics and insights. Evaluate and improve your agent iteratively.
