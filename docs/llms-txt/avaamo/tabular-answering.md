# Tabular answering

Typically, in any enterprise content, tables are used to organize data that is too detailed or complicated to be described adequately in the text. This allows the reader to quickly search and get the results. Tables can be in any HTML document, or in the form of Excel or CSVs.&#x20;

You can use Avaamo Answers to ingest documents with tables and later provide responses to user queries from the content available in the tables. With this feature, you can

* Upload documents that are in a tabular format -  Excels and CSVs
* Upload documents that have tables - HTML and PDF
* Get responses to user queries from the content available in Excel sheets, CSVs, tables embedded in PDFs, HTML

The answer skill can identify the exact row and column in the table where the response is present and extract the answer for the user.

The following illustration depicts how Avaamo answers can provide answers to a user query from the ingested table content:
