If the agent detects either frustration or request to talk with the live agent then the user will be prompted to ask if they want to talk with a live agent:

Clicking on the Chat with an Agent link then connects you to the Live Agent Chat configured for the agent. In the case above this the built-in live agent in the Avaamo platform. You can explicitly invoke a request to the agent by typing: `#talk to agent` in the chat window.
