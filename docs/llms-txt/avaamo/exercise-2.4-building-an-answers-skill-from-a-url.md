Here we learn how to build an Answers skill by providing a publicly accessible URL.

* Create an Answers skill as we have done previously with the *Skill name* Microsoft Support and *Skill description* Answer Skill for Microsoft Office Support

* In the Answers skill page, click on the button *Add URL* in the Documents tab. In the popup, provide the URL, a name for the URL, and click the button Import URL.
* Once the import is successful and training is complete, your Answers skill is now ready for use.

For the ease of understanding, the URL being used in this module is [Put a background picture on your slides](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/put-a-background-picture-on-your-slides-7a17358c-b76e-4c94-84db-604e1bba76da?ui=en-us\&rs=en-us\&ad=us). You can either use this URL or use any other publicly available URL.

Here are some example queries to try with the URL provided above:

```
Adding a background picture
Pictures on slides
Putting a background image on a slide
```
