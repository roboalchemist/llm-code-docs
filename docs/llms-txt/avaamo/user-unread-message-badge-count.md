# User unread message badge count

The user unread message count badge is a visual indicator that displays the number of unread messages a live agent has in a conversation or chat session with a user.

### **How does it help?**

The following are a few points that list the benefits of having the unread message badge count:

* **Visibility**: The badge displays the number of unread user messages so that the live agents can easily notice the badge and understand the current state of their conversation.
* **Real-time updates**: As new messages arrive from the user, the unread message count badge updates dynamically to reflect the changes. This feature allows the live agents to stay informed about any recent messages without manually refreshing the page or conversation.
* **Prioritization**: Live agents can prioritize their engagement with the users based on the number of unread messages. A higher unread message count indicates more pending responses or information to review, prompting live agents to address those messages first.

### Managing concurrent conversations

One of the configuration options available in the Live agent console is Concurrent assignment. This provides the ability to automatically assign multiple live agent requests to the same agent simultaneously. Instead of handling one request at a time, live agents can handle multiple inquiries concurrently. See [Concurrent assignment](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/advanced-configurations#concurrent-assignment), for more information.

The user unread message badge count helps the live agents to manage concurrent conversations. By visualizing the number of unread messages, the live agents can prioritize the chats with the users for an effective customer experience.
