# Introducing "Mercury" theme

In the `Atlas 8` release, a new refreshed theme **`Mercury`** for web channels has been introduced. The primary styling components of the `Mercury` theme offers a cleaner, bright display of user inputs and agent responses, provides streaming responses, and aids in a better user experience.&#x20;

Here's a quick demo of the `Mercury` theme:

## Key features

* **Streaming responses:** `Mercury` theme renders streaming responses through the typing animation to the user, eliminating idle waiting time. Streaming is intuitive, especially when there is a delay in agent response. It creates an impression to the user that the agent is responding and helps in actively engaging the user in the conversation flow.
* **Wider agent widget:** `Mercury` theme has a wider agent widget and provides more text area to display the agent response. For short responses, this can avoid scrolling to read answers.
* **Enhanced readability:** A clean UI in the `Mercury` theme with an enhanced white-tone usage, makes the theme look brighter and cleaner (less cluttered), thus enhancing readability when compared to the other themes.
* **Stop generating answers:** Users can stop generating answers in the `Mercury` theme. This helps the users to pause generating text in an ongoing conversation intermittently. This feature provides flexibility to the users in controlling the flow of interaction, allowing users to gather additional information, process intermediate results, or make decisions based on previous responses. To continue generating responses, users can just post queries back to the agent.

## User Feedback&#x20;

One of the significant improvements in the `Mercury` theme is the feedback collected from the users on the thumbs-down option for a response.&#x20;

The thumbs-down pop-up screen in the `Mercury` theme has been enhanced with specific options that allow the users to provide detailed descriptions of how the response can be fine-tuned to get the expected behavior. The open-ended responses allow users to provide a detailed description of the selected option in the pop-up screen.

In the `Mercury` theme, the feedback collected at the UAT stage aims towards collecting more specific details since UAT users are subject matter experts and testers within the account who are more aware of the agent and what is built into it when compared to the production users. Hence, the feedback collected at the UAT stage can be instrumental in fine-tuning the agent.

## How to use it?

`Mercury` is the default theme for all newly created agents and newly created web channels in the Avaamo Conversational AI Platform. &#x20;

If not enabled for your agent, you can navigate to the `Agent -> Channels` page and click `View` on the Web Channel. In the `Channels -> Theme` section, click the `Agent theme` dropdown to choose the `Mercury` theme based on your styling requirements. For [LLaMB](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/recent-releases/release-notes-v8.0/introducing-llamb), `Mercury` is the recommended theme.&#x20;
