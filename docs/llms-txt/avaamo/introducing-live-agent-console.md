See [Live agent](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/live-agent-console/live-agent), for more information.

### **Quick response composer**

Quick responses play a vital role in a live agent system, offering numerous benefits that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customer support. It helps to streamline live agent interactions, boost productivity, and help customers receive timely, accurate, and consistent responses from knowledgeable agents.

Supervisors can use the Live agent console workflow to create a collection of standardized responses or templates for recurring inquiries. In the given instance, you can observe a compilation of pre-defined responses created by a Supervisor specifically for the repetitive responses required for a healthcare agent. See [Quick responses](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/live-agent-console/supervisor/quick-responses), for more information.

Live agents can utilize quick responses as-is or rephrase them to provide improved and precise responses that contribute to an enhanced customer experience. A live agent can access the set of all the quick responses just by typing # in the message text box:

See [Use quick responses](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/live-agent-console/live-agent/use-quick-responses), for more information on how live agents can leverage the quick responses created in the system.

### **Collaborate, Contribute, and Resolve**&#x20;

Enable efficient team collaboration and issue resolution by utilizing the Live Agent console to create teams based on their expertise. Through this console, live agents can seamlessly transfer requests to appropriate teams within the organization that possess the necessary skills and knowledge to address the specific request. This collaborative approach promotes the effective utilization of team members' skills, leading to faster issue resolution.

With teams, you can maximize the potential of diverse teams within the organization to ensure proper and efficient issue resolution.&#x20;

The following example demonstrates a scenario where a live agent, upon reviewing the conversation history, recognizes that the query can be better addressed by another team. Consequently, the live agent decides to transfer the request to a more suitable team even without initiating a conversation with the user.

<figure><img src="https://2934665269-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LpXFTiTgns4Ml77XGi3%2Fuploads%2FKO0pMqIyoHcIGRZCTXpx%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c3cc316c-6291-42e7-996e-e96a808adf00" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this demonstration, observe the process of a live agent seamlessly transferring an ongoing conversation with a user to another team within the organization. This showcases the ability of a live agent to initiate a request transfer during an active conversation, ensuring smooth and efficient communication between teams.

### View reports to gain insights

Reports enable Supervisors to view real-time customer wait time and queue status. This provides valuable insights into traffic patterns and workload, allowing them to optimize ticket routing and create specialized teams with specific skill sets, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

For instance, Supervisors can leverage the traffic data to develop standardized responses or establish and manage routing rules. In the following example, Supervisors can assess the current traffic usage, including metrics such as wait time, and make informed decisions to update routing rules or explore alternative methods to enhance the overall customer experience.

### Omnichannel experience

Avaamo Conversational AI Platform has the capability to deploy agents in various channels such as Mobile Channels (iOS and Android), MS Teams, Facebook, and Custom Channels.&#x20;

The new Live agent console provides an omnichannel experience to the live agents interacting with the users, which implies, that although users can interact with the Live agent via different channels where the agent is deployed, all the conversations irrespective of the channel used by the user are seamlessly delivered to the Live agent console.
