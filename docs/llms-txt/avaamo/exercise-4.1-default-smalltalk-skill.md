# Exercise 4.1: Default Smalltalk skill

Smalltalk is a form of Q\&A skill that allows you to build a personality for your agent to represent the organization. It can be used across agents developed by the organization. Smalltalk has lesser priority as compared to Q\&A skills.

Examples of Smalltalk questions are:

```
Who built you?
Who is your CEO?
Which is your favourite sports team?
```

Open the Smalltalk skill in the skill builder and see what questions are already answered. Create a list of questions and answers that would want your agent to answer.
