# Exercise 2.3: Examining Answers knowledge base

To navigate to the knowledge goto **Answer Skill -> Implementation -> Knowledge**

To understand Answers better, click on the *Knowledge* menu item in the skill menu. The knowledge page consists of five tabs:

* Sections
* Entities
* Acronyms
* Vocabulary
* Knowledge graph

### **2.3.1 Sections**

Sections are chunks of content extracted and created based on the structure of the uploaded document. Each section contains the skill’s response to the user’s intent. You can add additional training data as required. Each section is displayed with a breadcrumb that indicates the page number from which the section is extracted and the corresponding section header.

Navigate to the *Sections* tab and observe the sections that have been identified.

### **2.3.2** **Entities**

Entities are business terms in your document. All entities are identified and extracted from your document and classified as entities in this section. Here, you can either view all the entities from all the documents or select a specific document and view all the entities.

You can change the document by selecting the document from the dropdown in the top right corner of the page. Select an entity from the list and try adding all the values. Test this in the agent to see how it responds

If there is an acronym used in your document, then the acronym along with the full form is present in the acronyms tab. Here, you can view all the acronyms available in the document. You can get the definition of an acronym, like in the following examples:

*What is APR?*

*What is DPR?*
