# Get started

Once you have created an **AI Agent**, follow these steps to configure and build it effectively.

### [**Add Skills**](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/skills)

In this step, you define the **actions** your agent should perform by adding skills. You can choose from two types of skills:

* [Prompt skill](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/skills/prompt-skill) – Uses predefined prompts to generate responses.
* [Knowledge skill](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/skills/knowledge-skill) – Leverages LLaMB capabilities for advanced AI-driven interactions.

### [**Configuration**](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/configuration)

This step allows you to set up additional configurations to **enhance the functionality** of your AI agents. Advanced settings help fine-tune the agent's behavior and responses for a more optimized experience.

### [**Debug**](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/debug)

In the **Debug** step, you review the data stored by the skill and analyze logs generated from your JavaScript code. This helps in identifying and fixing any issues in the agent's functionality.

### [**Test**](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/test)

Finally, you use the **Simulator** to test your skill with different `sample queries`. This ensures that your agent behaves as expected and provides accurate responses before deployment.&#x20;

You can test using either the `AI Agent` or `Classic Agent` types.\
In the `AI Agent` testing mode, a mobile screen-style widget is displayed, allowing users to interact with the agent in a conversational interface.

In the `Classic Agent` testing mode, the traditional agent widget is shown. You can click on it to start the conversation.

Refer [Test channel settings](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/configuration/channels/web-enabled-by-default#test-channel-settings), for detailed information.
