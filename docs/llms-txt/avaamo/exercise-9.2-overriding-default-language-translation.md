# Exercise 9.2: Overriding Default Language Translation

Existing output to the user is automatically translated but can be overridden by different responses in the added language.

First, you need to add the language to the dialog skill. In this example, we are using the **Order Pizza** skill. Adding a language is done similarly to the agent. Open the skill, navigate to **Configuration -> Language**. Add the language in the same manner as the previous exercise. Save the skill.

Navigate to the Implementation page and click on node 1. A dialog is then displayed. Click on the drop-down menu that is showing English (US) and select the item Spanish (es-US). The Spanish text is translated from English text by default. You can now override the Spanish as needed.
