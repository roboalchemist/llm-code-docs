# Opting out of campaign

Although campaigns allow you to reach to a wider set of audience, not all campaign messages are welcome by the recipients. Some consider it an invasion of privacy or others may not be just interested in receiving any such message to their number.

Avaamo respects recipient's privacy and allows recipients to opt-out of receiving messages from the Avaamo platform to their number.&#x20;

### Opting out

If a recipient no longer wishes to receive messages to a number, then the recipient can simply reply to the campaign message with any one of the following words to unsubscribe:

* STOP
* END
* QUIT
* CANCEL
* UNSUBSCRIBE
* STOPALL

When a recipient unsubscribes, then the campaign message is not sent. In the **Test campaign** pop-up, the following message for the corresponding recipient:

A similar message is also displayed in the CSV file when you download a campaign message history report from the **Campaign Statistics** page. See [Campaign Statistics](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/outreach/campaign-statistics), for more information.

### Opting in

To opt back in to receive messages from an unsubscribed number, the number that replied with STOP must send one of these keywords to start receiving messages back:

* START
* YES
* UNSTOP
