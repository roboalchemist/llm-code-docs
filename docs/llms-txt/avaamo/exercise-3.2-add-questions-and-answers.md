# Exercise 3.2: Adding Variations to Question and Answer Pairs

By adding variations to the intents you have created, the skill can handle many more variations of the same question.

Let us add two more variations

| Intent                          | Variation                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can I cancel an existing order? | <p>I want to cancel an existing order</p><p>I have placed an order and want to cancel it. Can I cancel it now?</p> |

Save your changes in the skill, and save the changes in your agent. Test these changes in your agent and see how it responds.<br>
