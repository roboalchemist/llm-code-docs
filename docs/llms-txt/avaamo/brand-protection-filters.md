# Brand protection filters

LLaMB `Brand protection` filters involve implementing strategies and mechanisms to ensure that the outputs generated by the model are always in favor of the company and do not harm or misrepresent a brand's image, reputation, or values.&#x20;

## How does it work? <a href="#id-7c25tcigo52l" id="id-7c25tcigo52l"></a>

There are two primary phases for implementing brand protection filters:

1. [Pre-Go-Live Phase](#pre-go-live-phase): In this phase, you work with Avaamo Support to configure brand protection filters tailored to your account. This includes validating the filters with experts to ensure that the model comprehends the specific taxonomy and branding requirements of your account.
2. [Post-Go-Live Phase](#post-go-live-phase): The first two weeks after going live are critical. It is recommended to continually review and monitor the conversations to maintain a consistent narrative in all interactions, thereby protecting the brand's image, reputation, and values.

## Pre-Go-live phase

### Step 1 - Configure your brand in LLaMB

The first step towards ensuring `Brand protection` is to configure the filters based on your business taxonomy and the brand details.

1. Contact Avaamo Support with your company name, instance, and agent details to get started.
2. Share the brand names, and business taxonomy list in the format provided by Avaamo Support.
3. To add [few-shot examples](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/llamb/llamb-filters/key-terms) specific to your business, share with Avaamo Support a few examples in user-query, response format.
4. Based on the business taxonomy and brand details, a customized `Brand protection` filter is configured for your account using the following two primary principles:
   * **Strict system instructions**: Strict system instructions are provided to a language model during inferencing to ensure that it consistently answers in favor of the company and does not harm or misrepresent a brand's image, reputation, or values. These instructions dictate that the model should never generate responses that could harm the company's reputation or suggest any form of liability. The guidelines mandate a positive portrayal of the company's products, services, and policies. Additionally, the model is directed to avoid any statements that might be construed as negative or critical. This ensures a consistent and favorable narrative in all interactions, aligning with the company's strategic interests.
   * **Few-shot examples**: To reinforce the system instructions, few-shot examples are integrated into the training data. Positive examples include responses like, "*<mark style="color:blue;">The latest product from \[Company] is outstanding, offering cutting-edge features and unmatched quality that set it apart in the market,</mark>*" and "*<mark style="color:blue;">\[Company] excels in customer service, ensuring that every customer is satisfied with prompt and professional support.</mark>*" Negative examples, illustrating what to avoid, include, "*<mark style="color:blue;">I don't have any information on that,</mark>*<mark style="color:blue;">" and "</mark>*<mark style="color:blue;">I'm not able to provide an answer to that question.</mark>*" These examples help the model understand the desired tone and content of its responses while steering clear of potentially harmful topics.

### Step 2 - Validate the control&#x20;

* You will receive a confirmation from Avaamo Support after the Brand protection configuration is completed.
* Use your business experts or SMEs to run the brand protection validation. See [Categories and Examples](#id-4zakda4rsiw4), for more information.

### Step 3 - More questions or need help?&#x20;

* During validation, in case of any questions or queries, contact Avaamo Support for further assistance.&#x20;
* When you reach out to Avaamo Support, provide us with your response to the Jailbreak question. How would you respond to the question?
* Avaamo Support will review the request and update the configurations if required.&#x20;
* Repeat [Step 2](#step-1-configure-your-brand-in-llamb) until you achieve the desired result.

## **Post-Go-Live** phase

### Step 1 - Review and Monitor

The first 2 weeks after going live, review every thumbs-down feedback in a given 24-hour period. See [Analytics](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/monitor-and-analyze/analytics) and [Query insights](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/monitor-and-analyze/query-insights), for more information on how to extract the analytics data.

### Step 2 - Report the observations for swift action

* Report your observation and attach an Urgency.xls file with the Jailbreak query, current response, and suggested response.
* All brand protection production scenarios are considered at the highest severity and Avaamo Support will take immediate action based on the information provided.
