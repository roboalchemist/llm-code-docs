# Exercise 1.2: Asking questions to the agent

Now that your agent is ready, try asking some questions and see how it responds. In your agent (Sample: My Assistant) try asking these questions:

```
I want to order a medium cheese pizza
What is the weather like in Seattle?
I want to see some general news
What's the stock price of Microsoft?
```

You can even use misspellings, try these examples:

```
I want to oder a pizza
What is the weater like in Seattle?
I want to general nws?
```

If the agent is not sure what you are asking about it responds with a disambiguation question. Try these examples to see the behavior:

```
I want to order a smed piza?
I wnt to se news?
Wht the stck pice of Microsft?
```
