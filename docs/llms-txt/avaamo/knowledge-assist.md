# Knowledge Assist

The `Knowledge Assist` tool allows you to manually ask any query at any time during or after a call, giving you the ability to search the entire knowledge repository from a single screen within the widget. This feature empowers you to quickly find relevant information outside of the automated recommendations.

The information retrieved through `Knowledge Assist` is presented similarly to the `Recommendations View`. You receive a summarized answer generated from one or more knowledge articles, along with references to the source articles. Additionally, you have the option to provide feedback on the accuracy and quality of the provided information.

For example, if a user asks about the terms and conditions regarding maternity leave, the agent can go to the Knowledge Assist tab, enter the query, and obtain an accurate response.

This feature provides agents with prompt answers during live calls, using a knowledge base built with the LLaMB in the Avaamo platform. This is populated with structured content, making recommendations both efficient and relevant.
