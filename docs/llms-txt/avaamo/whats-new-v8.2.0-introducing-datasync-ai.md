# What's new v8.2.0 - Introducing DataSync AI

The **`DataSync AI`** is a powerful feature within **LLaMB** designed to facilitate seamless content access across repositories such as **SharePoint** and **ServiceNow**. It acts as an interface, enabling users to leverage resources stored in these repositories to enhance the capabilities of their LLaMB agents in responding to user queries effectively from the enterprise content.

Previously, integrating URLs or documents into LLaMB content involved adding them individually to the Document group (refer to Document [Upload content](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/llamb/get-started/step-2-ingest-enterprise-content/upload-content)). With the introduction of DataSync AI, users can now integrate a wide variety of vast content directly from their repositories into the skill, streamlining the content integration and management process.

The following flow diagram illustrates the workflow of the DataSync AI.

### Seamless connection configuration

Setting up the connection between your content source and the LLaMB agent is straightforward. This process involves entering necessary connection details, which ensures a smooth setup for your chosen data source. Following a few simple steps, you can quickly establish a functional link between the content source and your LLaMB agent, enabling efficient data retrieval and utilization.

### Personalize with document attributes

Customize your documents by selecting attributes that apply to all documents selected for ingestion. These attributes ensure accessibility to specific authorized groups.

Also, if you decide to introduce new attributes in the future for additional customization or refinement, the system fully supports this capability. This flexibility allows you to continually adapt and enhance document management according to evolving needs and preferences.

### Achieving seamless ingestion of your content

After selecting resources from the content source, they become instantly available in the LLaMB agent. When the status of all chosen articles and documents displays as "**Ingested**," it confirms their accessibility within the document group of your agent skill. Additionally, you can easily track the total count of uploaded articles and documents for comprehensive management and monitoring.

Also, our system automatically synchronizes any updates made to ingested documents with your agent. This ensures that your agent remains synchronized with the latest information, whether it's minor edits or significant revisions, thereby maintaining data integrity throughout your operations.
