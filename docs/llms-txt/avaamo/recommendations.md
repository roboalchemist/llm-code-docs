# Recommendations

During an ongoing call, based on the caller's inputs, `Agent Assist` automatically searches the knowledge repository for relevant information and provides recommendations to help you respond to user queries. These recommendations include concise snippets along with citations, referencing content from the knowledge base. Typically, it takes about 4-6 seconds for recommendations to appear after the caller completes their input.

The `Recommendations View` displays a continuous feed of all recommendations generated throughout the conversation, with the most recent suggestions appearing at the top. Each recommendation also includes citations for the referenced knowledge resources, which you can click on to view the full knowledge article.

Agent Assist uses a knowledge base to quickly answer queries during calls This is populated using the **LLaMB** in the Avaamo platform, which ingests and structures relevant content for effective recommendations. Refer [Before you begin](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/avaamo-agent-assist/get-started/before-you-begin), for more information.

**How Automatic Recommendations Work:**

1. **Search for Relevant Answers**:

   As the agent engages in a call, Agent Assist reads the conversation in real-time, identifying user queries and searching for suitable responses within the knowledge library.
2. **Real-Time Notifications for Recommendations**:
   * If the agent is on a different tab or view when a recommendation is generated, a notification appears stating: `New recommendation received. Check the Recommendations tab.`
   * This alert allows the agent to know that a recommended action or solution is available for the current user’s question.
3. **Accessing Recommendations**:

   To view the recommendation, the agent navigates to the **Recommendations tab** where the proposed actions or solutions related to the caller’s query are displayed. These insights support the agent in promptly addressing user needs.

**Feedback on Recommendations**

You can provide feedback on the recommendations, which are recorded for analytics and reporting. If a recommendation meets your needs, you can give it a positive (thumbs up) rating, indicating that the provided information is accurate and complete.

If the recommendation is lacking, a negative rating prompts you to leave specific feedback comments detailing the issues or gaps you observed. This feedback helps improve the recommendation process through continuous training and refinement.
