# Exercise 4.4: Train Q\&A pairs with variations

By adding variations to the intents you have created, the skill can handle many more variations of the same question.

Let us add two more variations:

| Intent           | Variation                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who is your CEO? | <p>Tell me more about your CEO.</p><p>Where can I find information about your CEO?</p> |

Repeat this step and add 2 or more variations to all your Smalltalk pairs.<br>
