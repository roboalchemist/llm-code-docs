# Built-in functions window

Avaamo Platform provides several built-in JS functions and NodeJS utility wrappers that can be used to build enterprise agents with ease and minimal development effort. To name a few use-cases, it can be handling custom intents, or building custom input cards to complex functionalities such as controlling skill flow, custom API integration, and SMS/Email notifications.

For an agent developer, it is very useful if the syntax and usage of all such functions are available in the JS editor itself during agent development. This helps in:

* Faster development, since the required functions are accessible within the JS editor itself during agent development.
* Writing JS code with correct syntax, since examples can be copied and hence it is less error-prone.
* Browsing any additional functions that can be of use during the development

**Built-in functions** window lists all the out-of-box functions available in the Avaamo platform that can be used in your JS code during agent development.&#x20;
