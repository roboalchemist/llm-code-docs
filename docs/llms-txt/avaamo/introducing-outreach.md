For example, you can set up a vaccination drive outreach campaign program and send invitations out to all the contacts to avail service. Such campaign programs help healthcare providers to communicate with their communities and patients in a targeted and efficient way.

Avaamo platform provides out-of-the-box features to set up an outreach campaign program. A few key features are listed in this article.

## Key features

### AI-guided campaigns for complete automation

&#x20;`Outreach`  allows you to empower your campaign with AI and make it conversational. You can now link your campaign with agents or assistants in the Avaamo Conversational AI Platform and make your campaign powerful with two-way communication. Recipients receiving the campaign message can converse back in the same channel and in the same campaign to complete the entire flow.&#x20;

Not limited to the verticals, the table here shows different use cases and automation across Healthcare, Employee service, and Customer care:

| Healthcare                                                                                                                                                              | Employee Service                                                                                                                                                                  | Customer care                                                                                                                         |

### Self-serviceable "Campaign Composer"

Outreach comes with a Self-serviceable "Campaign Composer" that allows users to quickly set up a campaign in a guided, easy-to-use user interface. You can build and configure campaigns using the Campaign Composer with just 3 steps - Configure, Add Message, and Activate.

The "Campaign Composer" offers different scheduling options for you to send a campaign message immediately or schedule at a predefined agreed time or with a recurring option.

### Send campaign via any enterprise channel

Outreach enables enterprises to broadcast messages and reach wider audiences in channels of their choice. It comes with a set of built-in channels that are out-of-the-box -> SMS, MS Teams,  C-IVR, and Custom channel.&#x20;

By configuring your campaigns via the custom channel, you can now send campaign messages via any enterprise channel and are not limited only to channels such as SMS, C-IVR, or MS Teams. This widens the reach of the campaigns to a larger set of audience and better adoption of the Outreach campaign programs.&#x20;
