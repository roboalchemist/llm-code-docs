# Permissions

By default, when you create an agent, you are the **owner** of the agent. Additionally, when a user promotes an agent that the user is automatically the owner of the agent in the promoted stage. As an owner of the agent, you can assign permissions to different people within your company for your agent as required. This allows different users to participate and collaborate in each stage of the agent life-cycle.

There are four types of permissions available for an agent:

* **View**: Users can only view the agent but cannot edit the agent. Note that anyone with at-least view permission on the agent can submit the Unhandled query analyzer job.
* **Edit**: Users can view and edit the agent.
* **Publish**: Users can view agents, edit agents, and publish skills from the agent to the skills store.&#x20;
* **Owner**: Full access to the agent. Users can view agents, edit agents, publish skills from the agent to the Skill store, and edit agent permissions.
