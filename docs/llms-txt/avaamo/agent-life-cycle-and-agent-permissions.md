## FAQs

### 1. Is there an option to provide bulk edit to users?

You can choose the option **Anyone within Company can edit the agent** while assigning permission&#x73;**.** With this option, all users within company can view and edit the agent. However, if you wish to provide edit permissions to specific set of users, then you must assign permissions individually to each user. See [Permissions](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/permissions), for more information.

### 2. Can the permissions be applied at skill level?

No, permissions are applicable only at agent level.

### 3. Can we perform regression testing in production?

No, it is recommended to perform all your regression testing in Testing environment itself.
