* A `Classic Agent` who has conversational expertise in a certain domain or sector. See [Create Basic Agent](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/add-skills), for more information.
* A `Universal Agent` can handle the tasks of more than one agent by integrating with multiple virtual assistants (or agents). See [Universal agent](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/create-universal-agent) for more information.
* An `Advanced Agent`  delivers human-like, personalized interactions with less training data, making it smarter and more efficient than a Standard agent.
* An `AI Agent` leverages advanced models to understand context deeply, enabling fluid, dynamic conversations. It adapts to user inputs in real time, providing intelligent responses for a more natural and engaging experience.
