# Agent diagnostics (Deprecated)

The success of your agent depends upon how accurately it can respond to user queries. The quality of the intents and their training determines the quality of the agent's accuracy in understanding the user queries. Creating the right number of intents with the right number of training data samples for each intent is essential to provide a good user experience. &#x20;

If your agent is trained incorrectly or with insufficient training data, then it can lead to unexpected matches to the user queries, leading to an unpleasant user experience. Hence it is recommended to periodically review, understand, and improve the quality of training data. This can significantly improve the accuracy of your agent and helps in providing a pleasant user experience.

## What is agent diagnostics?

Agent diagnostics tool analyzes all the intents and their associated training data to determine the quality of the current training data in Dialog and Q\&A intents. It helps to understand:

* If the training data is adequate
* If you have duplicate training data
* If you have malformed or invalid training data
