# Custom live agent

The Avaamo Platform provides prebuilt live-agent integrations with Avaamo, Oracle RightNow, and Zendesk. However, if you wish to transfer to a live agent other than the ones available, you can configure a custom live agent. When you configure a custom live agent in the Avaamo platform, you also provide a webhook URL that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving requests and responses to and from the Avaamo platform.

When the user interacts with the virtual assistant and requests to speak to a live agent, the request is sent to the live agent (chat application) via a webhook call. The **Live agent integrator** transforms payloads to and from the Avaamo platform and the **Custom live agent,** respectively.

Refer [Custom live agent,](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/switch-to-live-agent/custom-live-agent) for more information.
