# Activity monitor

For an enterprise agent, as the demand and usage of the agent increase, the number of use cases required to build in the agent also increases substantially. To ensure faster adoption of the increasing agent demand, it is critical to build and deliver the agents faster. Hence, parallel development, which allows multiple developers to work on the agent simultaneously is a key factor in rapid agent development and reduces the turnaround time to build the agent.

Activity monitor helps you to get a snapshot of a list of all the developers working on the agent and the module they are working on. It is available for every agent and shows the list of users editing the agent at any given point in time. This allows developers to collaborate and work efficiently, thus promoting rapid agent development.

**To view the activity monitor of an agent**:

* Navigate to the **Agents** tab on the top menu.
* Search and click any agent for which you wish to view or edit. See [Search agents](https://docs.avaamo.com/v5/how-to/build-agents/manage-agents/other-common-actions#search-agents), for more information.
* If there are developers working on the agent, then the initials of the developers are displayed in the agent header section.

* Click the initials to view the **Activity monitor**. In the **Activity monitor** pop-up, you can view the user editing a module and the time since the module has been locked by the user. For example, in the following illustration, a user Tom Wilson is editing a JS file named GreetingHandler and it is locked since Nov 24, 1:06 PM.
