# Conversational IVR (C-IVR) or Phone

You can deploy the agents built on the Avaamo Platform into your phone channel. This allows callers to converse naturally with agents via interactive voice responses (IVR) to achieve the desired results without having to navigate lengthy audio menus. This feature can help to reduce live-agent calls, improve call routing, and provide a good user experience.

**To configure a C-IVR channel:**

After a successful configuration, a phone number is generated in the **Activated phone number** area, and this is the number that can be used to connect to your agent via the C-IVR channel.

* In the **Agent** page, navigate to the **Configure -> Channels** option in the left navigation menu.
* On the Channels page, click **Connect** in the C-IVR Channel.
* Specify the following channel setting details:

<table><thead><tr><th width="167">Parameter</th><th>Descriptions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Indicates the <strong>Name</strong> used to identify the C-IVR channel. Note that you can have upto 150 characters in the channel name.</td></tr><tr><td><p>Languages and </p><p>Playback Voice for</p></td><td><p>Select the language and configure the voice or the persona to be used by your agent in the interactive phone conversations with the user. Each language has a different set of voice personas that you can choose from. Select the persona from the options provided in the "Playback voice for &#x3C;&#x3C;language>>" section:</p><p></p><ul><li>As with any enterprise voice, audio, or video application, each region or country has its phone number to dial. Similarly, in the C-IVR channel, you choose the language of the region or country where you wish to share the configured number. If you wish to share the number in multiple regions, then set up the C-IVR channel specific to each language. Note that one C-IVR channel is specific to only one language.</li><li>To hear the voice preview, type any text in the text area and click the play button. You can also download the voice preview if required.</li><li>You can select only those languages for which the agent is configured and those that are supported in the C-IVR channel. If you have switched to a language that is not supported in the C-IVR channel, then the agent responds in the default language.</li></ul><p>See <a href="../../how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/add-languages">Add languages</a> and <a href="../../how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/deploy/voice-supported-languages">Supported languages</a>, for more information. </p></td></tr><tr><td>Live agent transfer mode</td><td>Defines how a live agent is invited into the conversation when escalation is required. Supports <strong>Invite</strong> (conference style where the bot stays in the call) or <strong>Refer</strong> (the call is handed over to the agent directly).</td></tr><tr><td>ASR Configuration</td><td>Allows selection of the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) provider version for speech-to-text processing. Available options are <strong>V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6</strong>. Choose the version based on performance and compatibility.</td></tr><tr><td>Enable Noise Filter</td><td>When enabled, background noise is filtered out during user input. This improves recognition accuracy by reducing interference from non-speech sounds.</td></tr><tr><td>Fallback Forward Configuration</td><td>Defines the backup handling flow when the AI agent cannot process the user’s request. The request is forwarded to the specified destination along with the required headers.</td></tr><tr><td>Forward Destination</td><td>Specifies the phone number to which incoming calls will be forwarded.</td></tr><tr><td>Forward Headers</td><td>Custom headers to be included while forwarding the request. Headers should be specified in JSON object format. </td></tr><tr><td>Speech timeout</td><td><p>Indicates a maximum wait time of the agent within which a user response is expected. If the user response is not received within the time-out period, then an automated message is rendered back to the user indicating that the agent is awaiting the user response. Currently, this is a standard message and cannot be customized.</p><ul><li>The default value is 1 second.</li><li>Use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease time as required.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>SMS message options</td><td>Enable this option and specify a message, if you wish to send an SMS message to the caller when the call gets disconnected and/or when the call is completed. Specify the SMS text message in the respective options as required. Note that a single SMS can have upto 150 characters.</td></tr><tr><td>Send an SMS after completion of call</td><td>Enable this option and specify a message, if you wish to send an SMS message to the caller when the call is completed. Note that a single SMS can have upto 150 characters. If a call is hung up after a successful dialogue between the user and the agent, that is a user asks a query and the agent responds back to the query, then it is considered as complete.</td></tr><tr><td>Send an SMS if call disconnects</td><td>Enable this option and specify a message if you wish to send an SMS message to the caller when the call gets disconnected. Note that a single SMS can have up to 150 characters. A call is considered disconnected when the user asks a query and, before the agent's response is received, the call is hung up. This is the case when the user is between conversation flows.</td></tr><tr><td>Enable custom user authentication</td><td>Use this if you wish to enable custom authentication for your agents deployed on the phone channels using JavaScript code. See <a href="../../../how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/define-settings#user-authentication-handler">User authentication handler</a>, for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>Enable wait time tone</td><td><p>Use this option if you wish to play an idle tone to the user in case the agent is taking a little longer to respond. </p><p></p><p>Rather than experiencing silence or a lack of input, the introduction of a tone serves to engage the user actively and assures that the agent will respond shortly. For example, the system generates a typing tone when processing DTMF/keypad input.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Select file</td><td><p>Once you enable the wait time tone, the option to upload a file becomes available. You can customize the wait time tone by uploading an audio file that plays an idle tone for the user. The file must not exceed 10 seconds and should be within 5 MB in size.<br></p><p>Click <strong>Select File</strong>, then choose and upload the desired file for the wait time tone.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

* Click **Save** to save the C-IVR channel configuration details. A phone number is generated in the **Activated phone number** area and this is the number that can be used to connect to your agent.

**Key Points**:&#x20;

* After successfully saving the C-IVR configuration, you have the option to add "Agent voice", "Voice menu", and "Voice hints" to the agent responses. See [Build skill responses](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-skills/create-skill/using-dialog-designer/create-new-skill/build-skill-responses) and [Advanced settings](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-skills/create-skill/using-dialog-designer/create-new-skill/build-skill-responses/advanced-settings), for more information.
* If you have deployed your agent in the C-IVR or Phone channel and masking is enabled, then the audio files from the user responses are not available in the conversation history, since it can contain PII data. See [Information masking](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/overview-and-concepts/advanced-concepts/information-masking), for information.
* You can also enable custom voice for your C-IVR agents in the Avaamo Platform. Contact Avaamo Support for more information.
