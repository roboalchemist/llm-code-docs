# What's new in v6.4.0?

In this release, a new feature - **An outreach campaign program** has been introduced.

In simple terms, Outreach is defined as "reach further than".  Elaborating on the same concept, an outreach campaign program is about reaching out or providing services to a wider set of targeted audiences.

For example, you can set up a vaccination drive outreach campaign program and send invitations out to all the contacts to avail service. Such campaign programs help healthcare providers to communicate with their communities and patients in a targeted and efficient way.

Avaamo platform provides out-of-the-box features to set up an outreach campaign program.

The following are a few key capabilities of this feature:

* Make conversational AI proactive: Instead of customers reaching out to conversational AI, the outreach program in the Avaamo Conversational AI platform reaches out to customers.&#x20;
* Campaign scheduling: Ability to send a campaign message immediately, schedule at a predefined agreed time, or as a recurring schedule.
* Faster reach to a wider audience
* Ability to configure campaigns in multiple channels such as SMS, C-IVR, and MS Teams.

### Key terms

Before you start creating your first outreach program, the following are a few terms of the Outreach feature available in the Avaamo Conversational AI Platform:

* **Recipient List**: List of users for whom the campaign is intended.&#x20;
* **Template**: A customized re-usable message that is sent to the campaign recipients.
* **Filters**: Configure filters based on the column names and values in the recipient CSV such as location, age, date of birth, or gender. When a filter is associated with a campaign, the campaign is triggered to only those recipients matching the filter criteria.&#x20;
