# Campaign FAQs

This article lists a few frequently asked questions related to the Outreach Campaign:

### 1. Unable to view the Outreach option in my dashboard?

Ensure that you have appropriate permission to view the campaign option. See [Campaign permissions](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/before-you-begin#campaign-permissions), for more information.&#x20;

Contact your Admin user with the Settings role to provide the required access or contact support for further assistance.

### 2. Why did the campaign SMS not get delivered?

A campaign SMS can fail to send the message due to several reasons. The **Campaign statistics** page provides a data summary of the campaign sent out to users. In the message history, you can click the help icon to view the specific reason for message failure for a recipient. See [Campaign statistics](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/outreach/campaign-statistics), for more information.

### 3. How can we find all the messages sent to a specific recipient?

You can view all the messages sent to a specific recipient on the Conversation history page in the **Campaign statistics** page. In the Campaign messaging history, click the arrow icon against the recipient and navigate to the [Conversation history](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/debug-agents/conversation-history) page to check the conversation in more detail.&#x20;
