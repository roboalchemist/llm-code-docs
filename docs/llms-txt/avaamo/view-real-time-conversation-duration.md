# View real-time conversation duration

Live agents can view real-time data of the conversation duration for all active chat requests in the Live agent console. The conversation duration timer is a valuable indicator for managing customer support interactions efficiently, meeting SLAs, and enhancing the overall customer experience. It provides real-time insights into the progress of each chat and allows live agents to make informed decisions.

You can view the conversation duration next to the user name at the top in the Live Agent Console. The **Live Sessions** page displays real-time conversation duration for each active chat. The conversation duration starts when a live agent accepts the chat request and it is kept updated for every second.

**Note**: The conversation duration is reset in the following cases:

* When the request is ended by the live agent or by the user.
* When a request is transferred to another live agent.&#x20;
* If you wish to view the complete conversation duration, you can download and view the chat details from the Reports page for further analysis. See [Reports](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/live-agent-console/supervisor/reports), for more information.

### **How does it help?**

The following are a few points that list the benefits of having a real-time conversation duration timer:

* **Service Level Agreement (SLA Compliance)**: It helps ensure that customer support interactions are in line with the established SLAs. Agents can monitor the timer to ensure that response and resolution times are within the agreed-upon limits.
* **Efficiency and Productivity**: It allows agents to gauge how efficiently chats are progressing. Agents can use the timer to pace their responses, ensuring that they are addressing customer inquiries promptly and effectively.
* **Customer Experience**: The timer indirectly impacts the customer experience by ensuring that the conversation doesn't drag on unnecessarily. Customers generally appreciate quick and efficient support, and the timer helps in achieving this.
