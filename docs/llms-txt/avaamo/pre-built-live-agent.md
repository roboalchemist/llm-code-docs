# Pre-built live agent

The Avaamo platform supports integration with a **live agent** for scenarios when there is a need for human intervention. If the user requests it, the agent senses dissatisfaction, frustration, or anger, or the agent has defined transfer intents, the conversation seamlessly transfers to a human agent system, such as Live Agent or Zendesk.

Refer [Pre-built live agent](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/configuration/live-agent/pre-built-live-agent), for more information.
