# Transfer to another team

Live agents have the ability to transfer to another team specialized in the relevant area to expedite issue resolution. See [Teams](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/live-agent-console/supervisor/teams), for further details on the advantages of utilizing teams and the supervisor's role in organizing teams to enhance customer satisfaction.

There are two ways a live agent can transfer to another team:

1. [At the time of accepting the chat](#at-the-time-of-accepting-the-chat)
2. [During the conversation with the customer after accepting the chat](#during-the-conversation-with-the-customer-after-accepting-the-chat)

### At the time of accepting the chat&#x20;

When a live agent picks a chat from the live agent queue by clicking the `Accept` button, they gain access to the entire conversation history. Based on this conversation, the live agents can determine whether the request must be transferred to another team even before engaging with the customer. This proactive approach facilitates quicker resolution by ensuring that chats are directed to the appropriate team with the relevant expertise.&#x20;

To transfer the request to another team at the time of accepting the chat:

* Click `Settings -> Avaamo Live agent` in the Avaamo dashboard home page to view the Live agent console
* In the `Live agent console`, click `Accept` from your list of queued chats to initiate the conversation with the customer.
* A preview of the complete conversation history is displayed in a pop-up. You can review the entire history and choose to transfer the chat by clicking the `Transfer to another team` button if you wish to transfer the chat.

* In the Transfer team pop-up, select the desired team, provide a transfer note if necessary, and click `Transfer to another team` to initiate the transfer of the chat request.

### During the conversation with the customer after accepting the chat

In certain situations, a live agent may initiate a chat with a customer and subsequently realize that there is another team better suited to assist with the specific query.&#x20;

In such instances, the live agent can utilize the `Transfer` icon located below the chat message box to initiate a transfer to another team.&#x20;

In the Transfer team pop-up, select the desired team, provide a transfer note if necessary, and click `Transfer to another team` to initiate the transfer of the chat request.

See [What happens after the transfer?](#what-happens-after-the-transfer) for more information.

### What happens after the transfer?

After a chat is transferred,&#x20;

* The chat is no longer listed in the live agent queue who has transferred the request to another team. Upon completion of the transfer, the chat is removed from the current live agent queue.
* The chat is now listed in the queued conversation list of the live agent from the transferred team.
* The live agent who accepts the chat from another team has the ability to review the entire conversation history, including any transfer notes left by the previous live agent, before engaging with the customer. This enables the live agent to gain a contextual understanding of the conversation in order to provide appropriate assistance to the customers.

When the live agent to whom the request is transferred accepts the request and starts chatting, a system message with a transfer note and the transfer team details are displayed to the live agent:

* From the end user's perspective, the experience remains seamless. The end user gets a unified chat experience with a live agent, unaffected by the transfer requests. However, the live agent transferring the request can notify the end user explicitly about the transfer. This proactive communication ensures that customers are informed about the transfer and are aware of any potential waiting period they may experience.
