# Release life cycle

### Beta (**Limited Availability)** <a href="#beta" id="beta"></a>

A beta release is a pre-release version of a feature, product, or enhancement that is made available to a select group of users for testing before the official launch.&#x20;

Although nearly complete, Beta features are subject to change before they reach General Availability (GA). Beta features documentation is also subject to change before GA. It is not recommended to use Beta features in production.

Beta features are enabled for select customers to provide early feedback to the product team before GA.

{% endhint %}

### General Availability (GA) <a href="#general_availability" id="general_availability"></a>

General Availability (GA) features have new or enhanced functionality and are enabled by default for all customers. This stage follows the beta phase and signifies that the product has undergone thorough testing, refinement, and validation.

### Deprecated <a href="#deprecated" id="deprecated"></a>

Continuously evaluating product capabilities, Avaamo consistently works towards enhancing overall customer value by upgrading older features with significantly improved alternatives. This process is executed with meticulous attention to ensuring continuous backward compatibility.

Typically, deprecated features still exist in the product for backward compatibility but will be removed in a subsequent release. However, the specific availability of a deprecated feature can vary with each release. Refer to the release notes of the particular version for precise information on the dates of availability.

Features slated for removal in a future release undergo a deprecation phase, first during which suitable alternatives are provided. While in the deprecated state, capabilities remain accessible but are not subject to further enhancements.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**Key point**: Deprecated features will only receive critical bug fixes and security updates until they are entirely phased out from the product. There are no SLA commitments for deprecated features.
{% endhint %}

### Removed

Removed features are no longer present in the product. Upon upgrading to a newer release, any use cases dependent on a removed feature will no longer work. No further support is offered for bug fixes or enhancements to a removed feature.

The removal of deprecated capabilities occurs in the subsequent major or minor release at the earliest. The specific date for removal will be communicated later. This systematic approach provides customers with at least one release cycle to adjust their implementation to a new version of a deprecated capability before the actual removal occurs.
