# Introducing "Advanced agent"

In this release, a new agent called the **`Advanced Agent`** has been introduced.&#x20;

In its fundamental nature, an `Advanced agent` achieves the "true" objective of a "Conversational Assistant" by involving the user in a dialogue closely resembling human interaction.&#x20;

The `Advanced Agent` uses our next-generation inference engine to provide a better user experience. It takes on a personalized approach, understanding nuances in the conversation, transforming interactions from a robotic demeanor to a more pleasurable and "conversational" experience for the user.

To the developers, this translates to **`a significant reduction in the amount of training data`** needed for the agent to comprehend user queries. You only have to train your agent with minimal meaningful user queries. The `Advanced agent` is capable of comprehending numerous nuances and variations in user queries.&#x20;

An `Advanced agent`, hence, stands out as distinctly superior, more intelligent, and more personalized compared to a `Standard agent`. The following illustrations depict a sample comparison of training data between a `Standard agent` and an `Advanced agent`:

**Notes**:&#x20;

* `Advanced agent` is enabled on demand. Contact Avaamo Support with your use case to enable this feature for your account. Note that the `Advanced agent` is included as part of the base platform and does not require an additional license fee.
* All the existing Standard agents before v8.0.0 continue to remain as-is. If you wish to migrate from a Standard agent to an Advanced agent, see [Migrating to Advanced agent](#migrating-to-advanced-agent), for more information.

## Key features

### **Human-like conversation**

Advanced agent responses are not limited to simple one-word responses but can include detailed explanations, descriptions, or discussions, depending on the complexity of the question. It makes your agent more intuitive and user-friendly, simulating human-like interactions.

### **Deep semantic understanding**

Advanced agents can comprehend the meaning of language beyond surface-level syntax by understanding the context, and relationships between words, and grasping the nuances of language semantics. This implies a massive reduction in the amount of training data required by the agent to understand the user query.

The following illustration demonstrates how an `Advanced agent` is capable of understanding different nuances and variations of "Create an incident" training data when compared to a `Standard agent`:

**Standard agent:**&#x20;

### **Conversational memory**

An `Advanced agent` can remember and maintain context throughout a conversation. This enables the system to understand references, callbacks, and evolving topics within the dialogue.

## How does it work?

Creating an `Advanced agent` is similar to creating a `Standard agent` and most of the functionalities available in the `Standard agent` are also available in the `Advanced agent`.

## Migrating to Advanced agent

* Currently migrating from a `Standard agent` to an `Advanced agent` is a manual process. Contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager for further assistance.
* Importing a Standard agent into an Advanced agent is not supported.&#x20;
