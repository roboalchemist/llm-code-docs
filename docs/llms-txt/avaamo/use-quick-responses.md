# Use quick responses

Live agents can utilize pre-written responses, also known as quick responses, or rephrase them to provide improved and precise responses that contribute to an enhanced customer experience.&#x20;

They empower agents to handle inquiries more effectively, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and a streamlined support experience. See [Quick responses](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/live-agent-console/supervisor/quick-responses), for further details on the advantages of quick responses and the supervisor's role in building such responses to enhance customer satisfaction.

**To use the quick responses**:

* Click `Settings -> Avaamo Live agent` in the Avaamo dashboard home page to view the Live agent console
* In the `Live agent console`, type **#** in the message box to view the list of all the quick responses.
