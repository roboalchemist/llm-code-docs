# SMS Gateway Analytics

In simple terms, an SMS gateway allows a device to send or receive text messages in the form of Short Message Service (SMS) transmissions between local and/or international telecommunications networks.&#x20;

Emulating the same concept in the Avaamo Conversational AI Platform is the `SMS Send API`. This API acts as an SMS Gateway. You can use the `SMS Send API` to send an agent's greeting message as an SMS to the specified phone number. In turn, the user can respond back to the agent via SMS and this can initiate a conversation flow based on the way you have designed your agent. See [SMS Send API](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/ref/avaamo-platform-api-documentation/sms-send-api), for more information.

**SMS Gateway Analytics** allows you to view the SMS report of the messages sent through the SMS Send API. With these statistics, you can decide how and where to further improve the user experience with your agent based on your business requirements.

**Note**: SMS Gateway Analytics is available only when the SMS channel is enabled for the agent. See [SMS channel](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/deploy/sms), for more information.
