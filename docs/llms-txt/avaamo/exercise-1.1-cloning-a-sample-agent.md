# Exercise 1.1: Cloning a sample agent

The easiest way to understand how agents work is by observing and understanding how a sample agent works. Once you login to your Avaamo dashboard, you are presented with 4 sample agents. These agents are&#x20;

* Sample: My Assistant
* Sample Agent: Auto Insurance
* Sample Agent: Service Desk
* Sample Agent: Healthcare.&#x20;

Pick the Sample Agent, Sample Agent: My Assistant. Make a copy of the Agent by clicking the hamburger menu and select the option - Make a Copy
