# Exercise 10.2: Understand Agent Permission

When you create an agent, you become the owner of the agent. Also, when a user promotes an agent, he becomes the owner of the agent. As the owner of the agent, you can now assign different permissions to different people within your company.

There are 4 types of permissions available for the agent:

* **View** - Users can only view the agent, but cannot edit it
* **Edit** - The users can view and edit the agent
* **Publish** - Users can view agent, edit agent and publish skills from the agent to the skill store
* **Owner** - Full access to the agent. Users can view agent, edit agent, publish agent from the agent to skill store, and edit agent permissions.

To give users permission to access your agent navigate to **Agent -> Configuration -> Permission**
