# Manage web channel

After you configure the channel settings, you can view, edit, disconnect and delete the channel settings as per your requirement. See [Manage channel settings](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/deploy/manage-channel-settings), for more information.

You can also deploy your agent through multiple web channels simultaneously. See [Deploy in multiple web channel instances](https://docs.avaamo.com/user-guide/how-to/build-agents/configure-agents/deploy/web-channel/deploy-and-test-web-channel), for more information.
