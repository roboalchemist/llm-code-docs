# Upload source maps for web - Docs

1.  1

    ## Install the PostHog CLI

    Required

    Install `posthog-cli`:

    PostHog AI

    ### Npm

    ```bash
    npm install -g @posthog/cli
    ```

    ### Curl

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/releases/latest/download/posthog-cli-installer.sh | sh
    posthog-cli-update
    ```

2.  2

    ## Authenticate the PostHog CLI

    Required

    To authenticate the CLI, call the `login` command. This opens your browser where you select your organization, project, and API scopes to grant:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    posthog-cli login
    ```

    If you are using the CLI in a CI/CD environment such as GitHub Actions, you can set environment variables to authenticate:

    | Environment Variable | Description | Source |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | POSTHOG_CLI_HOST | The PostHog host to connect to [default: https://us.posthog.com] | [Project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project#variables) |
    | POSTHOG_CLI_PROJECT_ID | PostHog project ID | [Project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project#variables) |
    | POSTHOG_CLI_API_KEY | Personal API key with error tracking write and organization read scopes | [API key settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#variables) |

    You can also use the `--host` option instead of the `POSTHOG_CLI_HOST` environment variable to target a different PostHog instance or region. For EU users:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    posthog-cli --host https://eu.posthog.com [CMD]
    ```

    ## Output source maps for web

    Required

    If you serve minified bundles in production, PostHog requires source maps to generate accurate stack traces. Here are instructions to enable source map generation for popular build tools:

    | Build Tool | Documentation |
    | --- | --- |
    | Vite | [Source Map Configuration](https://v3.vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-sourcemap) |
    | webpack | [Source Map Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) |
    | Rollup | [Source Map Options](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-sourcemap) |

    For other build tools, consult their documentation to enable source maps.

    ## Inject source map

    Required

    *Your goal in this step: Add metadata to associate maps with your code.*

    Once you've built your application and have bundled assets, inject the context required by PostHog to associate the maps with the served code.

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    # Inject release and chunk metadata into sourcemaps
    posthog-cli sourcemap inject --directory ./path/to/assets
    ```

5.  ## Verify source map injection

    Checkpoint

    *Confirm source map comments are present*

    Confirm that the served files are injected with the correct source map comment in production in dev tools.

    JavaScript

    PostHog AI

    ```javascript
    //# chunkId=0197e6db-9a73-7b91-9e80-4e1b7158db5c
    ```

6.  5

    ## Upload source map

    Required

    *Your goal in this step: Send the processed source maps to PostHog.*

    You will then need to upload the modified assets to PostHog.

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    # Upload injected sourcemaps to their release
    posthog-cli sourcemap upload --directory ./path/to/assets --release-name my-app --release-version 1.2.3
    ```

    The CLI will create or reuse the [release](/docs/error-tracking/releases.md) for the detected or supplied release name and version. The CLI will try to detect release name and version information, but you can set them explicitly with `--release-name` and `--release-version`. We recommend setting the release name, and letting the CLI detect the version, if your project is continuously deployed (the version will be the git commit hash at build time).

    > **💡 Tip:** You can use `--delete-after` option to clean up sourcemaps after uploading them.

    #### Serve injected assets

    You *must* serve the injected assets in deployed production app. The injected metadata is used during error capture to identify the correct source map to use. We suggest you upload source maps right after your production build in CI.

    If you serve a copy of the bundled assets as they were prior to running `posthog-cli sourcemap inject`, we won't be able to use the uploaded sourcemap to unminify or demangle your stack traces.

8.  ## Verify source maps upload

    Checkpoint

    Confirm that source maps are successfully uploaded to PostHog.[Check symbol sets in PostHog](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#error-tracking-symbol-sets)
