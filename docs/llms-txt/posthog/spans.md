# Spans - Docs

Spans are units of work within an LLM [trace](/docs/llm-analytics/traces.md). These are events that represent individual operations and discrete durations within your LLM application, like function calls, vector searches, or data retrieval steps, providing granular visibility into the execution flow.

Spans are nested and displayed within a trace

PostHog captures spans to track atomic operations that make up your LLM workflow. For example:

-   **[Generations](/docs/llm-analytics/generations.md)** - LLM calls and interactions
-   **Vector database searches** - Document and embedding retrieval
-   **Tool/function calls** - API calls, calculations, database queries
-   **RAG pipeline steps** - Retrieval, reranking, context building
-   **Data processing** - Validation, chunking, formatting

For technical implementation details, see [manual capture](/docs/llm-analytics/installation/manual-capture.md).

## Event properties

A span is a single action within your application, such as a function call or vector database search.

**Event name**: `$ai_span`

### Core properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $ai_trace_id | The trace ID (a UUID to group related AI events together)Must contain only letters, numbers, and the following characters: -, _, ~, ., @, (, ), !, ', :, \|Example: d9222e05-8708-41b8-98ea-d4a21849e761 |
| $ai_session_id | (Optional) Groups related traces together. Use this to organize traces by whatever grouping makes sense for your application (user sessions, workflows, conversations, or other logical boundaries).Example: session-abc-123, conv-user-456 |
| $ai_span_id | (Optional) Unique identifier for this spanExample: bdf42359-9364-4db7-8958-c001f28c9255 |
| $ai_span_name | (Optional) The name of the spanExample: vector_search, data_retrieval, tool_call |
| $ai_parent_id | (Optional) Parent ID for tree view grouping (trace_id or another span_id)Example: 537b7988-0186-494f-a313-77a5a8f7db26 |
| $ai_latency | (Optional) The latency of the span in secondsExample: 0.361 |
| $ai_is_error | (Optional) Boolean to indicate if the span encountered an error |
