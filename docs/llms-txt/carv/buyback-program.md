# Buyback Program

## **What is the Up-to-100% Buyback Program?**

In order to empower our community to participate confidently in building the foundation of a sustainable, user-owned internet, CARV is pioneering a mechanism: the 'Up-to-100% Buyback Program',

**Eligibility:** Pre-Token Generation Event (TGE) Node license holders who have maintained 70% or higher participation rate, and have not claimed any veCARV rewards will be eligible for the buyback program.

{% hint style="info" %}
Participants who delegate their node, instead of running it independently, must delegate only to nodes with a commission rate of up to 3% and that maintain over 70% uptime until the buyback claim is made. Additionally, these delegators are not eligible to claim any remaining rewards beyond what is covered by the delegation terms.
{% endhint %}

**Timeline:** From six months post Token Generation Event (TGE), node license holders have 7 days to participate in the Program.

### **Execution options:**

**100% buyback with $CARV**, value equivalent to the price of nodes denominated in USDT at the time of node purchase. 30-day linear vesting from time of buyback. OR

**80% immediate buyback in ETH**, value equivalent to the price of nodes snapshot in ETH at time of purchase. Immediate ETH release.\
To ensure transparency and security, CARV is integrating the 100% buyback program into smart contracts and collaborating with reputable, top-tier third-party auditors.

{% hint style="info" %}
Funds will be collected in a [Ceffu ](https://www.ceffu.com/)cold wallet address and serve as the security deposit for the ETH buyback.

Arbitrum Address: [0x3014Ab992464E3323D4b53570baDF782aC897a67 ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3014Ab992464E3323D4b53570baDF782aC897a67)
{% endhint %}

10,000,000 $CARV is allocated from treasury to ensure a 100% buyback with a 30-day linear vesting period. Node license holders will keep all airdrops prior to participation in the Program.

Some of the bought-back nodes will be reallocated to existing active node operators to further incentivize their participation. The rest will go to the CARV treasury, with potential uses including sharing node operation rewards with $CARV stakers, or conducting node resale or burning.\
