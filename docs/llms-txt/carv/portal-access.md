### **Data Analytics**

Based on the on-chain and off-chain zero & first-party data from over 2.4M users across various platforms, along with user behavior within CARV and CARV-partnered games, CARV offers its partners data analysis capabilities not limited to the following, to help games better understand their users:

1. Based on user on-chain and off-chain account bindings and data authorizations, generate over 200 user tags, providing games with data query capabilities, targeted advertising, and user attribute analysis based on tags.
2. Based on user participation in events, provide game projects with post-event data and participant profiles.
3. Based on user behavior in partnership games (through CARV ID Oauth or CARV API), provide game projects with user behavior data analysis and user profiling.
4. Based on game’s target user profiles, provide similar target audience group analysis and competitive analysis to partnered games.
5. Discord growth, engagement, retention, event data, and regional data analysis
6. Twitter data monitoring and analysis and sentiment analysis (in alpha testing).
