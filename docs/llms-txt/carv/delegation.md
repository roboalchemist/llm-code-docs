# Delegation

* **NFT Holder Delegation:** Each NFT holder can delegate to only one verifier per day, thereby earning rewards from only that verifier.
* **Commission Rate:** The CARV protocol has a commission rate for delegations. The rewards from verifications will be shared between the NFT holder and the verifier according to this rate. For example, with a commission rate of 1%, 99% of the verification rewards will go to the NFT holder, and 1% will go to the verifier.
