# CARV/veCARV Token

## **CARV Token**

1. Implements the standard ERC20 (decimals: 18).
2. Mints 1 billion tokens to a specified address upon deployment; no further minting is possible afterward.

## **veCARV Token**

1. A non-transferable ERC20 token (decimals: 18), where standard addresses cannot invoke transfer or *transferFrom* methods.
2. Only the Vault contract can call transfer, used for distributing user verification rewards.
3. Locks the CARV Token address upon deployment, which cannot be modified thereafter.
4. No explicit minting method; veCARV can only be minted through 1:1 staking of CARV and is burned upon redemption.
5. Future governance of the CARV protocol will be enabled by associating the veCARV Token address with the governance contract.
