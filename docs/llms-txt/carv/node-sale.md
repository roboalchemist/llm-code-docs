#### **Why Run a Node on CARV?**

Running a verifier node is crucial to maintaining the integrity and security of the data processing environment. Verifier nodes validate attestations produced by TEE nodes, ensuring the data processing is executed securely and as intended. The presence of a majority of honest verifiers, exceeding 50%, is vital to ensure the accurate verification and recording of attestation results on the blockchain, thus upholding the protocol's reliability and transparency.

#### **What will I receive from participating in the node sale?**

You will receive an NFT (ERC-721) which represents your Node License. The NFTs will be minted and transferred by CARV team 3 weeks after the public sale.

#### **How will the node licenses be distributed?**

After purchasing a node license, node licenses will be distributed as an NFT to the purchase wallet of the user. Only the wallet with the node license can then operate the node and earn rewards.

#### **What is the payment method for purchasing a node?**

You can purchase nodes using wETH on the Arbitrum network.

#### **How do run a node? Is it complicated?**

Not at all! Running a node can be quite straightforward and easy, typically involving just a few steps. Please check this step by step tutorial [here](https://docs.carv.io/carv-ecosystem/verifier-nodes/join-mainnet-verifier-nodes). We will soon provide a video tutorial to guide you through the process. If you prefer not to manage the node yourself, you can delegate to other node operators with just a single click through our explorer, which will be available shortly.

#### **Will the invitation leaderboard have an anti-sybil mechanism?**

Yes. There is an anti-sybil mechanism to protect the rights of users who participate honestly in the event. If an invited account is verified to be a bot or another type of non-authentic user account, that user will face severe penalties.

#### **On the referral leaderboard, if I appear on both the overall leaderboard and the weekly leaderboard, can I receive rewards from both lists?**

Yes, for example, if you are ranked 20th on the weekly leaderboard and 50th on the overall leaderboard, you will receive ranking rewards from both leaderboards.
