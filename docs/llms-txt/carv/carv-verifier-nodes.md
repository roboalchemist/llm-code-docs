# CARV Verifier Nodes

CARV Verifier Nodes are the cornerstone of the CARV ecosystem’s security, trust, and verification processes. Introduced before CARV’s Token Generation Event (TGE), these nodes have been operational since the inception of the CARV Protocol, where they played a pivotal role in verifying and securing decentralized identity and data interactions.With the introduction of CARV SVM Chain and the **D.A.T.A (Data Authentication, Trust, and Attestation)** framework, CARV Verifier Nodes have evolved to handle even more complex verification tasks, ensuring a robust, scalable, and privacy-centric infrastructure for AI agents and decentralized applications.

**Initial Role in CARV Protocol**:

* At the launch of CARV Protocol, Verifier Nodes were designed to validate decentralized identity and data attestations across Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.
* They enabled seamless, trustless interactions by ensuring the accuracy of identity claims and the integrity of data used in CARV’s decentralized identity solutions.

**Extended Role in CARV SVM Chain**:

* With the advent of CARV’s SVM Layer 2 architecture, Verifier Nodes now validate both **chain-level proofs** and **data privacy guarantees**, providing critical infrastructure to support AI agents and their on-chain ecosystems.
* By verifying zk-proofs generated through CARV’s zkVM and ensuring TEE attestations, Verifier Nodes safeguard the state transitions and data usage of AI agents.

CARV Verifier Nodes have grown into a comprehensive validation network, ensuring the security of the CARV Protocol, CARV SVM Chain, and the dynamic ecosystems they support. This evolution positions them as critical infrastructure for a future defined by AI-powered, decentralized interactions.
