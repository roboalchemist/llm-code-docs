# Verifier Nodes

Verifier nodes are components of the [verification layer](https://docs.carv.io/carv-ecosystem/broken-reference).

Verifier nodes are lightweight nodes managed by the community. They play a crucial role in maintaining the protocol's integrity, thereby enhancing its trustworthiness and security. Currently, these nodes primarily check TEE attestations on-chain, verifying that the results are reliable and that the process maintains the privacy of user data.
