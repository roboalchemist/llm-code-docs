# Operating a Verifier Node

If you prefer not to delegate your node (See [delegation](https://docs.carv.io/carv-ecosystem/verifier-nodes/delegation "mention")), there are several ways you can operate your own CARV nodes:

1. **Verifier Client CLI**: You can run the nodes on your own machine by downloading the appropriate software for your operating system. By keeping the software running for at least 6 hours per day, you can earn your expected rewards. (See [running-in-cli](https://docs.carv.io/carv-ecosystem/verifier-nodes/join-mainnet-verifier-nodes/operating-a-verifier-node/running-in-cli "mention"))
2. **Verifier Client App**: We offer a browser version of the verifier nodes. By running the verifiers in your browser and keeping it open, you can generate rewards without needing to download any software. This solution is convenient and works on any OS, including mobile devices, as long as the browser remains active. (See [running-in-desktop-app](https://docs.carv.io/carv-ecosystem/verifier-nodes/join-mainnet-verifier-nodes/operating-a-verifier-node/running-in-desktop-app "mention"))
3. **Virtual Private Servers (VPS)**: If you have difficulty keeping your node up and running on your local environment, you can use a VPS, such as AWS, Ali Cloud, or Google Cloud. A VPS provides a managed execution environment, allowing you to keep your node operational 24/7. Note that using a VPS may incur additional fees and require manual management of the installed software. (See [running-in-vps](https://docs.carv.io/carv-ecosystem/verifier-nodes/join-mainnet-verifier-nodes/operating-a-verifier-node/running-in-vps "mention"))
4. **Node-as-a-Service (NaaS)**: NaaS providers handle everything for you, including setup, deployment, and management. Here are some official CARV NaaS partners:

   * [Easeflow](https://easeflow.io/)
   * [Infstones](https://infstones.com/)
   * [Nodeops](https://console.nodeops.xyz/)
   * [BwareLabs](https://blastapi.io/node-as-a-service)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that all methods mentioned above guarantee the same rewards for each license you operate. If you have multiple licenses, you can delegate all of them to a single node operated by yourself. However, the more reliable your node is, the higher the possibility of receiving delegations from the community.
