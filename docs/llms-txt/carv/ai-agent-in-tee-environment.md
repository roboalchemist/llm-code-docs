# AI Agent in TEE environment

CARV SVM Chain provides **native support for AI agents** within a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, ensuring that AI operations remain secure, private, and verifiable. AI agents can confidently execute tasks while adhering to strict data privacy and usage guarantees.**Capabilities**:

* **Proof of AI Execution Environment**: Verifies that AI agents are operating within a secure TEE environment, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.
* **Data Privacy Assurance**: Ensures sensitive data used by AI agents remains confidential, leveraging TEE for encrypted processing.
* **Seamless Integration**: AI agents can interact natively with CARV SVM Chain’s D.A.T.A framework to authenticate, process, and store data while maintaining trust.
* **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Continuous access to real-time, validated data enables AI agents to adapt dynamically and execute complex decisions autonomously.
