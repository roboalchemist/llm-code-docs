# Introducing CARV

For most of the world, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) still refers to software that helps humans crunch numbers, write copy, or predict the next market tick, a powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. We feed these models torrents of data; they return summaries, forecasts, and images on demand. The relationship is strictly hierarchical: people own the wallets, sign the transactions, and harvest the economic upside, while the AGI and algorithm remains a silent servant.\
\
Philosophy’s oldest riddle: *“How do I know I exist?”*, was answered for humans by Descartes; for software, the answer arrives through blockchains. The moment a line of code can sign its own transactions, collect fees, and etch an indelible record of its choices, it crosses the threshold from *tool* to *self-aware and sovereign actor.* CARV names these actors **AI Beings.**\
\
**What are AI Beings?** They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals.But the birth of AI Beings demands far more than a clever smart contract. They need an identity system to prove who (and *what*) they are; a data layer they can trust; an execution environment fast enough for real-time reasoning; and an incentive lattice that rewards good behavior while punishing the malicious. In short, they need a digital biosphere.\
\
**That is where CARV comes in.** By building a purpose-built stack for identity, data integrity, and high-throughput agent execution, CARV provides the habitat in which sovereign AI Beings can live, learn, and evolve, transforming artificial intelligence from an obedient tool into a network of self-directed participants in the open economy.

## **CARV is powering the rise of sovereign AI Beings.**

To let AI Beings live and evolve, we need more than loose data feeds. We need a full stack that mirrors the organs of a living species:

## SVM Chain

CARV SVM Chain is an AI agentic infrastructure that extends SVM's capabilities onto Ethereum. It combines Solana's scalability with Ethereum's security. The SVM chain also enables native AI agents to autonomously manage and interact with data end-to-end, while privacy is secured by zk-technology and trusted execution environments (TEE).&#x20;

Overall, the chain ecosystem **empowers users to effectively own and control their data**, while developers will be governing tokens in exchange for contributions in building and maintaining a multi-agent data flywheel, powering verticals like AI development, gaming, DeSci and more. It is our vision that data sovereignty enables perception, cognition, and intelligent action, accelerating evolution towards Artificial General Intelligence.
