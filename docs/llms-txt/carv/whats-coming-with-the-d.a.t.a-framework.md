# What's Coming with the D.A.T.A Framework

The **D.A.T.A Framework** is designed to unlock a wide array of use cases, empowering AI agents with seamless access to both on-chain and off-chain data. As we continue to expand and enhance the D.A.T.A Framework, we are laying the foundation for new features and integrations that will push the boundaries of what AI agents can achieve in decentralized ecosystems. Below are the key use cases that will soon be available to all D.A.T.A-enabled AI agents:

## **Timeline and Future Features**

The following use cases will be rolled out in stages over the next few months. Each phase will bring new capabilities to the D.A.T.A Framework, empowering AI agents with even more autonomy, intelligence, and access to data.

**Phase 1: (Jan2025)**

* On-Chain Activity Alerts
* Autonomous On-Chain Actions (Airdrops, Token Transfers)
* Cross-Chain Insights

**Phase 2: (Feb 2025)**

* Social Media Integration for Enhanced User Profiling by leveraging **CARV ID**
* Swarm of Agents for Modular Data Access

**Phase 3: (March 2025)**

* Memory Sharing Between AI Agents
* Centralized Data Repository for Knowledge Sharing
* Enhanced Querying with AI Model Integration

**Phase 4: (April 2025)**

* Real-Time Analytics for Blockchain Activities
* Customizable Data Fetching and Query Generation
* Risk and Compliance Monitoring

With these upcoming features, **D.A.T.A Framework** is set to dramatically enhance the capabilities of AI agents, making them smarter, more autonomous, and capable of interacting with both on-chain and off-chain data at an unprecedented scale. By leveraging the full spectrum of data—from real-time on-chain transactions to off-chain social and market data—AI agents will become far more effective at understanding their environment, making informed decisions, and driving impactful actions.

As we continue to evolve the framework, these use cases will unlock a new era of data-driven, autonomous AI, benefiting not just the agents themselves but the decentralized ecosystem at large.
