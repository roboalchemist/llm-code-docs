# Prototyping vs Production

> Choose between optimized development pricing and full compatibility for your workloads

Thunder Compute offers two modes for running instances.

| Feature                   | Prototyping        | Production              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Cost                      | Lower              | Higher                  |
| Compatibility             | Most ML workloads  | Full CUDA compatibility |
| GPUs                      | A6000, A100, H100  | A100, H100              |
| Multi-GPU                 | H100: up to 2 GPUs | Up to 8 GPUs            |
| Graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan) | No                 | Yes                     |

## Prototyping Mode

<Note>
  Prototyping mode is currently in beta and exclusively available on Thunder Compute.
</Note>

Prototyping mode applies CUDA-level optimizations to maximize GPU utilization, significantly reducing costs for AI/ML development workflows.

### Supported Software

* **PyTorch**: Fully supported (downgrading from the pre-installed version may cause issues)
* **TensorFlow**
* **JAX**
* **Jupyter Notebooks**
* **Model Serving**: ComfyUI, Ollama, VLLM, and others
* **Fine Tuning**: Unsloth and others

### Unsupported Workloads

* Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, FFMPEG)
* Custom CUDA kernels (may exhibit unpredictable behavior)
* Hardware-specific profiling tools

<Tip>
  If you encounter issues with an unsupported workload, switch to production mode with [modify](/vscode/operations/modifying-instances) for full compatibility.
</Tip>

## Production Mode

Production mode provisions a standard virtual machine with full CUDA compatibility and predictable performance.

### When to Choose Production

* Long-running training jobs
* Multi-GPU workloads (up to 8 GPUs)
* Graphics workloads (OpenGL, Vulkan, FFMPEG)
* Custom CUDA kernels
* Workloads requiring accurate hardware metrics

## Switching Between Modes

[Modify existing instances](/vscode/operations/modifying-instances) to switch between prototyping and production mode. This also lets you change GPU type, vCPUs, and RAM. Storage can be expanded but not reduced.
