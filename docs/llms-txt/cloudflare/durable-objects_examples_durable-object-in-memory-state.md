This example shows you how Durable Objects are stateful, meaning in-memory state can be retained between requests. After a brief period of inactivity, the Durable Object will be evicted, and all in-memory state will be lost. The next request will reconstruct the object, but instead of showing the city of the previous request, it will display a message indicating that the object has been reinitialized. If you need your applications state to survive eviction, write the state to storage by using the [Storage API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/), or by storing your data elsewhere.

* JavaScript

  ```js
  import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";


  // Worker
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      return await handleRequest(request, env);
    },
  };


  async function handleRequest(request, env) {
    let stub = env.LOCATION.getByName("A");
    // Forward the request to the remote Durable Object.
    let resp = await stub.fetch(request);
    // Return the response to the client.
    return new Response(await resp.text());
  }


  // Durable Object
  export class Location extends DurableObject {
    constructor(state, env) {
      super(state, env);
      // Upon construction, you do not have a location to provide.
      // This value will be updated as people access the Durable Object.
      // When the Durable Object is evicted from memory, this will be reset.
      this.location = null;
    }


    // Handle HTTP requests from clients.
    async fetch(request) {
      let response = null;


      if (this.location == null) {
        response = new String(`
  This is the first request, you called the constructor, so this.location was null.
  You will set this.location to be your city: (${request.cf.city}). Try reloading the page.`);
      } else {
        response = new String(`
  The Durable Object was already loaded and running because it recently handled a request.


  Previous Location: ${this.location}
  New Location: ${request.cf.city}`);
      }


      // You set the new location to be the new city.
      this.location = request.cf.city;
      console.log(response);
      return new Response(response);
    }
  }
  ```

* Python

  ```py
  from workers import DurableObject, Response, WorkerEntrypoint


  # Worker
  class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
      return await handle_request(request, self.env)


  async def handle_request(request, env):
    stub = env.LOCATION.getByName("A")
    # Forward the request to the remote Durable Object.
    resp = await stub.fetch(request)
    # Return the response to the client.
    return Response(await resp.text())


  # Durable Object
  class Location(DurableObject):
    def __init__(self, ctx, env):
      super().__init__(ctx, env)
      # Upon construction, you do not have a location to provide.
      # This value will be updated as people access the Durable Object.
      # When the Durable Object is evicted from memory, this will be reset.
      self.location = None


    # Handle HTTP requests from clients.
    async def fetch(self, request):
      response = None


      if self.location is None:
        response = f"""
  This is the first request, you called the constructor, so this.location was null.
  You will set this.location to be your city: ({request.js_object.cf.city}). Try reloading the page."""
      else:
        response = f"""
  The Durable Object was already loaded and running because it recently handled a request.


  Previous Location: {self.location}
  New Location: {request.js_object.cf.city}"""


      # You set the new location to be the new city.
      self.location = request.js_object.cf.city
      print(response)
      return Response(response)
  ```

Finally, configure your Wrangler file to include a Durable Object [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/get-started/#4-configure-durable-object-bindings) and [migration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) based on the namespace and class name chosen previously.
