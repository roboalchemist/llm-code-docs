## 2026-01-30

**RealtimeKit Web Core 1.2.4**

**Compatibility:** Works best with RealtimeKit Web UI Kit 1.1.0 or later.

**New APIs**

Added chat pagination support with the following methods:

* `meeting.chat.fetchPinnedMessages` - Fetch pinned messages from server.
* `meeting.chat.fetchPublicMessages` - Fetch public messages from server.
* `meeting.chat.fetchPrivateMessages` - Fetch private messages from server.

**Enhancements**

* Added JSDoc comments to all public-facing methods and classes for improved developer suggestions.
* Chat message operations (edit, delete, pin) are now available to all RealtimeKit clients without additional configuration.
* `pinMessage` and `unpinMessage` events on `meeting.chat` now emit reliably.
* Message pinning (`meeting.chat.pin` and `meeting.chat.unpin`) is now available to all participants.

**Removed APIs**

Removed non-operational chat channel APIs to streamline the RealtimeKit SDK. Meeting chat (`meeting.chat`) remains fully operational.

* Removed `meeting.self.permissions.chatChannel`.
* Removed `meeting.self.permissions.chatMessage`. Use `meeting.self.permissions.chatPublic` and `meeting.self.permissions.chatPrivate` instead.
* Removed `meeting.chat.channels`.
* Removed `meeting.chat.sendMessageToChannel`.
* Removed `meeting.chat.markLastReadMessage`.
* Removed events: `channelMessageUpdate`, `channelCreate`, and `channelUpdate` from `meeting.chat`.

**API changes**

* The following methods no longer accept a third optional `channelId` parameter:

  * `meeting.chat.editTextMessage(messageId, message)`
  * `meeting.chat.editImageMessage(messageId, imageFile)`
  * `meeting.chat.editFileMessage(messageId, file)`
  * `meeting.chat.editMessage(messageId, messagePayload)`
  * `meeting.chat.deleteMessage(messageId)`

**Deprecations**

The following methods are deprecated due to scalability limitations (limited to 1,000 recent messages):

* `meeting.chat.messages` - Only fetches recent messages and new messages after joining.
* `meeting.chat.getMessagesByUser` - Use new fetch methods for scalable message retrieval.
* `meeting.chat.getMessagesByType` - Use new fetch methods for scalable message retrieval.
* `meeting.chat.getMessages` - Use `meeting.chat.fetchPublicMessages` or `meeting.chat.fetchPrivateMessages` instead.
* `meeting.chat.pinned` - Use `meeting.chat.fetchPinnedMessages` instead.
* `meeting.chat.searchMessages` - Use `meeting.chat.fetchPublicMessages` or `meeting.chat.fetchPrivateMessages` instead.

**Known limitations**

* Pinned messages are not supported for private chats.

## 2026-01-05

**RealtimeKit Web Core 1.2.3**

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where users who joined a meeting with audio and video disabled and then initiated tab screen sharing would experience SDP corruption upon stopping the screen share, preventing subsequent actions such as enabling audio or video.

  Error thrown:

  ```text
  InvalidAccessError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set remote answer sdp: Failed to set remote audio description send parameters for m-section with mid='<N>'
  ```

* Fixed an issue where awaiting `RealtimeKitClient.initMedia` did not return media tracks

  Example usage:

  ```ts
  const media = await RealtimeKitClient.initMedia({
    video : true,
    audio: true,
  });

  const { videoTrack, audioTrack } = media;
  ```

* Fixed an issue where an undefined variable caused `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getValue')` in media retrieval due to a race condition.

## 2025-10-30

**RealtimeKit Web Core 1.2.0**

  ```ts
  initMeeting({
    overrides: {
      simulcastConfig: {
        disable: false,
        encodings: [{ scaleResolutionDownBy: 2 }],
      },
    },
  });

**Fixes**
