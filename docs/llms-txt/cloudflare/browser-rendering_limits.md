Browser Rendering limits are based on your [Cloudflare Workers plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/).

For pricing information, refer to [Browser Rendering pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/pricing/).

## Workers Free

Need higher limits?

If you are on a Workers Free plan and you want to increase your limits, upgrade to a Workers Paid plan in the **Workers plans** page of the Cloudflare dashboard:

[Go to **Workers plans**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/plans)

| Feature | Limit |
| - | - |
| Browser hours | 10 minutes per day |
| Concurrent browsers per account (Workers Bindings only) [1](#user-content-fn-1) | 3 per account |
| New browser instances (Workers Bindings only) | 3 per minute |
| Browser timeout | 60 seconds [2](#user-content-fn-2) |
| Total requests (REST API only) | 6 per minute |

## Workers Paid

Need higher limits?

If you are on a Workers Paid plan and you want to increase your limits beyond those listed here, Cloudflare will grant [requests for higher limits](https://forms.gle/CdueDKvb26mTaepa9) on a case-by-case basis.

| Feature | Limit |
| - | - |
| Browser hours | No limit ([See pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/pricing/)) |
| Concurrent browsers per account (Workers Bindings only) [1](#user-content-fn-1) | 30 per account ([See pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/pricing/)) |
| New browser instances per minute (Workers Bindings only) | 30 per minute |
| Browser timeout | 60 seconds [2](#user-content-fn-2) |
| Total requests per min (REST API only) | 180 per minute |

## Limits FAQ & troubleshooting

### How can I manage concurrency and session isolation with Browser Rendering?

If you are hitting concurrency [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/limits/#workers-paid), or want to optimize concurrent browser usage with the [Workers Binding method](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/), here are a few tips:

* Optimize with tabs or shared browsers: Instead of launching a new browser for each task, consider opening multiple tabs or running multiple actions within the same browser instance.
* [Reuse sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/reuse-sessions/): You can optimize your setup and decrease startup time by reusing sessions instead of launching a new browser every time. If you are concerned about maintaining test isolation (for example, for tests that depend on a clean environment), we recommend using [incognito browser contexts](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser.createbrowsercontext), which isolate cookies and cache with other sessions.

If you are still running into concurrency limits you can [request a higher limit](https://forms.gle/CdueDKvb26mTaepa9).

### Can I increase the browser timeout?

By default, a browser instance will time out after 60 seconds of inactivity. If you want to keep the browser open longer, you can use the [`keep_alive` option](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/#keep-alive), which allows you to extend the timeout to up to 10 minutes.

### Is there a maximum session duration?

There is no fixed maximum lifetime for a browser session as long as it remains active. By default, Browser Rendering closes sessions after one minute of inactivity to prevent unintended usage. You can [increase this inactivity timeout](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/#keep-alive) to up to 10 minutes.

If you need sessions to remain open longer, keep them active by sending a command at least once within your configured inactivity window (for example, every 10 minutes). Sessions also close when Browser Rendering rolls out a new release.

### I upgraded from the Workers Free plan, but I'm still hitting the 10-minute per day limit. What should I do?

If you recently upgraded to the [Workers Paid plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) but still encounter the 10-minute per day limit, redeploy your Worker to ensure your usage is correctly associated with the new plan.

### Why is my browser usage higher than expected?

If you are hitting the daily limit or seeing higher usage than expected, the most common cause is browser sessions that are not being closed properly. When a browser session is not explicitly closed with `browser.close()`, it remains open and continues to consume browser time until it times out (60 seconds by default, or up to 10 minutes if you use the `keep_alive` option).

To minimize usage:

* Always call `browser.close()` when you are finished with a browser session.
* Wrap your browser code in a `try/finally` block to ensure `browser.close()` is called even if an error occurs.
* Use [`puppeteer.history()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/#list-recent-sessions) or [`playwright.history()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/#list-recent-sessions) to review recent sessions and identify any that closed due to `BrowserIdle` instead of `NormalClosure`. Sessions that close due to idle timeout indicate the browser was not closed explicitly.

You can monitor your usage and view session close reasons in the Cloudflare dashboard on the **Browser Rendering** page:

[Go to **Browser Rendering**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/browser-rendering)

Refer to [Browser close reasons](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/reference/browser-close-reasons/) for more information.

## Rate limits and errors

### Understanding rate limits

Rate limits are enforced with a fixed per-second fill rate, not as a burst allowance. This means you cannot send all your requests at once — the API expects them to be spread evenly over the minute.

| Plan | Rate limit | Per-second equivalent |
| - | - | - |
| Workers Free | 6 requests/min | 1 request every 10 seconds |
| Workers Paid | 180 requests/min | 3 requests/second |

If you exceed the rate limit, the API responds with HTTP status code `429 Too many requests` and includes a `Retry-After` header specifying how many seconds to wait before retrying.

### Error: `429 Too many requests`

When you make too many requests in a short period of time, Browser Rendering will respond with HTTP status code `429 Too many requests`. You can view your account's rate limits in the [Workers Free](#workers-free) and [Workers Paid](#workers-paid) sections above.

The example below demonstrates how to handle rate limiting gracefully by reading the `Retry-After` value and retrying the request after that delay.

* REST API

  ```js
  const response = await fetch('https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountId>/browser-rendering/content', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': 'Bearer <your-token>',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ url: 'https://example.com' })
  });


  if (response.status === 429) {
  const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After');
  console.log(`Rate limited. Waiting ${retryAfter} seconds...`);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter \* 1000));


      // Retry the request
      const retryResponse = await fetch(/* same request as above */);


  }
  ```

* Workers Bindings

  ```js
  import puppeteer from "@cloudflare/puppeteer";


  try {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch(env.MYBROWSER);


    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto("https://example.com");
    const content = await page.content();


    await browser.close();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = error.headers.get("Retry-After");
      console.log(
        `Browser instance limit reached. Waiting ${retryAfter} seconds...`,
      );
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));


      // Retry launching browser
      const browser = await puppeteer.launch(env.MYBROWSER);
    }
  }
  ```

### Error: `429 Browser time limit exceeded for today`

This `Error processing the request: Unable to create new browser: code: 429: message: Browser time limit exceeded for today` error indicates you have hit the daily browser limit on the Workers Free plan. [Workers Free plan accounts are limited](#workers-free) to 10 minutes of Browser Rendering usage per day. If you exceed that limit, you will receive a `429` error until the next UTC day.

You can [increase your limits](#workers-paid) by upgrading to a Workers Paid plan on the **Workers plans** page of the Cloudflare dashboard:

[Go to **Workers plans**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/plans)

If you recently upgraded but still encounter the 10-minute per day limit, redeploy your Worker to ensure your usage is correctly associated with the new plan.

## Footnotes

1. Browsers close upon task completion or sixty seconds of inactivity (if you do not [extend your browser timeout](#can-i-increase-the-browser-timeout)). Therefore, in practice, many workflows do not require a high number of concurrent browsers. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-1-2)

2. By default, a browser will time out after 60 seconds of inactivity. You can extend this to up to 10 minutes using the [`keep_alive` option](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/#keep-alive). Call `browser.close()` to release the browser instance immediately. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-2-2)
