## Background

Secrets are a type of binding that allow you to attach encrypted text values to your Worker. Secrets are used for storing sensitive information like API keys and auth tokens.

You can access secrets in your Worker code through:

* The [`env` parameter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/#parameters) passed to your Worker's [`fetch` event handler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).
* Importing `env` from [`cloudflare:workers`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#importing-env-as-a-global) to access secrets from anywhere in your code.
* [`process.env`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables) in Workers that have [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) enabled.

## Access your secrets with Workers

Secrets can be accessed from Workers as you would any other [environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/). For instance, given a `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` secret, you can access it in your Worker code through the `env` parameter:

```js
import postgres from "postgres";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const sql = postgres(env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING);


    const result = await sql`SELECT * FROM products;`;


    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
  },
};
```

You can also import `env` from `cloudflare:workers` to access secrets from anywhere in your code, including outside of request handlers:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
  import postgres from "postgres";


  // Initialize the database client at the top level using a secret
  const sql = postgres(env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING);


  export default {
    async fetch(request) {
      const result = await sql`SELECT * FROM products;`;


      return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    },
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
  import postgres from "postgres";


  // Initialize the database client at the top level using a secret
  const sql = postgres(env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING);


  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
      const result = await sql`SELECT * FROM products;`;


      return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    },
  };
  ```

For more details on accessing `env` globally, refer to [Importing `env` as a global](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#importing-env-as-a-global).

Secrets Store (beta)

Secrets described on this page are defined and managed on a per-Worker level. If you want to use account-level secrets, refer to [Secrets Store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/). Account-level secrets are configured on your Worker as a [Secrets Store binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/integrations/workers/).

## Local Development with Secrets

Warning

Do not use `vars` to store sensitive information in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. Use secrets instead.

Put secrets for use in local development in either a `.dev.vars` file or a `.env` file, in the same directory as the Wrangler configuration file.

Choose to use either `.dev.vars` or `.env` but not both. If you define a `.dev.vars` file, then values in `.env` files will not be included in the `env` object during local development.

These files should be formatted using the [dotenv](https://hexdocs.pm/dotenvy/dotenv-file-format.html) syntax. For example:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="value"
API_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9"
```

Do not commit secrets to git

The `.dev.vars` and `.env` files should not committed to git. Add `.dev.vars*` and `.env*` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

To set different secrets for each Cloudflare environment, create files named `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` or `.env.<environment-name>`.

When you select a Cloudflare environment in your local development, the corresponding environment-specific file will be loaded ahead of the generic `.dev.vars` (or `.env`) file.

* When using `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` files, all secrets must be defined per environment. If `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` exists then only this will be loaded; the `.dev.vars` file will not be loaded.

* In contrast, all matching `.env` files are loaded and the values are merged. For each variable, the value from the most specific file is used, with the following precedence:

  * `.env.<environment-name>.local` (most specific)
  * `.env.local`
  * `.env.<environment-name>`
  * `.env` (least specific)

Controlling `.env` handling

It is possible to control how `.env` files are loaded in local development by setting environment variables on the process running the tools.

* To disable loading local dev vars from `.env` files without providing a `.dev.vars` file, set the `CLOUDFLARE_LOAD_DEV_VARS_FROM_DOT_ENV` environment variable to `"false"`.
* To include every environment variable defined in your system's process environment as a local development variable, ensure there is no `.dev.vars` and then set the `CLOUDFLARE_INCLUDE_PROCESS_ENV` environment variable to `"true"`.

## Secrets on deployed Workers

### Adding secrets to your project

#### Via Wrangler

Secrets can be added through [`wrangler secret put`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret) or [`wrangler versions secret put`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-secret-put) commands.

`wrangler secret put` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately.

```sh
npx wrangler secret put <KEY>
```

If using [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), instead use the `wrangler versions secret put` command. This will only create a new version of the Worker, that can then be deploying using [`wrangler versions deploy`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-deploy).

Note

Wrangler versions before 3.73.0 require you to specify a `--x-versions` flag.

```sh
npx wrangler versions secret put <KEY>
```

#### Via the dashboard

To add a secret via the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Settings**.

3. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Add**.

4. Select the type **Secret**, input a **Variable name**, and input its **Value**. This secret will be made available to your Worker but the value will be hidden in Wrangler and the dashboard.

5. (Optional) To add more secrets, select **Add variable**.

6. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.

### Delete secrets from your project

#### Via Wrangler

Secrets can be deleted through [`wrangler secret delete`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-delete) or [`wrangler versions secret delete`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-secret-delete) commands.

`wrangler secret delete` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately.

```sh
npx wrangler secret delete <KEY>
```

If using [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), instead use the `wrangler versions secret delete` command. This will only create a new version of the Worker, that can then be deploying using [`wrangler versions deploy`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-deploy).

```sh
npx wrangler versions secret delete <KEY>
```

#### Via the dashboard

To delete a secret from your Worker project via the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Settings**.

3. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Edit**.

4. In the **Edit** drawer, select **X** next to the secret you want to delete.

5. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.

6. (Optional) Instead of using the edit drawer, you can click the delete icon next to the secret.

## Compare secrets and environment variables

Use secrets for sensitive information

Do not use plaintext environment variables to store sensitive information. Use [secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) or [Secrets Store bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/integrations/workers/) instead.

[Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) are [environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/). The difference is secret values are not visible within Wrangler or Cloudflare dashboard after you define them. This means that sensitive data, including passwords or API tokens, should always be encrypted to prevent data leaks. To your Worker, there is no difference between an environment variable and a secret. The secret's value is passed through as defined.
