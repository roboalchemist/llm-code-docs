AI Search is Cloudflare's managed search service. Connect your data such as websites or an R2 bucket, and it automatically creates a continuously updating index that you can query with natural language in your applications or AI agents.

## Prerequisites

AI Search integrates with R2 for storing your data. You must have an active R2 subscription before creating your first AI Search instance.

[Go to **R2 Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview)

## Choose your setup method

[Dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/get-started/dashboard/)Create and configure AI Search using the Cloudflare dashboard.

[API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/get-started/api/)Create AI Search instances programmatically using the REST API.
