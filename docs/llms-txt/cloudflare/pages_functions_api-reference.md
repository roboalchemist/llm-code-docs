The following methods can be used to configure your Pages Function.

## Methods

### `onRequests`

The `onRequest` method will be called unless a more specific `onRequestVerb` method is exported. For example, if both `onRequest` and `onRequestGet` are exported, only `onRequestGet` will be called for `GET` requests.

* `onRequest(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all requests no matter what the request method is, as long as no specific request verb (like one of the methods below) is exported.

* `onRequestGet(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `GET` requests.

* `onRequestPost(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `POST` requests.

* `onRequestPatch(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `PATCH` requests.

* `onRequestPut(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `PUT` requests.

* `onRequestDelete(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `DELETE` requests.

* `onRequestHead(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `HEAD` requests.

* `onRequestOptions(contextEventContext)` Response | Promise\<Response>

  * This function will be invoked on all `OPTIONS` requests.

### `env.ASSETS.fetch()`

The `env.ASSETS.fetch()` function allows you to fetch a static asset from your Pages project.

You can pass a [Request object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/), URL string, or URL object to `env.ASSETS.fetch()` function. The URL must be to the pretty path, not directly to the asset. For example, if you had the path `/users/index.html`, you will request `/users/` instead of `/users/index.html`. This method call will run the header and redirect rules, modifying the response that is returned.

## Types

### `EventContext`

The following are the properties on the `context` object which are passed through on the `onRequest` methods:

* `request` [Request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/)

  This is the incoming [Request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/).

* `functionPath` string

  This is the path of the request.

* `waitUntil(promisePromise<any>)` void

  Refer to [`waitUntil` documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#waituntil) for more information.

* `passThroughOnException()` void

  Refer to [`passThroughOnException` documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#passthroughonexception) for more information. Note that this will not work on an [advanced mode project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/advanced-mode/).

* `next(input?Request | string, init?RequestInit)` Promise\<Response>

  Passes the request through to the next Function or to the asset server if no other Function is available.

* `env` [EnvWithFetch](#envwithfetch)

* `params` Params\<P>

  Holds the values from [dynamic routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/routing/#dynamic-routes).

  In the following example, you have a dynamic path that is `/users/[user].js`. When you visit the site on `/users/nevi` the `params` object would look like:

  ```js
  {
    user: "nevi";
  }
  ```

  This allows you fetch the dynamic value from the path:

  ```js
  export function onRequest(context) {
    return new Response(`Hello ${context.params.user}`);
  }
  ```

  Which would return `"Hello nevi"`.

* `data` Data

### `EnvWithFetch`

Holds the environment variables, secrets, and bindings for a Function. This also holds the `ASSETS` binding which is how you can fallback to the asset-serving behavior.
