Run headless Chrome on [Cloudflare's global network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) for browser automation, web scraping, testing, and content generation.

Available on Free and Paid plans

Browser Rendering enables developers to programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances running on Cloudflare’s global network.

## Use cases

Programmatically load and fully render dynamic webpages or raw HTML and capture specific outputs such as:

* [Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/markdown-endpoint/)
* [Screenshots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/screenshot-endpoint/)
* [PDFs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/pdf-endpoint/)
* [Snapshots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/snapshot/)
* [Links](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/links-endpoint/)
* [HTML elements](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/scrape-endpoint/)
* [Structured data](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/json-endpoint/)

## Key features

* **Scale to thousands of browsers**: Instant access to a global pool of browsers with low cold-start time, ideal for high-volume screenshot generation, data extraction, or automation at scale
* **Global by default**: Browser sessions run on Cloudflare's edge network, opening close to your users for better speed and availability worldwide
* **Easy to integrate**: [REST APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/) for common actions, while [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/) and [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/) provide familiar automation libraries for complex workflows
* **Session management**: [Reuse browser sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/reuse-sessions/) across requests to improve performance and reduce cold-start overhead
* **Flexible pricing**: Pay only for browser time used with generous free tier ([view pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/pricing/))

## Integration methods

* **[REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/)**: Simple HTTP endpoints for stateless tasks like screenshots, PDFs, and scraping.
* **[Workers Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/)**: Full browser automation within Workers using [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/), [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/), or [Stagehand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/stagehand/).

| Use case | Recommended | Why |
| - | - | - |
| Simple screenshot, PDF, or scrape | [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/) | No code deployment; single HTTP request |
| Browser automation | [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/) | Full control with built-in tracing and assertions |
| Porting existing scripts | [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/) or [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/) | Minimal code changes from standard libraries |
| AI-powered data extraction | [JSON endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/json-endpoint/) | Structured data via natural language prompts |
| AI agent browsing | [Playwright MCP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/playwright-mcp/) | LLMs control browsers via MCP |
| Resilient scraping | [Stagehand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/stagehand/) | AI finds elements by intent, not selectors |
