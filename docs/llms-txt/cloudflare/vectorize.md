Build full-stack AI applications with Vectorize, Cloudflare's powerful vector database.

Vectorize is a globally distributed vector database that enables you to build full-stack, AI-powered applications with [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). Vectorize makes querying embeddings — representations of values or objects like text, images, audio that are designed to be consumed by machine learning models and semantic search algorithms — faster, easier and more affordable.

Vectorize is now Generally Available

To report bugs or give feedback, go to the [#vectorize Discord channel](https://discord.cloudflare.com). If you are having issues with Wrangler, report issues in the [Wrangler GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose).

For example, by storing the embeddings (vectors) generated by a machine learning model, including those built-in to [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) or by bringing your own from platforms like [OpenAI](#), you can build applications with powerful search, similarity, recommendation, classification and/or anomaly detection capabilities based on your own data.

The vectors returned can reference images stored in Cloudflare R2, documents in KV, and/or user profiles stored in D1 — enabling you to go from vector search result to concrete object all within the Workers platform, and without standing up additional infrastructure.
