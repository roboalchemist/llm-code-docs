This page documents error codes returned by R2 when using the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/) or the [S3-compatible API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/), along with recommended fixes to help with troubleshooting.

## How errors are returned

For the **Workers API**, R2 operations throw exceptions that you can catch. The error code is included at the end of the `message` property:

```js
try {
  await env.MY_BUCKET.put("my-key", data, { customMetadata: largeMetadata });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
  // "put: Your metadata headers exceed the maximum allowed metadata size. (10012)"
}
```

For the **S3-compatible API**, errors are returned as XML in the response body:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error>
  <Code>NoSuchKey</Code>
  <Message>The specified key does not exist.</Message>
</Error>
```

## Error code reference

### Authentication and authorization errors

| Error Code | S3 Code | HTTP Status | Details | Recommended Fix |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 10002 | Unauthorized | 401 | Missing or invalid authentication credentials. | Verify your [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/) or access key credentials are correct and have not expired. |
| 10003 | AccessDenied | 403 | Insufficient permissions for the requested operation. | Check that your [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/) has the required permissions for the bucket and operation. |
| 10018 | ExpiredRequest | 400 | Presigned URL or request signature has expired. | Regenerate the [presigned URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/presigned-urls/) or signature. |
| 10035 | SignatureDoesNotMatch | 403 | Request signature does not match calculated signature. | Verify your secret key and signing algorithm. Check for URL encoding issues. |
| 10042 | NotEntitled | 403 | Account not entitled to this feature. | Ensure your account has an [R2 subscription](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/). |

### Bucket errors

| Error Code | S3 Code | HTTP Status | Details | Recommended Fix |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 10005 | InvalidBucketName | 400 | Bucket name does not meet naming requirements. | Bucket names must be 3-63 chars, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens, start/end with alphanumeric. |
| 10006 | NoSuchBucket | 404 | The specified bucket does not exist. | Verify the bucket name is correct and the bucket exists in your account. |
| 10008 | BucketNotEmpty | 409 | Cannot delete bucket that contains objects. | Delete all objects in the bucket before deleting the bucket. |
| 10009 | TooManyBuckets | 400 | Account bucket limit exceeded (default: 1,000,000 buckets). | Request a limit increase via the [Limits Increase Request Form](https://forms.gle/ukpeZVLWLnKeixDu7). |
| 10073 | BucketConflict | 409 | Bucket name already exists. | Choose a different bucket name. Bucket names must be unique within your account. |

### Object errors

| Error Code | S3 Code | HTTP Status | Details | Recommended Fix |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 10007 | NoSuchKey | 404 | The specified object key does not exist. For the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/), `get()` and `head()` return `null` instead of throwing. | Verify the object key is correct and the object has not been deleted. |
| 10020 | InvalidObjectName | 400 | Object key contains invalid characters or is too long. | Use valid UTF-8 characters. Maximum key length is 1024 bytes. |
| 100100 | EntityTooLarge | 400 | Object exceeds maximum size (5 GiB for single upload, 5 TiB for multipart). | Use [multipart upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/objects/upload-objects/#multipart-upload) for objects larger than 5 GiB. Maximum object size is 5 TiB. |
| 10012 | MetadataTooLarge | 400 | Custom metadata exceeds the 8,192 byte limit. | Reduce custom metadata size. Maximum is 8,192 bytes total for all custom metadata. |
| 10069 | ObjectLockedByBucketPolicy | 403 | Object is protected by a bucket lock rule and cannot be modified or deleted. | Wait for the retention period to expire. Refer to [bucket locks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/bucket-locks/). |

### Upload and request errors

| Error Code | S3 Code | HTTP Status | Details | Recommended Fix |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 10033 | MissingContentLength | 411 | `Content-Length` header required but missing. | Include the `Content-Length` header in PUT/POST requests. |
| 10013 | IncompleteBody | 400 | Request body terminated before expected `Content-Length`. | Ensure the full request body is sent. Check for network interruptions or client timeouts. |
| 10014 | InvalidDigest | 400 | Checksum header format is malformed. | Ensure checksums are properly encoded (base64 for SHA/CRC checksums). |
| 10037 | BadDigest | 400 | Provided checksum does not match the uploaded content. | Verify data integrity and retry the upload. |
| 10039 | InvalidRange | 416 | Requested byte range is not satisfiable. | Ensure the range start is less than object size. Check `Range` header format. |
| 10031 | PreconditionFailed | 412 | Conditional headers (`If-Match`, `If-Unmodified-Since`, etc.) were not satisfied. | Object's ETag or modification time does not match your condition. Refetch and retry. Refer to [conditional operations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/extensions/#conditional-operations-in-putobject). |

### Multipart upload errors

| Error Code | S3 Code | HTTP Status | Details | Recommended Fix |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 10011 | EntityTooSmall | 400 | Multipart part is below minimum size (5 MiB), except for the last part. | Ensure each part (except the last) is at least 5 MiB. |
| 10024 | NoSuchUpload | 404 | Multipart upload does not exist or was aborted. | Verify the `uploadId` is correct. By default, incomplete multipart uploads expire after 7 days. Refer to [object lifecycles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/object-lifecycles/). |
| 10025 | InvalidPart | 400 | One or more parts could not be found when completing the upload. | Verify each part was uploaded successfully and use the exact ETag returned from `UploadPart`. |
| 10048 | InvalidPart | 400 | All non-trailing parts must have the same size. | Ensure all parts except the last have identical sizes. R2 requires uniform part sizes for multipart uploads. |

### Service errors

| Error Code | S3 Code | HTTP Status | Details | Recommended Fix |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 10001 | InternalError | 500 | An internal error occurred. | Retry the request. If persistent, check [Cloudflare Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com) or contact support. |
| 10043 | ServiceUnavailable | 503 | Service is temporarily unavailable. | Retry with exponential backoff. Check [Cloudflare Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com). |
| 10054 | ClientDisconnect | 400 | Client disconnected before request completed. | Check network connectivity and retry. |
| 10058 | TooManyRequests | 429 | Rate limit exceeded. Often caused by multiple concurrent requests to the same object key (limit: 1 write/second per key). | Check if multiple clients are accessing the same object key. See [R2 limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/platform/limits/). |
