Create new serverless SQL databases to query from your Workers and Pages projects.

Available on Free and Paid plans

D1 is Cloudflare's managed, serverless database with SQLite's SQL semantics, built-in disaster recovery, and Worker and HTTP API access.

D1 is designed for horizontal scale out across multiple, smaller (10 GB) databases, such as per-user, per-tenant or per-entity databases. D1 allows you to build applications with thousands of databases at no extra cost for isolating with multiple databases. D1 pricing is based only on query and storage costs.

Create your first D1 database by [following the Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/), learn how to [import data into a database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/import-export-data/), and how to [interact with your database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/) directly from [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#d1-databases).
