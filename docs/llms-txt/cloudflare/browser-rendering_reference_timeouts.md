Browser Rendering uses several independent timers to manage how long different parts of a request can take. If any of these timers exceed their limit, the request returns a timeout error.

Each timer controls a specific part of the rendering lifecycle — from page load, to selector load, to action.

| Timer | Scope | Default | Max |
| - | - | - | - |
| `goToOptions.timeout` | Time to wait for the page to load before timeout. | 30 s | 60 s |
| `goToOptions.waitUntil` | Determines when page load is considered complete. Refer to [`waitUntil` options](#waituntil-options) for details. | `domcontentloaded` | — |
| `waitForSelector` | Time to wait for a specific element (any CSS selector) to appear on the page. | null | 60 s |
| `waitForTimeout` | Additional amount of time to wait after the page has loaded to proceed with actions. | null | 60 s |
| `actionTimeout` | Time to wait for the action itself (for example: a screenshot, PDF, or scrape) to complete after the page has loaded. | null | 5 min |
| `PDFOptions.timeout` | Same as `actionTimeout`, but only applies to the [/pdf endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/pdf-endpoint/). | 30 s | 5 min |

### `waitUntil` options

The `goToOptions.waitUntil` parameter controls when the browser considers page navigation complete. This is important for JavaScript-heavy pages where content is rendered dynamically after the initial page load.

| Value | Behavior |
| - | - |
| `load` | Waits for the `load` event, including all resources like images and stylesheets |
| `domcontentloaded` | Waits until the DOM content has been fully loaded, which fires before the `load` event (default) |
| `networkidle0` | Waits until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms |
| `networkidle2` | Waits until there are no more than two network connections for at least 500 ms |

For pages that rely on JavaScript to render content, use `networkidle0` or `networkidle2` to ensure the page is fully rendered before extraction.

## Notes and recommendations

You can set multiple timers — as long as one is complete, the request will fire.

If you are not getting the expected output:

* Try increasing `goToOptions.timeout` (up to 60 s).
* If waiting for a specific element, use `waitForSelector`. Otherwise, use `goToOptions.waitUntil` set to `networkidle2` to ensure the page has finished loading dynamic content.
* If you are getting a `422`, it may be the action itself (ex: taking a screenshot, extracting the html content) that takes a long time. Try increasing the `actionTimeout` instead.
