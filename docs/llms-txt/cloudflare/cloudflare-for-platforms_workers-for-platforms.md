Build a multi-tenant platform that runs untrusted code in secure, isolated sandboxes.

Workers for Platforms lets you run untrusted code written by your customers, or by AI, in a secure hosted sandbox. Each customer runs code in their own Worker, a secure and isolated environment.

## When to use Workers for Platforms

Use Workers for Platforms when you need to:

* **Run untrusted code at scale** - Execute code written by your customers or generated by AI in a secure sandbox, with the ability to deploy an unlimited number of applications.
* **Build multi-tenant platforms** - Give each customer their own isolated compute environment with complete separation between tenants.
* **Extend Cloudflare's developer platform to your customers** - Use [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/bindings/) to give each customer access to KV stores, D1 databases, R2 storage, and more. Your customers get the same powerful tools, managed through your platform.
* **Give each application its own domain** - Host applications under a subdomain of your domain (for example, `customer-name.myplatform.com`) or integrate with [custom hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/) to allow customers to use their own domains.

## Features

Workers for Platforms provides tools to manage and control your customers' code:

* **[Custom limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/custom-limits/)** - Set per-customer limits on CPU time and subrequests.
* **[Observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/observability/)** - Collect logs and metrics across all user Workers in your namespace. Export to third-party platforms like Datadog, Splunk, and Grafana.
* **[Tags](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/tags/)** - Organize, search, and filter user Workers by custom tags like customer ID, plan type, or environment.
