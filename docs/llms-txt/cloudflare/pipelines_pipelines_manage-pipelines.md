Learn how to:

* Create pipelines with SQL transformations
* View pipeline configuration and SQL
* Delete pipelines when no longer needed

## Create a pipeline

Pipelines execute SQL statements that define how data flows from streams to sinks.

### Dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Pipelines** page.

   [Go to **Pipelines**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pipelines/overview)

2. Select **Create Pipeline** to launch the pipeline creation wizard.

3. Follow the wizard to configure your stream, sink, and SQL transformation.

### Wrangler CLI

To create a pipeline, run the [`pipelines create`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-create) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines create my-pipeline \
  --sql "INSERT INTO my_sink SELECT * FROM my_stream"
```

You can also provide SQL from a file:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines create my-pipeline \
  --sql-file pipeline.sql
```

Alternatively, to use the interactive setup wizard that helps you configure a stream, sink, and pipeline, run the [`pipelines setup`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-setup) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines setup
```

### SQL transformations

Pipelines support SQL statements for data transformation. For complete syntax, supported functions, and data types, see the [SQL reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/sql-reference/).

Common patterns include:

#### Basic data flow

Transfer all data from stream to sink:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_sink SELECT * FROM my_stream
```

#### Filtering events

Filter events based on conditions:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_sink
SELECT * FROM my_stream
WHERE event_type = 'purchase' AND amount > 100
```

#### Selecting specific fields

Choose only the fields you need:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_sink
SELECT user_id, event_type, timestamp, amount
FROM my_stream
```

#### Transforming data

Apply transformations to fields:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_sink
SELECT
  user_id,
  UPPER(event_type) as event_type,
  timestamp,
  amount * 1.1 as amount_with_tax
FROM my_stream
```

## View pipeline configuration

### Dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Pipelines** page.

2. Select a pipeline to view its SQL transformation, connected streams/sinks, and associated metrics.

### Wrangler CLI

To view a specific pipeline, run the [`pipelines get`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-get) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines get <PIPELINE_ID>
```

To list all pipelines in your account, run the [`pipelines list`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-list) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines list
```

## Delete a pipeline

Deleting a pipeline stops data flow from the connected stream to sink.

### Dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Pipelines** page.

2. Select the pipeline you want to delete. 3. In the **Settings** tab, and select **Delete**.

### Wrangler CLI

To delete a pipeline, run the [`pipelines delete`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-delete) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines delete <PIPELINE_ID>
```

Warning

Deleting a pipeline immediately stops data flow between the stream and sink.

## Limitations

Pipeline SQL cannot be modified after creation. To change the SQL transformation, you must delete and recreate the pipeline.
