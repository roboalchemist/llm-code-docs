How can I generate the Cloudflare API Token?

To use RealtimeKit APIs, you must have a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

Follow the [Create API token guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) to create a new token via the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). When configuring permissions, ensure that **Realtime** / **Realtime Admin** permissions are selected. Configure any additional [access policies and restrictions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) as needed for your use case.

### Meetings

Can I schedule meetings in advance with RealtimeKit?

While RealtimeKit does not include a built-in scheduling system, you can implement the scheduling experience on top of it in your application. RealtimeKit meetings do not have start or end time, so your backend must store the schedule and enforce when users are allowed to join. A common approach is:

* When a user schedules a meeting, your backend creates a meeting in RealtimeKit and stores the meeting `id` together with the start and end times.
* When a user tries to join the meeting in your application, your backend checks whether the current time is within the allowed window.
* If the checks pass, your backend [adds the participant](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/add_participant/) to the meeting, returns the participant auth token to the frontend and the frontend passes that token to the RealtimeKit SDK so the user can join.

How do I prevent participants from joining a meeting after a specific date or time?

You can disable the meeting at the required time by setting its status to `INACTIVE` using a `PATCH` request to the [Update Meeting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/update_meeting_by_id/) endpoint.

This prevents participants from joining the meeting and prevents any new Sessions from starting.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/realtime/kit/{APP_ID}/meetings/{MEETING_ID} \
--request PATCH \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{ "status": "INACTIVE" }'
```

### Participants

How do I generate an auth token for a participant?

Your backend generates an authentication token by adding the user as a participant to a meeting with the [Add Participant](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/add_participant/) API endpoint. The API response includes a `token` field, which is the authentication token for that participant in that meeting. If you need a new token for an existing participant after the previous token has expired, use the [Refresh Participant Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/refresh_participant_token/) endpoint. For more details, see [Participant tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/participant/#participant-tokens).

Can the same user join from multiple devices or browser tabs?

Yes. A single participant can be represented by multiple peers if the user joins the same meeting from different devices or tabs. Each connection becomes a separate peer, but they all map back to the same participant.

How can I prevent a user from joining a meeting again?

Delete that user's participant for the meeting using the [Delete Participant](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/delete_meeting_participant/) API endpoint. Once the participant is deleted and you stop issuing new tokens for them, they will no longer be able to join that meeting.

Can the same participant join multiple sessions of a meeting?

Yes. As long as the participant exists for that meeting and has a valid authentication token, that participant can join multiple live sessions of the same meeting over time.

Do I need to create a new participant for every session?

In most cases, no. You typically create a participant once for a given user and meeting, and then reuse that participant across sessions of that meeting. You may need to refresh the participant’s authentication token over time, but you do not need to recreate the participant.

What should I use for custom\_participant\_id?

Use a stable internal identifier from your own system, such as a numeric user id or UUID. Do not use personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information.

### Presets

Do I need a new preset for every meeting or participant?

Presets are **re-usable** set of rules and configurations that are defined at the App level. You can use the same preset for multiple participants.

Read more about presets [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/preset/).

### Client Side SDKs

How do I decide which SDK to select?

RealtimeKit support all the popular frameworks for web and mobile platforms.

We **recommend using our UI Kits** For most use cases.

Please Note: When you use our UI Kit, you also get the core SDK with it, which can be used to build additional features based on your needs.

For more information please refer to our [SDK Selection Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/sdk-selection/)

### Camera

How can I set an end user's camera quality to 1080p?

When initializing RealtimeKit, you can set the media configurations for camera quality.

Refer to the media configurations [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/#advanced-options) for more details.

Higher camera quality increases bandwidth usage and may impact meeting performance on lower-end devices if the end user's device is not powerful enough to handle 1080p from multiple peers.

How can I set a custom frame rate for an end user's camera feed?

When initializing RealtimeKit, you can set the media configurations for camera.

Refer to the media configurations [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/#advanced-options) for more details.

Higher video frame rates increase bandwidth usage and may impact the video feed quality of other peers in the meeting if there are bandwidth issues with the end user's device. Set the video frame rate to a lower value (for example, <= 30) in group calls. The current default is 24/30 FPS based on the simulcast layer.

### Microphone

Why is my microphone not auto-selected when plugged in?

RealtimeKit SDK attempts to provide the best experience by auto-selecting the microphone. It prefers Bluetooth devices over wired devices. However, if the device was already plugged in before joining a RealtimeKit meeting and the device does not have `bluetooth`, `headset`, or `earphone` in its label, it may be missed.

We support auto-selection of microphones with the label `bluetooth`, `headset`, `earphone`, or `microphone`, and USB devices with labels such as `usb` and `wired`. Some commonly used devices such as AirPods or Airdopes are also supported. We do not auto-select virtual devices.

If auto-selection fails, end users can manually select the microphone from the Settings button in the meeting and the SDK will remember the selection for future sessions. If you have a device that you believe is commonly used, please contact support to request first-hand auto-selection support for it.

### Screen Share

How can I set a custom frame rate for screen share?

When initializing RealtimeKit, you can set the media configurations for screen share.

Refer to the media configurations [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/#advanced-options) for more details.

Higher screen share frame rates increase bandwidth usage and may impact the video feed quality of other peers in the meeting if there are bandwidth issues with the end user's device. Set the screen share frame rate to a lower value (for example, <= 30) in group calls. In most use cases, 5 FPS (default) is sufficient for screen share.

### Chat

I cannot send a chat message

There could be multiple reasons for this.

First, try a sample meeting on the [demo app](https://demo.realtime.cloudflare.com/). If you cannot send a message in the demo app, contact support. If you can send a message in the demo app, the issue is on the integration side.

To troubleshoot integration issues, first check if the user has joined the meeting successfully. If the user has [joined](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/meeting-object-explained/) the meeting successfully, check if the user's [preset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/preset/) has permissions to send messages. If you are using a custom UI, check if the core [Chat APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/chat/) are working to eliminate the Core SDK from the usual suspects.

If this does not solve the issue, check if your framework is blocking the UI. Frameworks like Material UI can block input focus using focus traps in Drawer component. There is usually a prop to disable the focus trap. Material UI has a `disableEnforceFocus` prop for this purpose.

If you are still unable to send a message, please contact support.
