Start building agents that can remember context and make decisions. This guide walks you through creating your first agent and understanding how they work.

* **State management**: How agents remember information across interactions.
* **Decision making**: How agents analyze requests and choose actions.
* **Tool integration**: How agents access external APIs and data sources.
* **Conversation flow**: How agents maintain context and personality.
