Hyperdrive can be used when developing and testing your Workers locally. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the command-line interface for Workers, provides two options for local development:

* **`wrangler dev`** (default): Runs your Worker code locally on your machine. You configure a `localConnectionString` to connect directly to a database (either local or remote). Hyperdrive query caching does not take effect in this mode.
* **`wrangler dev --remote`**: Runs your Worker on Cloudflare's using your deployed Hyperdrive configuration. This is useful for testing with Hyperdrive's connection pooling and query caching enabled.

## Use `wrangler dev`

By default, `wrangler dev` runs your Worker code locally on your machine. To connect to a database during local development, configure a `localConnectionString` that points directly to your database.

The `localConnectionString` works with both local and remote databases:

* **Local databases**: Connect to a database instance running on your machine (for example, `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database`)
* **Remote databases**: Connect directly to remote databases over TLS (for example, `postgres://user:password@remote-host.example.com:5432/database?sslmode=require` or `mysql://user:password@remote-host.example.com:3306/database?sslMode=required`). You must specify the SSL/TLS mode if required.

Note

When using `localConnectionString`, Hyperdrive's connection pooling and query caching do not take effect. Your Worker connects directly to the database without going through Hyperdrive.

### Configure with environment variable

The recommended approach is to use an environment variable to avoid committing credentials to source control:

```sh
# Your configured Hyperdrive binding is "HYPERDRIVE"
export CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE="postgres://user:password@your-database-host:5432/database"
npx wrangler dev
```

The environment variable format is `CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>`, where `<BINDING_NAME>` is the name of the binding assigned to your Hyperdrive in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

To unset an environment variable: `unset CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>`

For example, to set the connection string for a local database:

```sh
export CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
npx wrangler dev
```

### Configure in Wrangler configuration file

Alternatively, you can set `localConnectionString` in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "c020574a-5623-407b-be0c-cd192bab9545",
        "localConnectionString": "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "c020574a-5623-407b-be0c-cd192bab9545"
  localConnectionString = "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/databasename"
  ```

If both an environment variable and `localConnectionString` in the Wrangler configuration file are set, the environment variable takes precedence.

## Use `wrangler dev --remote`

When you run `wrangler dev --remote`, your Worker runs in Cloudflare's network and uses your deployed Hyperdrive configuration. This means:

* Your Worker code executes in Cloudflare's production environment, not locally
* Hyperdrive's connection pooling and query caching are active
* You connect to the database configured in your Hyperdrive configuration (created with `wrangler hyperdrive create`)
* Changes made during the session interact with remote resources

This mode is useful for testing how your Worker behaves with Hyperdrive's features enabled before deploying.

Configure your Hyperdrive binding in `wrangler.jsonc`:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "your-hyperdrive-id",
      },
    ],
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "your-hyperdrive-id"
  ```

To start a remote development session:

```sh
npx wrangler dev --remote
```

Note

The `localConnectionString` field is not used with `wrangler dev --remote`. Instead, your Worker connects to the database configured in your deployed Hyperdrive configuration.

Warning

Use `wrangler dev --remote` with caution. Since your Worker runs in Cloudflare's production environment, any database writes or side effects will affect your production data.
