Pipelines connect [streams](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/streams/) and [sinks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/sinks/) via SQL transformations, which can modify events before writing them to storage. This enables you to shift left, pushing validation, schematization, and processing to your ingestion layer to make your queries easy, fast, and correct.

Pipelines enable you to filter, transform, enrich, and restructure events in real-time as data flows from streams to sinks.
