Workers Logs lets you automatically collect, store, filter, and analyze logging data emitted from Cloudflare Workers. Data is written to your Cloudflare Account, and you can query it in the dashboard for each of your Workers. All newly created Workers will come with the observability setting enabled by default.

Logs include [invocation logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#invocation-logs), [custom logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#custom-logs), errors, and uncaught exceptions.

To send logs to a third party, use [Workers Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/logpush/) or [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/).

## Enable Workers Logs

Wrangler version

Minimum required Wrangler version: 3.78.6. Check your version by running `wrangler --version`. To update Wrangler, refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

You must add the observability setting for your Worker to write logs to Workers Logs. Add the following setting to your Worker's Wrangler file and redeploy your Worker.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "observability": {
      "enabled": true,
      "head_sampling_rate": 1 // optional. default = 1.
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [observability]
  enabled = true
  head_sampling_rate = 1
  ```

[Head-based sampling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#head-based-sampling) allows you set the percentage of Workers requests that are logged.

### Enabling with environments

[Environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/) allow you to deploy the same Worker application with different configurations. For example, you may want to configure a different `head_sampling_rate` to staging and production. To configure observability for an environment named `staging`: 1. Add the following configuration below `[env.staging]`

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "env": {
      "staging": {
        "observability": {
          "enabled": true,
          "head_sampling_rate": 1 // optional
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [env.staging.observability]
  enabled = true
  head_sampling_rate = 1
  ```

1. Deploy your Worker with `npx wrangler deploy -e staging`
2. Repeat step 1 and 2 for each environment.

## View logs from the dashboard

Access logs for your Worker from the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. In **Overview**, select your **Worker**.

3. Select **Observability**.

## Best Practices

### Logging structured JSON objects

To get the most out of Workers Logs, it is recommended you log in JSON format. Workers Logs automatically extracts the fields and indexes them intelligently in the database. The benefit of this structured logging technique is in how it allows you to easily segment data across any dimension for fields with unlimited cardinality. Consider the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Logging Code | Event Log (Partial) |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | `console.log("user_id: " + 123)` | `{message: "user_id: 123"}` |
| 2 | `console.log({user_id: 123})` | `{user_id: 123}` |
| 3 | `console.log({user_id: 123, user_email: "a@example.com"})` | `{user_id: 123, user_email: "a@example.com"}` |

The difference between these examples is in how you index your logs to enable faster queries. In scenario 1, the `user_id` is embedded within a message. To find all logs relating to a particular user\_id, you would have to run a text match. In scenarios 2 and 3, your logs can be filtered against the keys `user_id` and `user_email`.

## Features

### Invocation Logs

Each Workers invocation returns a single invocation log that contains details such as the Request, Response, and related metadata. These invocation logs can be identified by the field `$cloudflare.$metadata.type = "cf-worker-event"`. Each invocation log is enriched with information available to Cloudflare in the context of the invocation.

In the Workers Logs UI, logs are presented with a localized timestamp and a message. The message is dependent on the invocation handler. For example, Fetch requests will have a message describing the request method and the request URL, while cron events will be listed as cron. Below is a list of invocation handlers along with their invocation message.

Invocation logs can be disabled in wrangler by adding the `invocation_logs = false` configuration.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "observability": {
      "logs": {
        "invocation_logs": false
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [observability.logs]
  invocation_logs = false
  ```

| Invocation Handler | Invocation Message |
| - | - |
| [Alarm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/) | \<Scheduled Time> |
| [Email](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/runtime-api/) | \<Email Recipient> |
| [Fetch](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/) | \<Method> \<URL> |
| [Queue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#consumer) | \<Queue Name> |
| [Cron](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/scheduled/) | \<UNIX-cron schedule> |
| [Tail](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/tail/) | tail |
| [RPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/) | \<RPC method> |
| [WebSocket](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/websockets/) | \<WebSocket Event Type> |

### Custom logs

By default a Worker will emit [invocation logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#invocation-logs) containing details about the request, response and related metadata.

You can also add custom logs throughout your code. Any `console.log` statements within your Worker will be visible in Workers Logs. The following example demonstrates a custom `console.log` within a Worker request handler.

* Module Worker

  ```js
  export default {
    async fetch(request) {
      const { cf } = request;
      const { city, country } = cf;


      console.log(`Request came from city: ${city} in country: ${country}`);


      return new Response("Hello worker!", {
        headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" },
      });
    },
  };
  ```

* Service Worker

  Service Workers are deprecated

  Service Workers are deprecated, but still supported. We recommend using [Module Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) instead. New features may not be supported for Service Workers.

  ```js
  addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
  });


  /**
   * Respond with hello worker text
   * @param {Request} request
   */
  async function handleRequest(request) {
    const { cf } = request;
    const { city, country } = cf;


    console.log(`Request came from city: ${city} in country: ${country}`);


    return new Response("Hello worker!", {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" },
    });
  }
  ```

After you deploy the code above, view your Worker's logs in [the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#view-logs-from-the-dashboard) or with [real-time logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs/).

### Head-based sampling

Head-based sampling allows you to log a percentage of incoming requests to your Cloudflare Worker. Especially for high-traffic applications, this helps reduce log volume and manage costs, while still providing meaningful insights into your application's performance. When you configure a head-based sampling rate, you can control the percentage of requests that get logged. All logs within the context of the request are collected.

To enable head-based sampling, set `head_sampling_rate` within the observability configuration. The valid range is from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates zero out of one hundred requests are logged, and 1 indicates every request is logged. If `head_sampling_rate` is unspecified, it is configured to a default value of 1 (100%). In the example below, `head_sampling_rate` is set to 0.01, which means one out of every one hundred requests is logged.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "observability": {
      "enabled": true,
      "head_sampling_rate": 0.01 // 1% sampling rate
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [observability]
  enabled = true
  head_sampling_rate = 0.01
  ```

## Limits

| Description | Limit |
