Cloudflare Access provides visibility and control over who has access to your [custom hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/). You can allow or block users based on identity, device posture, and other [Access rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/).

## Prerequisites

* You must have an active custom hostname. For setup instructions, refer to [Configuring Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/).
* You must have a Cloudflare Zero Trust plan in your SaaS provider account. Learn more about [getting started with Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/setup/).
* You can only run Access on custom hostnames if they are managed externally to Cloudflare or in a separate Cloudflare account. If the custom hostname zone is in the same account as the SaaS zone, the Access application will not be applied.

## Setup

1. At your SaaS provider account, select [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Access** > **Applications**.
3. Select **Add an application** and, for type of application, select **Self-hosted**.
4. Enter a name for your Access application and, in **Session Duration**, choose how often the user's [application token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/application-token/) should expire.
5. Select **Add public hostname**.
6. For **Input method**, select *Custom*.
7. In **Hostname**, enter your custom hostname (for example, `mycustomhostname.com`).
8. Follow the remaining [self-hosted application creation steps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/) to publish the application.
