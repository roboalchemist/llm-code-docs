## Supported SQL Clauses

R2 SQL supports: `DESCRIBE`, `SHOW`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`. New features will be released in the future, keep an eye on this page for the latest.

***

## SELECT Clause

### Supported Features

* **Individual columns**: `SELECT column1, column2`
* **All columns**: `SELECT *`

### Limitations

* **No JSON field querying**: Cannot query individual fields from JSON objects
* **Limited aggregation functions**: See Aggregation Functions section below for details
* **No synthetic data**: Cannot create synthetic columns like `SELECT 1 AS what, "hello" AS greeting`
* **No field aliasing**: `SELECT field AS another_name` (applies to both regular columns and aggregations)

### Examples

```sql
-- Valid
SELECT timestamp, user_id, status FROM my_table;
SELECT * FROM my_table;


-- Invalid
SELECT user_id AS uid, timestamp AS ts FROM my_table;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events FROM FROM my_table;
SELECT json_field.property FROM my_table;
SELECT 1 AS synthetic_column FROM my_table;
```

***

## Aggregation Functions

### Supported Features

* **COUNT(\*)**: Count total rows **note**: only `*` is supported
* **SUM(column)**: Sum numeric values
* **AVG(column)**: Calculate average of numeric values
* **MIN(column)**: Find minimum value
* **MAX(column)**: Find maximum value
* **With GROUP BY**: All aggregations work with `GROUP BY`

### Limitations

* **No aliases**: `AS` keyword not supported (`SELECT COUNT(*) AS total` fails)
* **COUNT(\*) only**: `COUNT(column_name)` or `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` is not supported

### Examples

```sql
-- Valid
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY department;
SELECT region, AVG(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY region;
SELECT category, MIN(price), MAX(price) FROM products GROUP BY category;
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM sales GROUP BY department ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;


-- Invalid
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM sales GROUP BY department; -- No aliases
SELECT COUNT(department) FROM sales; -- Must use COUNT(*)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT region) FROM sales; -- No DISTINCT support
```

***

## GROUP BY Clause

### Supported Features

* **Single column grouping**: `GROUP BY column`
* **Multiple column grouping**: `GROUP BY column1, column2`
* **With WHERE**: Filter before grouping
* **With LIMIT**: Limit grouped results

### Limitations

* **No expressions**: Cannot use expressions in GROUP BY (e.g., `GROUP BY YEAR(date)`)

### Examples

```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY region;
SELECT dept, category, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY dept, category;
SELECT region, COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE status = 'completed' GROUP BY region;
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY dept ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT is_active, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY is_active;
SELECT dept, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY dept ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;
```

***

## HAVING Clause

### Supported Features

* **With COUNT(\*)**: Filter groups by count
* **Comparison operators**: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`, `BETWEEN`, `AND`, `IS NOT NULL`
* **With GROUP BY**: Must be used with GROUP BY

### Examples

```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY region HAVING COUNT(*) > 1000;
SELECT dept, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY dept HAVING SUM(amount) > 100000; -- HAVING with SUM
SELECT region, COUNT(*) FROM sales GROUP BY region HAVING COUNT(*) > 100 AND COUNT(*) < 1000;
```

***

## FROM Clause

### Supported Features

* **Single table queries**: `SELECT * FROM table_name`

### Limitations

* **No multiple tables**: Cannot specify multiple tables in FROM clause
* **No subqueries**: `SELECT ... FROM (SELECT ...)` is not supported
* **No JOINs**: No INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL JOINs
* **No SQL functions**: Cannot use functions like `read_parquet()`
* **No synthetic tables**: Cannot create tables from values
* **No schema evolution**: Schema cannot be altered (no ALTER TABLE, migrations)
* **Immutable datasets**: No UPDATE or DELETE operations allowed
* **Fully defined schema**: Dynamic or union-type fields are not supported
* **No table aliasing**: `SELECT * FROM table_name AS alias`

### Examples

```sql
--Valid
SELECT * FROM http_requests;


--Invalid
SELECT * FROM table1, table2;
SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM events WHERE status = 200);
```

***

## WHERE Clause

### Supported Features

* **Simple type filtering**: Supports `string`, `boolean`, `number` types, and timestamps expressed as RFC3339
* **Boolean logic**: Supports `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operators
* **Comparison operators**: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`
* **Grouped conditions**: `WHERE col_a="hello" AND (col_b>5 OR col_c != 3)`
* **Pattern matching:** `WHERE col_a LIKE ‘hello w%’` (prefix matching only)
* **NULL Handling :** `WHERE col_a IS NOT NULL` (`IS`/`IS NOT`)

### Limitations

* **No column-to-column comparisons**: Cannot use `WHERE col_a = col_b`
* **No array filtering**: Cannot filter on array types (array\[number], array\[string], array\[boolean])
* **No JSON/object filtering**: Cannot filter on fields inside nested objects or JSON
* **No SQL functions**: No function calls in WHERE clause
* **No arithmetic operators**: Cannot use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` in conditions

### Examples

```sql
--Valid
SELECT * FROM events WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-02';
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE status = 200 AND user_type = 'premium';
SELECT * FROM requests WHERE (method = 'GET' OR method = 'POST') AND response_time < 1000;


--Invalid
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE tags[0] = 'error'; -- Array filtering
SELECT * FROM requests WHERE metadata.user_id = '123'; -- JSON field filtering
SELECT * FROM events WHERE col_a = col_b; -- Column comparison
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE response_time + latency > 5000; -- Arithmetic
```

***

## ORDER BY Clause

### Supported Features

* **ASC**: Ascending order
* **DESC**: Descending order (Default, on full partition key)
* **With partition key**: Order by partition key columns
* **With GROUP BY**: Can order by all aggregation columns

### Limitations

* **Non-partition keys not supported**: `ORDER BY` on columns other than the partition key is not supported (except with aggregations)

### Examples

```sql
-- Valid
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE ... ORDER BY partitionKey;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE ... ORDER BY partitionKey DESC;
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY dept ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;


-- Invalid
SELECT * FROM table_name GROUP BY dept ORDER BY nonPartitionKey DESC --ORDER BY a non-grouped column
```

***

## LIMIT Clause

### Supported Features

* **Simple limits**: `LIMIT number`
* **Range**: Minimum 1, maximum 10,000

### Limitations

* **No pagination**: `LIMIT offset, count` syntax not supported
* **No SQL functions**: Cannot use functions to determine limit
* **No arithmetic**: Cannot use expressions like `LIMIT 10 * 50`

### Examples

```sql
-- Valid
SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 100
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE ... LIMIT 10000


-- Invalid
SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 100, 50; -- Pagination
SELECT * FROM logs LIMIT COUNT(*); / 2 -- Functions
SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 10 * 10; -- Arithmetic
```

***

## Unsupported SQL Clauses

The following SQL clauses are **not supported**:

* `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`
* `WITH` (Common Table Expressions)
* `WINDOW` functions
* `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`
* `CREATE`/`ALTER`/`DROP`

***

## Best Practices

1. Always include time filters in your WHERE clause to ensure efficient queries.
2. Use specific column selection instead of `SELECT *` when possible for better performance.
3. Flatten your data to avoid nested JSON objects if you need to filter on those fields.
4. Use `COUNT(*)` exclusively - avoid `COUNT(column_name)` or `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`.
5. Enable compaction in R2 Data Catalog to reduce the number of data files needed to be scanned.
