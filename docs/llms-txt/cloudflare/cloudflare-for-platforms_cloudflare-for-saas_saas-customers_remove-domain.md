If your SaaS domain is also a [domain using Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/), you can use your Cloudflare DNS to remove your domain from your SaaS provider.

This means that - if you [remove the DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) pointing to your SaaS provider - Cloudflare will stop routing domain traffic through your SaaS provider and the associated custom hostname will enter a **Moved** state.

This also means that you need to keep DNS records pointing to your SaaS provider for as long as you are a customer. Otherwise, you could accidentally remove your domain from their services.
