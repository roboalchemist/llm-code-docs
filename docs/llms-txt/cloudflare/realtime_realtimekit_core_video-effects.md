Add video background effects and blur to participant video feeds in your RealtimeKit meetings using the Core SDK.

Note

If you are using the `rtk-meeting` component with UI Kit and prefer a higher-level abstraction, refer to [UI Kit Addons](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/addons/) instead.
