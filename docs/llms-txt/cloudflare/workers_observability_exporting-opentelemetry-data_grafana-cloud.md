Grafana Cloud is a fully managed observability platform that provides visualization, alerting, and analytics for your telemetry data. By exporting your Cloudflare Workers telemetry to Grafana Cloud, you can:

* Visualize distributed traces in **Grafana Tempo** to understand request flows and performance bottlenecks
* Query and analyze logs in **Grafana Loki** alongside your traces

This guide will walk you through configuring Cloudflare Workers to export OpenTelemetry-compliant traces and logs to your Grafana Cloud stack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* An active [Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user) (free tier available)
* A deployed Worker that you want to monitor

## Step 1: Access the OpenTelemetry setup guide

1. Log in to your [Grafana Cloud portal](https://grafana.com/)
2. From your organization's home page, navigate to **Connections** → **Add new connection**
3. Search for "OpenTelemetry" and select **OpenTelemetry (OTLP)**
4. Select **Quickstart** then select **JavaScript**
5. Click **Create a new token**
6. Enter a name for your token (e.g., `cloudflare-workers-otel`) and click **create token**
7. Click on **Close** without copying the token
8. Copy and Save the value for `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` in the `Environment variables` code block as the OTel endpoint and as the Auth header value respectively

## Step 2: Set up destination

1. Navigate to your Cloudflare account's [Workers Observability](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/pipelines) section
2. Click **Add destination** and configure a destination name (e.g. `grafana-tracing`)
3. From Grafana, copy your Otel endpoint, auth header, and auth value

* Your OTEL endpoint will look like `https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-2.grafana.net/otlp` (append `/v1/traces` for traces and `/v1/logs` for logs)

* Your custom header should include:

  * Your auth header name `Authorization`
  * Your auth header value `Basic MTMxxx...`

## Step 3: Configure your Worker

With your destination created in the Cloudflare dashboard, update your Worker's configuration to enable telemetry export.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "observability": {
      "traces": {
        "enabled": true,
        // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
        "destinations": ["grafana-traces"]
      },
      "logs": {
        "enabled": true,
        // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
        "destinations": ["grafana-logs"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [observability.traces]
  enabled = true
  destinations = [ "grafana-traces" ]


  [observability.logs]
  enabled = true
  destinations = [ "grafana-logs" ]
  ```

After updating your configuration, deploy your Worker for the changes to take effect.

Note

It may take a few minutes after deployment for data to appear in Grafana Cloud.
