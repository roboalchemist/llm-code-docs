## What are Workflows?

[Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) provide durable, multi-step execution for tasks that need to survive failures, retry automatically, and wait for external events. When integrated with Agents, Workflows handle long-running background processing while Agents manage real-time communication.

### Agents vs. Workflows

Agents and Workflows have complementary strengths:

| Capability | Agents | Workflows |
| - | - | - |
| Execution model | Can run indefinitely | Run to completion |
| Real-time communication | WebSockets, HTTP streaming | Not supported |
| State persistence | Built-in SQL database | Step-level persistence |
| Failure handling | Application-defined | Automatic retries and recovery |
| External events | Direct handling | Pause and wait for events |
| User interaction | Direct (chat, UI) | Through Agent callbacks |

Agents can loop, branch, and interact directly with users. Workflows execute steps sequentially with guaranteed delivery and can pause for days waiting for approvals or external data.

### When to use each

**Use Agents alone for:**

* Chat and messaging applications
* Quick API calls and responses
* Real-time collaborative features
* Tasks under 30 seconds

**Use Agents with Workflows for:**

* Data processing pipelines
* Report generation
* Human-in-the-loop approval flows
* Tasks requiring guaranteed delivery
* Multi-step operations with retry requirements

**Use Workflows alone for:**

* Background jobs with or without user approval
* Scheduled data synchronization
* Event-driven processing pipelines

## How Agents and Workflows communicate

The `AgentWorkflow` class (imported from `agents/workflows`) provides bidirectional communication between Workflows and their originating Agent.

### Workflow to Agent

Workflows can communicate with Agents through several mechanisms:

* **RPC calls**: Directly call Agent methods with full type safety via `this.agent`
* **Progress reporting**: Send progress updates via `this.reportProgress()` that trigger Agent callbacks
* **State updates**: Modify Agent state via `step.updateAgentState()` or `step.mergeAgentState()`, which broadcasts to connected clients
* **Client broadcasts**: Send messages to all WebSocket clients via `this.broadcastToClients()`

* JavaScript

  ```js
  // Inside a workflow's run() method
  await this.agent.updateTaskStatus(taskId, "processing"); // RPC call
  await this.reportProgress({ step: "process", percent: 0.5 }); // Progress (non-durable)
  this.broadcastToClients({ type: "update", taskId }); // Broadcast (non-durable)
  await step.mergeAgentState({ taskProgress: 0.5 }); // State update (durable)
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  // Inside a workflow's run() method
  await this.agent.updateTaskStatus(taskId, "processing"); // RPC call
  await this.reportProgress({ step: "process", percent: 0.5 }); // Progress (non-durable)
  this.broadcastToClients({ type: "update", taskId }); // Broadcast (non-durable)
  await step.mergeAgentState({ taskProgress: 0.5 }); // State update (durable)
  ```

### Agent to Workflow

Agents can interact with running Workflows by:

* **Starting workflows**: Launch new workflow instances with `runWorkflow()`
* **Sending events**: Dispatch events with `sendWorkflowEvent()`
* **Approval/rejection**: Respond to approval requests with `approveWorkflow()` / `rejectWorkflow()`
* **Workflow control**: Pause, resume, terminate, or restart workflows
* **Status queries**: Check workflow progress with `getWorkflow()` / `getWorkflows()`

## Durable vs. non-durable operations

Understanding durability is key to using workflows effectively:

### Non-durable (may repeat on retry)

These operations are lightweight and suitable for frequent updates, but may execute multiple times if the workflow retries:

* `this.reportProgress()` — Progress reporting
* `this.broadcastToClients()` — WebSocket broadcasts
* Direct RPC calls to `this.agent`

### Durable (idempotent, won't repeat)

These operations use the `step` parameter and are guaranteed to execute exactly once:

* `step.do()` — Execute durable steps
* `step.reportComplete()` / `step.reportError()` — Completion reporting
* `step.sendEvent()` — Custom events
* `step.updateAgentState()` / `step.mergeAgentState()` — State synchronization

## Durability guarantees

Workflows provide durability through step-based execution:

1. **Step completion is permanent** — Once a step completes, it will not re-execute even if the workflow restarts
2. **Automatic retries** — Failed steps retry with configurable backoff
3. **Event persistence** — Workflows can wait for events for up to one year
4. **State recovery** — Workflow state survives infrastructure failures

This durability model means workflows are well-suited for tasks where partial completion must be preserved, such as multi-stage data processing or transactions spanning multiple systems.

## Workflow tracking

When an Agent starts a workflow using `runWorkflow()`, the workflow is automatically tracked in the Agent's internal database. This enables:

* Querying workflow status by ID, name, or metadata with cursor-based pagination
* Monitoring progress through lifecycle callbacks (`onWorkflowProgress`, `onWorkflowComplete`, `onWorkflowError`)
* Workflow control: pause, resume, terminate, restart
* Cleaning up completed workflow records with `deleteWorkflow()` / `deleteWorkflows()`
* Correlating workflows with users or sessions through metadata

## Common patterns

### Background processing with progress

An Agent receives a request, starts a Workflow for heavy processing, and broadcasts progress updates to connected clients as the Workflow executes each step.

* JavaScript

  ```js
  // Workflow reports progress after each item
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    await step.do(`process-${i}`, async () => processItem(items[i]));
    await this.reportProgress({
      step: `process-${i}`,
      percent: (i + 1) / items.length,
      message: `Processed ${i + 1}/${items.length}`,
    });
  }
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  // Workflow reports progress after each item
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    await step.do(`process-${i}`, async () => processItem(items[i]));
    await this.reportProgress({
      step: `process-${i}`,
      percent: (i + 1) / items.length,
      message: `Processed ${i + 1}/${items.length}`,
    });
  }
  ```

### Human-in-the-loop approval

A Workflow prepares a request, pauses to wait for approval using `waitForApproval()`, and the Agent provides UI for users to approve or reject via `approveWorkflow()` / `rejectWorkflow()`. The Workflow resumes or throws `WorkflowRejectedError` based on the decision.

### Resilient external API calls

A Workflow wraps external API calls in durable steps with retry logic. If the API fails or the workflow restarts, completed calls are not repeated and failed calls retry automatically.

* JavaScript

  ```js
  const result = await step.do(
    "call-api",
    {
      retries: { limit: 5, delay: "10 seconds", backoff: "exponential" },
      timeout: "5 minutes",
    },
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/process");
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`API error: ${response.status}`);
      return response.json();
    },
  );
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  const result = await step.do(
    "call-api",
    {
      retries: { limit: 5, delay: "10 seconds", backoff: "exponential" },
      timeout: "5 minutes",
    },
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/process");
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`API error: ${response.status}`);
      return response.json();
    },
  );
  ```

### State synchronization

A Workflow updates Agent state at key milestones using `step.updateAgentState()` or `step.mergeAgentState()`. These state changes broadcast to all connected clients, keeping UIs synchronized without polling.
