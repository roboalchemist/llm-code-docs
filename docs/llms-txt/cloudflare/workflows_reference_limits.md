Limits that apply to authoring, deploying, and running Workflows are detailed below.

Many limits are inherited from those applied to Workers scripts and as documented in the [Workers limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/) documentation.

Note

Workflows cannot be deployed to Workers for Platforms namespaces, as Workflows do not support Workers for Platforms.

### `waiting` instances do not count towards instance concurrency limits

Instances that are in a `waiting` state — either sleeping via `step.sleep`, waiting for a retry, or waiting for an event via `step.waitForEvent` — do **not** count towards concurrency limits. This means you can have millions of Workflow instances sleeping or waiting for events simultaneously, as only actively `running` instances count toward the 10,000 concurrent instance limit. However, if there are 10,000 concurrent instances actively running, an instance that has been in a `waiting` state will be queued instead of resuming immediately. When an instance transitions from `running` to `waiting`, other `queued` instances will be scheduled (usually the oldest queued instance, on a best-effort basis). This state transition may not occur if the wait duration is very short.

For example, consider a Workflow that does some work, waits for 30 days, and then continues with more work:

```ts
import {
  WorkflowEntrypoint,
  WorkflowStep,
  WorkflowEvent,
} from "cloudflare:workers";


type Env = {
  MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
};


export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<unknown>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    await step.do("initial work", async () => {
      let resp = await fetch("https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/ips");
      return await resp.json<any>();
    });


    await step.sleep("wait 30 days", "30 days");


    await step.do(
      "make a call to write that could maybe, just might, fail",
      {
        retries: {
          limit: 5,
          delay: "5 seconds",
          backoff: "exponential",
        },
        timeout: "15 minutes",
      },
      async () => {
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
          throw new Error("API call to $STORAGE_SYSTEM failed");
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

While a given Workflow instance is waiting for 30 days, it will transition to the `waiting` state, allowing other `queued` instances to run if concurrency limits are reached.

### Increasing Workflow CPU limits

Workflows are Worker scripts, and share the same [per invocation CPU limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits) as any Workers do. Note that CPU time is active processing time: not time spent waiting on network requests, storage calls, or other general I/O, which don't count towards your CPU time or Workflows compute consumption.

If your Workflow exceeds its CPU time limit, it will throw the following error:

```txt
Error: Worker exceeded CPU time limit.
```

This will appear as `exceededCpu` in [`wrangler tail`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tail) outcomes and as `exceededResources` in [Workers metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics-and-analytics/#invocation-statuses).

By default, the maximum CPU time per Workflow invocation is set to 30 seconds, but can be increased for all invocations associated with a Workflow definition by setting `limits.cpu_ms` in your Wrangler configuration:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    // ...rest of your configuration...
    "limits": {
      "cpu_ms": 300000, // 300,000 milliseconds = 5 minutes
    },
    // ...rest of your configuration...
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [limits]
  cpu_ms = 300_000
  ```

To learn more about CPU time and limits, [review the Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time).

### Increasing Workflow subrequest limits

A subrequest is any request that a Workflow makes to either Internet resources using the [Fetch API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) or requests to other Cloudflare services like [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/), or [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/). Because Workflows are long-running and often make many calls to external services or Cloudflare APIs, they can exceed the default subrequest limit.

If your Workflow exceeds its subrequest limit, it will throw the following error:

```txt
Error: Too many subrequests.
```

This will appear as `exceededResources` in [Workers metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics-and-analytics/#invocation-statuses) and as `exception` in [`wrangler tail`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tail) outcomes.

By default, the maximum number of subrequests per Workflow instance is 10,000 on Workers Paid plans, but this can be increased up to 10 million by setting `limits.subrequests` in your Wrangler configuration:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    // ...rest of your configuration...
    "limits": {
      "subrequests": 10000000, // 10 million (maximum)
    },
    // ...rest of your configuration...
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [limits]
  subrequests = 10_000_000
  ```

Workers on the free plan remain limited to 50 external subrequests and 1,000 subrequests to Cloudflare services per invocation.

To learn more about subrequest limits, [review the Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests).

## Footnotes

1. A Workflow instance can run forever, as long as each step does not take more than the CPU time limit and the maximum number of steps per Workflow is not reached. [↩](#user-content-fnref-3) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-3-2)

2. `step.sleep` do not count towards the max. steps limit [↩](#user-content-fnref-5)

3. Only instances with a `running` state count towards the concurrency limits. Instances in the `waiting` state are excluded from these limits. [↩](#user-content-fnref-7)

4. Each instance created or restarted counts towards this limit [↩](#user-content-fnref-8)

5. Workflows will return a HTTP 429 rate limited error if you exceed the rate of new Workflow instance creation. [↩](#user-content-fnref-6) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-6-2)

6. Workflow instance state and logs will be retained for 3 days on the Workers Free plan and for 30 days on the Workers Paid plan. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)

7. Match pattern: \_`^[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9-_]\*$`\_ [↩](#user-content-fnref-4) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-4-2)
