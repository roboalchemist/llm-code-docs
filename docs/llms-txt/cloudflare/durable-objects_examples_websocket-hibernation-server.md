This example is similar to the [Build a WebSocket server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/examples/websocket-server/) example, but uses the WebSocket Hibernation API. The WebSocket Hibernation API should be preferred for WebSocket server applications built on Durable Objects, since it significantly decreases duration charge, and provides additional features that pair well with WebSocket applications. For more information, refer to [Use Durable Objects with WebSockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/websockets/).

Note

WebSocket Hibernation is unavailable for outgoing WebSocket use cases. Hibernation is only supported when the Durable Object acts as a server. For use cases where outgoing WebSockets are required, refer to [Write a WebSocket client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/websockets/#write-a-websocket-client).

* JavaScript

  ```js
  import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";


  // Worker
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      if (request.url.endsWith("/websocket")) {
        // Expect to receive a WebSocket Upgrade request.
        // If there is one, accept the request and return a WebSocket Response.
        const upgradeHeader = request.headers.get("Upgrade");
        if (!upgradeHeader || upgradeHeader !== "websocket") {
          return new Response("Worker expected Upgrade: websocket", {
            status: 426,
          });
        }


        if (request.method !== "GET") {
          return new Response("Worker expected GET method", {
            status: 400,
          });
        }


        // Since we are hard coding the Durable Object ID by providing the constant name 'foo',
        // all requests to this Worker will be sent to the same Durable Object instance.
