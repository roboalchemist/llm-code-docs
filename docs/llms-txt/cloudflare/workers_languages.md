Workers is a polyglot platform, and provides first-class support for the following programming languages:

* [JavaScript](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/javascript/)
* [TypeScript](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/)
* [Python Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/)
* [Rust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/rust/)

Workers also supports [WebAssembly](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/webassembly/) (abbreviated as "Wasm") — a binary format that many languages can be compiled to. This allows you to write Workers using programming language beyond the languages listed above, including C, C++, Kotlin, Go and more.
