In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) application on Cloudflare Workers using the [Cloudflare Workers platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [D1 database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/). You will build a Members Registry API with basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. You will use D1 as the database for storing and retrieving member data.

## Before you start

All of the tutorials assume you have already completed the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/), which gets you set up with a Cloudflare Workers account, [C3](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare), and [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## Quick start

If you want to skip the steps and get started quickly, select **Deploy to Cloudflare** below.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/docs-examples/tree/main/workers/express-on-workers)

This creates a repository in your GitHub account and deploys the application to Cloudflare Workers. Use this option if you are familiar with Cloudflare Workers, and wish to skip the step-by-step guidance.

You may wish to manually follow the steps if you are new to Cloudflare Workers.

## 1. Create a new Cloudflare Workers project

Use [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workers/get-started/c3-and-wrangler/#c3), the command-line tool for Cloudflare's developer products, to create a new directory and initialize a new Worker project:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- express-d1-app
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare express-d1-app
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest express-d1-app
  ```

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

Change into your new project directory:

```sh
cd express-d1-app
```

## 2. Install Express and dependencies

In this tutorial, you will use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a popular web framework for Node.js. To use Express in a Cloudflare Workers environment, install Express along with the necessary TypeScript types:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i express @types/express
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add express @types/express
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add express @types/express
  ```

Express.js on Cloudflare Workers requires the `nodejs_compat` [compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/). This flag enables Node.js APIs and allows Express to run on the Workers runtime. Add the following to your Wrangler configuration file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
  ```

## 3. Create a D1 database

You will now create a D1 database to store member information. Use the `wrangler d1 create` command to create a new database:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create members-db
```

The command will create a new D1 database and ask you the following questions:

* **Would you like Wrangler to add it on your behalf?**: Type `Y`.
* **What binding name would you like to use?**: Type `DB` and press Enter.
* **For local dev, do you want to connect to the remote resource instead of a local resource?**: Type `N`.

```sh
 ⛅️ wrangler 4.44.0
───────────────────
✅ Successfully created DB 'members-db' in region WNAM
Created your new D1 database.


To access your new D1 Database in your Worker, add the following snippet to your configuration file:
{
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "members_db",
      "database_name": "members-db",
      "database_id": "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
    }
  ]
}
✔ Would you like Wrangler to add it on your behalf? … yes
✔ What binding name would you like to use? … DB
✔ For local dev, do you want to connect to the remote resource instead of a local resource? … no
```

The binding will be added to your Wrangler configuration file.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "d1_databases": [
      {
        "binding": "DB",
        "database_name": "members-db",
        "database_id": "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[d1_databases]]
  binding = "DB"
  database_name = "members-db"
  database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
  ```

## 4. Create database schema

Create a directory called `schemas` in your project root, and inside it, create a file called `schema.sql`:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS members;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS members (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  joined_date TEXT NOT NULL
);


-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO members (name, email, joined_date) VALUES
  ('Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', '2024-01-15'),
  ('Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com', '2024-02-20'),
  ('Carol Williams', 'carol@example.com', '2024-03-10');
```

This schema creates a `members` table with an auto-incrementing ID, name, email, and join date fields. It also inserts three sample members.

Execute the schema file against your D1 database:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute members-db --file=./schemas/schema.sql
```

The above command creates the table in your local development database. You will deploy the schema to production later.

## 5. Initialize Express application

Update your `src/index.ts` file to set up Express with TypeScript. Replace the file content with the following:

```ts
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
import { httpServerHandler } from "cloudflare:node";
import express from "express";


const app = express();


// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());


// Health check endpoint
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Express.js running on Cloudflare Workers!" });
});


app.listen(3000);
export default httpServerHandler({ port: 3000 });
```

This code initializes Express and creates a basic health check endpoint. The key import `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` allows you to access [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) like your D1 database from anywhere in your code. The [httpServerHandler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/http/#httpserverhandler) integrates Express with the Workers runtime, enabling your application to handle HTTP requests on Cloudflare's network.

Next, execute the typegen command to generate type definitions for your Worker environment:

```sh
npm run cf-typegen
```

## 6. Implement read operations

Add endpoints to retrieve members from the database. Update your `src/index.ts` file by adding the following routes after the health check endpoint:

```typescript
// GET all members
app.get('/api/members', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { results } = await env.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM members ORDER BY joined_date DESC').all();


    res.json({ success: true, members: results });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: 'Failed to fetch members' });
  }
});


// GET a single member by ID
app.get('/api/members/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;


    const { results } = await env.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM members WHERE id = ?').bind(id).all();


    if (results.length === 0) {
      return res.status(404).json({ success: false, error: 'Member not found' });
    }


    res.json({ success: true, member: results[0] });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: 'Failed to fetch member' });
  }
});
```

These routes use the D1 binding (`env.DB`) to prepare SQL statements and execute them. Since you imported `env` from `cloudflare:workers` at the top of the file, it is accessible throughout your application. The `prepare`, `bind`, and `all` methods on the D1 binding allow you to safely query the database. Refer to [D1 Workers Binding API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/) for all available methods.

## 7. Implement create operation

Add an endpoint to create new members. Add the following route to your `src/index.ts` file:

```typescript
// POST - Create a new member
app.post("/api/members", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email } = req.body;


    // Validate input
    if (!name || !email) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        error: "Name and email are required",
      });
    }


    // Basic email validation (simplified for tutorial purposes)
    // For production, consider using a validation library or more comprehensive checks
    if (!email.includes("@") || !email.includes(".")) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        error: "Invalid email format",
      });
    }


    const joined_date = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];


    const result = await env.DB.prepare(
      "INSERT INTO members (name, email, joined_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
    )
      .bind(name, email, joined_date)
      .run();


    if (result.success) {
      res.status(201).json({
        success: true,
        message: "Member created successfully",
        id: result.meta.last_row_id,
      });
    } else {
      res
        .status(500)
        .json({ success: false, error: "Failed to create member" });
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Handle unique constraint violation
    if (error.message?.includes("UNIQUE constraint failed")) {
      return res.status(409).json({
        success: false,
        error: "Email already exists",
      });
    }
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: "Failed to create member" });
  }
});
```

This endpoint validates the input, checks the email format, and inserts a new member into the database. It also handles duplicate email addresses by checking for unique constraint violations.

## 8. Implement update operation

Add an endpoint to update existing members. Add the following route to your `src/index.ts` file:

```typescript
app.put("/api/members/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const { name, email } = req.body;


    // Validate input
    if (!name && !email) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        error: "At least one field (name or email) is required",
      });
    }


    // Basic email validation if provided (simplified for tutorial purposes)
    // For production, consider using a validation library or more comprehensive checks
    if (email && (!email.includes("@") || !email.includes("."))) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        error: "Invalid email format",
      });
    }


    // Build dynamic update query
    const updates: string[] = [];
    const values: any[] = [];


    if (name) {
      updates.push("name = ?");
      values.push(name);
    }
    if (email) {
      updates.push("email = ?");
      values.push(email);
    }


    values.push(id);


    const result = await env.DB.prepare(
      `UPDATE members SET ${updates.join(", ")} WHERE id = ?`
    )
      .bind(...values)
      .run();


    if (result.meta.changes === 0) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ success: false, error: "Member not found" });
    }


    res.json({ success: true, message: "Member updated successfully" });
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (error.message?.includes("UNIQUE constraint failed")) {
      return res.status(409).json({
        success: false,
        error: "Email already exists",
      });
    }
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: "Failed to update member" });
  }
});
```

This endpoint allows updating either the name, email, or both fields of an existing member. It builds a dynamic SQL query based on the provided fields.

## 9. Implement delete operation

Add an endpoint to delete members. Add the following route to your `src/index.ts` file:

```typescript
// DELETE - Delete a member
app.delete("/api/members/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;


    const result = await env.DB.prepare("DELETE FROM members WHERE id = ?")
      .bind(id)
      .run();


    if (result.meta.changes === 0) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ success: false, error: "Member not found" });
    }


    res.json({ success: true, message: "Member deleted successfully" });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: "Failed to delete member" });
  }
});
```

This endpoint deletes a member by their ID and returns an error if the member does not exist.

## 10. Test locally

Start the development server to test your API locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The development server will start, and you can access your API at `http://localhost:8787`.

Open a new terminal window and test the endpoints using `curl`:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8787/api/members
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "members": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "joined_date": "2024-01-15"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bob Smith",
      "email": "bob@example.com",
      "joined_date": "2024-02-20"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Carol Williams",
      "email": "carol@example.com",
      "joined_date": "2024-03-10"
    }
  ]
}
```

Test creating a new member:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "David Brown", "email": "david@example.com"}'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Member created successfully",
  "id": 4
}
```

Test getting a single member:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8787/api/members/1
```

Test updating a member:

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8787/api/members/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice Cooper"}'
```

Test deleting a member:

```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8787/api/members/4
```

## 11. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Before deploying to production, execute the schema file against your remote (production) database:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute members-db --remote --file=./schemas/schema.sql
```

Now deploy your application to the Cloudflare network:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

```sh
⛅️ wrangler 4.44.0
───────────────────
Total Upload: 1743.64 KiB / gzip: 498.65 KiB
Worker Startup Time: 48 ms
Your Worker has access to the following bindings:
Binding                  Resource
env.DB (members-db)      D1 Database


Uploaded express-d1-app (2.99 sec)
Deployed express-d1-app triggers (5.26 sec)
  https://<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
Current Version ID: <version-id>
```

After successful deployment, Wrangler will output your Worker's URL.

## 12. Test production deployment

Test your deployed API using the provided URL. Replace `<your-worker-url>` with your actual Worker URL:

```sh
curl https://<your-worker-url>/api/members
```

You should see the same member data you created in the production database.

Create a new member in production:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-worker-url>/api/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Eva Martinez", "email": "eva@example.com"}'
```

Your Express.js application with D1 database is now running on Cloudflare Workers.
