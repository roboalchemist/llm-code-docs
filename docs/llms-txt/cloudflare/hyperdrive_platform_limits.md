The following limits apply to Hyperdrive configurations, connections, and queries made to your configured origin databases.

## Configuration limits

These limits apply when creating or updating Hyperdrive configurations.

| Limit | Free | Paid |
| - | - | - |
| Maximum configured databases | 10 per account | 25 per account |
| Maximum username length [1](#user-content-fn-1) | 63 characters (bytes) | 63 characters (bytes) |
| Maximum database name length [1](#user-content-fn-1) | 63 characters (bytes) | 63 characters (bytes) |

## Connection limits

These limits apply to connections between Hyperdrive and your origin database.

| Limit | Free | Paid |
| - | - | - |
| Initial connection timeout | 15 seconds | 15 seconds |
| Idle connection timeout | 10 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Maximum origin database connections (per configuration) [2](#user-content-fn-2) | \~20 connections | \~100 connections |

Hyperdrive does not limit the number of concurrent client connections from your Workers. However, Hyperdrive limits connections to your origin database because most hosted databases have connection limits.

### Connection errors

When Hyperdrive cannot acquire a connection to your origin database, you may see one of the following errors:

| Error message | Cause |
| - | - |
| `Failed to acquire a connection from the pool.` | The connection pool is exhausted because connections are held open too long. Long-running queries or transactions are a common cause. |
| `Server connection attempt failed: connection_refused` | Your origin database is rejecting connections. This can occur when a firewall blocks Hyperdrive, or when your database provider's connection limit is exceeded. |

For a complete list of error codes, refer to [Troubleshoot and debug](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/).

## Query limits

These limits apply to queries sent through Hyperdrive.

| Limit | Free | Paid |
| - | - | - |
| Maximum query (statement) duration | 60 seconds | 60 seconds |
| Maximum cached query response size | 50 MB | 50 MB |

Queries exceeding the maximum duration are terminated. Query responses larger than 50 MB are not cached but are still returned to your Worker.

## Request a limit increase

You can request adjustments to limits that conflict with your project goals by contacting Cloudflare. Not all limits can be increased.

To request an increase, submit a [Limit Increase Request form](https://forms.gle/ukpeZVLWLnKeixDu7). You can also ask questions in the Hyperdrive channel on [Cloudflare's Discord community](https://discord.cloudflare.com/).

## Footnotes

1. This is a limit enforced by PostgreSQL. Some database providers may enforce smaller limits. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1) [↩2](#user-content-fnref-1-2)

2. Hyperdrive is a distributed system, so a client may be unable to reach an existing pool. In this scenario, a new pool is established with its own connection allocation. This prioritizes availability over strict limit enforcement, which means connection counts may occasionally exceed the listed limits. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)
