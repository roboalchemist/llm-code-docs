**RealtimeKit Web UI Kit 1.1.0**

**Compatibility:** Works best with RealtimeKit Web Core 1.2.4 or later.

**Features**

* Chat message operations (edit, delete, pin) are now available to all participants.

* Chat pagination with infinite scroll for improved performance in meetings with high message volume.

* Pinned messages are now displayed in a dedicated view for easy access.

* Added `overrides` prop support on `rtk-meeting` and `rtk-ui-provider` for easier UI customization. Available overrides include:

  * `disablePrivateChat` - Disable private chat functionality.
  * `disableEmojiPicker` - Hide emoji picker in chat component.

  ```tsx
  <RtkMeeting meeting={meeting} overrides={{
    disablePrivateChat: true,
    disableEmojiPicker: true
  }} />
  ```

**New components**

* `rtk-chat-header` - Header component with pinned messages and private chat selector.
* `rtk-pinned-message-selector` - Displays all pinned messages with paginated infinite scroll.
* `rtk-chat-selector` - Switch between public chat and private chats with specific participants.

**Component enhancements**

* `rtk-chat-composer-view` now accepts `isSending` prop to display sender messages on the right and other messages on the left with different colors.
* `rtk-chat-messages-ui-paginated` now accepts `privateChatRecipient` prop for displaying paginated private chat messages.
* `rtk-chat-messages-ui-paginated` now emits `editMessage`, `deleteMessage`, and `pinMessage` events for message operations.
* `rtk-menu-item` and `rtk-menu-list` now accept `menuVariant` prop for different color schemes based on user actions.
* `rtk-message-view` now accepts `isEdited`, `isSelf`, `messageType`, and `pinned` props for appropriate message rendering.
* Added automatic scrolling to new messages.

**Breaking changes**

Removed non-operational chat channel components to streamline the SDK. `rtk-chat` remains fully operational.

* Removed `rtk-channel-creator`.
* Removed `rtk-channel-header`.
* Removed `rtk-channel-details`.
* Removed `rtk-channel-selector-ui`.
* Removed `rtk-channel-selector-view`.
* `rtk-chat-composer-ui` no longer accepts `channelId` prop.
* `rtk-chat` no longer accepts `disablePrivateChat` prop. Use preset configuration instead, or pass as override:

  ```tsx
  <RtkMeeting meeting={meeting} overrides={{disablePrivateChat: true}} />
  ```

**Deprecations**

* `rtk-chat-composer-ui` is deprecated due to scalability limitations and lack of pagination support.

**Known limitations**

* Total message count for public and private chats is not currently displayed.
