Run machine learning models, powered by serverless GPUs, on Cloudflare's global network.

Available on Free and Paid plans

Workers AI allows you to run AI models in a serverless way, without having to worry about scaling, maintaining, or paying for unused infrastructure. You can invoke models running on GPUs on Cloudflare's network from your own code — from [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/), or anywhere via [the Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai/methods/run/).

Workers AI gives you access to:
