The Workers platform has a variety of ways to test your applications, depending on your requirements. We recommend using the [Vitest integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration), which allows you to run tests *inside* the Workers runtime, and unit test individual functions within your Worker.

[Get started with Vitest](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/write-your-first-test/)

## Testing comparison matrix

However, if you don't use Vitest, both [Miniflare's API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/miniflare/writing-tests) and the [`unstable_startWorker()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_startworker) API provide options for testing your Worker in any testing framework.
