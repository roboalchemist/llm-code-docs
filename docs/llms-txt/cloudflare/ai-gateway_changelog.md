## 2025-11-21

Unified Billing now supports opt-in Zero Data Retention. This ensures supported upstream AI providers (eg [OpenAI ZDR](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data#zero-data-retention)) do not retain request and response data.

* Supports adding OpenAI compatible [Custom Providers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-providers/) for inferencing with AI providers that are not natively supported by AI Gateway
* Cost and usage tracking for voice models
* You can now use Workers AI via AI Gateway with no additional configuration. Previously, this required generating / passing additional Workers AI tokens.

## 2025-11-06

**Unified Billing**

* [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/) is now in open beta.
