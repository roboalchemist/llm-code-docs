Workers KV REST API limits

Using the REST API to access Cloudflare Workers KV is subject to the [rate limits that apply to all operations of the Cloudflare REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/limits).

## Footnotes

1. Within a single invocation, a Worker can make up to 1,000 operations to external services (for example, 500 Workers KV reads and 500 R2 reads). A bulk request to Workers KV counts for 1 request to an external service. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)

2. The maximum value is [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)
