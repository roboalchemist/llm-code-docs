Privacy Proxy supports OpenTelemetry for monitoring and observability. You can collect metrics and traces to understand proxy performance and usage.

## OpenTelemetry integration

Privacy Proxy exports telemetry data using the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/). You can configure an endpoint to receive this data and forward it to your observability platform.

### Configure telemetry export

During onboarding, provide Cloudflare with your OpenTelemetry collector endpoint:

* **Endpoint URL**: The HTTPS endpoint where telemetry data should be sent.
* **Authentication**: Headers or credentials required to authenticate with your collector.

Cloudflare configures your Privacy Proxy instance to export telemetry to this endpoint.

### Supported signals

Privacy Proxy exports the following telemetry signals:

| Signal | Description |
| - | - |
| Metrics | Connection counts, request rates, latency histograms, error rates |
| Traces | Per-request traces showing proxy processing time. Traces are sampled at approximately 1% of requests. |

## Metrics

Privacy Proxy exports metrics that help you understand usage patterns and performance.

### Connection metrics

| Metric | Description |
| - | - |
| `privacy_proxy_connections_total` | Total number of proxy connections |
| `privacy_proxy_connections_active` | Currently active connections |
| `privacy_proxy_connections_duration_seconds` | Connection duration histogram |

### Request metrics

| Metric | Description |
| - | - |
| `privacy_proxy_requests_total` | Total CONNECT requests processed |
| `privacy_proxy_requests_by_status` | Requests grouped by response status code |
| `privacy_proxy_bytes_sent_total` | Total bytes sent to destinations |
| `privacy_proxy_bytes_received_total` | Total bytes received from destinations |

### Latency metrics

| Metric | Description |
| - | - |
| `privacy_proxy_connect_latency_seconds` | Time to establish connection to destination |
| `privacy_proxy_first_byte_latency_seconds` | Time to first byte from destination |

## `Server-Timing` header

Privacy Proxy includes a `Server-Timing` header in responses to help measure processing latency from the client side. For full header format details, refer to [HTTP headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-proxy/reference/http-headers/#server-timing).

```http
Server-Timing: proxy;dur=12.5
```

The `dur` value is the processing time in milliseconds introduced by the proxy. Use this header as a client-side SLI (Service Level Indicator) to monitor proxy performance.

### Example: Prometheus and Grafana

To visualize Privacy Proxy metrics in Grafana:

1. Configure an OpenTelemetry collector to receive data from Privacy Proxy.
2. Export metrics from the collector to Prometheus.
3. Create Grafana dashboards using Prometheus as a data source.

```promql
# Request rate over time
rate(privacy_proxy_requests_total[5m])


# 95th percentile connection latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(privacy_proxy_connect_latency_seconds_bucket[5m]))


# Error rate
sum(rate(privacy_proxy_requests_by_status{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(privacy_proxy_requests_total[5m]))
```

## Data privacy

Telemetry data does not include:

* User IP addresses
* Request content or headers (beyond what is needed for metrics)
* Destination URLs or hostnames (aggregated only)
* Authentication tokens or credentials

Cloudflare exports only operational metrics that help you monitor service health without compromising user privacy.
