You can pass an optional object `storage_config` in the start recording request to publish the recording directly to your cloud provider. If a `path` is specified, the recorded video will be stored there, otherwise the default is the root of the directory.

The filename for recording will be the same as given in `output_file_name`.

Note

Ensure that the cloud keys you provide to RealtimeKit APIs have only limited access.

## Set storage configuration

You can configure storage configs for RealtimeKit Recordings in the following ways:

### Set Storage Configuration Details Using RealtimeKit Dashboard

You can specify storage configuration details using RealtimeKit Dashboard for all meetings.

1. In the Cloudflare [RealtimeKit Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/realtime/kit), go to Recordings tab.
2. Click **Setup Storage**.
3. Specify the details for your cloud provider. We support transferring recordings to Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Azure, DigitalOcean, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets.

Note

If you specify storage configuration in the [Start Recording](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/) API request, that configuration takes precedence over the storage details configured in the RealtimeKit Dashboard.

To familiarize yourself with the RealtimeKit REST APIs, we recommend exploring the [RealtimeKit REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/).

### Using the `storage_config` option in the Start Recording API

This allows for the most granular level of control, and lets you specify a storage\_config for a specific [recording started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/) on a meeting.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/realtime/kit/<app_id>/recordings \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_authorization_token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "meeting_id": "97440c6a-140b-40a9-9499-b23fd7a3868a",
  "storage_config": {
    "type": "cloudflare",
    "access_key": "your-access-key",
    "secret": "your-secret-key",
    "bucket": "your-bucket-name",
    "path": "/"
  }
}'
```

## Supported Cloud Providers

Currently, the following cloud providers are supported:

### Cloudflare R2

To transfer recordings to Cloudflare R2, set the following fields in the `storage_config` parameter:

* Type: Specify `cloudflare`.
* Access Key: Enter your R2 access key ID. For more information, see [Create API tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/).
* Bucket: Enter the name of your R2 bucket.
* (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred to the root folder of the bucket.
* Secret: Enter your R2 secret access key.
* Account ID: Enter your Cloudflare account ID.

### AWS S3

To transfer recordings to the AWS S3 bucket, set the following fields in the `storage_config` parameter:

* Type: Specify `aws`.
* Access Key: Enter your `aws_access_key_id`.
* Bucket: Enter your AWS S3 bucket name.
* (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred to the root folder of the bucket.
* Secret: Enter your `aws_secret_access_key`.
* Region: Specify the region where your bucket is hosted, for example, `ap-south-1`.

### Azure Blob Storage

To transfer recordings to the Azure Blob Storage, set the following fields in the `storage_config` parameter:

* Type: Specify `azure`.
* Access key: Enter your azure connection string. For more information on how to get the access key, see [View account access key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json\&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json\&tabs=azure-portal#view-account-access-keys).
* Bucket: Enter the name of your container. The container should be in the same storage account as the connection string.
* (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred to the root folder of the container.
* Secret: Set to a blank string "".
* Region: Set to a blank string "".

### DigitalOcean

To transfer recordings to the DigitalOcean Spaces, set the following fields in the `storage_config` parameter:

* Type: Specify `digitalocean`.
* Access key: Enter your digital ocean access key. For more information, see [Create DigitalOcean Space and API Key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key).
* Bucket: Enter the name of your Spaces bucket.
* (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred to the root folder of the container.
* Secret: Enter your Spaces secret.
* Region: Specify the region where your Spaces bucket is hosted, for example, `SGP1`. For more information, see [Region Availability Matrix](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/platform/availability-matrix/).

### Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

To transfer recordings to GCS, set the following fields in the `storage_config` parameter:

* Type: Specify `gcs`.
* Bucket: Enter the name of your Cloud Storage bucket.
* (Optional) Path: Specify the path to a sub-folder where recordings should be transferred. If this parameter is not passed, recordings will be transferred to the root folder of the container.
* Secret: Enter your service account credentials. For more information, see [service account credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).
* Region: Specify the region where your Cloud Storage bucket is hosted, for example, `US multi-region`. For more information, see [Bucket locations](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations).

## Update the Recording File Name

You can change the name of the recording file using the `file_name_prefix` field. The default format for recorded file name is `roomname_timestamp`, but you can add an alphanumeric and underscore prefix to the default file name.

It's important to note that you can only add a prefix to the default format; you can't change the entire file name. For example, if you teach an online physics class at 9 a.m. using RealtimeKit, you could add `Physics_9am` to the file name. `Physics_9am_roomname_timestamp` would be the new file name.

For more information, see [start recording a meeting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/methods/start_recordings/).
