Cloudflare R2 Storage allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data without the costly egress bandwidth fees associated with typical cloud storage services.

## Before you begin

You need a Cloudflare account with an R2 subscription. If you do not have one:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Storage & databases > R2 > Overview**
3. Complete the checkout flow to add an R2 subscription to your account.

R2 is free to get started with included free monthly usage. You are billed for your usage on a monthly basis. Refer to [Pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) for details.

[Go to **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview)

## Choose how to access R2

R2 supports multiple access methods, so you can choose the one that fits your use case best:
