Cloudflare Stream works with all web video players that support HLS and DASH.

Note

Before you can play videos, you must first [upload a video to Cloudflare Stream](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/uploading-videos/) or be [actively streaming to a live input](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live)

## Examples

* [Video.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/video-js/)
* [HLS reference player (hls.js)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/hls-js/)
* [DASH reference player (dash.js)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/dash-js/)
* [Vidstack](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/vidstack/)
