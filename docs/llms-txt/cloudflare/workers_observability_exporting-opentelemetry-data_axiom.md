Axiom is a serverless log analytics platform that helps you store, search, and analyze massive amounts of data. By exporting your Cloudflare Workers application telemetry to Axiom, you can:

* Store and query logs and traces at scale
* Create dashboards and alerts to monitor your Workers

This guide will walk you through exporting OpenTelemetry-compliant traces and logs to Axiom from your Cloudflare Worker application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* An active [Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register) (free tier available)
* A deployed Worker that you want to monitor
* An Axiom dataset to send data to

## Step 1: Create a dataset

If you don't already have a dataset to send data to:

1. Log in to your [Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/)
2. Navigate to **Datasets** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Dataset**
4. Enter a name (e.g. `cloudflare-workers-otel`)
5. Click **Create Dataset**

## Step 2: Get your Axiom API token and dataset

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar

2. Click on **API Tokens**

3. Click **Create API Token**

4. Configure your API token:

   * **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `cloudflare-workers-otel`)
   * **Permissions**: Select **Ingest** permission (required for sending telemetry data)
   * **Datasets**: Choose which datasets this token can write to, or select **All Datasets**

5. Click **Create**

6. **Important**: Copy the API token immediately and store it securely - you won't be able to see it again

The API token will look something like: `xaat-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Step 3: Configure Cloudflare destinations

Now you'll create destinations in the Cloudflare dashboard that point to Axiom.

### Axiom OTLP endpoints

Axiom provides separate OTLP endpoints for traces and logs:

* **Traces**: `https://api.axiom.co/v1/traces`
* **Logs**: `https://api.axiom.co/v1/logs`

### Configure trace or logs destination

1. Navigate to your Cloudflare account's [Workers Observability](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/pipelines) section

2. Click **Add destination**

3. Configure your trace destination:

   * **Destination Name**: `axiom-traces` (or any descriptive name)

   * **Destination Type**: Select **Traces**

   * **OTLP Endpoint**: `https://api.axiom.co/v1/traces` (or `/v1/logs`)

   * **Custom Headers**: Add two required headers:

     * Authentication header

       * Header name: `Authorization`
       * Header value: `Bearer <your-api-token>`

     * Dataset header:

       * Header name: `X-Axiom-Dataset`
       * Header value: Your dataset name (e.g., `cloudflare-workers-otel`)

4. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Configure your Worker

With your destinations created in the Cloudflare dashboard, update your Worker's configuration to enable telemetry export.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "observability": {
      "traces": {
        "enabled": true,
        // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
        "destinations": ["axiom-traces"]
      },
      "logs": {
        "enabled": true,
        // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
        "destinations": ["axiom-logs"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [observability.traces]
  enabled = true
  destinations = [ "axiom-traces" ]


  [observability.logs]
  enabled = true
  destinations = [ "axiom-logs" ]
  ```

After updating your configuration, deploy your Worker for the changes to take effect.

Note

It may take a few minutes after deployment for data to appear in Axiom.
