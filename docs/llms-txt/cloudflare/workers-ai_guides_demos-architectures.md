Workers AI can be used to build dynamic and performant services. The following demo applications and reference architectures showcase how to use Workers AI optimally within your architecture.

## Demos

Explore the following demo applications for Workers AI.

* [Jobs At Conf:](https://github.com/harshil1712/jobs-at-conf-demo) A job lisiting website to add jobs you find at in-person conferences. Built with Cloudflare Pages, R2, D1, Queues, and Workers AI.

## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use Workers AI:

[Fullstack applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[A practical example of how these services come together in a real fullstack application architecture.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[Storing user generated content](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/storage/storing-user-generated-content/)

[Store user-generated content in R2 for fast, secure, and cost-effective architecture.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/storage/storing-user-generated-content/)

[Optimizing and securing connected transportation systems](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/iot/optimizing-and-securing-connected-transportation-systems/)

[This diagram showcases Cloudflare components optimizing connected transportation systems. It illustrates how their technologies minimize latency, ensure reliability, and strengthen security for critical data flow.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/iot/optimizing-and-securing-connected-transportation-systems/)

[Ingesting BigQuery Data into Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/)

[You can connect a Cloudflare Worker to get data from Google BigQuery and pass it to Workers AI, to run AI Models, powered by serverless GPUs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/)

[Multi-vendor AI observability and control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/)

[By shifting features such as rate limiting, caching, and error handling to the proxy layer, organizations can apply unified configurations across services and inference service providers.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/)

[Composable AI architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)

[The architecture diagram illustrates how AI applications can be built end-to-end on Cloudflare, or single services can be integrated with external infrastructure and services.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)

[Content-based asset creation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-asset-creation/)

[AI systems combine text-generation and text-to-image models to create visual content from text. They generate prompts, moderate content, and produce images for various applications.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-asset-creation/)

[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[RAG combines retrieval with generative models for better text. It uses external knowledge to create factual, relevant responses, improving coherence and accuracy in NLP tasks like chatbots.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[Automatic captioning for video uploads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-video-caption/)

[By integrating automatic speech recognition technology into video platforms, content creators, publishers, and distributors can reach a broader audience, including individuals with hearing impairments or those who prefer to consume content in different languages.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-video-caption/)

[Serverless image content management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-image-content-management/)

[Leverage various components of Cloudflare's ecosystem to construct a scalable image management solution](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-image-content-management/)
