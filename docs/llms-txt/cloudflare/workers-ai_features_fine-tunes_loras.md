Workers AI supports fine-tuned inference with adapters trained with [Low-Rank Adaptation](https://blog.cloudflare.com/fine-tuned-inference-with-loras). This feature is in open beta and free during this period.

## Limitations

* We only support LoRAs for a [variety of models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/?capabilities=LoRA) (must not be quantized)
* Adapter must be trained with rank `r <=8` as well as larger ranks if up to 32. You can check the rank of a pre-trained LoRA adapter through the adapter's `config.json` file
* LoRA adapter file must be < 300MB
* LoRA adapter files must be named `adapter_config.json` and `adapter_model.safetensors` exactly
* You can test up to 100 LoRA adapters per account

## Choosing compatible LoRA adapters

### Finding open-source LoRA adapters

We have started a [Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Cloudflare/workers-ai-compatible-loras-6608dd9f8d305a46e355746e) that lists a few LoRA adapters that are compatible with Workers AI. Generally, any LoRA adapter that fits our limitations above should work.

### Training your own LoRA adapters

To train your own LoRA adapter, follow the [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/fine-tune-models-with-autotrain/).

***

## Uploading LoRA adapters

In order to run inference with LoRAs on Workers AI, you'll need to create a new fine tune on your account and upload your adapter files. You should have a `adapter_model.safetensors` file with model weights and `adapter_config.json` with your config information. *Note that we only accept adapter files in these types.*

Right now, you can't edit a fine tune's asset files after you upload it. We will support this soon, but for now you will need to create a new fine tune and upload files again if you would like to use a new LoRA.

Before you upload your LoRA adapter, you'll need to edit your `adapter_config.json` file to include `model_type` as one of `mistral`, `gemma` or `llama` like below.

```json
{
  "alpha_pattern": {},
  "auto_mapping": null,
  ...
  "target_modules": [
    "q_proj",
    "v_proj"
  ],
  "task_type": "CAUSAL_LM",
  "model_type": "mistral",
}
```

### Wrangler

You can create a finetune and upload your LoRA adapter via wrangler with the following commands:

```bash
npx wrangler ai finetune create <model_name> <finetune_name> <folder_path>
#🌀 Creating new finetune "test-lora" for model "@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora"...
#🌀 Uploading file "/Users/abcd/Downloads/adapter_config.json" to "test-lora"...
#🌀 Uploading file "/Users/abcd/Downloads/adapter_model.safetensors" to "test-lora"...
#✅ Assets uploaded, finetune "test-lora" is ready to use.


npx wrangler ai finetune list
┌──────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────┐
│ finetune_id                          │ name            │ description │
├──────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────┤
│ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 │ test-lora       │             │
└──────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### REST API

Alternatively, you can use our REST API to create a finetune and upload your adapter files. You will need a Cloudflare API Token with `Workers AI: Edit` permissions to make calls to our REST API, which you can generate via the Cloudflare Dashboard.

#### Creating a fine-tune on your account

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `Workers AI Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/finetunes" \
  --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  --json '{
    "model": "SUPPORTED_MODEL_NAME",
    "name": "FINETUNE_NAME",
    "description": "OPTIONAL_DESCRIPTION"
  }'
```

#### Uploading your adapter weights and config

You have to call the upload endpoint each time you want to upload a new file, so you usually run this once for `adapter_model.safetensors` and once for `adapter_config.json`. Make sure you include the `@` before your path to files.

You can either use the finetune `name` or `id` that you used when you created the fine tune.

```bash
## Input: finetune_id, adapter_model.safetensors, then adapter_config.json
## Output: success true/false


curl -X POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/finetunes/{FINETUNE_ID}/finetune-assets/ \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
    -F 'file_name=adapter_model.safetensors' \
    -F 'file=@{PATH/TO/adapter_model.safetensors}'
```

#### List fine-tunes in your account

You can call this method to confirm what fine-tunes you have created in your account

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `Workers AI Write`
* `Workers AI Read`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/finetunes" \
  --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [
    [
      {
        "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
        "model": "@cf/meta-llama/llama-2-7b-chat-hf-lora",
        "name": "llama2-finetune",
        "description": "test"
      },
      {
        "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000",
        "model": "@cf/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora",
        "name": "mistral-finetune",
        "description": "test"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Running inference with LoRAs

To make inference requests and apply the LoRA adapter, you will need your model and finetune `name` or `id`. You should use the chat template that your LoRA was trained on, but you can try running it with `raw: true` and the messages template like below.

* workers ai sdk

  ```javascript
  const response = await env.AI.run(
    "@cf/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora", //the model supporting LoRAs
    {
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello world" }],
      raw: true, //skip applying the default chat template
      lora: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000", //the finetune id OR name
    },
  );
  ```

* rest api

  ```bash
  curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
    -d '{
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}],
      "raw": "true",
      "lora": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000"
    }'
  ```
