## 2025-08-05

**Adding gpt-oss models to our catalog**

* Check out the [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai) for more details about the new models
* Take a look at the [`gpt-oss-120b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b) and [`gpt-oss-20b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b) model pages for more information about schemas, pricing, and context windows

## 2025-04-09

**Pricing correction for @cf/myshell-ai/melotts**

* We've updated our documentation to reflect the correct pricing for melotts: $0.0002 per audio minute, which is actually cheaper than initially stated. The documented pricing was incorrect, where it said users would be charged based on input tokens.

## 2025-03-17

**Minor updates to the model schema for llama-3.2-1b-instruct, whisper-large-v3-turbo, llama-guard**

* [llama-3.2-1b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.2-1b-instruct/) - updated context window to the accurate 60,000
* [whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/whisper-large-v3-turbo/) - new hyperparameters available
* [llama-guard-3-8b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/) - the messages array must alternate between `user` and `assistant` to function correctly

## 2025-02-21

**Workers AI bug fixes**

* We fixed a bug where `max_tokens` defaults were not properly being respected - `max_tokens` now correctly defaults to `256` as displayed on the model pages. Users relying on the previous behaviour may observe this as a breaking change. If you want to generate more tokens, please set the `max_tokens` parameter to what you need.
* We updated model pages to show context windows - which is defined as the tokens used in the prompt + tokens used in the response. If your prompt + response tokens exceed the context window, the request will error. Please set `max_tokens` accordingly depending on your prompt length and the context window length to ensure a successful response.

**Deprecation announcement for \`@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8\`**

We will be deprecating `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8` on 2024-06-30.

Replace the model ID in your code with a new model of your choice:

* [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/) is the newest model in the Llama family (and is currently free for a limited time on Workers AI).
* [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq/) is the new Llama 3 in a similar precision to your currently selected model. This model is also currently free for a limited time.

If you do not switch to a different model by June 30th, we will automatically start returning inference from `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`.

## 2024-05-29

**Add new public LoRAs and note on LoRA routing**

* Added documentation on [new public LoRAs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/fine-tunes/public-loras/).

## 2024-04-11

**Add AI native binding**

* Added new AI native binding, you can now run models with `const resp = await env.AI.run(modelName, inputs)`
* Deprecated `@cloudflare/ai` npm package. While existing solutions using the @cloudflare/ai package will continue to work, no new Workers AI features will be supported. Moving to native AI bindings is highly recommended
