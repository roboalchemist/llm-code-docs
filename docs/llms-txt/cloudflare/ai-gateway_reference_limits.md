1 If you have reached 10 million logs stored per gateway, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must delete older logs in that gateway to free up space or create a new gateway. Refer to [Auto Log Cleanup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#auto-log-cleanup) for more details on how to automatically delete logs.

2 If you have reached 100,000 logs stored per account, across all gateways, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must delete older logs. Refer to [Auto Log Cleanup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#auto-log-cleanup) for more details on how to automatically delete logs.

3 Logs larger than 10 MB will not be stored.
