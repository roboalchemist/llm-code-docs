A MASQUE-based forward proxy that protects user privacy while preserving geolocation accuracy.

Enterprise-only

Privacy Proxy is a managed proxy service that runs on Cloudflare's global network. It uses the [MASQUE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/masque/about/) protocol suite to proxy TCP and UDP traffic via HTTP CONNECT and CONNECT-UDP methods over HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

Privacy Proxy separates user identity from user activity. Users authenticate to the proxy without revealing which destinations they visit, and destination servers see requests from Cloudflare IP addresses without learning who made them.

Privacy Proxy powers services like [Microsoft Edge Secure Network](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-now-powering-microsoft-edge-secure-network/) and serves as a second-hop relay for [iCloud Private Relay](https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/).

## Features

### Single-hop deployment

Deploy Privacy Proxy as a standalone proxy where Cloudflare handles authentication, proxying, and egress.

[Use Single-hop deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-proxy/concepts/deployment-models/#single-hop)

### Double-hop deployment

Operate your own first-hop proxy to authenticate users, then relay traffic through Cloudflare for additional privacy separation.

[Use Double-hop deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-proxy/concepts/deployment-models/#double-hop)

### Geolocation preservation

Maintain accurate geolocation for users without exposing their real IP addresses, ensuring location-relevant content and services work correctly.
