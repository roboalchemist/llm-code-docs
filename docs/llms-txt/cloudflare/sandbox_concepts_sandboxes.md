A sandbox is an isolated execution environment where your code runs. Each sandbox:

* Has a unique identifier (sandbox ID)
* Contains an isolated filesystem
* Runs in a dedicated Linux container
* Maintains state while the container is active
* Exists as a Cloudflare Durable Object

## Lifecycle states

### Creation

A sandbox is created the first time you reference its ID:

```typescript
const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "user-123");
await sandbox.exec('echo "Hello"'); // First request creates sandbox
```

### Active

The sandbox container is running and processing requests. All state remains available: files, running processes, shell sessions, and environment variables.

### Idle

After a period of inactivity (10 minutes by default, configurable via [`sleepAfter`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/configuration/sandbox-options/)), the container stops to free resources. When the next request arrives, a fresh container starts. All previous state is lost and the environment resets to its initial state.

**Note**: Containers with [`keepAlive: true`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/configuration/sandbox-options/#keepalive) never enter the idle state. They automatically send heartbeat pings every 30 seconds to prevent eviction.

### Destruction

Sandboxes are explicitly destroyed or automatically cleaned up:

```typescript
await sandbox.destroy();
// All files, processes, and state deleted permanently
```

## Container lifetime and state

Sandbox state exists only while the container is active. Understanding this is critical for building reliable applications.

**While the container is active** (typically minutes to hours of activity):

* Files written to `/workspace`, `/tmp`, `/home` remain available
* Background processes continue running
* Shell sessions maintain their working directory and environment
* Code interpreter contexts retain variables and imports

**When the container stops** (due to inactivity or explicit destruction):

* All files are deleted
* All processes terminate
* All shell state resets
* All code interpreter contexts are cleared

The next request creates a fresh container with a clean environment.

## Naming strategies

### Per-user sandboxes

```typescript
const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, `user-${userId}`);
```

User's work persists while actively using the sandbox. Good for interactive environments, playgrounds, and notebooks where users work continuously.

### Per-session sandboxes

```typescript
const sessionId = `session-${Date.now()}-${Math.random()}`;
const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, sessionId);
// Later:
await sandbox.destroy();
```

Fresh environment each time. Good for one-time execution, CI/CD, and isolated tests.

### Per-task sandboxes

```typescript
const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, `build-${repoName}-${commit}`);
```

Idempotent operations with clear task-to-sandbox mapping. Good for builds, pipelines, and background jobs.

## Request routing

The first request to a sandbox determines its geographic location. Subsequent requests route to the same location.

**For global apps**:

* Option 1: Multiple sandboxes per user with region suffix (`user-123-us`, `user-123-eu`)
* Option 2: Single sandbox per user (simpler, but some users see higher latency)

## Lifecycle management

### When to destroy

```typescript
try {
  const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, sessionId);
  await sandbox.exec("npm run build");
} finally {
  await sandbox.destroy(); // Clean up temporary sandboxes
}
```

**Destroy when**: Session ends, task completes, resources no longer needed

**Don't destroy**: Personal environments, long-running services

### Managing keepAlive containers

Containers with [`keepAlive: true`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/configuration/sandbox-options/#keepalive) require explicit management since they do not timeout automatically:

```typescript
const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'persistent-task', {
  keepAlive: true
});


// Later, when done with long-running work
await sandbox.setKeepAlive(false); // Allow normal timeout behavior
// Or explicitly destroy:
await sandbox.destroy();
```

### Handling container restarts

Containers restart after inactivity or failures. Design your application to handle state loss:

```typescript
// Check if required files exist before using them
const files = await sandbox.listFiles("/workspace");
if (!files.includes("data.json")) {
  // Reinitialize: container restarted and lost previous state
  await sandbox.writeFile("/workspace/data.json", initialData);
}


await sandbox.exec("python process.py");
```

## Version compatibility

The SDK automatically checks that your npm package version matches the Docker container image version. **Version mismatches can cause features to break or behave unexpectedly.**

**What happens**:

* On sandbox startup, the SDK queries the container's version
* If versions don't match, a warning is logged
* Some features may not work correctly if versions are incompatible

**When you might see warnings**:

* You updated the npm package (`npm install @cloudflare/sandbox@latest`) but forgot to update the `FROM` line in your Dockerfile

**How to fix**: Update your Dockerfile to match your npm package version. For example, if using `@cloudflare/sandbox@0.7.0`:

```dockerfile
# Default image (JavaScript/TypeScript)
FROM docker.io/cloudflare/sandbox:0.7.0


# Or Python image if you need Python support
FROM docker.io/cloudflare/sandbox:0.7.0-python
```

See [Dockerfile reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/configuration/dockerfile/) for details on image variants and extending the base image.

## Best practices

* **Name consistently** - Use clear, predictable naming schemes
* **Clean up temporary sandboxes** - Always destroy when done
* **Reuse long-lived sandboxes** - One per user is often sufficient
* **Batch operations** - Combine commands: `npm install && npm test && npm build`
* **Design for ephemeral state** - Containers restart after inactivity, losing all state
