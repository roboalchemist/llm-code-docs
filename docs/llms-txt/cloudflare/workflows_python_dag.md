The Python Workflows SDK supports DAG workflows in a declarative way, using the `step.do` decorator with the `depends` parameter to define dependencies (other steps that must complete before this step can run).

```python
from workers import Response, WorkflowEntrypoint


class PythonWorkflowStarter(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):
        async def await_step(fn):
            try:
                return await fn()
            except TypeError as e:
                print(f"Successfully caught {type(e).__name__}: {e}")


        await step.sleep('demo sleep', '10 seconds')


        @step.do('dependency1')
        async def dep_1():
            # does stuff
            print('executing dep1')


        @step.do('dependency2')
        async def dep_2():
            # does stuff
            print('executing dep2')


        @step.do('demo do', depends=[dep_1, dep_2], concurrent=True)
        async def final_step(res1, res2):
            # does stuff
            print('something')


        await await_step(final_step)


async def on_fetch(request, env):
    await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create()
    return Response("Hello world!")
```

On this example, `dep_1` and `dep_2` are run concurrently before execution of `final_step`, which depends on both of them.

Having `concurrent=True` allows the dependencies to be resolved concurrently. If one of the callables passed to `depends` has already completed, it will be skipped and its return value will be reused.

This pattern is useful for diamond shaped workflows, where a step depends on two or more other steps that can run concurrently.
