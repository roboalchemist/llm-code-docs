Learn how you can use Pages within your existing application and architecture.

## Demos

Explore the following demo applications for Pages.

* [Jobs At Conf:](https://github.com/harshil1712/jobs-at-conf-demo) A job lisiting website to add jobs you find at in-person conferences. Built with Cloudflare Pages, R2, D1, Queues, and Workers AI.
* [Upload Image to R2 starter:](https://github.com/harshil1712/nextjs-r2-demo) Upload images to Cloudflare R2 from a Next.js application.
* [Staff Directory demo:](https://github.com/lauragift21/staff-directory) Built using the powerful combination of HonoX for backend logic, Cloudflare Pages for fast and secure hosting, and Cloudflare D1 for seamless database management.
* [Wildebeest:](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest) Wildebeest is an ActivityPub and Mastodon-compatible server whose goal is to allow anyone to operate their Fediverse server and identity on their domain without needing to keep infrastructure, with minimal setup and maintenance, and running in minutes.
* [Multiplayer Doom Workers:](https://github.com/cloudflare/doom-workers) A WebAssembly Doom port with multiplayer support running on top of Cloudflare's global network using Workers, WebSockets, Pages, and Durable Objects.
* [Queues Web Crawler:](https://github.com/cloudflare/queues-web-crawler) An example use-case for Queues, a web crawler built on Browser Rendering and Puppeteer. The crawler finds the number of links to Cloudflare.com on the site, and archives a screenshot to Workers KV.
* [Pages Functions with WebAssembly:](https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-fns-with-wasm-demo) This is a demo application that exemplifies the use of Wasm module imports inside Pages Functions code.
