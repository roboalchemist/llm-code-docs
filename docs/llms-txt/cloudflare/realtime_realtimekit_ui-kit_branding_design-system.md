RealtimeKit's UI Kit provides all the necessary UI components to allow complete customization of all its UI Kit components. You can customize your brand colours, fonts, logo and more.

## Prerequisites

To get started with customizing the icons for your meetings, you need to first [integrate RealtimeKit's Web SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/) into your web application.

## Override Design System

The `provideRtkDesignSystem()` utility allows you to override the exisiting design system with your own custom design system.

### Installation

### Usage

## Design Tokens

UI Kit uses [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) for it's design system.

Design tokens are the design related values which are used to maintain a design system, which provides flexibility in customizing the overall design of a system with values such as: typography, spacing, colors etc.

These design tokens are stored and shared among components with the help of [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Cascading_variables/Using_custom_properties).

### Typography

You can tweak the font family used in your UI Kit components easily with this token. You can edit this value in two ways with the provideRtkDesignSystem utility.

```css
--rtk-font-family: Inter;
```

#### Usage

Set either of these values in your design tokens.

* With fontFamily - Use a custom font family, you'll have to load the font manually.
* With googleFont - Use a google font, the font is loaded automatically.

```javascript
const designTokens = {
  fontFamily: "Custom Font",
  // or
  googleFont: "A Google Font",
};
```

### Colours

CSS Variables are set in the format: `R G B`.

Here are all the color tokens, along with their default values.

```css
--rtk-colors-brand-500: 33 96 253;
--rtk-colors-background-1000: 8 8 8;
/_ ... rest of the shades _/
```

#### Usage

Note

Note the exception of `text` and `text-on-brand` colors, you only specify a single color even though there are the following shades: 1000 - 600.

This is because the `provideRtkDesignSystem()` utility sets the color you pass to text-1000 and calculates lighter shades and sets them as well.

Only pass objects for `brand` and `background` colors.

A set of commonly used `background` shades are available by default with the `theme` property.

Theme values are: `light`, `dark`, `darkest`.

Edit color tokens like this. Only the colors you specify will be set.

```javascript
const designTokens = {
  theme: "darkest",
  colors: {
    brand: { 500: "#0D51FD" },
    background: { 1000: "#080808" },
    text: "#ffffff",
    "text-on-primary": "#ffffff",
    "video-bg": "#181818",
  },
};
```

### Spacing

The spacing scale is used for setting width, height, margins, paddings, positions etc. throughout the components.

* The default value for the spacing scale base is 4px.
* Rest of the values are calculated with this base, set to `--rtk-space-1`.
* Current spacing scale ranges from 0 to 96.

```css
--rtk-space-1: 4px;
/* ... rest of the spacing scale */
```

#### Usage

Set the base of the spacing scale with `spacingBase` property.

```javascript
const designTokens = {
  spacingBase: 4, // value in px
};
```

### Borders

Border Width and Border Radius properties can also be customized with design tokens!

| Token Name | Values |
| - | - |
| `borderWidth` | `none`, `thin`, `fat` |
| `borderRadius` | `sharp`, `rounded`, `extra-rounded`, `circular` |

#### Usage

```javascript
const designTokens = {
  borderWidth: "thin",
  borderRadius: "rounded",
};
```
