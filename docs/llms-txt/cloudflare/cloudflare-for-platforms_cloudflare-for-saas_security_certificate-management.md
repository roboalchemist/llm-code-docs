title: Certificate management · Cloudflare for Platforms docs
description: Cloudflare for SaaS takes away the burden of certificate issuance
  and management from you, as the SaaS provider, by proxying traffic through
  Cloudflare's edge. You can choose between Cloudflare managing all the
  certificate issuance and renewals on your behalf, or maintain control over
  your TLS private keys by uploading your customers' own certificates.
