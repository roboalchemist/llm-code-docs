# Version History

> Learn how flow versioning works in Activepieces

Activepieces keeps track of all published flows and their versions. Here’s how it works:

1. You can edit a flow as many times as you want in **draft** mode.
2. Once you're done with your changes, you can publish it.
3. The published version will be locked and uneditable.
4. If you try to edit a published flow, Activepieces will create a new **draft** if there is none and copy the **published** version to the new version.

This means you can always go back to a previous version and edit the flow in draft mode without affecting the published version.
