* **🌐 Open Ecosystem:** All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, **60% of the pieces are contributed by the community**.

* **🛠️  Pieces are written in Typescript**: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including **hot reloading** for **local** piece development on your machine. 😎

* **🤖 AI-Ready**: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK to help you build flows inside the builder.

* **🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

* **🔒 Secure by Design**: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

* **🧠 Human in Loop**: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨

* **💻 Human Input Interfaces**: Built-in support for human input triggers like "Chat Interface" 💬 and "Form Interface" 📝
