# Vercel

> Deploy your Nuxt Application to Vercel infrastructure.

<tip>

**Zero Configuration ✨**

<br />

Integration with Vercel is possible with zero configuration, [learn more](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy#zero-config-providers).

</tip>

## Deploy using Git

1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will detect that you are using Nitro and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
4. Your application is deployed!

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#production-environment).

Learn more about Vercel’s [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/git).

## Custom Build Output Configuration

You can provide additional [build output configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api) using `nitro.vercel.config` key inside `nuxt.config.ts`. It will be merged with built-in auto generated config.
