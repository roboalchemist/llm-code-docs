> Deploy your Nuxt Application to Northflank infrastructure.

Nuxt supports deploying on [Northflank](https://www.northflank.com) with minimal configuration.

## Setup

1. Link your [Git provider](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/getting-started/link-your-git-account) and [create a new project](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/getting-started/create-a-project) in Northflank.
2. In your project, create a [Service](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/getting-started/build-and-deploy-your-code) and connect it to your Nuxt repository.
3. Ensure your package.json includes a start script that runs the Nuxt production server.

```json [package.json]
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node .output/server/index.mjs"
  }
}
```

1. Click "Create Service" to build and deploy your Nuxt app.
