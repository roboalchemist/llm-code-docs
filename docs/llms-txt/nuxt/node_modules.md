# node_modules

> The package manager stores the dependencies of your project in the node_modules/ directory.

The package manager ([`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm/) or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) or [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/cli/install) or [`bun`](https://bun.com/package-manager) or [`deno`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)) creates this directory to store the dependencies of your project.

<important>

This directory should be added to your [`.gitignore`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/gitignore) file to avoid pushing the dependencies to your repository.
