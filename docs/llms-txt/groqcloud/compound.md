Groq's Compound system integrates OpenAI's GPT-OSS 120B and Llama 4 models with external tools like web search and code execution. This allows applications to access real-time data and interact with external environments, providing more accurate and current responses than standalone LLMs. Instead of managing separate tools and APIs, Compound systems offer a unified interface that handles tool integration and orchestration, letting you focus on application logic rather than infrastructure complexity.

Rate limits for `groq/compound` are determined by the rate limits of the individual models that comprise them.

This system should not be used by customers for processing protected health information as it is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This system is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

### QUANTIZATION

This uses Groq's TruePoint Numerics, which reduces precision only in areas that don't affect accuracy, preserving quality while delivering significant speedup over traditional approaches. [Learn more here](https://groq.com/blog/inside-the-lpu-deconstructing-groq-speed).

### [Key Technical Specifications](#key-technical-specifications)

### Model Architecture

Compound is powered by [Llama 4 Scout](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct) and [GPT-OSS 120B](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b) for intelligent reasoning and tool use.

### Performance Metrics

Groq developed a new evaluation benchmark for measuring search capabilities called [RealtimeEval](https://github.com/groq/realtime-eval). This benchmark is designed to evaluate tool-using systems on current events and live data. On the benchmark, Compound outperformed GPT-4o-search-preview and GPT-4o-mini-search-preview significantly.

### Use Cases

Realtime Web Search

Automatically access up-to-date information from the web using the built-in web search tool.

Code Execution

Execute Python code automatically using the code execution tool powered by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/).

Code Generation and Technical Tasks

Create AI tools for code generation, debugging, and technical problem-solving with high-quality multilingual support.

### Best Practices

* Use system prompts to improve steerability and reduce false refusals. Compound is designed to be highly steerable with appropriate system prompts.
* Consider implementing system-level protections like Llama Guard for input filtering and response validation.
* Deploy with appropriate safeguards when working in specialized domains or with critical content.
* Compound should not be used by customers for processing protected health information. It is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum for customers at this time.
