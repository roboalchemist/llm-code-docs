# Groq Client Libraries

Groq provides both a Python and JavaScript/Typescript client library.

## [Groq Python Library](#groq-python-library)

The [Groq Python library](https://pypi.org/project/groq/) provides convenient access to the Groq REST API from any Python 3.7+ application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields, and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

### [Installation](#installation)

shell

```
pip install groq
```

### [Usage](#usage)

Use the library and your secret key to run:

Python

```
import os

from groq import Groq

client = Groq(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
        }
    ],
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument, we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to add `GROQ_API_KEY="My API Key"` to your `.env` file so that your API Key is not stored in source control.

These applications require immediate responses, and high latency can lead to a poor user experience.\n\n2.

Low latency LLMs can help businesses respond to customer inquiries more quickly, potentially leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.\n\n4.

This can be particularly important in industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, where quick decision-making can have a significant impact on business outcomes.\n\n5. Scalability: Low latency LLMs can handle a higher volume of requests, making them more scalable than high-latency models. This is particularly important for businesses that experience spikes in traffic or have a large user base.\n\nIn summary, low latency LLMs are essential for real-time applications, providing a better user experience, enabling quick decision-making, and improving scalability. As the demand for real-time NLP applications continues to grow, the importance of low latency LLMs will only become more critical."

## [Groq JavaScript Library](#groq-javascript-library)

The [Groq JavaScript library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/groq-sdk) provides convenient access to the Groq REST API from server-side TypeScript or JavaScript. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields, and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

### [Installation](#installation)

shell

```
npm install --save groq-sdk
```

### [Usage](#usage)

Use the library and your secret key to run:

JavaScript

```
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });

export async function main() {
  const chatCompletion = await getGroqChatCompletion();
  // Print the completion returned by the LLM.
  console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0]?.message?.content || "");
}

export async function getGroqChatCompletion() {
  return groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Explain the importance of fast language models",
      },
    ],
    model: "openai/gpt-oss-20b",
  });
