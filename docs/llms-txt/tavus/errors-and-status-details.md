| poor\_lighting                   | There was a quality issue with your replica. The user's face was not clearly visible due to poor lighting or heavy shadows. Please edit or record a new video with even lighting on your face, avoiding shadows or dim environments.                                             | Shadows and uneven lighting cause distortions during replica training. Please ensure the lighting is as even as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| teeth\_not\_visible              | There was a quality issue with your replica. The top and bottom teeth were not clearly visible during recording, either due to poor lighting or obstruction. Please edit your video or record a new training video with better lighting and ensure your teeth are fully visible. | A large smile at the beginning helps the training process capture your natural teeth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
