# Perception Tool Call Event

> This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

A perception tool call event is broadcasted by Tavus when a perception tool is triggered based on visual context. The event will contain the tool name, arguments, and encoded frames that triggered said tool call.

Perception tool calls can be used to trigger automated actions in response to visual cues detected by the Raven perception system.
