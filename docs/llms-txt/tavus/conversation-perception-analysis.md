# Perception Analysis Event

> This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

A perception analysis event is fired after ending a conversation, when the replica has finished summarizing what was visually observed throughout the call.

This is a feature that is only available when the persona has `raven-0` specified in the [perception layer](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/perception#end-of-call-perception-analysis).
