# Search

You can easily search anything on the Hub with **Full-text search**. We index model cards, dataset cards, and Spaces app.py files.

Go directly to https://huggingface.co/search or, using the search bar at the top of https://huggingface.co, you can select "Try Full-text search" to help find what you seek on the Hub across models, datasets, and Spaces:

## Filter with ease

By default, models, datasets, & spaces are being searched when a user enters a query. If one prefers, one can filter to search only models, datasets, or spaces.

Moreover, one can copy & share the URL from one's browser's address bar, which should contain the filter information as URL query. For example, when one searches for a query `llama` with a filter to show `Spaces` only, one gets URL https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=llama&type=space
