# GGUF usage with GPT4All

[GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/) is an open-source LLM application developed by [Nomic](https://nomic.ai/). Version 2.7.2 introduces a brand new, experimental feature called `Model Discovery`.

`Model Discovery` provides a built-in way to search for and download GGUF models from the Hub. To get started, open GPT4All and click `Download Models`. From here, you can use the search bar to find a model.

After you have selected and downloaded a model, you can go to `Settings` and provide an appropriate prompt template in the GPT4All format (`%1` and `%2` placeholders).

Then from the main page, you can select the model from the list of installed models and start a conversation.
