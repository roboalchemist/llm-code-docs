# Custom Benefit

> Create your own Custom benefit

You can add a simple, custom benefit, which allows you to attach a note to paying customers.

## **Custom Notes**

Secret message only customers can see, e.g [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) link, private email for support etc.

For custom integrations you can also distinguish benefits granted to customers to offer even more bespoke user benefits.
