## `webflow.getMediaQuery()`

Retrieves the current [breakpoint](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/intro-to-breakpoints?topics=layout-design) setting in the Designer.  Webflow's built-in responsive breakpoints - also known as media queries - allow users to customize site designs for different screen sizes. Knowing the current breakpoint can help your app build responsive content that's applicable to different screen sizes and contexts.

### Syntax

```typescript
webflow.getMediaQuery(): Promise<BreakpointId>
```

### Returns

**Promise\<*BreakpointID* >**:`"xxl" | "xl" | "large" | "main" | "medium" | "small" | "tiny"` - Identifier for the breakpoint size, also known as media query, in the designer.

A Promise that resolves to the value of the Breakpoint ID.

### Example

```typescript
const breakpointId = await webflow.getMediaQuery();

  switch (breakpointId) {
    case 'xxl':
      console.log("The current view is for very large screens or high-resolution monitors.");
      break;
    case 'xl':
      console.log("The current view is suitable for large desktop monitors.");
      break;
    case 'large':
      console.log("The current view fits standard desktop monitors.");
      break;
    case 'main':
      console.log("The current view is suitable for smaller desktops or large tablets.");
      break;
    case 'medium':
      console.log("The current view is suitable for tablets and some large phones.");
      break;
    case 'small':
      console.log("The current view is designed for larger mobile devices.");
      break;
    case 'tiny':
      console.log("The current view is for the smallest mobile devices.");
      break;
  }
}
```
