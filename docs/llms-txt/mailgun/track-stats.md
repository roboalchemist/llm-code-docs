# Stats

You can view stats aggregated by tag within the Analytics portion of the Mailgun UI. Additionally the [Stats API](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/api-reference/openapi-final/tag/Stats/) can provide this detail in your own application. You can also filter by tags in the [Reporting Dashboard](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402703701019-Reporting-Dashboard).
