# Domains

## Overview

When emails are sent, they are transmitted through domains over the internet. An email address has two main parts: the username and the domain (e.g., username@example.com).
Domains have a crucial role, as they are responsible for identification, routing and deliverability of email!

Within Mailgun, many features such as webhooks, logs, mailing lists and suppressions are associated with individual Domains.
