# Subaccounts Overview

Mailgunâs subaccount functionality allows account admins and developers the ability to create and manage a new Mailgun account that is linked to the primary account, but with wholly separate assets such as sending domains, IPs, API keys,  and if necessary, users.

From a billing and administrative standpoint, all usage on the subaccount level is tracked and rolled into the usage of the primary account. At this time subaccounts cannot be billed separately.
