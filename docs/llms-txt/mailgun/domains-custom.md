# Custom Domains

Creating custom domains in Mailgun enables you to send emails through your own domain instead of relying on the default sandbox domain. To use Mailgun for production, you must create and verify your custom domain(s) with Mailgun to ensure proper authentication and deliverability. Once you've acquired a domain through a DNS provider, follow these steps to set it up with Mailgun.

#### Add your domain:

1. Go to the **Mailgun Control Panel**
2. On the left side control panel, click **'Send'** then **'Sending'** to expand the sidebar, then click **'Domains'**
3. **Click** the **Add new domain** button from the upper right corner
4. **Enter** your domain name in the **Domain name** field
5. Select **Domain region**
6. **Choose** your **IP assignment option**
7. **Click** the **Add Domain** button


Once a domain has been added, you will receive an email that you will need to respond to so that it can be verified.
