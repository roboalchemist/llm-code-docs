# Recipient Engagement

In addition to processing bounces, complaints and unsubscribes, MBPs (Mailbox Providers)
measure your reputation through the engagement of your recipients. If
recipients are opening, forwarding and replying to your emails, it will
improve your reputation. This is what makes 'do-not-reply' emails so
offensive. At many MBPs, it is also helpful if recipients add your email
address to their address books.

Mailgun allows you to track opens and link clicks with our Tracking and
Tagging functionality (see our `user-manual`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more information). You are free to create up to 4,000
tags and use them simultaneously for A/B testing. In addition, Mailgun
is built to receive and parse emails efficiently. So there is no excuse
to not allow your recipients to reply to your emails. Email is not a
billboard - it is a conversant technology.
