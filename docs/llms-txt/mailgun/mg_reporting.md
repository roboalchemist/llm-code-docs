# Reporting Overview

## Reporting Dashboard

Mailgun's Reporting Dashboard provides a quick and easy way to view your sending metrics and reports. You can view reports on both a graphical and tabular representation. You also have the ability to export the tabular data to a CSV.

Note:
By default, the Reporting Dashboard displays the last 24 hours of data and does not load tabular data.
