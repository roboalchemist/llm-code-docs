# Sending Messages

Info
Since Mailgun does not host mailboxes, our service does not use the POP or IMAP protocols.

## How to Start Sending Messages

There are two ways to send messages using Mailgun that work great to support the same feature set.

- HTTP API
- SMTP


Choose the one you'd like to use based on your preferences and requirements.
