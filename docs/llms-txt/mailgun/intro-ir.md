# Mailgun Optimize User's Guide

## Introduction

This section documents the API endpoints that support features under the [Mailgun Optimize](https://www.mailgun.com/products/inbox/inboxready) (Formerly InboxReady) offering.

The Mailgun Optimize deliverability suite was built to be used seamlessly alongside Mailgun's email sending platform. As such, Mailgun and Mailgun Optimize share the same underlying API infrastructure, which includes authentication, REST conformity, and more. To understand the basics of the API or to get started, see this [Introduction](/docs/mailgun/api-reference/api-overview).
