# Kaggle

Kaggle is an online community for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and AI developers. Users can find and publish datasets, build models in a web-based data science environment, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

Important notes:

* Kaggle is more than just competitions; it also provides a vast collection of datasets, a cloud-based environment for data science called Notebooks, hubs for Models and Benchmarks, and a variety of courses.  
* The platform is gamified, with users able to earn performance-based rankings from Novice to Grandmaster.
