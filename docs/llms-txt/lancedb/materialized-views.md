# Materialized Views with UDFs

> Learn how to use Geneva's materialized view feature to declaratively manage batch updates of expensive operations using UDFs.

Geneva provides a materialized view feature that can be used to declaratively manage "batch" updates of expensive operations such as populating UDF columns. These updates are triggered via refresh operation. This can be used to optimize data layouts for training and to simplify some operations that traditionally may require external procedural orchestration (airflow, prefect, dagster).

> **Note**: This is similar to how traditional databases offer a materialized view feature to declaratively manage expensive aggregation and join operations.

## Process Overview

The process is straightforward:

1. Define a query on table, optionally including UDFs in the select clause.
2. Create the materialized view using `db.create_materialized_view(...)`.
3. Populate the new materialized view table using the `refresh` operation.

Just like with backfills, this operation is incremental, checkpointed, and run in a distributed manner.

## Example

Let's walk through an example using a raw video table as a base. We want to create a materialized view off the table that adds transcription columns to a subset of the values.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python icon="python" theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  from geneva import connect, udf
  import pyarrow as pa

  db = connect("/path/to/lancedb")
  schema = pa.schema([
      pa.field("video_id",   pa.int64(),            nullable=False),
      pa.field("video_uri",  pa.string(),           nullable=False),
      pa.field("upload_ts",  pa.timestamp("us"),    nullable=False),
      pa.field("metadata",   pa.json(),             nullable=True),
  ])
  raw_videos = db.create_table(
      "raw_videos",
      schema=schema,
      primary_key="video_id"
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Here's our UDFs, and the creation of a new empty materialized view.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python icon="python" theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  @udf
  def transcribe(video_uri) -> str:
    from whisper import load_model
    model = load_model("base")
    return model.transcribe(uri)["text"]

  @udf(data_type=pa.binary())
  def load_video(video_uri: pa.Array) -> pa.Array:
      videos = <expensive stuff>
      return ...

  q = raw_videos.search(None)
      .shuffle(seed=42)
      .select(
          {
              "video_uri": "video_uri",
              "video": load_video,
              "transcription": transcribe,
          }
      )

  view_table = db.create_materialized_view("table_view", q)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To populate the values, we call `refresh`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python icon="python" theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  # explicitly copy values from the source table, applying UDF on cols.
  db.refresh("table_view")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Note that the UDF is stored on the destination materialized view table.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python icon="python" theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  raw_table.add(...)
  db.refresh("table_view")  # only materialize new or modified rows.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The operation is incremental. So the next time refresh on the table is called, only new fragments with new data get materialized into the materialized view table.

Materialized views are just tables so you can query them as well as modify them by adding new `add_columns`, `backfill` particular columns and deriving other materialized views or views from them.

## FAQ

### Do we copy the UDFs from the source table?

No. The UDF does not but any UDF calculated values in the original table come to the materialized table via refresh. New columns defined by the UDFs in the materialized view creation are attached only to the materialized view. They can be backfilled (since the UDF belongs to the view) or refreshed.

### On MV refresh, do we force materialization of UDFs cols on the source table?

No. They are managed at the source table only. If it is null the null values are propagated. Future options may force materialization/backfill "recursively".
