LanceDB offers two main vector indexing algorithms: **Inverted File (IVF)** and **Hierarchically Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)**. You can create multiple vector indexes within a Lance table. This guide walks through common configurations and build patterns.

### Option 1: Self-Hosted Indexing

**Manual, Sync or Async:** If using LanceDB Open Source, you will have to build indexes manually, as well as reindex and tune indexing parameters. The Python SDK lets you do this *sychronously and asychronously*.

### Option 2: Automated Indexing

**Automatic and Async:** Indexing is automatic in LanceDB Cloud/Enterprise. As soon as data is updated, our system automates index optimization. *This is done asychronously*.

Here is what happens in the background - when a table contains a single vector column named `vector`, LanceDB automatically:

* Infers the vector column from the schema
* Creates an optimized `IVF_PQ` index without manual configuration
* The default distance is `l2` or euclidean

Finally, LanceDB Cloud/Enterprise will analyze your data distribution to **automatically configure indexing parameters**.

<Note title="Manual Index Creation">
  You can create a new index with different parameters using `create_index` - this replaces any existing index

  Although the `create_index` API returns immediately, the building of the vector index is asynchronous. To wait until all data is fully indexed, you can specify the `wait_timeout` parameter.
</Note>

## Example: Construct an IVF Index

In this example, we will create an index for a table containing 1536-dimensional vectors. The index will use IVF\_PQ with L2 distance, which is well-suited for high-dimensional vector search.

Make sure you have enough data in your table (at least a few thousand rows) for effective index training.

### Index Configuration

Sometimes you need to configure the index beyond default parameters:

* Index Types:
  * `IVF_PQ`: Default index type, optimized for high-dimensional vectors
  * `IVF_HNSW_SQ`: Combines IVF clustering with HNSW graph for improved search quality
* `metrics`: default is `l2`, other available are `cosine` or `dot`
  * When using `cosine` similarity, distances range from 0 (identical vectors) to 2 (maximally dissimilar)
* `num_partitions`: The number of partitions in the IVF portion of the index. This number is usually chosen to target a particular number of vectors per partition. A common heuristic is `num_rows / 8192`. Larger values generally make index building take longer but use less memory, and they often improve accuracy at the cost of slower search because queries typically need a higher `nprobes`. LanceDB automatically selects a sensible default `num_partitions` based on the heuristic mentioned above.
* `num_sub_vectors`: The number of sub-vectors that will be created during Product Quantization (PQ). This number is typically chosen based on the desired recall and the dimensionality of the vector. Larger `num_sub_vectors` increases accuracy but can significantly slow queries; a good starting point is `dimension / 8`.

Let's take a look at a sample request for an IVF index:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexConfigureIvf}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 1. Setup

Connect to LanceDB and open the table you want to index.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexSetup}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Construct an IVF Index

Create an `IVF_PQ` index with `cosine` similarity. Specify `vector_column_name` if you use multiple vector columns or non-default names. By default LanceDB uses Product Quantization; switch to `IVF_SQ` for scalar quantization.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexBuildIvf}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Query the IVF Index

Search using a random 1,536-dimensional embedding.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexQueryIvf}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

#### Search Configuration

The previous query uses:

* `limit`: number of results to return
* `nprobes`: number of IVF partitions to scan; covering roughly 5–10% of partitions often balances recall and latency
* `refine_factor`: reads additional candidates and reranks in memory
* `.to_pandas()`: converts the results to a pandas DataFrame

## Example: Construct an HNSW Index

### Index Configuration

There are three key parameters to set when constructing an HNSW index:

* `metric`: The default is `l2` euclidean distance metric. Other available are `dot` and `cosine`.
* `m`: The number of neighbors to select for each vector in the HNSW graph.
* `ef_construction`: The number of candidates to evaluate during the construction of the HNSW graph.

### 1. Construct an HNSW Index

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexBuildHnsw}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Query the HNSW Index

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexQueryHnsw}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

## Example: Construct a Binary Vector Index

Binary vectors are useful for hash-based retrieval, fingerprinting, or any scenario where data can be represented as bits.

### Index Configuration

* Store binary vectors as fixed-size binary data (uint8 arrays, with 8 bits per byte). For storage, pack binary vectors into bytes to save space.
* Index Type: `IVF_FLAT` is used for indexing binary vectors
* `metric`: the `hamming` distance is used for similarity search
* The dimension of binary vectors must be a multiple of 8. For example, a 128-dimensional vector is stored as a uint8 array of size 16.

### 1. Create Table and Schema

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexBinarySchema}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Generate and Add Data

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexBinaryAddData}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Construct the Binary Index

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexBinaryBuildIndex}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Vector Search

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexBinarySearch}
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

## Check Index Status

Vector index creation is fast - typically a few minutes for 1 million vectors with 1536 dimensions. You can check index status in two ways:

### Option 1: Check the UI

Navigate to your table page - the "Index" column shows index status. It remains blank if no index exists or if creation is in progress.

### Option 2: Use the API

Use `list_indices()` and `index_stats()` to check index status. The index name is formed by appending "\_idx" to the column name. Note that `list_indices()` only returns information after the index is fully built.
To wait until all data is fully indexed, you can specify the `wait_timeout` parameter on `create_index()` or call `wait_for_index()` on the table.

  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {VectorIndexCheckStatus}
