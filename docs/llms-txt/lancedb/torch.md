# PyTorch Integration

> Learn how to use LanceDB with PyTorch for training and inference.

LanceDB provides a seamless integration with PyTorch for training and inference. This allows you to use LanceDB as a backend for your PyTorch models, and to use PyTorch for training and inference. You can use LanceDB to store your data, and PyTorch to train your models.

## Quickstart

The `Table` class in LanceDB implements a contract for a PyTorch
[Dataset](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset).
This means you can simply use a LanceDB table in a PyTorch dataloader directly.

<CodeGroup>
  ```py Python icon=Python  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  import lancedb
  import torch
  import pyarrow as pa

  mem_db = lancedb.connect("memory://")
  table = mem_db.create_table("test_table", pa.table({"a": range(1000)}))

  # Any LanceDB table can be used as a PyTorch Dataset
  dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
      table, batch_size=1024, shuffle=True
  )

  for batch in dataloader:
      print(batch)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Although the `Table` class in LanceDB implements the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` interface, you'll most likely find that using
a table [Permutation](/training/) is more efficient for training.

## Selecting columns

By default, the `Table` class will return all columns in the table when used as input to PyTorch. If you only need
a subset of columns, you can significantly reduce your I/O requirements by selecting only the columns you need.

<CodeGroup>
  ```py Python icon=Python  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  from lancedb.permutation import Permutation

  permutation = Permutation.identity(table).select_columns(["id", "prompt"])
  dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
      permutation, batch_size=1024, shuffle=True
  )

  for batch in dataloader:
      print(batch.schema)
  ```
</CodeGroup>
