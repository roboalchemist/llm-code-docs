# Backfill Conflicts

> Learn how Geneva handles conflicts during backfill operations and what to do when they occur.

## Overview

Geneva backfills operate on a **point-in-time snapshot** of your table. When other operations modify the table during or between backfills, conflicts can occur. Geneva >=0.9.0 automatically handles most conflict scenarios, reducing unnecessary recomputation and enabling graceful recovery.

## Safe Operations During Backfill

These operations can safely run while a backfill is in progress:

| Operation                              | Why It's Safe                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `merge_insert` (Insert-only)           | Creates new fragments without modifying existing ones |
| `add()` / append data                  | Creates new fragments without modifying existing ones |
| Read operations (`search`, `to_arrow`) | Read-only, no fragment modification                   |
| Adding new columns                     | Schema change only, no fragment rewrite               |

## Operations That Cause Conflicts

These operations can conflict with running backfills:

| Operation                        | What Happens                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compact_files()` / `optimize()` | Reorganizes fragments, invalidating the backfill's snapshot |
| `merge_insert` with updates      | Modifies existing rows, causing fragment conflicts          |
| `delete()`                       | Modifies existing fragments                                 |

<Warning>
  When a conflict occurs, affected fragments fail gracefully. The backfill completes what it can, and you can re-run it to process the remaining rows.
</Warning>

## How Geneva Handles Conflicts

### Concurrent Backfills on Different Columns

When multiple backfills run on the same table but different columns, Geneva handles version conflicts automatically:

1. Each backfill writes to different column files (field IDs)
2. If a commit conflict occurs, Geneva retries at the latest version
3. The retry merges the new column data without overwriting other columns

This is controlled by the `GENEVA_VERSION_CONFLICT_MAX_RETRIES` environment variable (default: 10). See [Advanced Configuration](/geneva/udfs/advanced-configuration) for details.

### Compaction Between Backfills

When you run compaction between backfills (not during), Geneva handles it efficiently:

| Scenario                                         | Behavior                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backfill, compact, re-backfill (same UDF)        | Already-computed rows are skipped via `WHERE <col> IS NULL` |
| Partial backfill, compact, resume                | Incremental processing continues from where it left off     |
| Backfill, `alter_columns` (new UDF), re-backfill | Full reprocessing with new UDF (intentional)                |

<Note>
  Geneva's default behavior is to skip rows that already have values (`WHERE <col> IS NULL`). This means compaction doesn't cause unnecessary recomputation.
</Note>

## Recovery Steps

When a conflict occurs during a backfill:

1. **Wait** for any concurrent operations (compaction, updates) to complete
2. **Re-run** the backfill:
   ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
   tbl.backfill("column_name")
   ```
3. **Only uncomputed rows** will be processed (rows with NULL values in the target column)

Checkpoints from the previous run are preserved, so you won't lose progress on successfully computed rows.

## Best Practices

### Sequence Your Operations

For the smoothest experience, sequence your operations:

```
1. Complete all data ingestion
2. Run backfill to compute UDF columns
3. Run compaction/optimization
```

### Use Insert-Only Operations During Backfill

If you need to add data while a backfill is running, use insert-only operations:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
# Safe: INSERT-only merge_insert
tbl.merge_insert("id").when_not_matched_insert_all().execute(new_data)

# Unsafe: Updates to existing rows
tbl.merge_insert("id").when_matched_update_all().execute(data)  # May conflict
```

### Monitor Backfill Progress

Use async backfills to monitor progress and handle errors:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
fut = tbl.backfill_async("column_name")
while not fut.done():
    time.sleep(1)
# Check for errors before subsequent operations
result = fut.result()
```

### Disable Auto-Compaction During Large Backfills

If using LanceDB Cloud or Enterprise with auto-compaction enabled, consider disabling it during large backfill operations to avoid conflicts.
