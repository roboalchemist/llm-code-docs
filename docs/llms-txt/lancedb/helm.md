# Deploy Geneva using Helm

> Learn how to deploy Geneva on Kubernetes using the Geneva Helm Chart

<Tip>
  **Feature Engineering is deployed automatically in LanceDB Enterprise**

  In self-managed environments, Geneva can be installed into existing Kubernetes clusters using Helm. Please [contact LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/contact/) for access to the Helm Chart and related resources.
</Tip>

## Pre-requisites

* An existing Kubernetes cluster
* An existing node pool(s) for Geneva workloads. By default, Geneva uses node selector
  `{"geneva.lancedb.com/ray-head": "true"}` for Ray head nodes, and
  `{"geneva.lancedb.com/ray-worker-cpu": "true"}` and `{"geneva.lancedb.com/ray-worker-gpu": "true"}`
  for Ray CPU worker and Ray GPU worker nodes respectively. This can be overridden in the Geneva client.
* Geneva Helm chart. Please [contact LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/contact/) for access to the Helm Chart and related resources.

For more information on deploying the required cloud resources, see the [manual deployment instructions](/geneva/deployment/).

## Geneva Helm Chart

The Helm chart includes resources required for running [Geneva](https://lancedb.com/docs/geneva/) in Kubernetes.

It includes services, service accounts, RBAC roles, etc. that are used by the Geneva client to manage resources.

## Install

1. Authenticate with Kubernetes cluster, i.e. update kubeconfig
2. Configure Helm chart values

In values.yaml, configure the service account, node selectors, and cloud resources, if applicable.

```
geneva:
  # Object storage root URI
  rootUri:
    value: "s3://my-data-bucket"

  serviceAccount:
    # Service account for Geneva worker pods and services
    annotations:
      # Set per-CSP annotations to provide access to CSP resources, i.e.
      # eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::0123456789:role/geneva_service_role
      # iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: geneva-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

  gcp:
    # GCP service account email for the Geneva client.
    # It should have access to the GKS cluster and "roles/storage.objectUser"
    # permissions on the object storage bucket.
    # e.g., geneva-client-sa@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    clientServiceAccount: ""

  aws:
    # AWS IAM role ARN to be assumed by the Geneva client.
    # This role should have an access entry to the cluster with username matching the role ARN.
    # It should also have r/w access to the object storage bucket.
    # e.g., arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/geneva-client-role
    clientRoleArn: ""
```

3. Install kuberay operator

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
export NAMESPACE=geneva

helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/
helm repo update
helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator -n $NAMESPACE --create-namespace
```

4. Install NVIDIA device plugin (if using GPU nodes)

For GPU support, the NVIDIA device plugin must be installed in your EKS cluster:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.17.0/deployments/static/nvidia-device-plugin.yml > nvidia-device-plugin.yml
kubectl apply -f nvidia-device-plugin.yml
```

5. Install Geneva Helm chart

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
helm install geneva ./geneva -n $NAMESPACE --create-namespace
```
