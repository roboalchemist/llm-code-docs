# Building Custom Rerankers

> Learn how to create custom rerankers in LanceDB by extending the base Reranker class.

You can build your own custom reranker in LanceDB by subclassing the `Reranker` class and implementing the
`rerank_hybrid()` method. Optionally, you can also implement the `rerank_vector()` and `rerank_fts()`
methods if you want to support reranking for vector and FTS search separately.

## Interface

The `Reranker` base interface comes with a `merge_results()` method that can be used to combine the
results of semantic and full-text search. This is a vanilla merging algorithm that simply concatenates
the results and removes the duplicates without taking the scores into consideration. It only keeps the
first copy of the row encountered. This works well in cases that don't require the scores of semantic
and full-text search to combine the results. If you want to use the scores or want to support
`return_score="all"`, you'll need to implement your own merging algorithm.

Below, we show the pseudocode of a custom reranker that combines the results of semantic and full-text
search using a linear combination of the scores:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python icon="python" theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  from lancedb.rerankers import Reranker
  import pyarrow as pa

  class MyReranker(Reranker):
      def __init__(self, param1, param2, ..., return_score="relevance"):
          super().__init__(return_score)
          self.param1 = param1
          self.param2 = param2

      def rerank_hybrid(self, query: str, vector_results: pa.Table, fts_results: pa.Table):
          # Use the built-in merging function
          combined_result = self.merge_results(vector_results, fts_results)

          # Do something with the combined results
          # ...

          # Return the combined results
          return combined_result

      def rerank_vector(self, query: str, vector_results: pa.Table):
          # Do something with the vector results
          # ...

          # Return the vector results
          return vector_results

      def rerank_fts(self, query: str, fts_results: pa.Table):
          # Do something with the FTS results
          # ...

          # Return the FTS results
          return fts_results
  ```

## Example

As an example, let's build custom reranker that enhances the Cohere Reranker by accepting a filter
query, and accepts any other `CohereReranker` params as `kwargs`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python icon="python" theme={"theme":{"light":"vitesse-light","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  from typing import List, Union
  import pandas as pd
  from lancedb.rerankers import CohereReranker

  class ModifiedCohereReranker(CohereReranker):
      def __init__(self, filters: Union[str, List[str]], **kwargs):
          super().__init__(**kwargs)
          filters = filters if isinstance(filters, list) else [filters]
          self.filters = filters

      def rerank_hybrid(self, query: str, vector_results: pa.Table, fts_results: pa.Table)-> pa.Table:
          combined_result = super().rerank_hybrid(query, vector_results, fts_results)
          df = combined_result.to_pandas()
          for filter in self.filters:
              df = df.query("not text.str.contains(@filter)")

          return pa.Table.from_pandas(df)

      def rerank_vector(self, query: str, vector_results: pa.Table)-> pa.Table:
          vector_results = super().rerank_vector(query, vector_results)
          df = vector_results.to_pandas()
          for filter in self.filters:
              df = df.query("not text.str.contains(@filter)")

          return pa.Table.from_pandas(df)

      def rerank_fts(self, query: str, fts_results: pa.Table)-> pa.Table:
          fts_results = super().rerank_fts(query, fts_results)
          df = fts_results.to_pandas()
          for filter in self.filters:
              df = df.query("not text.str.contains(@filter)")

          return pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
  ```

<Card icon="lightbulb">
  Under the hood, `vector_results` and `fts_results` are PyArrow tables. You can learn more about
  PyArrow tables [here](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python). The advantage of PyArrow tables is their
  interoperability -- you can easily convert them to Pandas/Polars DataFrames, `PyDict`, `PyList`, etc.

  The benefits are also bidirectional -- just as you can easily convert PyArrow tables *to* Pandas
  DataFrames using the `to_pandas()` method -- you can perform DataFrame transformations
  and just as easily convert the DataFrame back to PyArrow tables using `pa.Table.from_pandas()` method
  as shown in the example above.
