# POST /resume

> Resume crew execution with human feedback



## OpenAPI

````yaml enterprise-api.en.yaml post /resume
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: CrewAI AMP API
  description: >
    REST API for interacting with your deployed CrewAI crews on CrewAI AMP.


    ## Getting Started


    1. **Find your crew URL**: Get your unique crew URL from the CrewAI AMP
    dashboard

    2. **Copy examples**: Use the code examples from each endpoint page as
    templates

    3. **Replace placeholders**: Update URLs and tokens with your actual values

    4. **Test with your tools**: Use cURL, Postman, or your preferred API client


    ## Authentication


    All API requests require a bearer token for authentication. There are two
    types of tokens:


    - **Bearer Token**: Organization-level token for full crew operations

    - **User Bearer Token**: User-scoped token for individual access with
    limited permissions


    You can find your bearer tokens in the Status tab of your crew's detail page
    in the CrewAI AMP dashboard.


    ## Reference Documentation


    This documentation provides comprehensive examples for each endpoint:


    - **Request formats** with all required and optional parameters

    - **Response examples** for success and error scenarios

    - **Code samples** in multiple programming languages

    - **Authentication patterns** with proper Bearer token usage


    Copy the examples and customize them with your actual crew URL and
    authentication tokens.


    ## Workflow


    1. **Discover inputs** using `GET /inputs`

    2. **Start execution** using `POST /kickoff`

    3. **Monitor progress** using `GET /{kickoff_id}/status`

      summary: Resume Crew Execution with Human Feedback
      description: >
        **📋 Reference Example Only** - *This shows the request format. To test
        with your actual crew, copy the cURL example and replace the URL + token
        with your real values.*


        Resume a paused crew execution with human feedback for Human-in-the-Loop
        (HITL) workflows.

        When a task with `human_input=True` completes, the crew execution pauses
        and waits for human feedback.


        **IMPORTANT**: You must provide the same webhook URLs (`taskWebhookUrl`,
        `stepWebhookUrl`, `crewWebhookUrl`)

        that were used in the original kickoff call. Webhook configurations are
        NOT automatically carried over -

        they must be explicitly provided in the resume request to continue
        receiving notifications.

        Use your actual Bearer Token or User Bearer Token from the CrewAI AMP
        dashboard for real API calls.


        **Bearer Token**: Organization-level access for full crew operations

        **User Bearer Token**: User-scoped access with limited permissions
