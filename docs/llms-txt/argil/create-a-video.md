> You can create a video from scratch or start with one of your templates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick your avatar">
    Chose among our public avatars (horizontal and vertical format) and using the different tags.  You can chose among normal or pro avatars\* (available on the pro plan). And of course, you can pick your own!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your script or prompt">
    Two ways of entering info:

    * write a script or prompt
    * upload an audio or directly record yourself talking on the app
  </Step>

  <Step title="Magic editing: pick your options" stepNumber={3}>
    You can chose your voice, toggle captions, [pick a B-rolls type](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/brolls) and layouts ([doc here](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/layouts)). You can pick a background music to have a pre-edited video rapidly. \
    And you can modify all of those in the studio.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview and edit your video">
    You can press the “Play” button to preview the video. You can edit your script, B-rolls, captions, background, voice, music and body language.\
    **Note that lipsync hasn’t been generated yet. That's why the image remains still.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate the video">
    This is when you spend some of your credits to generate the lipsync of the avatar. This process takes between 5 and 15 minutes depending on the length of the video and your plan. Pro plans have a faster generation time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ:

* \*Pro avatars are higher quality and usually offer more diversity in the scenes.
* The maximum for video duration is 60 paragraphs and each one has a limit of 500 characters. If you maximize everything, you can get to 10 to 15 minutes depending on the avatar talking speed.
* You can edit your script or cut it without having to regenerate it
* Choosing dynamic splitting will allow you to create more paragphs.
