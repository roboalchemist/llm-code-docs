> Some tips regarding a good editing and improving the quality of the video results

Editing will transform a boring video into a really engaging one. Thankfully, you can use our many features to **very quickly** make a video more engaging.

<Tip>
  Cutting your sentences in 2 paragraphs and playing with zooms & B-rolls is the easiest way to add dynamism to your video - and increase engagement metrics
</Tip>

### Use zooms wisely

Zooms add heavy emphasis to anything you say. We <u>advise to cut your sentences in 2 to add zooms</u>. Think of it as the video version of adding underlining or bold to a part of your sentence to make it more impactful.

Instead of this:

```
And at the end of his conquest, he was named king
```

Prefer a much more dynamic and heavy

```
And at the end of his conquest
[zoom in] He was named king
```

### Make shorter clips

In the TikTok era, we are used to dynamic editing - an avatar speaking for 20 seconds with nothing else on screen will have the viewer bored.

Prefer <u>cutting your scripts in short sentences</u>, or even cutting the sentences in 2 to add a zoom, a camera angles or a B-roll.

### Add more B-rolls

B-rolls and media will enrich the purpose of your video - thankfully, <u>you don't need to prompt to add a B-roll</u> on Argil. Simply click the "shuffle" button to rotate until you find a good one.

<Note>
  B-rolls will take the length of the clip you append it to. If it is too long, toggle the "1/2" button on it to make it shorter
