# Motion Control

> Transfer real movements from a video to your avatar

Extract body movements from any reference video and apply them to your static avatar photo. Perfect for dance content, expressive presentations, and recreating trending videos.

## How it works

1. **Import motion video** — Upload a video of someone moving or dancing
2. **Upload avatar photo** — Static image of your avatar (full body recommended)
3. **Generate** — System extracts movements and applies them to your avatar

## What gets transferred

* ✓ Body position and gestures
* ✓ Arm movements
* ✓ Head motion
* ✓ Walking and dancing
* ✗ Voice/audio (add separately)
* ✗ Hand finger details (approximate)

## Tips

* Use well-lit motion videos with full body visible
* Stable camera, single person in frame
* Match avatar starting pose roughly to motion video
* Smooth movements transfer better than jerky ones
