  ### What is a good voice dataset?

  * no moments of silence
  * keep the tone and energy you would want your avatar to have, you can exagerate a little if needed

## Voice creation when creating an avatar

If you are creating an avatar, you will be presented with three options: - **select a voice :** which is from your own library, from the voices you already have

* **create my voice:** upload any audio file of yourself talking
* **generate my voice:** pick among three voices created for you according to the person we see on your image

<Tip>
  Don't hesitate to edit your voices in the "voices" section in order to increase the speed to 1.05 or 1.1. This can make all of your videos more entertaining.
