# Product Interaction

> Show your avatar physically holding and using products

## How it works

1. **Upload your product** — Drop image in the Product zone (controller, phone, bottle, etc.)
2. **Select your avatar** — Drop in the Avatar zone (full body works best)
3. **Describe the interaction** — E.g., "Avatar holding the controller and pressing buttons"
4. **Generate** — AI creates realistic product manipulation

## vs Product Presentation

| Flow                    | Avatar behavior                               |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Product Presentation    | Speaks about product, makes a video out of it |
| **Product Interaction** | Physically holds and uses product             |

## Tips

* Use avatars with visible hands and arms
* Small, hand-held products work best
* Keep interactions simple (holding, showing, using)
* Remove product background for cleaner results
