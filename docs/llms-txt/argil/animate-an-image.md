# Animate An Image

> Turn a single image into a short video with first and last frame

Bring any static image to life with AI-generated motion. Define start and end frames, describe the animation you want, and generate dynamic video content in seconds.

## How it works

1. **Upload your first frame** — Drop your starting image (or pick a sample)
2. **Upload your last frame** (optional) — Drop your ending image to guide the animation direction
3. **Write your prompt** — Describe what you want to see (e.g., "Camera slowly zooms in, leaves blowing in the wind")
4. **Generate video** — Choose your model and render

## Available models

| Model        | Style                     |
| :----------- | :------------------------ |
| Sora 2       | Cinematic, photorealistic |
| VEO 3.1      | Versatile, natural motion |
| Seedance 1.5 | Stylized, artistic        |

## Settings

* **Duration** — 8s shot by default
* **Aspect ratio** — 9:16 (vertical), 16:9 (horizontal), 1:1 (square)
* **Sound** — Toggle on/off

## Tips

* Use high-quality images for better results
* Last frame is optional but helps guide motion direction
* Keep prompts simple and focused on one type of movement
* Add assets via "+ Add assets" to reference specific elements in your prompt
