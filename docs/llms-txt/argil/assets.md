# Assets

> How do assets work, what type of files can be uploaded

If you are using the same images or videos quite often, uploading them to the asset section is the best way to have them all stored at the same place.

### How do I add an image or a video to the assets?

You can either:

a) Go in the asset section on the left panel then "Upload" directly\
b) Go into create a video then "Upload media" in the next tab\
c) If you are editing a video in the studio, all the images and videos that you upload there will be stored in the assets section.
