# Public avatars and pro avatars

> What is the difference between normal public and pro avatars. 

**Public Avatars (Stock Avatars)**

Public avatars are pre-trained characters, ready to use, ideal for getting started quickly without having to film a training video. You can use a range of tags to get the avatars that you like the best (age, accessories, etc.).

**Included in the free plan:** Access to basic avatars to test the platform.

**Pro Avatars (Custom Avatars)**

Pro avatars are some of the best looking avatar on the platform. They benefit from Pro voices that are already attached to them as well. \
These are only available on the Pro plan.
