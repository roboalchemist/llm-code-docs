# Deleting your account

> How to delete your account

<Warning>
  Deleting your account will delete **all projects, videos, drafts, and avatars you have trained**. If you create a new account, you will have to **use up a new avatar training** to train every avatar.
</Warning>

If you are 100% sure that you want to delete your account and never come back to your avatars & videos in the future, please contact us at [support@argil.ai](mailto:support@argil.ai) and mention your account email address. We will delete it in the next 720 days.
