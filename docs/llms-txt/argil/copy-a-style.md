# Copy the style of an image

> Transform any visual into your AI Avatar setup (clothes, background, etc.)

Copy Style from Image lets you recreate any visual style from any image, screenshot, or reference while keeping your avatar's face and identity intact.

The AI extracts visual elements (background, clothing, lighting, composition) from your reference image and applies them to your chosen avatar, preserving facial identity while transforming everything else.

## How It Works

Select your avatar, provide a style reference, and the AI analyzes the background, clothing, lighting, and composition. Your avatar is then placed into this reconstructed scene, maintaining facial consistency while adopting all visual characteristics from your reference.

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Select the avatar you want to use, your own or any from Argil's public library.

**Step 2:** Choose your style reference by uploading any image or browsing the 100+ pre-made setups in Argil's style library.

### Accepted References

Movie screenshots, social media content, professional photography, artwork, stock photos, personal photos. Any image, any format, any source.

### Tips for Best Results

Use high-quality, well-lit images with distinct visual elements. Horizontal images with centered subjects work best for video format.
