### For videos:

| Feature                           | Unit      | Cost in credit |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Video (Atom model)\*              | 1 min     | 140            |
| Voice                             | 1 min     | 20             |
| B-roll images                     | 1 B-rolls | 10             |
| B-roll videos                     | 1 B-roll  | 20             |
| Royalties (Argil v1 avatars only) | 1 vidéos  | 20             |

If you do a 30 sec video with 2 video B-rolls with one of our licenced avatars that are NOT v1, you will pay:

40 (2 video B-rolls) + 10 (30sec of talking avatar) + 70 (30sec of Atom model) = 120 credits

\*For legacy users (before 20th of october 2025): Argil v1 costs 60 credits for 3 minutes
