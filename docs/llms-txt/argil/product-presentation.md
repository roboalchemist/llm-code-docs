# Product Presentation

> Create videos with an avatar presenting your product

Generate professional product videos where an AI avatar talks about your product. Choose between a scripted approach with Atom or creative prompt-driven scenes with VEO.

## How it works

1. **Upload your product image** — Clear photo, no background works best
2. **Select your avatar** — Pick from the library or use your own
3. **Add your content** — Write a script (Atom) or a creative prompt (VEO)
4. **Generate** — Choose your model and render

## Atom vs VEO

| Model   | Input           | Avatar behavior                    |
| :------ | :-------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Atom    | Text script     | Speaks exactly what you write      |
| VEO 3.1 | Creative prompt | Interacts dynamically with product |

## Prompt example (VEO)

```
Avatar holding @Product and promoting its hand-made craft, with @Image as video background
```

Use `@Product` and `@Image` tags to reference your uploaded assets.

## Tips

* Atom for clear, controlled messaging
* VEO for dynamic scenes and visual storytelling
* Remove product background for cleaner compositing
* Keep scripts under 2 minutes for best results
