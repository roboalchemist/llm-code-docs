## Encryption of sensitive data and communication

All data is encrypted in transit, through all layers of our application and processing. Typically this is [TLS1.2+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) but supporting TLS1.1 for compatibility.

All data is encrypted at rest. This is a combination of [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and AWS-based [KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) for packages, and [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) based (plus others) for "sensitive data" in relational data.

Encryption keys are either [HSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) (Hardware Security Module), KMS (Key Management Service) or via environment (symmetric with rotations) depending on what's been accessed. Rotation is handled internally.

## Vulnerability disclosure and Bug Bounty program

Security issues are considered a higher priority than all other issues, and the team will investigate and respond to any reported vulnerability in scope. We request that you do not publicly disclose the issue until it has been identified and resolved by Cloudsmith.

We understand the hard work and knowledge required to identify viable security issues. We offer a reward program for responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities in scope to show our appreciation.
