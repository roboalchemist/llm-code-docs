How to export packages from JFrog Artifactory

Migrating from JFrog Artifactory requires you to migrate hosted repositories only, since any proxy repositories configured in Artifactory can just be set up with the same configuration in Cloudsmith Repository Manager, and all data will be retrieved from the upstream repositories again. All the upstream repositories supported by Cloudsmith are listed [here](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upstream-proxying-caching).

Hosted repositories will have to be migrated from Artifactory to Cloudsmith.

To migrate from JFrog Artifactory cloud or a JFrog Artifactory cluster you will be required to have access to Artifactory.

## Exporting via Artifactorys UI

You can use the import/export feature of Artifactory and migrate one hosted repository after another. Please consult the Artifactory [documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Import+and+Export) for step-by-step instructions on how to export a repository.

## Exporting via the CLI

Exporting via JFrogs CLI can provide more control over how and what you export. Below are some instructions on how to conduct your export.

### Install jfrog-cli

All the information about installing jfrog-cli can be found [here](https://jfrog.com/getcli/).\
It can be installed on Linux, Mac, or Windows.

### Configure jfrog-cli

Log into jfrog-cli with your Artifactory credentials

```shell
jfrog config add                                                               
Server ID: server_name
JFrog platform URL: https://server_name.jfrog.io/
JFrog access token (Leave blank for username and password/API key): 
JFrog username: artifactory_user
JFrog password or API key: 
Is the Artifactory reverse proxy configured to accept a client certificate? (y/n)
```

### Download your packages from Artifactory

The `jfrog rt dl` command can be used to download all packages from Artifactory.

To get all artifacts from all repos in Artifactory do the following:

```shell
jfrog rt dl "*/*"
```

The following examples use the `--flat` option to dump all the packages into the same folder.

> 📘 NOTE
>
> Be careful that the use of the *--flat* option doesn't cause issues due to packages with the same name in different repositories.

To get all packages from a particular repository called REPO

```shell
jfrog rt dl REPO --flat
```

The command below shows you how to just get a particular package type from all repositories, using .tgz as an example

```shell
jfrog rt dl "*/*.tgz" --flat
```
