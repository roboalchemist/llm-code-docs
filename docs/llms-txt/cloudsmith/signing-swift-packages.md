## How it works

Swift packages are signed using an ECDSA private key and X.509 Certificate combination, with the certificate containing the private key’s corresponding public key. When Swift package signing is enabled for a repository, an ECDSA key pair and X.509 certificate are created, and all Swift packages uploaded or resynchronized to the repository will be signed automatically.

## Note on signing existing packages

> ⚠️ Signing of existing packages
>
> Signing a Swift package mutates it's state, and may cause builds employing the package as a dependency to break. This can be rectified by removing the stored fingerprint(s) for the relevant manifest and source archive.

Signing a Swift package mutates the package's state, as package manifest signatures are added to the manifest files themselves, modifying the checksum of the overall source archive. As Swift performs [checksum Trust On First Use](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/PackageRegistryUsage.md#checksum-tofu) (TOFU), signing Swift package may cause builds to break where those packages have already been consumed locally as dependencies.

Consequently,  to sign packages already used as dependencies, the stored fingerprint(s) for the relevant manifest and source archive must be removed. These can be viewed and modified in the `~/.swiftpm/security/fingerprint` directory.

## Configuring the Swift CLI to verify packages

When the Swift CLI consumes a signed package, it validates the signature for both the manifest and the source archive. These signatures are in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) format, and are base64 encoded. The signatures vary slightly:

* A manifest signature is an attached signature; it is included directly within the manifest file ([see here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/PackageRegistryUsage.md#package-manifests) for example).
* A source archive signature is a detached signature; it is included within the metadata response when fetching a package for a specific scope/name/version. Swift determines whether the package is signed by inspecting the signing attribute in the metadata response. For more information [see here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/Registry.md).

The source archive signature is generated after the manifest(s) is signed.

The Swift CLI registry security configuration is specified at the user level in a `registries.json` file. For more information on this configuration [see here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/PackageRegistryUsage.md#security-configuration).

### Adding a Trusted Certificate

A certificate is trusted by Swift if it is chained to any root in SwiftPM’s trusted store (which can be in two locations). To ensure that the certificate used by Cloudsmith to sign Swift your packages is trusted you’ll need to perform the following steps, which will fetch the intermediate CA certificate used to sign the repository-level certificate, and place it in Swift’s default trust store.

1. Fetch the certificate chain for the signing certificate and assign it to a variable. The chain contains both the root CA certificate and intermediate CA certificate (it does not include the actual signing certificate):

```
CERTIFICATE_CHAIN="$(curl --location '<https://api.cloudsmith.io/repos/<org-name>/<repo-name>/x509-ecdsa/' \\
--header 'Accept: application/json' \\
--header 'X-Api-Key: <api-key>' \\ | jq -r .certificate_chain)"
```

2. Write the chain to a `.pem` file.

```
echo $CERTIFICATE_CHAIN >> cert_chain.pem
```

3. Swift requires that the certificate be in `.der` (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format. To do that, convert the `.pem` file to `.der`. Note that a certificate chain can’t be represented in the DER format, however only the intermediate CA certificate is required. The can be achieved by the following:

```
openssl x509 -in cert_chain.pem -out cert.der -outform DER
```

4. Now place this trusted certificate in the following path: `~/.swiftpm/security/trusted-root-certs/`.
5. Add the `trustedRootCertificatesPath` to your security configuration, as shown [here](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/PackageRegistryUsage.md#security-configuration). Confusingly, the CLI doesn’t seem to like the relative path in the example shown, so you might have to change it to an absolute path.

Once the above steps are complete, you will be able to consume fully verifiable and signed swift packages from Cloudsmith.
