How to integrate CircleCI with Cloudsmith

<Image align="center" width="100%" src="https://files.readme.io/2d14e11-cloudsmith-circleci-partner-banner.png" />

Cloudsmith provides first-class support for CircleCI with our official [orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/cloudsmith/cloudsmith). Using the orb, users can easily integrate publishing to Cloudsmith with their existing CircleCI workflows.

Full reference documentation for the orb can be found on the [CircleCI website](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/cloudsmith/cloudsmith). This documentation is automatically generated from the orb itself and so is guaranteed to always be up to date with the latest release of the orb.

      The Cloudsmith CLI gives you full control when connecting to any CI/CD process; allowing you to upload any of our support formats or query your repositories. Just configure your API Key, install the CLI, and you'll be all set.

## Orb usage example

To use the orb you must first ensure you are using Circle version 2.1. At the top of your `.circleci/config.yml` file you should add:

```yaml
version: 2.1
```

And then include the orb:

```yaml
orbs:
  cloudsmith: cloudsmith/cloudsmith@1.0.6
```

Note that you can check the [releases page on github](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/orb/releases) for our orb, [or the orb page](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/cloudsmith/cloudsmith) on CircleCI itself to find the latest version to use.

You'll need to configure authentication credentials for the orb if you're not planning to use OIDC to authenticate with. To do so, you can add an environment variable named `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY` within the CircleCI settings page for your project:

![](https://files.readme.io/c3ed739-Screen_Shot_2019-07-22_at_14.49.16.png "Screen Shot 2019-07-22 at 14.49.16.png")

The orb (for now) requires that you have already built the package you wish to publish. Assuming you're publishing a Python library (though the same process applies to any package type), you'll want to run `setup.py sdist` as a step in your job:

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Build Python package
          command: python setup.py sdist

workflows:
  cloudsmith_publish:
    jobs:
      - publish
```

Once built, we can use the orb to easily publish the package. The orb provides a number of commands to make this process simpler. We'll first ensure the Cloudsmith CLi is configured and installed, then after we've built the package, publish it:

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7
    steps:
      - checkout
      - cloudsmith/ensure-api-key
      - cloudsmith/install-cli
      - run:
          name: Build Python package
          command: python setup.py sdist
      - cloudsmith/publish:
          cloudsmith-repository: myorg/myrepo
          package-path: dist/package-*.tar.gz
          package-format: python
```

If using OIDC for authentication, ensure you're using at least version `1.0.6` of the Cloudsmith orb and add an extra step calling `authenticate-with-oidc` e.g.

```
...
jobs:
  publish:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7
    steps:
      - checkout
      - cloudsmith/authenticate-with-oidc:
          organization: <organization slug>
          service-account: <service account slug>
      - cloudsmith/ensure-api-key
...
```

Putting this all together, we end up with a `.circleci/config.yaml` file which looks like so:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  cloudsmith: cloudsmith/cloudsmith@1.0.4

jobs:
  publish:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7
    steps:
      - checkout
      - cloudsmith/ensure-api-key
      - cloudsmith/install-cli
      - run:
          name: Build Python package
          command: python setup.py sdist
      - cloudsmith/publish:
          cloudsmith-repository: myorg/myrepo
          package-path: dist/package-*.tar.gz
          package-format: python

workflows:
  cloudsmith_publish:
    jobs:
      - publish
```

## Manual integration

Our official Orb provides simple integration for the majority of standard CI usecases, but we know that it won't fit every purpose. For additional flexibility users can mix and match commands provided by the orb and/or use the Cloudsmith CLI directly.

For example, to use the orb to install and configure the CLI, but then use the CLI directly to publish to Cloudsmith, your configuration might look like so:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  cloudsmith: cloudsmith/cloudsmith@1.0.4

jobs:
  publish:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7
    steps:
      - checkout
      - cloudsmith/ensure-api-key
      - cloudsmith/install-cli
      - run:
          name: Build Python package
          command: python setup.py bdist_wheel
      - run:
          name: Publish Python package
          command: cloudsmith push python myorg/myrepo dist/my-package-0.1.0.whl

workflows:
  cloudsmith_publish:
    jobs:
      - publish
```
