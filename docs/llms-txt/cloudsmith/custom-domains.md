# Custom Domains

## About custom domains

Your company brand and trust are important to you and your customers, and with custom domains you can present your own company as the endpoint for distribution, APIs, and configuration (e.g. retrieving GPG keys).

This is a great idea if you are -

* A vendor that is selling and distributing software to your customers
* A security-conscious DevOps team that is looking to control the source endpoint for artifacts

Custom domains are available with our Velocity and Ultra plans. We strongly recommend - and may require - custom domains for any customer with significant Cloudsmith package delivery traffic.

## Configuration Options

### Account-wide vs per-repository

An **account-wide** (also called organizational-level) custom domain works across all repositories in your Cloudsmith organization. When using an account-wide custom domain, the organization/account identifier (slug) will be removed from the URI for a repository.

A **per-repository** custom domain works for a single repository in your Cloudsmith organization. When using a per-repository custom domain, the organization/account identifier (slug) and the repository identifier are both removed from the URI for the repository.

### Package support (Download vs Native API)

For API-based (Native) package formats, such as NuGet, Docker, Cargo, npm, Conan, Conda and Terraform, you can have a specific custom domain, such as *docker.yourdomain.com*, *npm.yourdomain.com* or *cargo.yourdomain.com*.

For other package formats, and downloads in general, you can have a custom domain such as *dl.yourdomain.com*.

It is possible to have multiple download domains for a package type, however, all of them will be accessible through each other, for example, if we set up a general `Downloads` domain for raw packages and a `Debian` domain (which is also Download), we will be able to hit the `Downloads` domain to get Debian packages.

Please refer to the table below to see which package will utilize Download/API Native domains.

### Top Level Redirects

You can request that the top-level of your domain (e.g. npm.example.com) redirect to a location of your choice. For example, to the UI for your repositories if public, or to your own customer support page.

If you'd like to configure this, please include it in your request.

***

## Setup

To configure a custom domain within Cloudsmith, we require you to provide:

* A list of domains that you wish to have for each package type (refer to the table above). We recommend having only 1 domain for Download types, but this can be set up to include multiple if needed.

* For each domain, do you wish to have an account-wide or per-repository domain

* Finally, would you like to have a top level redirect for your domain

Example request:

Domain: `docker.mycompany.com` (Docker)\
Account wide\
No redirect

Once created within Cloudsmith, you will need to create two DNS CNAME entries for each domain you wish to configure within your DNS provider.

***

#### <span style={{ color: "#81a4de" }}>Step 1:</span>

* The process begins when you [contact us](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/contact-us) via support with a list of custom domains you would like to configure. We will review and start processing your request, ensuring your plan is eligible to make use of the custom domain feature.

#### <span style={{ color: "#81a4de" }}>Step 2:</span>

* After confirming the domains you need, a member of the team will review and configure them within Cloudsmith. Once set, the DNS CNAME entries will be visible in your account (in the "Custom Domains" section of any repository)

#### <span style={{ color: "#81a4de" }}>Step 3:</span>

* You then add the DNS CNAME entries to your domain DNS records with your DNS provider. The first CNAME is for authorizing the domain, and the second is to make it visible and accessible to your users.

* Once you have configured the CNAME's, you will then be able to make use of your custom domains.

* Please just [contact us](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/contact-us) if you would like to set this up or require any further information.
