# OCI Repository

Cloudsmith provides public & private registries for OCI artifacts

[The OpenContainer Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) is a lightweight, open governance structure project, formed under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.

OCI provides the concept of the *registry* as a storage service for storing and distributing artifacts for use.

Cloudsmith is OCI-compliant and provides a fully-fledged registry with full OCI v1.1 compatibility. With Cloudsmith you'll be able to push, pull, inspect and manage OCI artifacts, privately and publicly.

All of this is provided with the standard functionality and features that are offered in the Cloudsmith platform, such as collaboration, advanced permissioning, whitelabelled distribution, multi-tenacy with other packaging formats, etc.

For more information on OCI, please see:

* [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/): The official website for the OpenContainer Initiative.
* [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec): The official Github repository containing the distribution specification.
* [OCI Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Container_Initiative): The Wikipedia article on OCI.

## Differences from the OCI Image and Distribution Specification

For clarity, it's important to note some of the differences between a registry such as Docker Hub, and a Cloudsmith OCI registry. These are both naming and functional in nature.

### Naming Differences

Docker defines the following names (this is not the official wording):

* **Layer:** A blob (big object of bytes) containing software and configuration.
* **Image:** A collection of Docker layers plus metadata that represent an application.
* **Container:** A running instance of a Docker image in-memory.
* **Repository:** A collection of Docker images, separated by hashref and version tags.
* **Registry:** A collection of all Docker repositories, separated by namespaces.

For comparison purposes, where terms differ from Cloudsmith:

* **Package:** A specific identifiable and versionable artifact.
* **Repository:** A collection of versionable artifacts, with multiple allowed per account.

Therefore, based on the above, the following terms are equivalent:

| OCI Term | Cloudsmith Term |
| :------- | :-------------- |
| Image    | Package         |
| Registry | Repository      |

For consistency, the terms will be used within all of the OCI-related documentation but please be aware of the differences if looking at documentation elsewhere.

## Upload an Generic Artifact with ORAS

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  If you have added a [Custom Domain](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/custom-domains) for Docker, you must use it to authenticate and push. Please replace `docker.cloudsmith.io` in the following instructions with the Docker custom domain you have created.
</Callout>

[ORAS (OCI Registry As Storage)](https://oras.land/)  is an open-source tool that enables users to push, pull, and manage non-container artifacts in OCI-compliant registries. It extends the OCI specification beyond container images, turning registries into a general-purpose storage system for diverse artifact types.

### Setup

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code or expose them in any logs
</Callout>

You need to authenticate via `oras login` to push/pull artifacts:

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
oras login docker.cloudsmith.io
Username: USERNAME
Password: API-KEY

Login Succeeded
```

### Push an artifact

After authentication you can push the artifact by doing:

```shell Shell
$ oras push docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ARTIFACT_NAME:TAG ./FILENAME_PATH
```

ORAS allows you to specify the type of the artifact by using the `--artifact-type` parameter, you can use it in the following way:

```shell Shell
$ oras push docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ARTIFACT_NAME:TAG --artifact-type application/vnd.cloudsmith.v1 ./FILENAME_PATH
```

For more information on how to define a unique artifact type check the [official documentation](https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts/blob/main/artifact-authors.md#defining-a-unique-artifact-type) .

## Attach file to an existing Artifact

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  The `attach` [command](https://oras.land/docs/commands/oras_attach) in ORAS is in preview and still under development
</Callout>

As Cloudsmith is fully OCI v1.1 compliant, this includes support for the Referrers API.

Referrers allow artifacts to reference related objects, enabling a parent artifact (like a container image) to have associated metadata or attachments (e.g., SBOMs, signatures, or provenance files). This is critical for securely and efficiently managing relationships between artifacts, such as attaching additional context or verifying authenticity without modifying the original artifact.

To attach a file to an existing artifact, execute:

```shell Shell
$ oras attach --artifact-type application/vnd.cloudsmith.attachment.v1 docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ARTIFACT_NAME:TAG ./FILE_TO_ATTACH
```

## Download / Pull an Generic Artifact with ORAS

### Setup

#### Public Registries

For public registries, no further setup is needed as authentication is not required.

#### Private Registries

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  Private Registries require authentication.  You can choose between two types of authentication, Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication.

  The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.
</Callout>

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  Entitlement Tokens and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code or expose them in any logs
</Callout>

You need to authenticate via `oras login` to pull images:

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
oras login docker.cloudsmith.io
Username: token
Password: TOKEN

Login Succeeded
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
oras login docker.cloudsmith.io
Username: USERNAME
Password: API-KEY

Login Succeeded
```

### Pull an Artifact

Pulling (downloading) an artifact from the Cloudsmith OCI registry can be done using the standard `oras pull` command:

```shell
$ oras pull docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/ARTIFACT_NAME:TAG
```

## Helm v3 charts via OCI

Starting Helm v3.8.0 OCI-compliant registries can now be used to store and share chart packages. For full detail see [Helm Docs](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/) .

> 🚧 Early Access Feature
>
> While Cloudsmith OCI Registries are GA, our Helm OCI registry is in Early Access, so some Cloudsmith features like Helm OCI Upstreams aren't yet available.

### Setup

Before you can push your chart you need to login to Cloudsmith's registry.

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
helm registry login helm.oci.cloudsmith.io -u OWNER/REPOSITORY -p TOKEN
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
helm registry login helm.oci.cloudsmith.io -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
helm registry login helm.oci.cloudsmith.io -u USERNAME -p API-KEY
```

With public repositories, you don't need any sort of authentication and you can jump straight to the Installing a Chart section below.

### Push your chart

The command to upload a Helm Chart via OCI using the Helm CLI is:

```shell
helm push CHART_NAME-CHART_VERSION.tgz oci://helm.oci.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY
```

### Installing a Chart

To install/use a specific version of a chart:

```Text Shell - OCI Repository
helm install oci://docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/CHART_NAME --version CHART_VERSION
```

To install the latest version of a chart:

```Text Shell - OCI Repository
helm install oci://docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/CHART_NAME
```

Or you can upgrade to the most recent version of a chart if you've already installed:

```Text Shell - OCI Repository
helm upgrade oci://docker.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/CHART_NAME
```

If you've got a `requirements.yaml` file in your chart, you can specify this as a dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: CHART_NAME
    version: CHART_VERSION
    repository: NAME
```

### Logging out of Registry

Helm provides a command to logout of OCI-based registries

```shell
helm registry logout docker.cloudsmith.io
```

## Provenance

Provenance files allow for verification of both the integrity and source of a Helm chart.

<Callout icon="🚧" theme="warn">
  Provenance files aren't supported for OCI chart uploads yet, but this feature is coming soon. Cloudsmith fully supports both verification and generation of Helm provenance files for non-OCI Helm Charts.
</Callout>
