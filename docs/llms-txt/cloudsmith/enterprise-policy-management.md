## Enterprise Policy Management Overview

Enterprise policy management provides a way for Workspaces (previously known as Organizations) to define policies that can match and act on packages within Cloudsmith. Enterprise policy management is implemented on top of [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA), a general-purpose and widely adopted policy evaluation engine. OPA provides a high-level declarative language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) to define policies as code.

### OPA and Enterprise Policy Management

Enterprise policy management allows you to create an OPA policy that triggers when certain events occur within Cloudsmith, ensuring your policies are consistently enforced. When a policy is triggered, Cloudsmith provides the policy evaluation engine with package metadata (input data). Through the rego-based policies, a set of actions associated with the policy (called policy actions) act on the package if the policy is matched.

At a high level, the Enterprise policy management policy evaluation workflow is as follows:

1. An event within Cloudsmith triggers a policy evaluation (for example, completing a package security scan).
2. Package metadata and your rego-based policy are provided to the policy evaluation engine.
3. The policy evaluation engine determines if the policy "matches" the package, based on the logic/criteria provided in your policy.
4. If the policy matches the package, the action(s) associated with the policy are then applied to the package.

An example policy, explained in more detail below, quarantines a package following a security scan if vulnerabilities of a certain severity are found within the package.

## Policies Overview - Key Concepts

### Policy Triggers

Cloudsmith policies are continuously evaluated, so we detect changes in your security posture in near real time. Certain events will explicitly trigger a policy re-evaluation:

* When a package is added to a repository, it goes through a [synchronization process](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/resync-a-package#what-is-package-synchronization) that includes evaluating existing policies that may affect the package. Vulnerability Scanning should be enabled for the Workspace.
* When a package is resynchronized, provided it wasn't scanned within the 30 minutes before that.
* When a package is copied from one repository to another.
* When a vulnerability scan is triggered via the UI or API (Note that manual scan requests will only result in a re-scan 30 minutes after the previous scan).
* When a [recurring vulnerability scan](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/security-scanning#early-access-recurring-security-scans) is triggered.
* When Cloudsmith receives updated package data, such as CVSS or EPSS updates.

### Policies

Policies are written in [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), a declarative language used to define OPA policies. Policies evaluate packages against a set of criteria, such as package metadata, workspace, repository, and security information.

### Policy Matching

Policy matching occurs when the policy evaluation engine evaluates a policy against a package and determines that the package matches the criteria outlined in the policy.

### Policy Actions

Actions can be assigned to policies to act on packages following policy evaluation. If a package has been matched in the matching step above, the policy actions associated with the policy will then be applied to the package. Multiple actions can be associated with a given policy, and the following actions are currently supported:

* `set_state`. This allows you to control the state of the package. For example, whether to delete or quarantine the package. See the [PackageStateEnum](https://api.cloudsmith.io/v2/swagger/#/:~:text=MovePackageActionTyped-,PackageStateEnum,string,-AVAILABLE%20%2D%20The%20package) for more information.
* `add_package_tags`. Add a set of tags to the package.
* Note on quarantining action: If you set the action to quarantine, any request for the package returns 403 Forbidden.

### Decision Logs

The details of every policy evaluation and its outcome are captured in a decision log.\
Decision logs record the result of policy evaluations, including why the decision was made and what actions were taken as a result.

The [Getting Started](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/getting-started-with-enterprise-policy-management)  with Enterprise Policy Management guide provides more details on creating enterprise policy management policies and actions.
