# Supply Chain Security

Modern software delivery pipelines face growing complexities and a rising wave of sophisticated supply chain attacks, requiring artifact management to go beyond traditional storage. According to the [**Cloudsmith 2025 Artifact Management Report**](https://cloudsmith.com/campaigns/2025-artifact-management-report), this is top of mind for engineering teams, with 56% of respondents citing improved security as the leading benefit of their artifact management tools.

Our platform is designed to meet this challenge head-on. We provide a comprehensive suite of features to help you secure your software supply chain by enabling you to define your policies and responses to policy violations as code; identifying, mitigating, and blocking risks from vulnerabilities and non-compliant licenses in your dependencies.

In this section you can learn how to:

* Ensure with **Block Until Scan** that no package can be downloaded until a security scan is successfully completed, helping you enforce security mandates across the whole organization.
* Reduce risk associated with **Software Vulnerabilities**, by proactively identifying and quarantining packages with known vulnerabilities from entering your software supply chain.
* **License Compliance:** Automatically scan for and identify the licenses of your dependencies, ensuring compliance with your organization's policies.
* **Digital Signatures:** Verify the integrity and authenticity of your software artifacts using GPG, PGP, and other signing standards.

Adding to this, Enterprise Policy Management (EPM):

* **Policy-as-Code (Early Access):** The next evolution in policy management. This new feature allows you to define all your security and license compliance rules in a single, version-controlled YAML file. While our existing policy features remain fully supported, Policy-as-Code is intended to become the primary method for managing supply chain security rules at scale.
