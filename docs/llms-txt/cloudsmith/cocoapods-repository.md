## Upload a Package

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command-Line Interface](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/cli)\
The command to upload an (Objective-C or Swift) CocoaPods package via the Cloudsmith CLI is:

```shell
cloudsmith push cocoapods OWNER/REPOSITORY PACKAGE_NAME.tar.gz
```

Example:

```shell
cloudsmith push cocoapods org/repo your-package.tar.gz
```

### Upload via Cloudsmith Website

Please see [Upload a Package](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upload-via-website-ui) for details of how to upload via the Website UI.

## Download / Install a Package

### Setup

Before you can install packages from your Cloudsmith repository you'll need to add your repository to your project's Podfile. This can be done using the `source` keyword in your project's Podfile. The `source` keyword is a URL to a git repository with the metadata index of all of your repository's private pods.

To add the repository to your project's Podfile, add the following:

#### Public Repositories

```shell
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
```

#### Private Repositories

> 📘
>
> Private Cloudsmith repositories require authentication.  You can choose between two types of authentication, Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication.
>
> The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.

> 🚧
>
> Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code, or expose them in any logs

> 🚧
>
> When using HTTP basic authentication, you'll need to configure Git with the proper credentials. Git's standard authentication mechanisms are used by CocoaPods and can be configured in the normal way. For example, you could use git's per-user credential store like so:
>
> `git config --global credential.helper store`\
> `echo "https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io" > ~/.git-credentials`

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
source 'https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API Key)
source 'https://USERNAME:API-KEY@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
source 'https://token:TOKEN@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
```

***

### Specifying Dependencies

Add the latest version of a package to your Podfile using the syntax outlined by [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

#### Public Repositories

```shell
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'PACKAGE_NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

#### Private Repositories

```shell Entitlement Token Auth
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'PACKAGE_NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITORY/cocoapods/index.git'
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'PACKAGE_NAME', '~> PACKAGE_VERSION'
end
```

***

### Installing a Package

Once added, the cocoapods tool will download the dependency to the Pods directory in your project, and update the `Podfile.lock` after running following command:

```shell
pod install
```

> 🚧
>
> When a dependency is added to the Podfile and retrieved via `pod install`, it gets the new dependency, along with any of its transitive dependencies. However, the cocoapods tool won’t change the versions of any already-acquired dependencies unless that’s necessary to get the new dependency.
>
> The cocoapods tool also stores a cache of the index on your machine, so in order to receive the most up to date version of the index it may be necessary to use the `--repo-update` flag to force a repository update before installing your project's pods.

***

### Configuration Example

Here is a complete (but minimal) `Podfile` using entitlement token authentication:

```shell
source 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/abcedef1234567/org/repo/cocoapods/index.git'

workspace 'cocoapods-install-example.xcworkspace'

target 'cocoapods-install-example' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for cocoapods-install-example
  pod 'cloudsmith-cocoapods-example', '~> 1.0.158207047536418'

end
```
