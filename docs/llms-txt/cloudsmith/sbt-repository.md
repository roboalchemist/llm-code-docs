Cloudsmith provides public & private repositories for sbt packages (Scala)

![](https://files.readme.io/b209426-cloudsmith-sbt-banner-hd.jpg "cloudsmith-sbt-banner-hd.jpg")

sbt is an open-source build tool for Scala and Java projects. Its main features are\
native support for compiling Scala code and integrating with many Scala test frameworks.

## Upload a Package

### Upload via sbt Publish

The endpoint for the native Maven API is:

```
https://maven.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

By default, Sbt 1.x uses Maven-style publishing and no other plugins are required to publish to Cloudsmith. If you're using Sbt 0.x then you'll need to use the Maven Wagon integration approach (see the integrations tab within the repository on the Cloudsmith website for further details).

Include a `publishTo` stanza in your `publish.sbt` file as follows:

```scala
publishTo := { Some("Cloudsmith API" at "https://maven.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/") }
pomIncludeRepository := { x => false }
```

You then configure a `~/.sbt/.credentials` file with the authentication details of the uploading user as follows:

```
realm=Cloudsmith API
host=maven.cloudsmith.io
user=OWNER
password=API-KEY
```

Then refer to the above in your `publish.sbt` file with:

```scala
credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".sbt" / ".credentials")
```

> 📘
>
> You can also encode your credentials directly (and use an environment variable to pull in the API key).

You can now publish to the native API with:

```shell
sbt publish
```

You can find out additional information about Sbt publishing in the [official Sbt documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Publishing.html).

#### Publishing an sbt plugin

Cloudsmith supports publishing sbt plugins via the Maven publish style. To publish an sbt plugin you need to add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
    .enablePlugins(SbtPlugin)
    .settings(
        name := "PLUGIN_NAME",
        sbtPlugin := true,
        publishMavenStyle := true,
    )
```

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upload-via-cloudsmith-cli-api).

The command to upload via the Cloudsmith CLI is:

```shell
cloudsmith push maven OWNER/REPOSITORY ARTIFACT_ID-PACKAGE_VERSION.jar --pom-file=ARTIFACT_ID-PACKAGE_VERSION.pom
```

Example:

```shell
cloudsmith push maven org/repo validation-api-1.0.0.GA.jar --pom-file=validation-api-1.0.0.GA.pom
```

### Upload via Cloudsmith Website

Please see [Upload a Package](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upload-via-website-ui) for details of how to upload via the Website UI.

## Download / Install a Package

### Setup

#### Public Repositories

To enable the retrieval of packages from a public Cloudsmith repository via sbt, add your repository your `build.sbt` file as follows:

```scala
resolvers += "NAME" at "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/OWNER/REPOSITORY/maven/"
```

***

#### Private Repositories

> 📘
>
> Private Cloudsmith repositories require authentication.  You can choose between two types of authentication, Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication.
>
> The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.

> 🚧
>
> Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code or expose them in any logs.

To enable the retrieval of packages from a private Cloudsmith repository via sbt, add your repository your `build.sbt` file as follows:

```scala Entitlement Token Authentication
resolvers += "NAME" at "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/TOKEN/OWNER/REPOSITORY/maven/"
```

```scala HTTP Basic Authentication
resolvers += "NAME" at "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/OWNER/REPOSITIORY/maven/"
```

When using Entitlement Token Authentication, no further setup is required.\
If using HTTP Basic Authentication, you can provide one following three types of credentials:

* Cloudsmith Username and Password
* Cloudsmith API Key
* An Entitlement Token

You should keep these credentials separately in your `~/.sbt/.credentials` file instead of within the `build.sbt` file. When you have your credentials ready, setup your `~/.sbt/.credentials` file as follows:

```text Username & Password
realm=Private Repository
host=
user=USERNAME
password=PASSWORD
```

```text API Key
realm=Private Repository
host=
user=USERNAME
password=API-KEY
```

```text Entitlement Token
realm=Private Repository
host=
user=token
password=TOKEN
```

Then add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".sbt" / ".credentials")
```

### Specifying Dependencies

After the repository is added to the `build.sbt` file, and your credentials are added to the `/.sbt/.credentials` file (required for private repositories if using HTTP Basic Authentication), all that is left is to [specify the dependency](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Library-Dependencies.html) in the dependencies section of the project `build.sbt` file.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "GROUP_ID" % "ARTIFACT_ID" % "PACKAGE_VERSION"
```

***

> 📘 NOTE
>
> In sbt 0.13.x (not sbt 1.x or above) an extension point in the dependency resolution to use Maven-style resolvers is required. To enable this plugin add the following to `project/maven.sbt` (or `project/plugin.sbt`):
>
> ```scala
> addMavenResolverPlugin
> ```

## Upstream Proxying / Caching

<span class="cs-tag cs-tag-dark-green">Configurable Proxying</span> <span class="cs-tag cs-tag-orange">Caching</span>\
You can configure upstream repositories that you wish to use for packages that are not available in your Cloudsmith repository. In addition, you can also choose to cache any requested packages for future use.

Please see our [Upstream Proxying](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/proxying) documentation for further instructions.
