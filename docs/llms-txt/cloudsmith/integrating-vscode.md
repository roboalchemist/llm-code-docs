# VS Code Extension

The Cloudsmith extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to view and manage your Cloudsmith packages directly within your VS Code IDE.

## Installation

You can install the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cloudsmith.cloudsmith-vsc) or by using the `.vsix` file from [a release](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-vscode-extension/releases). We recommend installing via the Marketplace for ease of use and automatic updates.

### From the VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)

1. Open the **Extensions** view in VS Code (or press `Ctrl +Shift+X`).
2. Search for `cloudsmith` in the search bar.
3. Select the Cloudsmith extension published by Cloudsmith and click **Install**.

### From a .vsix File

You can also install the extension manually from a `.vsix` file, which is available on the [GitHub repository releases page](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-vscode-extension/releases).

1. In the **Extensions** view, click the **Views and More Actions...** (`...`) button.
2. Select **Install from VSIX...** and choose the downloaded `cloudsmith-x.x.x.vsix` file.

Alternatively, open your terminal and run:

```shell
code --install-extension cloudsmith-x.x.x.vsix
```

## Configuration

### Authentication

After installation, connect the extension to your Cloudsmith account using an [API Key](/about-cloudsmith/api-key) or a [Service Account Token](/accounts-and-teams/service-accounts) (Entitlement tokens are not supported).

1. Navigate to the Cloudsmith view in the VS Code Activity Bar.
2. Click the **key icon** located in the view's menu.
3. Enter your Personal API Key or Service Account Token into the input box that appears and press `Enter`.
4. Click the **connect/refresh icon** to load your workspaces and repositories.

### Settings

You can configure the extension's behavior by navigating to **File > Preferences > Settings** and searching for `Cloudsmith`:

* **Show Packages by Group**: If enabled, the explorer will display packages as [Package Groups](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/package-groups). By default, individual packages are shown.
* **Inspect Output Target**: Choose where the `Inspect Package` command sends its output: `Output` window or a `New Document`.
* **Maximum Packages Per Repository**: Set the maximum number of packages to display per repository. The value can be between 1 and 30. The default (and maximum) is 30.
* **Use Legacy Web App**: If enabled, URLs opened via the `Open Package in Cloudsmith` command will point to the legacy Cloudsmith web app ([https://cloudsmith.io/](https://cloudsmith.io/)).

## Using the Cloudsmith VS Code extension

The extension adds a **Cloudsmith Explorer** view to VS Code. This view provides a tree-based navigator to explore your Cloudsmith assets, including workspaces, repositories, and packages.

Selecting a package or package group in the explorer will display a selection of its most important details directly in the tree view. You can right-click on any detail (e.g., Name, Version) to copy its value to the clipboard.

This is a subset of the full data available via the Cloudsmith API. For the complete dataset, use the `Inspect Package` command.

| Field                     | Description                                                                               |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**                | Indicates the current state of the package (e.g., Completed, Failed, Deleted, etc.).      |
| **Name**                  | The human-readable title or name of the package.                                          |
| **Slug**                  | A URL-friendly version of the package name, typically lowercase with hyphens for spaces.  |
| **Slug Perm**             | A permanent, unique slug that does not change, even if the package name is updated.       |
| **Number of downloads**   | The total count of how many times the package has been downloaded.                        |
| **Version**               | The specific release version number, often following semantic versioning (e.g., `1.2.3`). |
| **Tags**                  | Keywords or labels used to categorize the package and make it discoverable.               |
| **Uploaded at date/time** | The timestamp indicating the exact date and time the package version was published.       |

> 📘 Note
>
> When the **Package Groups** option is enabled, the next fields are available for each of the package groups: **Count of packages in group**, **Size**, **Number of downloads**, and **Last pushed date/time**.

Right-clicking on a package or package group in the explorer opens a context menu with several commands:

* **Inspect Package**: this command retrieves the raw JSON data for the selected package or group. By default, the output is sent to the VS Code `Output` window. You can change this behavior in the extension settings to send the output to a new, untitled text document instead.
* **Open Package in Cloudsmith**: this command opens the selected package's page directly in the Cloudsmith web application using your default browser.
