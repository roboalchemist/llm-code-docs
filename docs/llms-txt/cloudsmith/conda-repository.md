## Upload a Package

### Creating Conda Packages

To upload via the Cloudsmith API/CLI, you'll need to generate a package first. You can do this with [conda-build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/index.html):

```
conda build .
```

This generates a `.tar.bz2` file like `your-package-0.1.0.tar.bz2` that you can upload.

### Upload via the Cloudsmith CLI

For full details of how to install and setup the Cloudsmith CLI, see [Command Line Interface](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upload-via-cloudsmith-cli-api).

The command to upload Conda package via the Cloudsmith CLI is:

```shell
cloudsmith push conda OWNER/REPOSITORY PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.tar.bz2
```

Example:

```shell
cloudsmith push conda my-org/my-repo your-package-0.1.0.tar.bz2
```

### Upload via Cloudsmith Website

Please see [Upload a Package](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upload-via-website-ui) for details of how to upload via the Website UI.

### Setup

**Public Repositories**

Adding a new channel can be accomplished by using the `conda` CLI:

```shell
conda config --add channels https://conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

Alternatively, the channel can be added directly to your `.condarc`:

```yaml
channels:
  - https://conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
```

Or if you prefer, directly in your `environment.yml` file:

```yaml
name: env-name
channels:
  - https://conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - codecov
```

**Private Repositories**

> 📘
>
> Private Cloudsmith repositories require authentication.  You can choose between two types of authentication, Entitlement Token Authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication.
>
> The setup method will differ depending on what authentication type you choose to use.

> 🚧
>
> Entitlement Tokens, User Credentials and API-Keys should be treated as secrets, and you should ensure that you do not commit them in configurations files along with source code or expose them in any logs

Adding a new channel can be accomplished by using the `conda` CLI:

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
conda config --add channels https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
conda config --add channels https://USERNAME:API-KEY@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

```shell HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
conda config --add channels https://token:TOKEN@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
```

Alternatively, the channel can be added directly to your `.condarc`:

```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
channels:
  - https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
```

```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
channels:
  - https://USERNAME:API-KEY@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
```

```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
channels:
  - https://token:TOKEN@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
```

Or if you prefer, directly in your `environment.yml` file:

```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (User & Pass)
name: env-name
channels:
  - https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - codecov
```

```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (API-Key)
name: env-name
channels:
  - https://USERNAME:API-KEY@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - codecov
```

```yaml HTTP Basic Auth (Token)
name: env-name
channels:
  - https://token:TOKEN@conda.cloudsmith.io/OWNER/REPOSITORY/
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - codecov
```

### Install a Package

Once configured, you can install packages from your channel using the `conda` CLI:

```
conda install your-package=1.2.3
```

## Conda repodata patching

In certain scenarios, Conda package metadata may need to be patched. Patching is often required when a package dependency is updated, and backwards compatibility is broken, as in the following example:

* `package-a`, version `3.5.0` depends on `package-b` with a version constraint of `package-b >= 2.0.0`.
* A new major version of `package-b` is released (`3.0.0`). This introduces breaking changes, making it incompatible with all previous versions of `package-a`.

Repodata patching can be used to resolve the above scenario. For example, the dependency constraint can be amended (patched) to the more specific: `package-b >= 2.0.0, <3`. This approach does not alter the original package artifacts, and means no requirement is placed on package maintainers to re-release corrected versions of any existing (broken) packages.

### Applying repodata patching

Patching is accomplished by applying patching instructions to a channel's repodata file (`repodata.json`). This file format is used by Conda channels to provide an index of all packages and their respective metadata within a specific subdirectory (subdir) of the channel. When a request is made for the relevant repodata.json file, the patch instructions are merged with the repodata, and the patched (modified) repodata is returned. An overview of this process is available [here](https://bioconda.github.io/developer/repodata_patching.html).

Cloudsmith provides a dedicated [cloudsmith-conda-repodata-patches](https://github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-conda-repodata-patches) repository to facilitate the easy creation of patching instructions. This repository provides relevant scripts and instructions on how to add, generate and submit your patch instructions to Cloudsmith.
