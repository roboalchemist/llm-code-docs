# Cloudsmith Integration with Codefresh

[Codefresh](https://codefresh.io/) is a CI/CD platform designed for Kubernetes and modern microservices, offering streamlined workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications with integrated Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes support.

Cloudsmith can seamlessly work with Codefresh to authenticate, consume, and publish artifacts from Cloudsmith in your Codefresh CI/CD pipelines.

## Prerequisites:

* **Cloudsmith Account**: Ensure you have an active Cloudsmith account with a repository where your artifacts will be stored.
* **Codefresh Account**: Ensure you have an active Codefresh account.
* **Kubernetes Cluster:** A Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy your applications.

## Artifact management with Cloudsmith and Codefresh

You can manage artifacts between Cloudsmith and Codefresh in several ways:

* **Uploading Packages:**
  * Use the Cloudsmith [Command-Line Interface](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/cli).
  * Use native package management tools such as Docker, pip gem or cargo.
  * Use Codefresh’s native Docker build and push steps for containerized workflows.
* **Deploying Artifacts:** Deploy Docker images and Helm charts stored in Cloudsmith repositories directly from Codefresh pipelines.

## Authentication Options

* API Key: You can authenticate to Cloudsmith using an API key stored in Codefresh.
* OIDC Authentication: Alternatively, set up Codefresh as an OIDC provider to authenticate dynamically without manual credential management.

### Adding Your Cloudsmith API Key in Codefresh

Steps to [add encrypted variables](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/variables/) in your Codefresh pipelines:

1. Open your Codefresh pipeline and go to the Settings tab.
2. Click on Environment Variables and select Add New Variable.
3. Provide a name (e.g., `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY`), input the value, and toggle Encrypt Value to ensure it's secure.
4. You can reference the secret in your pipeline YAML like this: `${{CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY}}`.

For more security options, Codefresh offers a Vault plugin from the Step Marketplace to handle key-value pairs dynamically. Refer to [Vault Secrets](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/example-catalog/ci-examples/vault-secrets-in-the-pipeline/) in the Pipeline for more details.

### Setup OIDC

To authenticate securely, set up **Codefresh as an OIDC provider** for Cloudsmith.

> 📘 [OIDC](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/openid-connect) Authentication
>
> Codefresh does not support OIDC for Docker integrations natively. You can use OIDC for [freestyle steps](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/) when using the Hybrid Runtime, which allows access to the Docker Daemon. From there, you can manually log in to Docker, build your image, and push it to Cloudsmith. However, this means you will not be able to use the built-in build and push steps provided by Codefresh. Instead, you'll need to handle the authentication and image operations within freestyle steps.

#### Add Codefresh as OIDC identity provider in Cloudsmith

Set up **Codefresh as an OIDC provider** for Cloudsmith. This allows your Codefresh pipelines to request Cloudsmith API tokens dynamically, without manual credential management.

1. **Create a[Service Account](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/service-accounts)** in Cloudsmith (required for OIDC to work with Cloudsmith).
2. **Configure[OpenID Connect](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/openid-connect) in Cloudsmith**:
   * Provider URL: `https://oidc.codefresh.io`
   * Claims: For example add your **Codefresh account ID** to restrict access. For more information on claims consult the [Codefresh documentation](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/integrations/oidc-pipelines/#claims--conditions).
   * Assign the **service account** you created earlier.

#### Obtain OIDC ID token from OIDC provider

Obtain the ID token from the Codefresh OIDC provider by using the `obtain-oidc-id-token` Marketplace step.

Add the step to your Codefresh pipeline’s workflow.

```yaml
version: '1.0'  
steps:  
obtain_id_token:  
  title: Obtain ID Token  
  type: obtain-oidc-id-token
```

For more details, refer to the [Cloudsmith OIDC documentation](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/openid-connect) and [Codefresh OIDC documentation](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/integrations/oidc-pipelines/).

#### Example Pipeline: Publish a Python Package to Cloudsmith

This example demonstrates how to authenticate and publish a Python package to Cloudsmith using OIDC in a Codefresh pipeline::

```yaml
version: "1.0"
steps:
  obtain_id_token:
    title: "Obtain ID Token"
    type: obtain-oidc-id-token

  authenticate_with_cloudsmith:
    title: "Authenticate with Cloudsmith"
    image: "curlimages/curl:7.82.0"
    commands:
      - echo "Installing jq"
      - apk add --no-cache jq
      - |
        cloudsmith_token=$(curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "{\"oidc_token\":\"$ID_TOKEN\", \"service_slug\":\"${{CS_SERVICE_USER_NAME}}\"}" \
        https://api.cloudsmith.io/openid/${{CS_ORG}}/ | jq -r '.token')

        echo "Setting PIP_INDEX_URL with the obtained Cloudsmith token"
        export PIP_INDEX_URL="https://token:$cloudsmith_token@dl.cloudsmith.io/basic/${{CS_ORG}}/${{CS_REPO}}/python/simple/"
        cf_export PIP_INDEX_URL=$PIP_INDEX_URL

```

Replace `CS_SERVICE_USER_NAME`, `CS_ORG`, and `CS_REPO` with your service account, organization, and repository details. You can store these values as environment variables within your Codefresh pipeline.

## Adding Cloudsmith as a Docker Registry in Codefresh

To add Cloudsmith as a Docker registry to Codefresh:

* Go to settings and select Pipeline Integrations
* Select Docker Registries and then click Add Registry Provider.
* Select Other Registries
* Define the following:
  * Registry name: A unique name for this configuration.
  * Username: Your Cloudsmith username.
  * Password: Your Cloudsmith API Key or password.
  * Domain: docker.cloudsmith.io
  * Prefix: For a Cloudsmith organziation followed by the repository e.g.`CS_ORGANIZATION/CS_REPOSITORY`

For more information consult the [Docker Registry](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/docker-registry) or [Codefresh documentation](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/integrations/docker-registries/other-registries/).
