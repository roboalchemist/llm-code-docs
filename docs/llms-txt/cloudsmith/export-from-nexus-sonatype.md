# Export from Nexus Sonatype

How to export packages from Nexus Sonatype

Migrating from Nexus requires you to migrate hosted repositories only, since any proxy repositories configured in Nexus can just be set up with the same configuration in Cloudsmith Repository Manager, and all data will be retrieved from the upstream repositories again. All the upstream repositories supported by Cloudsmith are listed [here](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/upstream-proxying-caching).

Hosted repositories will have to be migrated from Nexus to Cloudsmith.

To migrate from Nexus you will be required to have access to Nexus and all of the repositories that you wish to migrate.

As Nexus doesn't provide an official way to download all of the packages, a community written script can assist in the process.

The following script will produce a LogFile and a file for the specified repository with all of the download links, the second part of the script will then pull the information with all of the download links and download them to your directory.

```shell
sourceServer=
sourceRepo=
sourceUser=
sourcePassword=

filters=("\\.zip$") # Grab only the packages specificed in the filter or leave the variable blank to grab everything
logfile=$sourceRepo-backup.log
outputFile=$sourceRepo-artifacts.txt

# ======== GET DOWNLOAD URLs =========

url=$sourceServer"/service/rest/v1/assets?repository="$sourceRepo
contToken="initial"
while [ ! -z "$contToken" ]; do
    if [ "$contToken" != "initial" ]; then
        url=$sourceServer"/service/rest/v1/assets?continuationToken="$contToken"&repository="$sourceRepo
    fi
    echo Processing repository token: $contToken | tee -a $logfile
    response=`curl -ksSL -u "$sourceUser:$sourcePassword" -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' "$url"`
    artifacts=( $(echo $response | sed -n 's|.*"downloadUrl" : "\([^"]*\)".*|\1|p') ) 
    printf "%s\n" "${artifacts[@]}" > artifacts.temp 
    if [ ! -z "$filters" ]; then
        for filter in "${filters[@]}"; do
            cat artifacts.temp | grep "$filter" >> $outputFile
        done
    else
        cat artifacts.temp >> $outputFile
    fi
    contToken=( $(echo $response | sed -n 's|.*"continuationToken" : "\([^"]*\)".*|\1|p') )
done

# ======== DOWNLOAD EVERYTHING =========

echo Downloading artifacts...
IFS=$'\n' read -d '' -r -a urls < $outputFile
for url in "${urls[@]}"; do
    url="$(echo -e "${url}" | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//')"

    curFolder=$(pwd)
    mkdir -p $dir
    cd $dir
    url="$(echo -e "${url}" | sed -e 's/\s/%20/g')"
    curl -vks -u "$sourceUser:$sourcePassword" -D response.header -X GET "$url" -O  >> /dev/null 2>&1
    responseCode=`cat response.header | sed -n '1p' | cut -d' ' -f2`
    if [ "$responseCode" == "200" ]; then
        echo Successfully downloaded artifact: $url
    else
        echo ERROR: Failed to download artifact: $url  with error code: $responseCode
    fi
    rm response.header > /dev/null 2>&1
    cd $curFolder
done
