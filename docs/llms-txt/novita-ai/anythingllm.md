# AnythingLLM

> Step-by-step guide to set up AnythingLLM with Novita AI models for secure, document-based AI applications.

With AnythingLLM, you gain seamless access to a comprehensive suite of Novita AI LLM models, including DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, and more, along with vector database solutions. The integration enables you to effortlessly build and deploy AI-powered applications that handle complex language tasks while ensuring privacy and control.

This guide will walk you through installing and integrating AnythingLLM, connecting Novita AI’s models, enabling web search functionality, and setting up a knowledge base for dynamic and intelligent document interactions.

## **What is AnythingLLM?**

AnythingLLM is a full-stack application designed to give you the flexibility of using both commercial LLMs and popular open-source LLMs, along with vector database solutions. You can run this application locally or host it remotely, offering a secure, private environment to interact intelligently with your documents.

By integrating these resources, AnythingLLM allows you to build a highly functional AI-powered chat interface that handles complex language tasks without compromising privacy or control.

## Key Features

* **Thread-like Structure Workspace**: Workspaces act as threads, organizing related documents in a contained space. Each Workspace isolates documents from others, preserving a unique context for each project or topic.
* **Flexibility for Personal and Businesses:** Install AnythingLLM and its full suite of tools as a single application on your personal desktop. And Fine-grained permissioning and access control for organization is also built-in.
* **Security:** AnythingLLM only talks to the services you connect to and can run fully on your machine without internet connectivity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* Novita AI LLM API Key:
  * Visit [Novita AI’s website](https://novita.ai/) and create an account.
  * After logging in, go to the [Key Management](https://novita.ai/settings/key-management) page to generate your API Key. This key is required to connect Novita AI’s models to AnythingLLM.
