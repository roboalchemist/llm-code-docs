[**Bolt.new**](https://bolt.new) is an AI-first platform for building full-stack web applications directly in the browser. Created by StackBlitz, it combines WebContainers and Anthropic’s Claude model to provide a zero-setup coding experience. Developers can use natural language to scaffold, run, and deploy complete apps—including frontend frameworks, Node.js servers, and full npm ecosystems.

[**Dappier**](https://dappier.com/developers/) provides AI agents and applications with verified, real-time data from trusted sources like web search, stock market APIs, local news, and lifestyle content providers. By connecting Dappier’s tools with bolt.new, developers can instantly prototype and ship apps that reason over live data.

## ⚡ Quickstart: Enable a Smart AskAI Agent

Want to add a conversational AI assistant to your bolt.new app? This setup gives you a modal-style AskAI widget powered by Dappier, docked in the bottom-right corner of your screen. It responds to user questions using real-time data—perfect for search, support, and intelligent content discovery.

Copy and paste the following into your project to get started:

````markdown  theme={null}
I'd like to enable a smart AskAI search agent on my project, docked in the bottom-right corner of the screen. When clicked, it should open a modal-style conversational experience powered by Dappier.

Here's the widget I want to embed:

1. Add this to the <head> section:

```
<script
  src="https://assets.dappier.com/widget/dappier-loader.min.js"
  widget-id="wd_01jw8xz7ztf4zr22e2whnsxp7s"
  style-icon="chat"
  theme="light"
/>
```

2. And place this where the widget should mount:

```
<div id="dappier-ask-ai-widget">
  <dappier-ask-ai-widget widgetId="wd_01jw8xz7ztf4zr22e2whnsxp7s" />
</div>
```

It should support modal open/close behavior and work well across desktop and mobile.

3. Customize the button design:

Please make the button match the site's style. Some ideas:

Rounded corners

Chat icon next to text

Sticky in the corner or part of nav

Use tailwind classes like bg-indigo-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg shadow
````

> ✅ Drop it into your Bolt app to activate a fully working, real-time AskAI assistant with no backend setup required.
