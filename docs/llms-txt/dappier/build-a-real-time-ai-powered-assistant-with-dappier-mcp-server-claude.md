## Step 1: Install UV Package Manager

To use Dappier MCP within Claude, **UV** must be installed first.

For **MacOS/Linux**, run:

```json  theme={null}

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

```

For **Windows**, run:

```json  theme={null}

powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

```

**Verify installation:**

```json  theme={null}

uv --version

```

### Install using UV

For users preferring **UV**, run the following command:

```json  theme={null}

uv pip install dappier-mcp

```

## Step 2: Locate UVX Path

To ensure **claude** can access the **Dappier MCP Server**, you need to find the **UVX** path.

### For MacOS/Linux:

Run the following command to locate the **UVX** path:

```json  theme={null}

which uvx

```

### For windows:

```json  theme={null}

where uvx

```
