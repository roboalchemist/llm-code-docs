# 🧲 AI Stock Analyst with OpenAI Agents + Real-Time Financial Insights via Dappier MCP
Source: https://docs.dappier.com/cookbook/recipes/open-ai-agent-mcp-stock-analyst



This cookbook demonstrates how to build a real-time **Stock Analyst Agent** using **OpenAI Agents** and the **Dappier MCP**. By combining structured agent workflows with live financial data, this notebook walks you through building a dynamic assistant that analyzes a chosen **tech sector**, summarizes key news and trends, and recommends a tailored investment strategy.

In this cookbook, you'll explore:

* **OpenAI Agents SDK**: A powerful toolkit that enables large language models to operate as autonomous agents, use tools, and execute multi-step workflows with memory and structured decision-making.
* **Dappier MCP**: A Model Context Protocol server that connects your agents to real-time, rights-cleared tools — including live search, financial data, stock tickers, content recommendations, AI-powered summaries, and more. Dappier MCP acts as a gateway to trusted data and intelligent utilities your agent can use dynamically.
* **Real-Time Stock Analysis**: A practical use case where the agent analyzes a user-selected tech sector, pulls live financial signals, and generates a smart, explainable investment strategy with top stock picks.

This cookbook offers a foundation for building real-time, data-augmented AI agents that operate with current financial context, and can be extended to support any domain where market conditions matter.

## 📦 Installation

To get started, install the required tools and dependencies:

**Step 1: Install `uv` (required to run the Dappier MCP server)**

**macOS / Linux**:

```bash  theme={null}
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows**:

```bash  theme={null}
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

***

**Step 2: Install Python Packages**

Install the the OpenAI Agents SDK:

```bash  theme={null}
pip install openai-agents
```

## 🔑 Setting Up API Keys

You’ll need API keys for both **Dappier** and **OpenAI** to authenticate your requests and access real-time tools.

**Dappier API Key**

Head to [Dappier](https://platform.dappier.com/profile/api-keys) to sign up and generate your API key. Dappier offers free credits to get started.

You can set your API key as an environment variable in your terminal:

```bash  theme={null}
export DAPPIER_API_KEY=your-dappier-api-key
```

Or programmatically in your Python script:

```python Python theme={null}
import os

os.environ["DAPPIER_API_KEY"] = "your-dappier-api-key"
```

***

**OpenAI API Key**

Visit [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to retrieve your API key.

Set it in your terminal:

```bash  theme={null}
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Or in your Python script:

```python Python theme={null}
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"
```

## ⚙️ Import Dependencies

Start by importing all required modules to build the stock analyst agent. This includes components from the OpenAI Agents SDK and the Dappier MCP server.

```python Python theme={null}
import asyncio
import shutil
import os
from datetime import datetime

from agents import Agent, Runner, trace
from agents.mcp import MCPServer, MCPServerStdio
from openai.types.responses import ResponseTextDeltaEvent
```

These imports enable:

* Running the MCP server locally via `MCPServerStdio`
* Tracing and managing the agent's execution with `Runner` and `trace`
* Streaming the assistant's output using `ResponseTextDeltaEvent`

## 📝 Define User Input

We’ll collect the tech sector the user is interested in analyzing.

```python Python theme={null}
def get_user_input():
    sector = input("Enter the tech sector you are interested in (e.g., AI, semiconductors, cloud computing): ").strip()
    return sector
```

## 🛰️ Run the Agent with Dappier MCP

This function sets up the agent, formulates the user query, and streams the response using tools served via Dappier MCP.

```python Python theme={null}
async def run(mcp_server: MCPServer, sector: str):
    agent = Agent(
        name="StockAnalyst",
        instructions="""
        You are a financial investment assistant specializing in the technology sector. Your job is to:
        1. Understand the user's interest in a specific tech sector.
        2. Use Dappier's tools to gather the most recent financial news related to that sector.
        3. Analyze the news and suggest a strategy to invest in that sector.
        4. Identify the top 5 stock recommendations with reasoning.
        Make sure to provide clear, up-to-date, and actionable financial insights.
        """,
        mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
    )

    query = f"""
        I am interested in investing in the {sector} sector. Please do the following:

        1. Use Dappier's real-time tools to search for the latest financial news and developments in the {sector} sector.
        2. Summarize the key trends, opportunities, and risks.
        3. Based on your analysis, formulate a detailed investment strategy tailored to the current market conditions.
        4. Recommend the top 5 tech stocks in this sector with reasons for each choice, including any links or references if available.

        Ensure your answer is precise, data-backed, and investor-friendly.
    """

    print("\n" + "-" * 40)
    print(f"Analyzing investment opportunities in the {sector} sector")
    print("\n=== Streaming Start ===\n")

    result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, query)

    async for event in result.stream_events():
        if event.type == "raw_response_event" and isinstance(event.data, ResponseTextDeltaEvent):
            print(event.data.delta, end="", flush=True)

    print("\n\n=== Streaming Complete ===\n")
```

## 🚦 Initialize and Launch the Workflow

The `main()` function sets up the Dappier MCP server, enables tracing for observability, and runs the stock analysis agent.

```python Python theme={null}
async def main():
    sector = get_user_input()

    async with MCPServerStdio(
        cache_tools_list=True,
        params={
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["dappier-mcp"],
            "env": {"DAPPIER_API_KEY": os.environ["DAPPIER_API_KEY"]},
        },
    ) as server:
        with trace(workflow_name="AI Stock Analyst with Dappier MCP"):
            await run(server, sector)
```

## 🧪 Run the Stock Analyst Agent

This block checks for the required `uvx` binary and launches the full async workflow. Make sure `uvx` is installed and available in your system path.

```python Python theme={null}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if not shutil.which("uvx"):
        raise RuntimeError(
            "uvx is not installed. Please install it with `pip install uvx` or "
            "`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`."
        )

    asyncio.run(main())
```

```json  theme={null}
Enter the tech sector you are interested in (e.g., AI, semiconductors, cloud computing): AI
