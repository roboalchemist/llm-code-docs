### **Saturday Adjustments**
- **Morning Museum Visit**: Since the weather is sunny in the morning, consider starting your day earlier to enjoy the outdoor surroundings of the museums before heading inside.

- **Evening Performance**: Check the schedule for live performances in advance and consider booking tickets to ensure you have a spot, especially since it will be a chilly evening.

### **General Tips**
- **Dress Warmly**: Remind yourself to dress in layers and wear warm clothing, especially for outdoor activities.
