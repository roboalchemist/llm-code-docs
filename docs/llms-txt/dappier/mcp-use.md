## Overview

The integration of **MCP-Use** with the **Dappier MCP Server** enables developers to build powerful, **tool-augmented AI agents** that connect to real-time, rights-cleared content using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. By combining any LangChain-supported LLM with Dappier’s specialized tools — including live search, AI recommendations, and financial insights — this integration allows you to orchestrate intelligent, real-time assistants using a lightweight, open-source client.

With **MCP-Use**, you can dynamically spin up MCP-compatible agents using just a few lines of Python, connect to multiple tool servers in parallel, and run rich, context-aware workflows that adapt to user input in real time.

## Basic Use Case: MCP-Use + Dappier MCP Server

### Set Up Your Environment

You’ll need API keys for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic) and the Dappier MCP Server.

#### Example `.env` file:

```env  theme={null}
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
DAPPIER_API_KEY=your-dappier-key
```

### Install Required Dependencies

Install the MCP-Use client and your preferred LangChain LLM provider.

```bash  theme={null}
pip install mcp-use langchain-openai  # or langchain-anthropic
```

### Run Your Agent

Here’s a simple example of using `mcp-use` with the Dappier MCP server over an HTTP transport:

```python Python theme={null}
import asyncio
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from mcp_use import MCPAgent, MCPClient

async def main():
    load_dotenv()

    config = {
        "mcpServers": {
            "dappier": {
                "command": "uvx",
                "args": ["dappier-mcp"],
                "env": {
                    "DAPPIER_API_KEY": os.getenv("DAPPIER_API_KEY")
                }
            }
        }
    }

    client = MCPClient.from_dict(config)
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

    agent = MCPAgent(llm=llm, client=client, max_steps=30)

    result = await agent.run("Show me the latest news about Tesla.")
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
