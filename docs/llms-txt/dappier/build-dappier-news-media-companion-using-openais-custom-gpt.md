## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* An OpenAI account
* API access to create and configure custom GPTs
* A **Dappier API Key** (Get it from [Dappier API Keys](https://platform.dappier.com/profile/api-keys))

***

## Step 1: Access the GPT Builder

1. Navigate to OpenAI’s [Custom GPT Page](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor)
2. Log in to your OpenAI account
3. Click on **"Create a GPT"** to begin customization

***

## Step 2: Define GPT Characteristics

### Name

Set the GPT’s name to **Dappier News & Media Companion**

### Description

Use the following description:

> Processes AI-recommended news to summarize, analyze, and react to content dynamically.

### Instructions

This GPT interacts with the **Dappier AI Recommendations API** to retrieve and process AI-powered news content. Upon receiving data from the API, it can perform multiple actions, including:

* **Summarization**: Condenses articles into key points for quick understanding.
* **Reactions & Insights**: Provides top reactions and expert insights based on the article content.
* **Trend Analysis**: Identifies trending topics across different sources and highlights patterns.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Compares multiple articles on the same topic to provide a well-rounded view.
* **Source Evaluation**: Highlights credibility and relevance based on metadata such as publication date, author, and source domain.

Users can specify the type of insights they want, such as **trending news, semantic matches, or the latest articles**. The GPT adapts its response based on API parameters, ensuring accurate and valuable output. It prioritizes **clarity, factual reporting, and relevance** while avoiding speculation.

***

## Step 3: Configure API Integration

### API Endpoint

Your GPT will communicate with the **Dappier AI Recommendations API** at:

```
https://api.dappier.com/app/datamodel/{datamodel_id}
```

### Authentication

Use **Bearer Token** authentication. Include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
```

### Request Body Format

Send queries in JSON format:

```json  theme={null}
{
    "query": "Summarize the latest trends in sustainability and green living."
}
```

### Example API Request (cURL)

```sh  theme={null}
curl -X POST "https://api.dappier.com/app/datamodel/dm_01j0pb465keqmatq9k83dthx34" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "Summarize the latest trends in sustainability and green living."}'
```

***

## Step 4: Configure Capabilities

### Sample Conversation Starters

* **Give me a quick summary of today's top sports news.**
* **What’s trending in lifestyle right now? Summarize the latest insights.**
* **Find and summarize the latest expert advice on pet care.**
* **Show me the most recent updates on sustainability and green living.**

***

## Step 5: Import API Schema

To ensure proper interaction, import the **OpenAPI schema**:
