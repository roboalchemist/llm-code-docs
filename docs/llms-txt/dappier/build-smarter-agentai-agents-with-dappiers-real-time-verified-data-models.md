[**Agent.ai**](http://Agent.ai) is a professional network and marketplace
for AI agents—and the people who love them. It allows users to discover,
connect with, and hire a variety of AI agents to perform useful tasks,
serving as a hub for agent-based collaborations and innovations.

[**Dappier**](https://dappier.com/developers/) is a platform that connects
LLMs and Agentic AI agents to real-time, rights-cleared data from trusted
sources, including web search, finance, and news. By providing enriched,
prompt-ready data, Dappier empowers AI with verified and up-to-date
information for a wide range of applications.

This guide provides a step-by-step process for extracting real-time
search data from Dappier RAG models into a new Agent on the Agent.ai
platform. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure a successful setup.
For the purpose of this guide, we are using Dappier’s Real Time Data RAG
model, available here: [https://marketplace.dappier.com/marketplace/real-time-search](https://marketplace.dappier.com/marketplace/real-time-search)
