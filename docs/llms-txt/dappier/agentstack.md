[**AgentStack**](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack) is a CLI-first framework for rapidly scaffolding AI agent workflows. It helps developers generate agents, tasks, and tool configurations with minimal setup using simple commands. AgentStack supports multi-agent execution engines such as CrewAI and LangGraph and is designed to integrate seamlessly with real-time data tools and observability platforms.

[**Dappier**](https://dappier.com/developers/) is a platform that connects LLMs and Agentic AI agents to real-time, rights-cleared data from trusted sources, including web search, finance, and news. By providing enriched, prompt-ready data, Dappier empowers AI with verified and up-to-date information for a wide range of applications.

## Real-Time Use Cases

The following real-time cookbooks demonstrate how to use Dappier tools inside AgentStack to build fully local, multi-agent workflows. Each example includes project initialization, agent and task setup, tool configuration, and runtime execution with OpenAI and AgentOps integration.

* [**Dynamic Travel Planner**](https://docs.dappier.com/cookbook/recipes/agentstack-dynamic-travel-planner)\
  Generate a travel itinerary for a selected city and date, using Dappier's real-time web search tool. The system retrieves current weather, live events, and hotel deals, then compiles a structured markdown itinerary with daily activity suggestions and booking links.

* [**Stock Market Researcher**](https://docs.dappier.com/cookbook/recipes/agentstack-stock-market-researcher)\
  Build an end-to-end research agent that analyzes public companies using real-time web and financial data. This workflow combines company overviews, financial metrics, peer benchmarking, live stock performance, and categorized financial news into a single markdown investment report.

## Overview

The AgentStack integration with [Dappier](https://dappier.com/) allows developers to enhance their agent workflows with real-time search and AI-powered content recommendation tools. By connecting to Dappier's pre-trained, rights-cleared APIs, agents built with AgentStack can retrieve up-to-date information across domains such as news, weather, finance, sports, pet care, sustainable living, and local events.

This integration includes access to the following tools:

* **real\_time\_web\_search**: Perform real-time web queries across general domains including news, weather, events, and more.
* **stock\_market\_data\_search**: Retrieve live financial news and stock-specific insights.
* **get\_sports\_news**: Access real-time sports news and analysis from top media sources.
* **get\_lifestyle\_news**: Retrieve lifestyle content recommendations from trusted lifestyle publications.
* **get\_iheartdogs\_content**: Surface dog care, behavior, and health tips from iHeartDogs.
* **get\_iheartcats\_content**: Fetch cat care guidance and lifestyle content from iHeartCats.
* **get\_greenmonster\_guides**: Recommend sustainable living content and eco-conscious guides.
* **get\_wishtv\_news**: Access local and national news, sports, entertainment, and multicultural headlines from WISH-TV.

These tools can be selectively added to agents and invoked through natural language tasks. By integrating Dappier with AgentStack, developers can create agents that reason with live, trusted data to deliver context-aware, up-to-date outputs across a variety of use cases.

## Usage with AgentStack

To use Dappier tools inside your AgentStack project, you’ll first need to initialize a new project and then add the Dappier toolset using the CLI.

### Step 1: Initialize an AgentStack Project

Run the following command to scaffold a new project:

```bash  theme={null}
agentstack init my_project_name
```

This will generate a full project structure using crewai

### Step 2: Add the Dappier Tool

To add Dappier tools to your project, run:

```bash  theme={null}
agentstack tools add dappier
```

This will:

* Automatically install the `dappier` Python package (if not already installed)
* Add Dappier’s toolset to your project configuration
* Make the tools available for use inside your agents via the `agentstack.tools["dappier"]` registry

You can then selectively assign tools like `real_time_web_search` or `get_sports_news` to individual agents using helper functions inside `crew.py`.
