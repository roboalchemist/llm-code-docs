# Initialize clients
openai_client = OpenAI()
dappier_client = Dappier()
```

***

## 🛰️ Define the Dappier Tool Function

This function will be called by the LLM to fetch real-time info.

```python Python theme={null}
def dappier_real_time_search(query: str) -> str:
    response = dappier_client.search_real_time_data(
        query=query,
        ai_model_id="am_01j06ytn18ejftedz6dyhz2b15"
    )
    return response.message if response else "No data found."
```

***

## 📋 Define the User Prompt

This prompt instructs the assistant to gather news, weather, and hotel data, and then create an itinerary.

```python Python theme={null}
user_prompt = """
Generate a 2-day travel itinerary for New York City, tailored to real-time weather and current news. Follow these steps:

1. Fetch Current News:
Retrieve the latest news in New York City to include relevant events or updates.

2. Fetch Weather Data:
Retrieve the weather forecast for the upcoming weekend dates.

3. Fetch Hotel Deals:
Retrieve the cheapest hotel deals in NYC.

4. Design the Itinerary:
Use both news and weather insights to create a dynamic itinerary. Include news in the beginning of the itinerary and include weather for each day in the itinerary.
"""
```

***

## 🧠 Define the Tool Schema for OpenAI

We’ll register `dappier_real_time_search` as a callable tool for OpenAI’s function calling.

```python Python theme={null}
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "dappier_real_time_search",
        "description": "Accesses real-time information including news, weather, and more.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Search query (e.g., 'Latest news in NYC')"
                }
            },
            "required": ["query"]
        }
    }
}]
```

## 🤖 Run the Assistant Workflow

This function runs the full interaction: the model decides which tools to use, retrieves the data, and then generates a final response.

```python Python theme={null}
import json

def run_conversation(user_prompt: str):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}]

    # Step 1: Let OpenAI decide on needed functions
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
        tool_choice="auto",
        temperature=0
    )

    response_message = response.choices[0].message

    # Step 2: Call Dappier for each function the model requested
    if tool_calls := response_message.tool_calls:
        messages.append(response_message)

        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
            tool_output = dappier_real_time_search(query=function_args["query"])

            messages.append({
                "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                "role": "tool",
                "name": tool_call.function.name,
                "content": tool_output,
            })

    # Step 3: Final call to OpenAI with all gathered data
    final_response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,
        stream=True
    )

    return final_response
```

***

## 🚀 Generate the Travel Itinerary

Run the full conversation and stream the final response as the itinerary.

```python Python theme={null}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Processing travel planner...\n")

    response = run_conversation(user_prompt)

    print("\n🗓️ Final Itinerary:\n")
    for chunk in response:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end='', flush=True)
```

```json  theme={null}
Processing travel planner...
