## [📄️<!-- --> <!-- -->Filters](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/filters.md)

[MikroORM has the ability to pre-define filter criteria and attach those filters to given entities. The application can then decide at runtime whether certain filters should be enabled and what their parameter values should be. Filters can be used like database views, but they are parameterized inside the application.](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/filters.md)
