# Chat session history

Bito automatically saves the chat session History. The session history is stored locally on your computer. You can return to any chat session and continue the AI conversation from where you left off. Bito will automatically maintain and restore the memory of the loaded chat session.

You can "Delete" any saved chat session or share a permalink to the session with your coworkers.

Here is the video overview of accessing and managing the session history.
