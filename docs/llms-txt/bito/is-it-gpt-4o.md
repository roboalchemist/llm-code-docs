# Is it GPT-4o?

Wondering which AI model you're chatting with on Bito? Let's clear it up.

Bito AI Chat uses the most capable AI models available, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, DeepSeek-V3, o3-mini, and similar cutting-edge models. These advanced models are great for tasks that require long, complex prompts and advanced reasoning.

Bito automatically selects the relevant AI models to provide you with the best possible responses for your queries.

## **But wait... Why does it say GPT-3?** 🤔

At Bito, we use OpenAI's API to integrate both GPT-4o and o3-mini AI models.

If you ask the OpenAI GPT-4o API which model it is, it will still say GPT-3 because GPT-4o was trained using information only up to 2021. So, it might not always recognize itself as GPT-4o. This is a small issue on their part, not ours.

As a result, when you chat with Bito, the chatbox might still display "GPT-3" even though you're using GPT-4o or other advanced models.

You can read more about this issue on the official OpenAI's community forum.

## Example from OpenAI Playground

Here are the screenshots from the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) for their API as of today. In these screenshots, you can clearly see that their API responses for both GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 APIs show "GPT-3."

## **Key Takeaway for Bito Users**

When you use Bito AI Chat, rest assured you are engaging with cutting-edge AI models like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, DeepSeek-V3, o3-mini, and similar advanced models. If the chat displays "GPT-3", it's simply due to how the model identifies itself based on its training data cutoff.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work closely with our AI partners to ensure clarity and precision in our services.
