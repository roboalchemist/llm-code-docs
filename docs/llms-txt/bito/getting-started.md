# Getting started

**The** [**AI Code Review Agent**](https://docs.bito.ai/ai-code-reviews-in-git/overview) **supports two deployment options:**

* [**Bito Cloud (fully managed)**](https://docs.bito.ai/ai-code-reviews-in-git/install-run-using-bito-cloud)

Each option comes with its own set of benefits and considerations.

This guide walks you through both options to help you determine which deployment model best fits your team’s needs.

## Self-hosted service

[**Self-hosted**](https://docs.bito.ai/ai-code-reviews-in-git/install-run-as-a-self-hosted-service) AI Code Review Agent offers a higher degree of control and customization, suited for organizations with specific requirements or those who prefer to manage their own infrastructure.

**Pros:**

* **Full Control:** Self-hosting provides complete control over the deployment environment, allowing for extensive customization and the ability to integrate with existing systems as needed.
* **Privacy and Security:** Keeping the AI Code Review Agent within your own infrastructure can enhance data security and privacy, as all information remains under your direct control.

**Cons:**

* **Setup Complexity:** Establishing a self-hosted environment requires technical know-how and can be more complex than using a managed service, potentially leading to longer setup times.
* **Maintenance Responsibility:** The responsibility of maintaining and updating the software falls entirely on your team, which includes ensuring the system is scaled appropriately to handle demand.
