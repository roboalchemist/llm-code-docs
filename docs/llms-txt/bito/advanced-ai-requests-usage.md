# Advanced AI requests usage

If you are on a paid plan, such as the **Team Plan**, and are the owner or admin of a workspace, you can easily view the **Advanced AI Model requests** (GPT-4o or similar) included for the current month and the number of requests used by your workspace members and AI Agents.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are on the **Free Plan**, this plan does not include Advanced AI Model requests, so this feature is not relevant to your plan.
{% endhint %}

To view your usage, simply visit the [**Settings > Requests Usage**](https://alpha.bito.ai/home/bito-premium/ai-request-usage) dashboard.

## What is an Advanced AI Model Request?&#x20;

Bito uses best-in-class AI models (such as GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and similar models) to offer its services. These are known as **Advanced AI models** and are only accessible through our [paid plans](https://bito.ai/pricing/).

When your **Advanced AI Model Request** quota is used up, [AI Chat](https://docs.bito.ai/ai-code-reviews-in-ide/ai-chat-in-bito) requests will be blocked for the rest of the day and will become available again the next day.
