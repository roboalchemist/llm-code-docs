# Access key

**Bito Access Key** allows for an alternate authentication mechanism in contrast to the standard Email & OTP based authentication. Access Keys can be created via the [Bito Web UI](https://alpha.bito.ai/) and utilized within the [Bito CLI](https://docs.bito.ai/other-bito-ai-tools/bito-cli). This guide outlines the process of creating or deleting an Access Key.
