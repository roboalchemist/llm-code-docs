# Setting AI output language

Bito users come from all over the world, and it makes it super easy to set the AI output language. Bito will automatically generate the text output in the language in your user profile setting, regardless of the prompt input language.&#x20;

Bito allows setting this language when creating an account, as described in [creating-a-bito-account](https://docs.bito.ai/help/account-and-settings/creating-a-bito-account "mention").&#x20;

You can also set or change this setting anytime by going to [**Settings > Profile settings**](https://alpha.bito.ai/home/profile) in Bito Cloud. Here is a quick video walkthrough.&#x20;
