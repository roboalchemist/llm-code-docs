{% hint style="info" %}
Starting with Bito version 1.3.4, the extension is only supported on VS Code versions 1.72 and higher. Bito does not support VS Code versions below 1.72, and earlier versions of Bito do not function properly on these older versions.
{% endhint %}

3. After a successful install, the Bito logo appears in the Visual Studio Code pane.

## Setup Bito extension in VS Code running through WSL

Running VS Code on WSL allows developers to work in a Linux-like environment directly from Windows. This kind of setup is to take advantage of development experience on both operating systems.

WSL provides access to Linux command-line tools, utilities, and applications, to enhance productivity and streamline the development process.

This setup ensures a consistent development environment across different systems, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications that will run on Linux servers.
