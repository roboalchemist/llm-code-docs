# Security

We understand that the security of your payment information is of utmost importance. That's why we have partnered with Stripe, a globally recognized and trusted payment platform, to ensure that your sensitive data remains safe and secure throughout the payment process.&#x20;

## Why Stripe?&#x20;

When you subscribe to our paid plans, we rely on Stripe's robust infrastructure to handle your payment details securely.&#x20;

**Here's why we chose Stripe as our trusted payment handler:**&#x20;

### 1. PCI Compliance&#x20;

Stripe is certified as a Level 1 Service Provider under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). It is the most stringent level of certification available in the payment industry. This means that Stripe adheres to strict security standards and undergoes regular audits to ensure compliance.&#x20;

It ensures that all cardholder data is handled securely throughout the payment journey.&#x20;

&#x20;Rest assured that your sensitive card information is securely handled at all times. Neither Bito nor Stripe stores your sensitive data on their servers. Even our staff cannot access it. Your payment details are safe with us.&#x20;

### 2. GDPR Compliance&#x20;

Stripe also complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and regularly undergoes audits to maintain its certifications.&#x20;

### 3. Secure API Communication&#x20;

All communication between Bito and Stripe occurs through secure APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). These APIs are designed to transmit data in an encrypted format, adding an extra layer of security to the payment process.&#x20;

### 4. Data Encryption&#x20;

All data transmitted to Stripe is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security). This ensures that sensitive information, including credit card details and personal data, is protected during transit.&#x20;

### 5. Secure Card Information Handling&#x20;

Stripe follows the principle of "security by design" and does not store cardholder data on its servers. Instead, it utilizes tokenization, a process that replaces sensitive card information with unique tokens. These tokens are used for subsequent transactions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to card data.&#x20;

This means that even if Stripe's systems were compromised, your original card information would remain safe as the token holds no value to potential attackers.&#x20;

### 6. Intrusion Detection and Prevention&#x20;

Stripe maintains a comprehensive intrusion detection and prevention system to monitor and block any unauthorized attempts to access its systems. Suspicious activities are flagged in real-time, and appropriate action is taken to mitigate potential threats.&#x20;

### 7. Radar Fraud Detection&#x20;

Stripe's Radar uses machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. This intelligent system constantly evolves and adapts to new fraud patterns, providing enhanced protection for Bito's customers.&#x20;

### 8. Continuous Monitoring&#x20;

Stripe conducts regular security assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities and address potential weaknesses in its systems. This continuous monitoring approach allows them to stay proactive in the face of emerging security risks.
