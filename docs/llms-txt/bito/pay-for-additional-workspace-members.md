# Pay for additional workspace members

If your workspace is using the **Free Plan**, your account will not be charged when you invite new members. However, if your workspace has subscribed to the **Team Plan**, each member you invite will be charged based on the price of the **Team Plan** and the number of days and time left in the current month. Additionally, the **600 Advanced AI Model requests** will be added to the total quota of the workspace for each member invited.
