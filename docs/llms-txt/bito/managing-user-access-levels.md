# Managing user access levels

A Bito Workspace represents your organization. It is the highest level of organization in Bito.  &#x20;

In a Bito Workspace, different user types play distinct roles in managing and collaborating within the workspace. Here is an overview of the three user types: **Owner, Admin, and User**. Understanding these roles will help you effectively manage your workspace and optimize team collaboration.&#x20;

**Owner:** The Owner holds the highest level of authority within the workspace&#x20;

**Admin:** Admins have a significant role in managing the workspace alongside the Owner&#x20;

**User:** Users have access to the workspace with limited administrative privileges&#x20;

Here's a table summarizing the roles of the different user types in a Bito Workspace:
