# Example Questions

You can try asking any question you may have in mind regarding your codebase. In most cases, Bito will give you an accurate answer. Bito uses AI to determine if you are asking about something in your codebase.

However, if you want to ask a question about your code no matter what, then you can use our pre-defined keywords such as **"my code", "my repo", "my project", "my workspace"**, etc., in your question.
