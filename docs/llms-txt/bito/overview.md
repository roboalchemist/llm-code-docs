Bito’s [**AI Code Review Agent**](https://bito.ai/product/ai-code-review-agent/) is the first agent built with **Bito’s AI Agent framework and engine**. It is an automated AI assistant (powered by Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.7) that will review your team’s code; it spots bugs, issues, code smells, and security vulnerabilities in Pull/Merge Requests (PR/MR) and provides high-quality suggestions to fix them.

It seamlessly integrates with Git providers such as **GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket**, automatically posting recommendations directly as comments within the corresponding Pull Request. It includes real-time recommendations from Static Code Analysis and OSS vulnerability tools such as fbinfer, Dependency-Check, etc. and can include high severity suggestions from other 3rd party tools you use such as Snyk.

{% hint style="info" %}
We also support **GitHub (Self-Managed)** and **GitLab (Self-Managed)**.

The AI Code Review Agent acts as a **set of specialized engineers** each analyzing different aspects of your PR. They analyze aspects such as Performance, Code Structure, Security, Optimization, and Scalability. By combining and filtering the results, the Agent can provide you with much more detailed and insightful code reviews, bringing you a better quality code review and helping you save time.

The AI Code Review Agent helps engineering teams merge code faster while also keeping the code clean and up to standard, making sure it runs smoothly and follows best practices.

It ensures a secure and confidential experience without compromising on reliability. Bito neither reads nor stores your code, and none of your code is used for AI model training. Learn more about our [**Privacy & Security practices**](https://docs.bito.ai/privacy-and-security).

By accessing Bito's [**AI that Understands Your Code**](https://bito.ai/blog/how-does-bitos-ai-that-understands-your-code-work/) feature, the AI Code Review Agent can analyze relevant context from your entire repository, providing better context-aware analysis and suggestions. This tailored approach ensures a more personalized and contextually relevant code review experience.

To comprehend your code and its dependencies, we use Symbol Indexing, Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), and Embeddings. Each step feeds into the next, starting from locating specific code snippets with Symbol Indexing, getting their structural context with AST parsing, and then leveraging embedding vectors for broader semantic insights. This approach ensures a detailed understanding of the code's functionality and its dependencies. For more information, see [**How does Bito’s “AI that understands your code” work?**](https://bito.ai/blog/how-does-bitos-ai-that-understands-your-code-work/)

The AI Code Review Agent is built using **Bito Dev Agents**, an open framework and engine to **build custom AI Agents** for software developers that understands code, can connect to your organization’s data and tools, and can be discovered and shared via a global registry.

## Why use an AI Agent for code review?

In many organizations, senior developers spend approximately half of their time reviewing code changes in PRs to find potential issues. The AI Code Review Agent can help save this valuable time.

AI Code Review Agent **speeds up PR merges by 89%**, **reduces regressions by 34%**, and **delivers 87% human-grade feedback**.

However, it's important to remember that the AI Code Review Agent is designed to assist, not replace, senior software engineers. It takes care of many of the more mundane issues involved in code review, so senior engineers can focus on the business logic and how new development is aligned with your organization’s business goals.

## Pricing details

The **Free Plan** offers **AI-generated pull request summaries** to provide a quick overview of changes. For advanced features like **line-level code suggestions**, consider upgrading to the **Team Plan**. For detailed pricing information, visit our [**Pricing**](https://bito.ai/pricing/) page.
