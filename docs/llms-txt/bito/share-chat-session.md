# Share chat session

Easily share insights from any [AI Chat](https://docs.bito.ai/ai-code-reviews-in-ide/ai-chat-in-bito) session by creating a unique shareable link directly from the Bito extension in VS Code or JetBrains IDEs.

Whether you need to share AI-generated code suggestions, explanations, or any other chat insights, this feature allows you to create a public link that others can access. The link will remain active for 15 days and can be viewed by anyone with access to the URL, making collaboration and knowledge sharing seamless.

Additionally, you can quickly share your AI Chat session through a pre-written Tweet or an Email.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

* The link will expire in 15 days.
* The session link will be publicly accessible by anyone with the link.
* Recipients can access the chat session in any web browser by using the unique URL.&#x20;
