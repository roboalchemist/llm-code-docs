# Testset Generation

Curating a high quality test dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of your AI application.

## Characteristics of an Ideal Test Dataset

- Contains high quality data samples
- Covers wide variety of scenarios as observed in real world.
- Contains enough number of samples to derive statistically significant conclusions.
- Continually updated to prevent data drift

Curating such a dataset manually can be time-consuming and expensive. Ragas provides a set of tools to generate synthetic test datasets for evaluating your AI applications.
