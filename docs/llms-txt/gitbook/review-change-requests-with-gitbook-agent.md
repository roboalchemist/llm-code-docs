# Review change requests with GitBook Agent

As well as [creating content](https://gitbook.com/docs/gitbook-agent/write-and-edit-with-ai), GitBook Agent can review your change requests to quickly find and fix errors, suggest improvements and more.

The Agent understands the context of the rest of your docs content, and you can also add [your team’s style guide](https://gitbook.com/docs/what-is-gitbook-agent#add-a-style-guide-and-custom-instructions) to ensure it reviews your changes while sticking to your team’s style

### Review change requests with GitBook Agent

You can request a review from GitBook Agent in any [open change request](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests/change-requests-screen) in your organization.

When viewing an open change request, you can select GitBook Agent as a reviewer. Once selected as a reviewer, GitBook Agent will go through your changes, and review for accuracy, clarity, and more — through the context of your published site and style guide.

It will suggest further changes if needed — and if you want the Agent to implement them, you can tell it to do so either [through the chat window](https://gitbook.com/docs/write-and-edit-with-ai#open-gitbook-agent-chat-window-in-any-change-request) or by [tagging it in a comment](https://gitbook.com/docs/write-and-edit-with-ai#tag-gitbook-agent-in-a-comment).

Once you’re happy with your changes, you can [merge the change request](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests#merge) to publish the changes live.

### Update change requests with GitBook Agent

GitBook Agent works with you like another member of your team. [Inside of a change request](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests/change-requests-in-a-space), you can [open the GitBook Agent chat window](https://gitbook.com/docs/write-and-edit-with-ai#open-gitbook-agent-chat-window-in-any-change-request) to start collaborating.

You can ask it to do things like:

* Write new content or expand existing sections
* Fix typos and spelling errors
* Rewrite unclear or outdated explanations
* Review pages for accuracy, clarity, and completeness
* Generate or update code examples
* Identify missing docs or gaps in workflows.
