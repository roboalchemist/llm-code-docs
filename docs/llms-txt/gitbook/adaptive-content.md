# Adaptive content

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on the [Ultimate site plan](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

When a user visits your site, you may already know things about them — such as who they are, which plan they’re subscribed to, and which features they have access to.

Adaptive content helps to build a tailored documentation experience based on who is reading.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adaptive content is slightly different from [authenticated access](https://gitbook.com/docs/publishing-documentation/authenticated-access), although they can work together.&#x20;

While authenticated access allows you to protect your docs through a login, adaptive content customizes published material based on various authentication methods — including authenticated access or those from your own app.
{% endhint %}

### How it works

Adaptive content works in one of two ways:

1. Passing data from your app to GitBook
2. Passing data from authenticated access

When a user visits your sites, we call the data they bring with them their “claims” — basically data that helps to identify a user. These claims are controllable by you — the site author — and can be used through the GitBook editor to show or hide different pages, variants, and sections in your docs.
