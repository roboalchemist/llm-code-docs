# How do I change or replace the favicon for my docs site?

To replace the favicon for your published docs site, head to the site’s dashboard, then click the **Customization** tab at the top of the screen.

In the **Customization** menu’s General tab you’ll see a section called **Title & Icon**. Click the icon to open the palette. Here you can either choose an emoji from the picker, or upload your own image.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The icon will be displayed as a square on the page and in the site’s favicon. We recommend you choose a graphical icon with minimum dimensions of 132 x 132 pixels.
{% endhint %}

Once you’ve chosen your icon, click **Save**. It may take a few minutes for your change to be reflected in your published docs.&#x20;

If you don’t see your new favicon after a few minutes, it may be because your browser has cached the old favicon. Try opening your docs site in a different browser.
