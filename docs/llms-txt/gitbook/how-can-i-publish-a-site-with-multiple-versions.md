# How can I publish a site with multiple versions?

Multivariant content allows you to display different versions (or variants) of your documentation, for example, different language versions such as English and French or documentation for subsequent releases such as 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2.

In the previous versions of GitBook, this was managed through collections. If you have been using GitBook before May 2024 your multi-variant collections were automatically migrated to multi-variant Sites.&#x20;

### How to publish a new multi-variant Site

1. Create a new site or click on a site which should host your multi-variant content
2. Review the already **Linked spaces** in the **Content** tab.&#x20;
3. Click **+** to add a new variant.&#x20;
4. Select the space you want to add as a new variant to your published site.

**Billing:** A multi-variant site is counted as a single published site towards your bill.
