# Install and manage integrations

There are [many different integrations](https://app.gitbook.com/integrations) available in GitBook. From interactive content blocks to advanced analytics tools, your favorite tools are only a click away from integrating with GitBook.

You can install an integration in a single space, multiple spaces, or all the spaces across your organization.

If you install an integration in a single space, it will only work in that specific space. By installing an integration in multiple spaces, you’ll be able to perform actions across all those spaces.

### Install an integration in your organization

Before enabling an integration into a space or site, you'll need to install it in your organization. Start by clicking **Integrations** section in the sidebar on the left.

#### 2. Select the integration and install

Next, click on the integration you want to install. Certain integrations work can be installed for your spaces, and others for your published documentation.

On this screen you can select the areas you would like to install your integration in.
