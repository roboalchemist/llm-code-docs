# Page links

Page link blocks are the best way create relations between different pages within your content. Page links stand out on the page as they fill their own block — compared to a hyperlink added to some text.&#x20;

### Example of page link block

The links below point to [blocks](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks) and [inline content](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/inline):

{% content-ref url="" %}
[](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../formatting/inline" %}
[inline](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/inline)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Representation in Markdown

```markdown
{% content-ref url="./" %} . {% endcontent-ref %}
```
