# Name Squatting Policy

GitBook account names are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and are intended for immediate and active use. Account names may not be inactively held for future use. GitBook account name squatting is prohibited. Inactive accounts may be renamed or removed by GitBook staff at their discretion. Keep in mind that not all activity on GitBook is publicly visible. Staff will not remove or rename any active account.

Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.

If you believe someone's account is violating your trademark rights, you can find more information about making a trademark complaint on our [Trademark Policy](https://gitbook.com/docs/policies/policies/trademark-policy) page.
