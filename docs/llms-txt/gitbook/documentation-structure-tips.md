# How to structure technical documentation: information architecture best practices

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide explains how to plan your information architecture (IA) around real workflows, and structure everything from top-level sections down to page headings and links.
{% endhint %}

Good technical documentation is more than accurate content. It also needs a structure people can navigate fast.

The right documentation structure makes it easy to browse, search, and link related topics. That’s how users find answers when they’re stuck — and how teams keep docs consistent as they scale.

This guide covers documentation best practices for building a clear information architecture. You’ll learn how to organize API docs, product docs, tutorials, how-to guides, FAQs, and changelogs. You’ll also see practical ways to name sections and reduce duplicated content.

## What is information architecture (IA) in documentation?

Information architecture (IA) is how your docs are organized, labeled, and linked. It’s what makes navigation, search, and cross-references feel predictable.

Good IA helps users find answers fast. It also helps your team understand where new content belongs — reducing duplication and making docs easier to maintain.

## Start with user workflows (documentation IA)

Before you start mapping out your docs structure, first talk to other stakeholders and contributors to get their views on the best way to organize your content.

While the ultimate goal is to make it easier for [your users to find what they need](https://gitbook.com/docs/guides/docs-workflow-optimization/documentation-personas), it’s just as important that everyone on the team knows how to contribute to your docs, and don’t have to jump through hoops to do it.

You might want to put together a short Contribution Guide, if your docs setup is complex. Or you might want to consider a new documentation platform with useful tools built in. Some, like [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), include [Git Sync](https://www.gitbook.com/solutions/git-sync), which lets you sync your docs with GitHub or GitLab — allowing technical people to update docs from their code editor, while offering an intuitive but powerful editor for those that prefer it.

Once you’re happy with your setup and your team are on board, you can think about how best to bring all your content together

## Types of technical documentation

The term ‘documentation’ covers a wide array of content — and there’s no reason why you can’t bring all of them into your structure.

To give you an idea, here are a few types of documentation you might already create, or might want to consider as you build your structure

* **API docs/API reference** – If your product uses an API, having API docs or API reference docs helps your users quickly find, explore, test and use it.
* **Quickstart/Explanation** – You may have a quickstart guide at the start of your product docs, or in a standalone section.
* **Tutorials** – Tutorials are learning-oriented. They are practical activities, but the goal is the aquisition of practical knowledge, rather than achieving a specific goal
* **How-to guides** – Guides are goal-oriented. Users will enter the guide with a goal, and the guide should help them achieve that goal.
* **Changelog/release notes** – If you have product documentation, it often makes sense to include a changelog alongside it to show what’s new and point people to the latest docs.
* **FAQs/help center** – If you consider your docs as a support tool, it can be useful to include a help center or FAQ section alongside the rest of your docs.

This is far from an exhaustive list of documentation types. There may be others you want to include in your structure, such as a product blog, a video guides page, or a contributing guide for open source projects.

## How to choose the best technical documentation structure

Of course, there's more than one way to structure documentation. There’s certainly no single right answer that will always work for every product.

However, the two most important factors to consider when deciding on a structure are your product, and your users.

Think about your existing documentation, and any other types you’re considering in the near future. What are the most important to your users, and which will they need the most?

You can build your own structure based on these considerations and conversations with your team. Alternatively, you might want to to turn to an established documentation framework and either use it as-is, or adapt it for your particular use case.

### Use documentation frameworks (like Diátaxis)

Documentation frameworks are designed to create structure within your docs by assigning a role to each piece of content you create.

The most popular and well-known framework is [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr). It sets out a systematic approach to documentation structure that organizes content into four categories — tutorials, how-to guides, reference and explanation.

There’s a lot of specific details about the framework that we won’t get into here, but you can head over to the Diátaxis site to learn more about it, and analyze how easily you could apply it to your own documentation structure.

It’s worth noting that Diátaxis is a great basis for your documentation structure, but you don’t have to follow it to the letter. After all, no framework is perfect. The dividing lines between the different categories aren’t always clear, and in some situations it leans more into theory than practicality.

What we’re saying is that you may want to follow a framework like this to the letter, or you may want to use it as a starting point for developing your own framework. And both of those are totally legitimate approaches.

## How to build a top-level technical documentation structure

Now that we know the theory, let’s put it into practice.

Depending on the structure you’ve chosen, you can now start grouping content together. That might be clearly-defined [sections](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/publishing-documentation/site-structure/site-sections) for API docs, product docs, guides, and FAQs. Maybe it includes a changelog or a blog.

Whatever content groups you create, you now need to think about what most people will want to see first, and what your priories are as a team.

### Make documentation easy to find

Are you focused on improving your onboarding? Make sure docs visitors can easily access your Quickstart guide — or even land there by default. Are most of your support tickets about your API? Make sure it’s clearly labelled and easy to find on your docs site.

### Create a documentation landing page

When people click through to your docs, what’s the first thing they’ll see? Make sure your landing page clearly explains what the user is looking at, and include links to you most popular pages. You might want to use cards and imagery to add some brand.

### Use a navigation bar to organize documentation sections

Most documentation tools let you add all these things to a single website, with a navigation bar to help users switch between different types of docs. Some even let you add drop-down menus to this navigation bar, to group even more kinds of content together.

### Add llms.txt and Markdown for AI-friendly documentation

These two options are important to help AI tools like ChatGPT and Google AI Overview understand the content of your documentation.

llms.txt gives an overview of your entire site structure in an AI-friendly format, while Markdown support makes it easy for the AI to read each page. Some [documentation platforms](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/getting-started/ai-documentation) offer built-in support out of the box.

## Structure documentation at the page and section level

Okay, things are shaping up. You’ve got your top-level docs structure and now it’s time to consider how your content fits into each of those sections

Let’s think about some product docs, for example. How do you decide what order to document the features and processes you can follow? How do you group different sets of features together?

This will depend entirely on what you’re documenting but here are some quick tips:

* **Create page groups** – [Group pages together](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/content-structure/page#page-groups) under titles to bring related subjects together, and make it easier for your users to find the information they need at a glance.
* **Add pages and subpages** – When a topic is large or you need to add things like technical guides that relate to it directly, add them as [a subpage](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/content-structure/page#pages). This creates hierarchy in your docs, but we’d suggest only creating a maximum two levels of subpages — any more and things can become confusin.
* **Use H1-H4 headings** – Add [headings](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/blocks/heading) to your page to denote hierarchy within a page’s content. Give each page an H1 heading at the top, then use H2, H3 and H4 headings to break up ideas. Be consistent about how you use them to make it easier to scan a page for information. Some documentation tools use headings to create [an ‘On this page’ section](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/resources/gitbook-ui#page-outline) that lets you jump between headings fast.
* **Cross-reference** – Linking between related pages is essential. Don’t explain concepts or features on multiple pages — it’s a waste of time, and will become increasingly hard to keep track of and update when things change. Instead, [add links](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/blocks/page-link) to direct people to more information if they need it. Consider adding [a link to a word or concept](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/formatting/inline#links) the first time it appears on the page, but also adding in dedicated links to related content wherever relevant.
* **Use global search** – When you have multiple kinds of documentation (such as API docs, product docs, FAQs etc) on a single docs site, enabling [global search](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/searching-your-content) will help users find what they need without having to click through multiple tabs and pages. Dedicated documentation tools like GitBook [support global search natively](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/searching-your-content).

### Write and structure AI-friendly documentation

Modern docs are read by both humans and AI assistants — so it’s also important that you consider AI best practices when it comes to structuring your docs.

A clean structure makes content easier to chunk, retrieve, and cite correctly, which improves AI answers, reduces hallucinations, and [increases your chances of being mentioned by tools like ChatGPT](https://gitbook.com/docs/guides/seo-and-llm-optimization/geo-guide).

What does that mean in practice? Here are some AI writing best practices you can follow at a content level:

* Use clear, descriptive headings, short sections, and consistent terminology
* Keep key facts in text (not only screenshots)
* Prefer reusable patterns (steps, examples, FAQs)
* Add explicit links between related topics so retrieval has the right context
* When something is versioned or conditional, say so explicitly near the relevant content

## Maintain your documentation structure over time

Now that you’ve got a docs structure you’re happy with and a clear idea of precisely where each kind of content belongs, make sure your team are all on the same page. Create workflows for adding or updating content, share them, and make sure they’re easy to access.

You may also want to consider new workflows for updating your content. If you use GitHub already, you probably already have a review system in place for docs updated. Many documentation platforms, such as GitBook, can [sync your docs to a specific Git repository](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/getting-started/git-sync), and use a similar branch-based workflow for docs.

That means you can set up a process that includes branching, and review and approval steps that encourage collaboration, guarantee the quality of your docs will be maintained, and avoid conflicts.

## Choose a documentation platform that supports strong IA

We’ve mentioned it a few times already, but GitBook has a number of powerful features that make it easy to structure and maintain the quality of your docs.

* **Site sections and site section groups** – Add [multiple content spaces to a single site](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/publishing-documentation/site-structure/site-sections) and organize them into a tabbed navigation bar with drop-down groups if needed.
* **Effortless navigation** – GitBook automatically creates a [table of contents](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/resources/gitbook-ui#table-of-contents) for your docs, with an ‘On this page’ section to make it easy to browse and jump to specific page sections.
* **Global search** – No matter how many kinds of documentation you publish in a single site, you can [search across them all](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/searching-your-content) and use Ask AI to find information fast.
* **GitHub and GitLab Sync** – [Sync your content to GitHub or GitLab](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/getting-started/git-sync) so your developers can update your docs from Git, while less technical team members work in the built-in editor.
* **Branch-based workflow** – Encourage collaboration and protect your primary docs with intuitive branching, including [reviews and conflict resolution](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/collaboration/change-requests).
* **Beautiful out of the box** – Your docs will look incredible in GitBook, even if you just hit publish. But you’ll also get a ton of [customization options](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/publishing-documentation/customization) to build docs that match your brand.
* **Built-in AI Agent** – GitBook Agent can help you optimize your docs structure from the editor. Simply tell it what you need and it can make suggestions or edit your content directly.

And there’s more to GitBook — including [built-in content insights](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/publishing-documentation/insights) and [interactive OpenAPI blocks](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/api-references/openapi) that let your users test endpoints right on the page.
