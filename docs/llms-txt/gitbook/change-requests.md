# Change requests

A change request is a copy of your main content. It comes from the simple concept of [**branching**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell), and will feel familiar to anyone who uses pull requests in GitHub or merge requests in GitLab.

In a change request, you can edit, update and delete elements of your content, request reviews on your changes, then merge them back into your main version to apply all the changes you made.

To learn more about managing open change requests, head to [reviewing change requests](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests/change-requests-screen).

### Open a change request

To start editing content, you’ll need to start by creating a change request. Change requests can be opened:

* By [pressing the **Edit** button in the top right corner](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests-in-a-space#creating-a-change-request) when viewing a space
* By [implementing a new change request with GitBook Agent](https://gitbook.com/docs/gitbook-agent/write-and-edit-with-ai)
* [Automatically by GitBook Agent](https://gitbook.com/docs/gitbook-agent/automatic-documentation-suggestions)
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Make your changes

After a change request is opened, you’re free to make any edits or changes. Changes can be made by working [directly in the editor](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content), or by [working with Docs Agent](https://gitbook.com/docs/gitbook-agent/write-and-edit-with-ai).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Request a review

Once your changes are ready to go, you can request a review from your team in the **Overview** tab. Tagging reviewers in a change request will notify them, and allow you to further collaborate in the change request by directly making more changes in the editor, or discussing changes in [comments](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/comments).

You can request Docs Agent for any reviews, or anyone on your team with the right [permissions](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/member-management/permissions-and-inheritance).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Merge

After your reviews are done, you’ll be able to [merge your changes](#merge) to publish them to your live docs site immediately!
{% endstep %}
