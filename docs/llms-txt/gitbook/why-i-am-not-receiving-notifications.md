# Why I am not receiving notifications?

There can be several reasons why you may not be receiving notifications, which include but are not limited to:

* Our email is in your spam folder or caught by another protection mechanism.
* Emails sent to your email address from GitBook have bounced multiple times. As a result, our mail service has automatically blocked further sending.
* There may be a temporary delivery issue that will be resolved by itself.
* A wrong expectation about the notifications you should be receiving.
* A notification has been sent to an email address different from the one you are currently checking.

If you think you might be running into any of these issues, here are some things you can try:

### Check if you haven't disabled notifications in your settings.&#x20;

Email notifications are enabled by default but can be disabled in [your notifications settings](https://app.gitbook.com/account/notification). When enabled, GitBook will send one email per notification type. This will be sent to the email address associated with your personal GitBook account.

Make sure you have enabled email notifications for the specific notification you want to receive.

### Check your spam or other protection mechanism

Ensure that our email address (`no-reply@gitbook.io`) is not blocked on your end.

### Make sure you are checking the correct email address.

&#x20;Occasionally, users create multiple accounts with similar email addresses. To confirm if you are checking the correct email address, verify which email you have registered with in [your account settings](https://app.gitbook.com/account).&#x20;
