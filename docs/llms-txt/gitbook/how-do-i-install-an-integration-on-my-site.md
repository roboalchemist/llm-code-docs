# How do I install an integration on my site?

To make the distinction between internal content and published content for external readers, we have moved all the actions related to publishing to sites — and that includes integrations.

Integrations that control your visibility settings (such as Azure or Okta for authenticated access) or those that gather analytics on your site traffic (like Google Analytics, Segment, or Fathom) can only be installed on docs sites.

**Permissions:** admins can install an integration in the organization, while creators configure them in sites (and spaces)
{% endhint %}

### How to install integrations on a docs site:

To install an integration on your docs site:

1. Go to the **Integrations** section in the top section of the sidebar.
2. Click the **All spaces and docs sites** dropdown menu and select the site on which you want to install the integration.
3. You’ll see a list of available integrations for the chosen site. Click an integration to open its dedicated page, where you’ll see a modal to confirm that you want to enable the integration.
4. After enabling the integration for your site, configure it by filling in the required details.

### Installing analytics integrations on sites with multiple spaces linked

If you have linked multiple spaces to a single site, please note that integrations related to your published content — such as Google Analytics or Fathom — must be configured for the whole sit&#x65;***.***

This means you cannot collect *separate* analytics for the different spaces linked to a single published site. Instead, a single configuration will apply to the entire site.
