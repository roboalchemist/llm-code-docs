# I can't find where to put my Google Analytics tracking ID

The Google Analytics integration for GitBook allows you to track traffic in your published sites from your Google Analytics dashboard, giving you a fuller picture of how your customers interact across your sites and apps throughout their lifecycle.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure the integration has been configured in **each site** you want to gather insights on.
{% endhint %}

You can input the tracking ID in two ways:&#x20;

* from the sidebar
* from site settings

### Add Google Analytics tracking ID from the sidebar

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab in the sidebar.
2. Access the Google Analytics integration from the list of installed integrations and click on the tab **Configuration.**
3. Next, click **Pick a site** and choose where the integration should run.&#x20;
4. Click on the options menu next to the site name and select **Configure in site**.
5. Add your `UA-XXXXXXXXX-Y`Google Analytics tracking ID in the tracking ID field.

Once complete, your GitBook site should send data to your Google Analytics account. You can verify this by checking your Google Analytics dashboard for incoming data.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please remember that the data might take some time (up to 48 hours) to appear in your Google Analytics dashboard.
