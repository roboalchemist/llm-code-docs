# Do I have to pay to publish a site?

We offer unlimited basic sites for free, however, if you are planning to use custom domains, advanced customizations or any other premium features you will have to upgrade your site to a paid plan.&#x20;

## Are spaces charged?

No, spaces are free as they are internal only. You can create unlimited number of spaces free of charge.

You will only be charged if this space will be connected to a site and published. You cannot publish a space without connecting it to a site.&#x20;
