# Changing organization ownership

### I want to access my organization with *my* different email address&#x20;

If you would like to change the email that your GitBook account is registered to, please navigate to your organization name in top left corner, click **Settings** and then **Account > General.**

You can update your email here. Please don't forget to verify it to prevent future login issues!&#x20;

### I want to transfer my organization to a different user&#x20;

To transfer ownership in GitBook, ensure both you and the new owner are admins, allowing full access to all actions. Generally, all admins have the same rights and can manage billing, users and publishing.&#x20;

If you would like to leave the organiation to fully remove your rights as owner, ask the other admin to remove you from the organization. This means you will loose the access to content.&#x20;
