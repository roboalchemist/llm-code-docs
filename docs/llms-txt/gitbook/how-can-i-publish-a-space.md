# How can I publish a space?

As of May 2024, spaces are now being published as part of a docs site and are not published in a standalone fashion anymore.

When you're ready to publish a space, you can link it to an existing site or create a new site to publish it. This makes the separation between content and publishing clear.

### How to publish a space as a part of a docs site?

1. Go to **Docs sites**
2. Click on **New site**
3. Name your site
4. If you already have a space you'd like to publish, click on **Link an existing space**. Otherwise, you can choose to create a new space.
5. Click the **Publish** button

You can change the visibility of your site under the **Publishing settings.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Ultimate** sites can use additional visibility options such as *share link*, *unlisted* or *Authenticated Access*.
{% endhint %}
