# What happens to my site when I delete a space connected to it?

The deleted space will be removed from the site.&#x20;

The site, along with all its custom settings, will remain accessible for linking with different space(s).

### Single space connected to a site

If your **site** is connected to single space, when this space is deleted it will remain in the trash for 7 days until it's deleted entirely and the content is no longer recoverable.&#x20;

### Multi-variant space connected to a site

If you delete a space connected to a site, all other variants will remain available. You might need to check if your default space (the one visitors will land on) is set correctly.&#x20;
