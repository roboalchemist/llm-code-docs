# Search & Quick find

GitBook’s **Quick find** palette lets you search for content across all your organizations, and jump between them fast.

### Use Quick find

**​**You can open the **Quick find** palette by hitting the **Quick find** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FsR35vdoNcYMz1KzmQ8hM%2Fquick-find-1.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ecb2b113-b737-4fd9-b5f1-730343a78332" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FPnAIpi7l7NOqFoTvAx11%2Fquick-find.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=7b2c5f2d-04d7-44de-9751-3a985679c2a1" alt=""></picture> button at the top of the sidebar or by pressing **⌘ + K** on Mac or **Ctrl + K** on PC.

### Search results <a href="#display-of-results" id="display-of-results"></a>

Results from the space you’re currently in appear at the top, followed by results from other spaces from the organization you’re currently working in — **as well as other organizations** you are a member of.

When you select a search result from an organization, you’ll switch to browsing that organization. To go back, use quick find to select a document in the organization you were in before, or use [the organization switcher](https://gitbook.com/docs/resources/gitbook-ui#the-sidebar) in the sidebar.

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not currently support the ability to prioritize certain content in Quick find results.

### Permissions <a href="#team-permissions" id="team-permissions"></a>

**Quick find** is compliant with your team’s permission settings, meaning that users will only be able to search the content they have permission to access.‌

### Content indexing <a href="#indexation" id="indexation"></a>

We index your content by grouping it into sections. Sections are denoted using [H1, H2 or H3 Headings](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks/heading), with the content that follows them forming part a section.

Each result shows the first three lines of information below the section header. If your section is too big,  your keyword match may not appear in the preview — but don’t worry, quick find still found a match!
