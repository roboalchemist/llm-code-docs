# Which authentication method should I use for Adaptive content?

It depends on how you want to control access:

* Need public + private content? → Use Signed Cookies
* Simple personalization without auth? → Use URL Parameters
* Entire site private? → Use Authenticated Access Integration
* Already use feature flags? → Use Feature Flag provider
