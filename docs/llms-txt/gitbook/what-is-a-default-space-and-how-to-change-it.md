# What is a default space and how to change it?

When your **Docs site** has multiple spaces linked to it , it is referred to as a multi-variant site. This allows you to publish different language versions or product versions under one domain.

In your **Docs Sites** dashboard, under the **Spaces** section, you will see one of your spaces labeled as **Default**.&#x20;

This indicates that this space is the first one visitors see when they visit your URL.

### Changing the default site

To change the default space:

1. Navigate to the **Spaces** section of **site** settings.&#x20;
2. Click on the option menu (three vertical dots) next to the space you want to designate as the default, and then select **Set as default space**.
