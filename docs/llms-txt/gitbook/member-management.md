# Member management

You can [invite and remove members](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/member-management/invite-members-to-your-organization) from your organization, manage members’ content access through [roles](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/member-management/roles), and manage [teams](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/member-management/teams) of members from the members’ page in your organization’s settings.

## Members & permissions

Shows each person’s role, last seen date, and SSO status, if applicable. You’ll also see an overview of the [spaces](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/content-structure/space) they can access and, if you’re on the Pro plan, how many [teams](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/member-management/teams) they’re part of.

Click the **Teams** or **Access** listings for any member to jump to a list of all those teams and spaces.

You can also click on any member to open their **individual member page**. Here, you can see more information about them, including their join date and active status.

Select the **Teams** and **Spaces** tabs to see a list of the [teams](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/member-management/teams) they’re a member of, and the spaces they have access to — as well as their access level for those specific spaces.
