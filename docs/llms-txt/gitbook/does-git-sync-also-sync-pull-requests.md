# Does Git Sync also sync pull-requests?

No, our integration with both GitLab and GitHub don't sync pull-requests (PRs). This means that if you create a PR in GitHub, this won't create an equivalent CR in GitBook.

Vice-versa is also true: creating a CR in GitBook doesn't create a PR in GitHub/GitLab.
