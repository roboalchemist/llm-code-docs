# Where can I find my invoices, and update billing details?

GitBook uses Stripe for billing. To access your invoices:

1. Click **Settings** at the bottom of your sidebar
2. Click **Organization Settings**
3. Click **Billing** → **Manage Billing** (redirects you to Stripe)
4. Navigate to **Invoice History** and click the arrow (↗️) next to any payment to download

#### To update billing information:

In the billing portal, click **Update Information** in the information section.&#x20;

You can add additional email addresses, for example, your finance department details here. This address will receive invoices but won't have GitBook access.&#x20;

**Important:** Please update billing details *before* making a payment.&#x20;

We cannot change company information on invoices that already have been paid.
{% endhint %}
