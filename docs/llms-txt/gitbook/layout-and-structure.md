# Layout and structure

### Header

**Search bar**

Change the position and look of the search bar between prominent (centered in the header) and subtle (located in the upper right corner). Turning off the header entirely will place the search bar in the sidebar instead.

**Navigation**

Add header links to your site. You could use header links to point to important parts of your documentation, or link back to your main website.

You can choose what appearance you would like your link to have—normal link, primary button, or secondary button. When enabled, simply add a title and a URL for each link. We support two levels of header navigation, meaning you can have sub‑links that appear in a dropdown menu.

### Announcement (Premium & Ultimate)

Toggle this option on to add an announcement banner to the top of your published site. You can add a message and optionally include a link and call to action, which will appear after your message in the banner.

You can also change the announcement style using the same options as hint blocks—Info, Warning, Danger, and Success. The color of these styles is determined by your semantic colors settings.

### Pagination

Control the display of the “previous” and “next” buttons that appear at the bottom of each page in your space. You can also set this feature for specific pages.

### Footer (Premium & Ultimate)

**Logo**

Add your logo or another image in the footer.

**Copyright text**

Add copyright information to your footer.

**Navigation**

Add links in your footer, organized into multiple sections. Similar to the header, add a title and URL for each link, and include a section title for each group of links.
