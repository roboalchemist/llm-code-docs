# Why am I seeing “We couldn’t load the integration” in GitBook?

If you see this message, the most common cause is an ad blocker or privacy extension preventing the integration from loading.

How to fix it:

1. Temporarily disable your ad blocker or privacy extension and reload the page.
2. If you don’t want to disable it entirely, add GitBook (and the services it uses) to your extension’s allowlist.
3. Refresh the page to check if the integration loads correctly.
