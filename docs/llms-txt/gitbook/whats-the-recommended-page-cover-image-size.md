# What’s the recommended page cover image size?

The ideal cover image size is 1990 × 480 pixels (px). Cover images will be locked to this aspect ratio, so these proportions will be maintained as much as possible across different screen sizes.

Read more about page options and covers in [our documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/creating-content/content-structure/page#page-options).

### Setting a custom cover height

When in edit mode, you can increase or decrease the height of a page cover by dragging the drag handle at the bottom of the page cover (or focus the handle and use <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> ).

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you set a custom height, it will no longer be locked to the aspect ratio of 1990 × 480. Instead, the cover will behave responsively across different screen sizes. Follow the steps below to revert back to the fixed ratio.
{% endhint %}

#### Resetting the custom cover height

If your cover has a custom height, a button appears in the **Page options** menu to reset it. Use it to revert to the default fixed-proportions behavior:

* Click the **Cover options** button on the cover image.
* In the menu that shows, click **Reset height**.
