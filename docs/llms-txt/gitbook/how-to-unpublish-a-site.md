# How to unpublish a site?

You can unpublish an entire site or remove a linked space, anytime. This action does not affect your billing. To adjust the number of sites, go to the billing tab in your organization settings.

### Unpublish a site

1. Navigate to the **Docs Sites** option in the left-hand panel under the **Home** section.
2. Select the specific **site** you wish to unpublish by clicking on it.
3. Locate the **Unpublish** option under the title of your docs site. Click on this option and **confirm** your decision to unpublish the site.&#x20;
4. Once confirmed, the site will not be accessible to external visitors.&#x20;

**Multiple spaces linked?**&#x20;

To remove a linked space from your site without unpublishing the entire site, navigate to the settings menu in the top right corner of the **site** dashboard. Scroll down to the content section, then select **Remove from Site.** This will unlink the space from the site, without deleting your content.
