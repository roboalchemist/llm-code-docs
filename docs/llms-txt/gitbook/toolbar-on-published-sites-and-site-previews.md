# Toolbar on published sites and site previews

When viewing your live docs site, you may see a toolbar appear at the bottom of the browser window. It provides quick access to useful options with a click:

* Open the editor to view and edit your site’s content
* Open your site’s settings in GitBook
* Open your site’s customization settings
* View your site’s insights

{% hint style="warning" %}
The toolbar is **only visible to logged-in members of your GitBook organization**. Site visitors who are not members of your GitBook organization **will not see the toolbar**.
{% endhint %}

You will also see a slightly different version of the toolbar when you [open a preview URL for your site](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests#preview-a-change-request) from the GitBook app, allowing you to jump back into the app to add feedback or continue editing.

#### When does the toolbar appear?

You will see the toolbar in the following situations:

* Viewing your live site while logged into GitBook
* Previewing earlier versions of your site through your [version history](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/version-control)
* Previewing links for proposed changes, such as in a [change request](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests) created in GitBook or a pull request created through [Git Sync](https://gitbook.com/docs/getting-started/git-sync/github-pull-request-preview)

#### Can I hide the toolbar?

Yes. By clicking the last button on the toolbar, you can choose between different options to change how the toolbar is displayed:

1. **Minimize:** This reduces the toolbar to a small orb. To expand it again, you only have to click it.
2. **Close for one session:** Fully removes the toolbar in the current tab until you close it.
3. **Don't show again:** Hides the toolbar and remembers your choice. You can restore the toolbar by clearing your browser’s local storage.
