# What does GitBook’s trial include?

The free trial allows you to test GitBook’s features, start onboarding your team, and create or import your content while testing all advanced features such as advanced customization, AI answers and controlled access to your site.

### How do I start a free trial?

Your trial will start only once you have published your Site to an audience or if you invite additional team members to your organization, regardless of their user permissions.

### Do I have to provide a payment method to start a free trial?

No! We don't ask for any payment information during your free trial. If you decide to upgrade after your trial, we will ask for a payment method.

### How can I check the time remaining on my free trial?

You can see the remaining trial time in the banner at the bottom of your sidebar.

Alternatively, you can click on the settings icon, which is located at the bottom of the sidebar, and then click on **\[organization name] settings**. This will take you to the general tab of that organization’s settings page.

From there, click on the **plans** tab. You will see a banner on the plans page that tells you how many days remain on your free trial. This is also where you can switch your plan if required.

### Which features can I test during the free trial?

You can test all of the features of the Ultimate plan. Your site feature access will depend on which site type you choose when creating a site.

Please take a look at [our pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) to compare all of the features of our plans.

### What happens at the end of my free trial?

After the trial finishes, you will be asked to select your plan or given an option to downgrade to free. You will have a chance to review your users and published sites before proceeding to payment and adding in your payment information.

### Can I extend my free trial?

If you have a **large organization** and you are interested in the **Enterprise** plan, we offer additional assistance in migration and onboarding including longer trials.&#x20;

Please get in touch via <sales@gitbook.com> and we’ll go discuss your requirements.
