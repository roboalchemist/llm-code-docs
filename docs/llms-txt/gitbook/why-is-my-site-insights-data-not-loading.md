# Why is my Site insights data not loading?

If your Site insights dashboard isn’t loading, it’s usually because an ad blocker or privacy extension is blocking the analytics scripts.&#x20;

How to fix it:

1. Temporarily disable your ad blocker or privacy extension and reload the page.
2. If you don’t want to disable it entirely, add GitBook (and the services it uses) to your extension’s allowlist.
3. Refresh the page to check if the insights load correctly.
