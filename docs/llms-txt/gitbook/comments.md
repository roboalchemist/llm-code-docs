# Comments

Comments allow you to provide feedback around specific pieces of content — without switching out of context from GitBook.

### Add a comment <a href="#comment-within-your-content" id="comment-within-your-content"></a>

You can open the comments panel by clicking on the **Comments** button <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FEkQbWdMgE720SJxq4lyv%2Fcomment%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=733ae21c-3791-4f12-8ffe-839c8b9e0f1a" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FwY5tC7wFYA0IYlJqzZjb%2Fcomment.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=29d1a323-d832-4791-bb2c-ae13e24ee04c" alt="The Comments button icon in GitBook"></picture> in the [space header](https://gitbook.com/docs/resources/gitbook-ui#space-header).

Adding a comment here will attach a comment to the entire page. You can also comment on a specific block by hovering over a block and clicking the content icon that appears on the right.

You can tag teammates by typing the `@` symbol followed by their name.

{% hint style="info" %}
Guests will be able to make comments but they will not be able to see or mention other users in the organization.
{% endhint %}

### Comment threads

You can reply to any comment to start a conversation with your teammates, turning it into a discussion thread.

You can also leave an emoji reaction on any comment by clicking the emoji button on the message or thread you’d like to react to.

### Resolving comments

If you’re done working through a comment thread or idea, you can **resolve** a comment at any time. Resolving a comment will hide it in the interface, but still keep it accessible in the ’Resolved’ tab of the space’s comments section.
