# What does “Page not found” mean in insights?

“Page not found” in insights means users tried to visit a page in your documentation that doesn’t exist. The table only counts visits to your default “Page not found” page.

To see which specific URLs are broken, go to **Site insights → Broken URLs**. There you can see how many visitors each broken link had and create redirects if needed.
