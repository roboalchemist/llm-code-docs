# I was charged for an unexpected upgrade

Plan upgrades in GitBook always require user confirmation through a pop-up modal that clearly shows the plan details and pricing before processing payment. However, certain actions can trigger these upgrade prompts:

* Publishing a site with Premium or Ultimate features enabled
* Adding custom domains or advanced customizations

If you believe you were charged in error, please contact our support team with your receipt number. We can review the specific circumstances.

To avoid unexpected charges in the future, carefully review any upgrade prompts before confirming, and familiarize yourself with your current plan's feature limits.
