# GitBook UI

GitBook is split into different sections to make it easier to organize and manage the content you create.

### Sidebar

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FMINl0qBtvGV3pt8G3bnZ%2FCleanShot%202025-12-10%20at%2010.02.40.png?alt=media&#x26;token=57f3871d-67b0-432e-b646-8b5e5a073aaa" alt=""><figcaption><p>The GitBook sidebar holds all of your documentation, as well as notifications, the search bar, snippets and more.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

The sidebar allows you to see and overview of your GitBook organization at a glance. The sidebar contains:

* **Organization switcher**\
  If you’re a part of multiple organizations, you can see and switch between them here. You can also create a new organization from this menu.
* **Notifications**\
  When you’re tagged in a comment or conversation, or when there is important activity in a space you’re working in, you’ll get a [notification](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/notifications) to show you what’s new.
* **Ask or search**\
  Powered by [GitBook AI](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/searching-your-content/gitbook-ai), you can ask questions in natural language, or search through the different spaces and content in your organization.
* **Home**\
  The Home page allows you to see everything your team is working on at a glance. View open change requests, discussions and comments, recent page edits and more.
* **Docs sites home**\
  Click this to visit the overview page for all the docs sites you have created in your organization.
* **Integrations**\
  GitBook [integrations](https://github.com/GitbookIO/public-docs/blob/main/content-editor/editor/broken-reference/README.md) supercharge your content, allowing you to embed more into your pages, or add information to your knowledge base from other apps.
* **Docs sites**\
  Toggle this section to view all the [docs sites](https://gitbook.com/docs/publishing-documentation/publish-a-docs-site) in your organization right in the sidebar and jump to one with a click.
* **Spaces**\
  The spaces section is where you’ll find the [collections](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/content-structure/collection) and [spaces](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/content-structure/space) you create when adding more content. Head to our [content structure](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/content-structure) section to find out more.
* **Settings**\
  You’ll find [personal settings](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/account-settings) and [organization settings](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/organization-settings) at the bottom of the sidebar. Here, you can also toggle light/dark mode, or get help from our support team if needed.
* **Trash**\
  Deleted spaces appear in the trash. You can restore them for up to seven days — after that, they’re permanently deleted.

### Table of contents

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FZYKSwnzcZOkqVA2xgRlX%2FCleanShot%202025-12-10%20at%2010.07.01.png?alt=media&#x26;token=47cb70e3-4cee-4fdd-8247-28a04e75f92e" alt=""><figcaption><p>The table of contents lists all the pages and links in your selected space.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

By default, the table of contents shows a list of [pages, links, and groups](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/content-structure/page#organizing-your-content) that make up a space. You’ll find it to the right of the sidebar. It’s specific to the space you’re currently viewing.

The table of contents is also where you can view and manage [resuable content](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/reusable-content) and [files](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks/insert-files) for your space.

From the **Pages** tab in the table of contents you can:

* Create new [pages](#pages) and subpages
* Create [page groups](#groups)
* Add [external links](#external-links)
* Access [the Actions menu](#the-actions-menu) <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt=""></picture> for individual pages.

In the **Reusable content** tab, you can:

* View and search through the reusable content in the space

* Drag and drop reusable content onto the page
* Rename and delete reusable content

In the **Files** tab, you can:

* View, search and reorder the files in your space
* Drag and drop more files into your space
* Manage individual files

If you want to give more focus to the content of your page, you can temporarily hide the table of contents by hovering your cursor next to it and clicking the **Hide** button <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FgXIVpUPXn7bJ2SWzgFzd%2Fpanel%20left%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=424e246d-05bd-4d49-a287-bfc6fb38174b" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F0goJ97jfVBvH656kUK0d%2Fpanel%20left.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=cb31d43b-804c-4c4f-b5bb-e71db0d03860" alt="The Hide button icon in GitBook"></picture> that appears. To make it appear again, hover your cursor near the edge of the page and click the **Show** button <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FNWbU09fwPj4NJK1clKmm%2Fpanel%20right%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=35d1e4d0-bc5d-406f-a1e8-c3808acc4d30" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FwOFmEqy96fMvDPjqjAED%2Fpanel%20right.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2f39279a-cd05-48a3-8985-d07ec08663ba" alt="The Show button icon in GitBook"></picture>.

### Space header

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F2Z5NSb3mmbMRoWqONncm%2FCleanShot%202025-12-10%20at%2010.08.48.png?alt=media&#x26;token=da8f53b3-d134-46e1-84d1-db3c1e1eb3cd" alt=""><figcaption><p>The space header sits at the top of the editor, and offers options that apply to the whole space.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

The space header contains information about the space you’re currently viewing. It lets you do things like publish and share your space, view the comments and history for the space, configure [GitHub or GitLab sync](https://gitbook.com/docs/getting-started/git-sync), and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The space header is adaptable**, and changes depending on the space and mode you’re currently in.

For example, if you’re editing a [change request](https://gitbook.com/docs/collaboration/change-requests), you will see an overview of the change request, alongside options to open the editor, view changes and merge your change request.&#x20;

If you’re viewing a read-only space, you will need to open a new change request to edit the content of the page as live edits are locked.
{% endhint %}

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FrTr3IxB9SPupw4YedgqL%2FCleanShot%202025-12-10%20at%2010.11.01.png?alt=media&#x26;token=772809ef-1b4b-453f-9ce4-64883cfc292c" alt=""><figcaption><p>The space header inside a change request.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Site header

The site header contains information about the site you’re currently viewing. It lets you do things like view site insights, customize your site, change its settings and preview the site in different modes and screen sizes. You can also configure integrations and manage members’ access.

### Content editor

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FxpmoPcLU6kfep6QsXlxi%2FCleanShot%202025-12-10%20at%2010.18.49.png?alt=media&#x26;token=af2b3315-f6e0-4a12-b853-1cbbd5e0e0e9" alt=""><figcaption><p>Write content and add blocks in the GitBook editor.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

The editor is the main part of your space, where you can write or insert content in GitBook. It supports multiplayer, meaning you and your team can collaborate on changes in real-time.

You can insert [content blocks](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks), type [Markdown](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/markdown), [embed content](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/blocks/embed-a-url), and collaborate on changes with [GitBook Agent](https://gitbook.com/docs/gitbook-agent).

In addition to working on changes, you can also comment on blocks, tag teammates, and more.

### Page title and description <a href="#page-title" id="page-title"></a>

At the top of each page you can set a **title**, add an optional **emoji**, and write a **description**. The title you use will appear in the table of contents, and forms your page’s URL slug when published.

Your page description can be a maximum of 200 characters long, and will act as the preview text for your page in search engines.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can change the URL slug for a page by choosing **Page Actions** <picture><source srcset="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FQ4IsWwmEEi5QM7PSXNsN%2Factions%20-%20dark.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=ebff54f4-9825-4ab0-99bc-633e1c449371" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="https://1050631731-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2F89MTSo5XRpPMVr1T0rxS%2Factions.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=2b5d001e-560a-4f29-8d22-de8163725ca1" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> > **Rename**.
