# How can I contribute to GitBook’s Documentation?

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our documentation! Any contribution you make will be reviewed by our team.

The official developer docs for GitBook are hosted on <https://gitbook.com/docs/>. Our documentation uses one of GitBook's most useful features—[Git Sync](https://gitbook.com/docs/product-tour/git-sync)!

Git Sync allows you to keep your GitBook site up to date with a remote repository either on GitHub or GitLab. In our case we have the our repository `public-docs` synced with <https://gitbook.com/docs/>.

This means that any changes reviewed, approved, and merged into this directory will automatically be deployed!

Head to our repository below to get started.
