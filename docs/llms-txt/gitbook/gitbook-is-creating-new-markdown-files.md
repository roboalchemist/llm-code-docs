# GitBook is creating new markdown files

**When synchronizing and editing from GitBook** with an existing Git repository, GitBook may create new markdown files instead of using the existing ones.‌ This is done to ensure GitBook doesn't overwrite files that already exist in your repository.

These files are also automatically added and referenced to your SUMMARY.md file.
