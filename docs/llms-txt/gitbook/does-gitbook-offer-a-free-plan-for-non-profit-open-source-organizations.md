# Do you offer a free plan for non-profits and open-source organizations?

We welcome applications for our free community plan from organizations that meet certain criteria.

Broadly, these fall into one of three categories:

* Non-profit organizations
* Open source projects
* Small education-related groups

[Read our criteria and how to apply community plan](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/plans/community) in our docs.&#x20;

The plan has access to all Ultimate features except SAML SSO.&#x20;
