# Change or update my custom domain in GitBook

You can easily update your custom domain through your site settings:

1. Navigate to your **Docs Sites** in the left sidebar
2. Select the site where you want to change the domain
3. Click **Settings** at the top of the site page
4. Go to **Domain and URL** section.
5. You can either:
   * Remove the current domain and add a new one
   * Edit the existing domain configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
**Remember** to update your DNS settings with your domain provider to point to the new GitBook configuration. The process is the same as the initial setup - you'll need to create a CNAME record pointing to the value GitBook provides.
{% endhint %}
