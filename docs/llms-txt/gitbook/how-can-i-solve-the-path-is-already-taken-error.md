# How can I solve the "path is already taken" error?

In GitBook, each slug is designed to be unique within the context of your **entire organization**. This means that each path can only be used in one site to prevent conflicts, even if it belongs to different multi-variant sites.

This is a question frequently asked by users who are using multi-variant sites to display language versions as slugs, such as: `"en"` or `"fr".`The slugs will not work if they are already used somewhere else.&#x20;

We recommend using slightly varied slugs, ensuring they are unique yet meaningful and related to your content.&#x20;
