# Why I am not receiving emails from GitBook?

There can be several reasons why you may not be receiving emails from us, which include but are not limited to:

* Our email is in your spam folder or caught by another protection mechanism.
* Emails sent to your email address from GitBook have bounced multiple times. As a result, our mail service has automatically blocked further sending.
* There may be a temporary issue with the delivery that will resolve by itself.
* An email has been sent to a different address than the one you are currently checking.

We recommend checking your spam or junk folder and ensuring that GitBook (`no-reply@gitbook.io)` is added to your email's safe senders list.&#x20;

You can also verify if you are checking the email associated with your GitBook account by checking [your account settings](https://app.gitbook.com/account).
