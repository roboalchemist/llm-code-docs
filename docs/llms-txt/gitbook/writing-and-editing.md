## Why are pages in the app not loading?

If the GitBook app is not loading or crashing on certain pages, it’s usually because an ad blocker or privacy extension is blocking certain functions in the app.

How to fix it:

1. Temporarily disable your ad blocker or privacy extension and reload the page.
2. If you don’t want to disable it entirely, add GitBook (and the services it uses) to your extension’s allowlist.
3. Refresh the page to check if it loads correctly.

## What's the difference between a space and a docs site?

In GitBook, **space** is your primary content area, containing its own set of pages, assets, and historical revisions. It's where you create, edit, and manage your documentation.

A **docs** **site**, on the other hand, is a newer concept designed to specifically handle the aspects of publishing and rendering that content.&#x20;

While spaces focus on content creation and storage, sites manage how that content is presented and accessed publicly, providing a clear division between content management and content delivery.&#x20;

## Can I edit GitBook on a smartphone?

Currently, GitBook does not support editing on smartphones. While you can access your organization and view content using a smartphone, editing features are only available on a laptop or computer. To make any changes, you’ll need to use a desktop or laptop device.

## Does GitBook support Right To Left?

Unfortunately, we do not currently support RTL contributions. \

Only paragraphs and headings will automatically detect RTL text and adapt its layout. Lists and other content blocks may not be properly aligned. You may also notice a poor font quality being used for your language.
