# Why my Adaptive Content segments aren't working or showing in preview?

If your segments aren’t working properly, check the following:

* Confirm your visitor schema is correctly defined
* Verify that your segment JSON matches the schema structure
* Ensure the condition applies to the section, page or block you’re testing
* Use the preview feature from the correct page
* Try refreshing the preview after making schema changes
