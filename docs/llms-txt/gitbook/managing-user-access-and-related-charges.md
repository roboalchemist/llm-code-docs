# Managing user access and related charges

## When I invite a new member, when will I be charged?

GitBook’s pricing is based on the number of members in an organization, and our [pro rata billing policy](https://gitbook.com/docs/account-management/plans/billing-policy) helps to ensure that you pay for the correct usage. For monthly plans, you can add or remove members at any time and the change to your bill will be included on your next monthly invoice. For yearly plans, the same applies — however, if your pending charges exceed a certain amount, we’ll invoice straight away.

It is important to note that you ***won’t*** go through ***another checkout process*** when adding a new member to your organization.

## Are guests or readers free members?

Access permissions do not affect members' price, so guests or readers cost the same as other users.&#x20;
