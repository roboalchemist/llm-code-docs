## AWS [#AWS]

### Taking backups to AWS [#taking-backups-to-aws]

#### 1. Steps to follow in AWS [#aws-steps]

<Note>
These steps are similar to the secure s3 setup as described in ["Accessing S3 data securely"](/cloud/data-sources/secure-s3), however, there are additional actions required in the role permissions
</Note>

Follow the steps below on your AWS account:

<Steps headerLevel="h5">

##### Create an AWS S3 bucket [#create-s3-bucket]

Create an AWS S3 bucket in your account where you want to export backups.

##### Create an IAM role [#create-iam-role]

AWS uses role based authentication, so create an IAM role that the ClickHouse Cloud service will be able to assume into, to write to this bucket.

- a. Obtain the ARN from the ClickHouse Cloud service settings page, under Network security information,  which looks similar to this:

<img src="https://files.buildwithfern.com/clickhouse.docs.buildwithfern.com/5c141aa63406fb779a20f3c6a0cd03d747faaecc9539c0836806b422911e4046/images/cloud/manage/backups/arn.png" alt="AWS S3 ARN"/>

- b. For this role create the trust policy as follows:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "backup service",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS":  "arn:aws:iam::463754717262:role/CH-S3-bordeaux-ar-90-ue2-29-Role"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Update permissions for role [#update-permissions-for-role]

You will also need to set the permissions for this role so this ClickHouse Cloud service can write to the S3 bucket.
This is done by creating a permissions policy for the role with a JSON similar to this one, where you substitute in your bucket ARN for the resource in both places.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::byob-ui"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::byob-ui/*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::byob-ui/*/.lock"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Steps>

#### 2. Steps to follow in ClickHouse Cloud [#cloud-steps]

Follow the steps below in the ClickHouse Cloud console to configure the external bucket:

<Steps headerLevel="h5">

##### Change external backup [#configure-external-bucket]

On the Settings page, click on Set up external backup:

<img src="https://files.buildwithfern.com/clickhouse.docs.buildwithfern.com/a9ab47059cd23222de47a9e027857aea8fcdfd13f3fffbf8d5792c895bb41c94/images/cloud/manage/backups/change_external_backup.png" alt="Change external backup"/>

##### Configure AWS IAM Role ARN and S3 bucket details [#configure-aws-iam-role-arn-and-s3-bucket-details]

On the next screen provide the AWS IAM Role ARN you just created and the S3 bucket URL in the following format:

<img src="https://files.buildwithfern.com/clickhouse.docs.buildwithfern.com/811fb5c1b2079eaea719575626383119df2a3bfc6ca7a92109adb25962c33f8d/images/cloud/manage/backups/configure_arn_s3_details.png" alt="Configure AWS IAM Role ARN and S3 bucket details"/>

##### Save changes [#save-changes]

Click on “Save External Bucket” to save the settings

##### Changing the backup schedule from the default schedule [#changing-the-backup-schedule]

External Backups will now happen in your bucket on the default schedule.
Alternatively, you can configure the backup schedule from the “Settings” page.
If configured differently, the custom schedule is used to write backups to your
bucket and the default schedule (backups every 24 hours) is used for backups in
the ClickHouse cloud owned bucket.

##### View backups stored in your bucket [#view-backups-stored-in-your-bucket]

The Backups page will display these backups in your bucket in a separate table
as shown below:

<img src="https://files.buildwithfern.com/clickhouse.docs.buildwithfern.com/509a2cc90d43bf68e3f08bc64e38fae4da7cc78788b75c35185e8c9ccd9cdc2b/images/cloud/manage/backups/view_backups.png" alt="View backups stored in your bucket"/>

</Steps>

### Restoring backups from AWS [#restoring-backups-from-aws]

Follow the steps below to restore backups from AWS:

<Steps headerLevel="h5">

##### Create a new service to restore to [#create-new-service-to-restore-to]

Create a new service to restore the backup to.

##### Add service ARN [#add-service-arn]

Add the newly created service’s ARN (from the service settings page in Clickhouse
Cloud console) to the trust policy for the IAM role. This is the same as the
[second step](#create-iam-role) in the AWS Steps section above. This is required
so the new service can access the S3 bucket.

##### Get SQL command used to restore backup [#obtain-sql-command-to-restore-backup]

Click on the “access or restore a backup” link above the list of backups in the
UI to get the SQL command to restore the backup. The command will look like this:

<img src="https://files.buildwithfern.com/clickhouse.docs.buildwithfern.com/e17e153255bb57d9cc0e1b7220f9484b2bf23f0e11ff7357918202ad16370159/images/cloud/manage/backups/backup_command.png" alt="Get SQL command used to restore backup"/>

<Warning title="Moving backups to another location">
If you move the backups to another location, you will need to customize the restore command to reference the new location.
</Warning>

<Tip title="ASYNC command">
For the Restore command you can also optionally add an `ASYNC` command at the end for large restores.
This allows the restores to happen asynchronously, so that if connection is lost, the restore keeps running.
It is important to note that the ASYNC command immediately returns a status of success.
This does not mean the restore was successful.
You will need to monitor the `system.backups` table to see if the restore has finished and if it succeeded or failed.
</Tip>

##### Run the restore command [#run-the-restore-command]

Run the restore command from the SQL console in the newly created service to
restore the backup.

</Steps>

## GCP [#gcp]

### Taking backups to GCP [#taking-backups-to-gcp]

#### Steps to follow in GCP [#gcp-steps-to-follow]

<Steps headerLevel="h5">

##### Create a GCP storage bucket [#create-a-gcp-storage-bucket]

Create a storage bucket in your GCP account to export backups to.

##### Generate an HMAC Key and Secret [#generate-an-hmac-key-and-secret]

Generate an HMAC Key and Secret, which is required for password-based authentication. Follow the steps below to generate the keys:

- a. Create a service account
  - I.  Navigate to the IAM & Admin section in the Google Cloud Console and select `Service Accounts`.
  - II. Click `Create Service Account` and provide a name and ID. Click `Create and Continue`.
  - III. Grant the Storage Object User role to this service account.
  - IV. Click `Done` to finalize the service account creation.

- b. Generate the HMAC key
  - I. Go to Cloud Storage in the Google Cloud Console, and select `Settings`

  - IV. Choose the service account you created in the previous step from the dropdown menu.
  - V. Click `Create key`.

- c. Securely store the credentials:
  - I. The system will display the Access ID (your HMAC key) and the Secret (your HMAC secret). Save these values, as
       the secret will not be displayed again after you close this window.
