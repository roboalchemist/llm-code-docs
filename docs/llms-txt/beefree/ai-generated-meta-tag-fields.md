Read this technical documentation to learn more about how to configure AI [generated titles, meta descriptions for pages, preheaders, and subject lines for emails](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/advanced-options/meta-tags) within your host application.

### Overview

AI addresses common issues in crafting effective subject lines, pre-headers, and titles, such as vague messaging, lack of urgency, and limited personalization. By utilizing AI, users can generate compelling copy for email campaigns and landing pages. The key benefits include optimizing title formats for character count and mobile responsiveness, avoiding common mistakes, and expediting the copy creation process. This tool aims to enhance efficiency in marketing endeavors by providing a solution to errors commonly encountered in title and subject line composition. The feature is applicable to both Page and Email applications within the builder.

### Prerequisites

* Beefree SDK Superpowers or Enterprise plan subscription
* OpenAI API Key
* [Activated OpenAI AddOn](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/addons/partner-addons/openai-addon) within your Beefree SDK Developer Console

### Configuration Steps

This section outlines the steps for configuring this feature within your host application.

2. Add the `metadataGeneration` parameter
3. Set the parameter to `true` is your configuration code

The following code displays an example of the enabled feature.

```javascript
addOns: 
[{
    id: "ai-integration",
    settings: {
        tokensAvailable: tokensAvailable,
        tokensUsed: tokenCounter,
        tokenLabel: 'tokens',
        isPromptDisabled: (tokenCounter >= tokensAvailable) ? true : false,
        isSuggestionsDisabled: false,
        isUpsellEnabled: true,
        metadataGeneration: true  // Enabled by default
    }
}, ],
```

### Disable AI Generated Meta Tag Fields

To disable the AI Generated Metadata feature, set `metadataGeneration` to `false` in your code.

The following code sample displays the disabled feature.

```javascript
addOns: [{
    id: "ai-integration",
    settings: {
        tokensAvailable: tokensAvailable,
        tokensUsed: tokenCounter,
        tokenLabel: 'tokens',
        isPromptDisabled: (tokenCounter >= tokensAvailable) ? true : false,
        isSuggestionsDisabled: false,
        isUpsellEnabled: true,
        metadataGeneration: false
    }
}, ]
```

### Multi-Language Templates Compatibility

AI-Generated Titles, Descriptions, Preheaders, and Subject Lines are compatible with Multi-language templates.

To use both Multi-language templates and AI-Generated Titles, Descriptions, Preheaders, and Subject Lines, take the following steps:

1. Perform the Multi-language Configuration Steps
2. Perform the AI-Generated Titles, Descriptions, Preheaders, and Subject Lines Configuration steps
3. Test the AI-generated content in a few different languages
4. Confirm everything works as intended

#### Language Recognition Methods

The system identifies which language to use for AI-generated Titles, Descriptions, Preheaders, and Subject Lines based on the following conditions and methods, ordered by priority:

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Priority</th><th>Condition</th><th>Language Recognition Methods</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><a href="https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/other-customizations/multi-language-templates">Multi-language Template</a> is enabled</td><td>AI creates content in the selected translation language</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Language selector has a value</td><td>If Multi-Language Templates is not active, AI detects language using the 
HTML language dropdown in the side panel</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>No explicit language is set</td><td>If the language dropdown is empty or missing, AI 
detects which language to use for details based on the main content (eg email body)</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Troubleshooting

If AI-driven generation fails, check the OpenAI AddOn configuration. Ensure your OpenAI API key is working properly, and that the AddOn is configured correctly within your Beefree SDK developer Console.

### Additional Considerations

* Customers will be billed through their OpenAI accounts for AI generation-related features. This is done through connecting their OpenAI API key in the Beefree SDK Developer Console.<br>
