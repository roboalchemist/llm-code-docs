00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,200
Hey everyone. Well, we are so on 
time—we're actually one minute

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,280
early. That rarely happens. So thanks, everyone,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:16,640
for joining. We’ll give folks another 
minute or two to get settled in and log in.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,520
Hello to everyone who's already here, and hi to 
Francesco and Andrea. Thank you for joining today.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,960
For anyone who’s new here, make sure you 
find the chat box on the right. We can’t

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,880
see you—unfortunately—but we can interact with 
you through the chat. So feel free to say hi!

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,720
Hello, hello. We’re always curious—again, we 
can’t see you—but we’d love to get to know you

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:04,000
a bit. We were just chatting about vacation plans 
earlier while waiting for the session to start.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,000
Hi, Ashwin! If you all don’t mind sharing, let 
us know where you’re joining from and if you have

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,880
any fun vacation plans this summer. Ashwin, 
where are you from? I also see Jesse typing.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,160
Francesco, are you doing anything 
fun for vacation this year?

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,040
Oh, yeah, definitely. I'm going to Greece.
Ooh, nice! I’ve been wanting to go to

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
Greece for the past—I don’t know—six, 
seven years. And finally, I’m doing

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,680
it. Never been there before.
That certainly counts. Nice.

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,120
Oh, we've got Ashwin tuning in from India.

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:55,760
Hello—and good evening to you! It’s 
a late one. Thank you for tuning in.

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Hello also to folks joining 
from Washington and Florida.

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:16,800
All right, it’s 2 minutes after the hour, so 
let’s get started. Francesco, Andrea—you ready?

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
Okay, awesome.

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Welcome everyone to today’s spotlight session. 
We're really thrilled to have you with us

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,560
because we’re talking about something exciting. 
And yes—we might be biased—but it’s a very cool

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,760
topic. Today we’ll chat about how you can 
bring QA tools into your application and

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,400
help your users create error-free 
emails using the latest Beefree SDK

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,920
features. We recently released some powerful 
updates that enhance your QA functionality.

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,640
Quick intro—I’m Betina. I run the 
product marketing team here at Beefree,

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,120
and I get the pleasure of hosting this session. 
I’m joined by these two wonderful humans:

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
Andrea and Francesco, who are developers on 
the Beefree app side. If you didn’t know,

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,560
the Beefree app is our end-user-facing 
implementation of the Beefree SDK. So

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,640
Francesco and Andrea work with the SDK a 
lot. They're basically in the same shoes

30
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,080
as you are, which makes it especially exciting 
to have them share their experience with us.

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,480
Here’s what you can expect today:

32
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,480
We’ll start with context—why 
error prevention and QA matter.

33
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,000
Then we’ll give an overview of two 
new features that power your QA tools:

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
the Check API and Front-End Commands.

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:09,440
Then, we’ll turn it over to Francesco 
and Andrea for a live demo showing

36
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,840
how to build QA tools into your app.

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,240
We’ll wrap with a Q&A.

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,440
Let’s jump in.

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:35,680
At Beefree, we care deeply about 
designing beautiful assets. But

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,080
even the most gorgeous landing page 
or email campaign can’t perform

41
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,240
if it’s riddled with mistakes. And it’s 
surprisingly easy to make mistakes.

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:01,200
Those of you who’ve been in the space for a 
while know how easy it is to create a design

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:18,311
that gets clipped in Gmail, forget to add a link 
to a CTA, or upload images that are too large

44
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:22,831
and slow to load. All small mistakes—but 
with big consequences for performance.

45
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,720
So, we asked ourselves: how can 
we help you (and your end users)

46
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,480
catch these mistakes before they happen?

47
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,320
I want to show you the end result.

48
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:03,360
What you're seeing here is a nice-looking 
email in the editor. Looks great! But under

49
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:12,240
the hood, there are issues. We’ve built a 
QA tool that catches these. For example,

50
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:24,480
buttons with missing links, 
images that are over 1MB. With the

51
00:06:31,200 --> 00:07:37,680
tool, users can click directly on the 
affected element and fix it immediately.
