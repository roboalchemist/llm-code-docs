```
1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,640
What if you could build forms without 
the usual headaches? What if you could

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,960
give users an easy no-code form builder 
while still keeping full control over

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,120
everything happening behind the scenes? 
Introducing the Form Block, available

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,640
for both page and pop-up builders with various 
pre-built templates and customization options.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,000
The form block is easy to integrate for 
developers and intuitive to use for end users.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,400
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to 
make the most of the form block. First,

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,080
we'll show you how to enable the form block 
inside the Beefree SDK developer console. Next,

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,080
we'll guide you through how to create 
a prebuilt default form for your users

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,000
that they can quickly customize 
for any landing page or pop-up.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,520
Next, we'll guide you through two examples of how 
to use the content dialogue managed form method.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,960
The first example demonstrates how to trigger 
a custom-built UI that interacts with Beefree

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
SDK and provides end users with a form 
library they can choose from. The second

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,360
example walks through how to load your UI 
for form creation on top of the builder so

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,080
you can load forms into Beefree SDK 
from those custom user interfaces.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,120
And finally, we'll show you how the form block 
allows your end users to customize their form

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,040
directly inside the builder, making it flexible 
and easy to use—no coding required. By the end

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,320
of this video, you'll see how Beefree simplifies 
form building for everyone. Developers can set

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,280
up default templates while the SDK ensures 
a smooth experience for end users to edit

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,800
and customize forms effortlessly. We'll also 
provide three sample forms and a readme to help

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,320
you explore this feature. You can find them in 
our GitHub repo linked in the video description.

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
First, let's enable the form block feature. 
You can enable the form block feature from

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,600
the Beefree SDK dashboard by heading to your 
page builder application and clicking details.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
From there, you can click configure application,

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,760
then scroll to the bottom of the page 
until you find the content section.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,120
Then click the checkbox to enable the 
form content block, hit save changes,

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,720
and confirm. Now that this is enabled, you can 
maintain full control over data processing,

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,240
default form customization, and overall 
behavior, which leads us to the next section.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,400
It's important to remember that in order 
for the form block to appear in the builder,

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
you must enable it in the console 
and then pass a form to the

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360
default form parameter in the Beefree SDK 
configuration. If either step is missing,

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
the form block will not appear. To ensure this is 
done correctly, you can always reference the form

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,920
validation schema for creating your own form, 
which I've linked in the video description.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,960
Next, we'll show you how to pre-build 
default forms your end users can easily

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,960
drag and drop into the builder and 
then customize however they like.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,760
There are two methods to enable your 
users to add forms in Beefree SDK.

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,560
The first method is bypassing in the 
configuration parameters a single default

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,840
form, potentially including all the fields your 
application supports, and then having customers

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,280
customize and style forms with our form content. 
The second method is about implementing a content

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,320
dialogue on top of the form content block 
and building a user interface on top of the

40
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,640
builder so users can either browse and select 
prebuilt forms or build a new form altogether.

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
Let's show you how to do both. As mentioned,

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,360
the simplest way to allow users to add forms 
in the Beefree SDK is by including a single

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,520
default form in the configuration parameters. 
The final product can look something like this.

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,520
This is a car loan pre-approval banking form. 
You can see that you can add your full name here,

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,080
your credit score range, your car 
make and model, loan amount requested,

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,000
and whether it's a used or new car. Now let's head 
to the code to show you how we implemented this.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,200
It's important to note that in this example, 
the JSON has been pre-pasted into the default

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,800
form object. You can access this JSON through 
the link provided in the video description.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,280
First, let's scroll down to the Beefree 
configuration because this is the most

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,360
important part of implementing the form 
block. If a developer does not include

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,640
this default form parameter in their code, it 
will not be available in the builder. Here,

52
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,840
you'll notice that I have my auto loan preapproval 
form here, and you'll need to ensure you have the

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,960
right structure within your JSON for your 
form to load properly for your end users.

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
Make sure to check out the GitHub repository, 
as we mentioned earlier, linked in the video

55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,520
description. That's where you'll find the 
validation schema to ensure you're using

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,360
the correct properties when creating forms within 
the default form parameter. In our example here,

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,400
you can see the structure we've created, which 
includes structure, then title, description

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,280
fields, and all the different fields we have here. 
These are all properties that exist within the

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,120
validation schema. Then you also have layout, 
which you can see here. Finally, attributes.

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
This layout is super important because if 
we navigate back to the end user experience,

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,280
we want to ensure this add new field button 
is visible. This won't appear if you don't

62
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,640
have this layout section in your code, as well 
as these fields defined in this section here.

63
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,080
After the submit button, you'll also 
notice number, long text, data list.

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,720
All of these different properties have to be 
defined, and part of their definition is the

65
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,360
data type, the label, the options, the 
attributes, and then remove from layout.

66
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Another important thing to remember is if 
I go over here, you'll notice that I have

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,720
a few true or false Boolean options 
here. The option can be removed from

68
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,640
layout. If this is set to true, then in 
the builder you'll have the delete button

69
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,080
available here, and it's clickable so 
your end user can delete any field.

70
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
A few other options you can 
customize are remove from layout,

71
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
so if this is set to false, when the default 
form is dragged and dropped onto the stage,

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,960
it automatically includes the first and last 
name fields. This can be modified. So if you

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,720
want your users to be able to edit different 
fields in the form, you set this to true.

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,680
For example, if we want to give the end user 
the ability to modify their credit score range,

75
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,280
we can copy "can be modified: true" and 
paste it here and save this. Then if we

76
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,320
head to the builder and drag and drop our 
form onto the canvas, then click on it,

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,040
you'll notice that credit score range has an edit 
option here that we can click on and now edit.

78
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Now let's cover the second way you 
can enable forms for users in Beefree

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,120
SDK. This method uses content dialogue 
and a custom UI on top of the builder,

80
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,480
which allows users to browse and select from 
any number of pre-built forms. Here's my code,

81
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,120
and you can see I have Beefree 
config and content dialogue.

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Content dialogue is the parameter that 
needs to be added to the Beefree config

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,920
to activate the button that says 
edit label. If we scroll down,

84
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,600
you'll notice that within content dialogue 
we have this section here, manage form. This

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,880
object is crucial and needs to be included 
in order for this implementation to work.

86
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,320
It includes a label which triggers the content 
dialogue, and it says edit form right now,

87
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,080
which is what we want it to say. But if we wanted 
to change this text to say something different,

88
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,840
like "select form" for instance, I can 
simply edit this label here. Then I

89
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,200
have some logic that I use to manage 
the different forms that I've added.

90
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,720
Basically, what's happening here is 
that when the content dialogue modal

91
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
is triggered by an end user clicking 
the edit form button, they have the

92
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,880
option to select one of these three different 
forms: the auto loan form, the mortgage form,

93
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,880
or the credit card form. Now let me show you 
what this experience looks like on the front end.

94
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,160
Here we have the same template as before, 
and let's say we want to add a form at the

95
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,640
bottom of the page. We can drag and drop the 
form block. To change the form type, your end

96
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:34,960
user can head to the edit form button and select 
any of the form variables we previously created.

97
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Now we're going to show you how to load 
your UI for form creation on top of the

98
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,880
builder. That means your users will be 
able to create a new form and add it

99
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,240
to the web content they're building without 
interrupting their workflow. Let me explain.

100
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
In this example, we want to give the user 
the power to build their own custom forms.

101
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,680
The experience looks like this: The end 
user drops the form block onto the stage

102
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,360
and then clicks edit form to enter the 
form builder. This is a custom-built form

103
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,920
builder that I created showcasing what 
the host application is truly capable of

104
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,320
implementing. You can get super creative 
with how you design this experience.

105
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,800
Now let's create a simple form for a personal 
loan. To do so, we can click on each field and

106
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,560
modify the text to match the information we 
want to capture. Once we're done, we can hit

107
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,600
save form. The form will then automatically load 
inside the builder. If I click into the form,

108
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,640
I can still make changes like editing 
or deleting fields, for example. And if

109
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,120
we scroll back up and click edit form, I can 
always go back and add new fields if I choose.

110
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,640
Now, if we go to the code, let's look at what 
is working behind the scenes. At a high level,

111
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,560
this advanced implementation builds on the same 
basic concepts as before with one key addition:

112
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,760
a new variable called form structure.

113
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
When a user creates a form, it is passed 
through the content dialogue modal that

114
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,560
appears when the end user clicks edit form. 
This form data is then passed to default form,

115
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,280
which is how it's able to load in the builder.

116
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,560
This approach gives developers and technical 
teams the flexibility to apply different logic,

117
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,280
customize configurations, and create a similar 
experience tailored to their end users' needs.

118
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,520
To recap, here's a quick comparison of the two 
form block implementation methods. Method one,

119
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,280
the quick setup, requires no content dialogue 
or custom UI. It just takes three steps:

120
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,760
Enable the checkbox in the Beefree SDK 
developer console, add the default form

121
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,440
parameter in the Beefree configuration, and 
pass valid JSON in the default form field.

122
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,520
This loads the form automatically 
when users drag and drop the block.

123
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,920
Method two is the custom setup. It uses content 
dialogue and a custom UI. For more flexibility,

124
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,440
choose method one for simplicity or 
method two for a more tailored experience.

125
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,960
Okay, now let's talk about what your end users 
can do with the front-end customization of

126
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,680
the form block. When an end user drags 
the form block onto their landing page,

127
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,960
the sidebar provides full customization controls.

128
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,640
As we showed earlier, you can start by selecting 
a form using the edit form button, which allows

129
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,040
your end users to choose from prebuilt forms. 
Other customization options include layout,

130
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,440
which lets you set the width, alignment, font 
family, weight, and size to match the page design.

131
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,160
Manage fields lets you add, edit, 
or rearrange up to 10 field types,

132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,440
including multiple choice, email, 
drop-down, phone, and text fields.

133
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
Label options allow you to format label text,

134
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,760
choose top or side positioning, and 
adjust width when using side labels.

135
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,560
With field options, you can 
customize background color,
