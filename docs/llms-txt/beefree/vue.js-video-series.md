The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,200
To get started, navigate to developers.beefree.io. 
This will be your essential hub for everything

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
related to the Beefree SDK. In the top-right 
corner of the window, click Create a Developer

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,840
Account, then fill out the form to create 
your first developer account with Beefree.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,800
You’ll notice there’s also a link 
to the Beefree app as a standalone

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
tool. However, this video series focuses on 
the Beefree SDK as an embeddable solution.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,760
Once you’ve created your account and logged 
in, you’ll be taken to a screen that looks

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,760
something like this. At the top-right, you’ll 
find links to support and documentation.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,880
In the main section, you’ll see the 
type of subscription you’ve chosen,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
along with four activation options: Email Builder, 
Page Builder, Popup Builder, and File Manager.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,160
This is where you’ll activate the SDK instance 
that will later run within your application.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Let’s do that now by clicking Activate 
for the Email Builder application.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,880
On the next screen, you’ll be prompted 
to name your application. I’ll call

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,240
mine Test Email 1. You can choose any 
name you like. Once you click Create,

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
you’ll see your running SDK instance. 
Here, you’ll find the application name,

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,040
client ID, subscription type, and a Details 
button. Let’s go ahead and click on Details.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Inside the details screen, you’ll see important 
information such as the environment type,

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,480
creation and update dates, and configuration 
options. From here, you can change themes,

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,320
manage roles, and manage add-ons. 
One of the key features of the SDK

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,400
is that it provides two critical pieces of 
information: your Client ID and Client Secret.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,120
Don’t worry—we’ll delete these 
credentials after this video. You’ll

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,480
also see references to some of our APIs, 
like the HTML Importer, Content Services,

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,000
and the Template Catalog API. All of these 
can be accessed from this single screen.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,600
This area is known as the Beefree 
Developer Console. As mentioned,

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,520
this is where you’ll find your Client ID and 
Client Secret, which are used for authorization.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Since they’re sensitive credentials, you 
should never share them. If necessary,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
you can regenerate them using the 
Regenerate button on this screen.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Finally, in this video series, we’ll demonstrate

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,240
a client-side authorization process for 
simplicity. But when moving to production,

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,280
you’ll want to implement server-side 
authorization for added security.

### Quickstart Guide: Vue.js No-code Email Builder (Part 2)

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xHfpMoxg2k>" %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
This Quickstart Guide walks you through embedding the Beefree SDK’s no-code email builder into a Vue 3 application. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a fully functional Vue app running locally with the builder embedded, authenticated, and ready to use—following Vue best practices.

PART 2: introduction to installing the Beefree SDK with a Vue Application
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transcript" %}
The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,560
Hi developers, this video covers working 
with the Bin a Vue.js application. If your

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,440
framework of choice is React or Angular, we have 
separate videos for those as well. In this video,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,040
once we have you clone a sample 
Vue.js application from GitHub,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,280
we'll then go through how to install the 
Beefree SDK itself. Then we'll look at

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,840
taking care of authentication with a proxy 
server. We'll show you how to embed the SDK

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,880
in the Vue.js application. And finally, how 
to run and test your application locally.

### Quickstart Guide: Vue.js No-code Email Builder (Part 3)

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DstfPbGt6bI>" %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
This Quickstart Guide walks you through embedding the Beefree SDK’s no-code email builder into a Vue 3 application using the /loginV2 authorization process. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a fully functional Vue app running locally with the builder embedded, authenticated, and ready to use—following Vue best practices.

PART 3: in this video, you'll learn how to:

* Clone the Beefree React demo repository from GitHub
* Configure your environment by running npm install + adding your client ID and secret
* Learn how the SDK is initialized and managed
* Authentication process using a proxy server.
* Launch the application locally to see the embedded Beefree editor in action
  {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transcript" %}
The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
0:00:01.440,0:00:06.080
The first thing we want to do is navigate to 
the Beefree View Demo available on GitHub,

0:00:06.080,0:00:18.880
and go ahead and clone this repository.

0:00:18.880,0:00:29.360
Once you have that cloned, install the 
Beefree SDK using the following NPM command.

0:00:29.360,0:00:34.800
That didn’t take long at all. Let’s talk for a 
moment about authentication. Secure authentication

0:00:34.800,0:00:40.080
is essential for a production environment. In 
the application provided, we leverage loginV2

0:00:40.800,0:00:46.000
to secure the Client ID and Client Secret and 
ensure they’re not exposed in frontend code.

0:00:46.000,0:00:56.000
First, open the .env.ampl file and rename it 
to .env, which is what our program expects.

0:00:57.040,0:00:59.883
Replace the placeholders with your actual Client 
ID and Client Secret from the developer console.

0:00:59.883,0:01:01.120
Next, open proxyServer.js to see how this is 
implemented. After importing .env, the Client

0:01:01.120,0:01:22.880
ID and Secret are referenced securely on the 
backend, and the token is accessed server-side.

0:01:22.880,0:01:28.160
At this point, in our sample VGS application, 
we have installed the Beefree SDK via NPM, and

0:01:29.280,0:01:33.040
handled authorization to your Beefree 
account through the proxy server. Now,

0:01:34.480,0:01:38.320
let’s embed the Beefree SDK 
editor within the application.

0:01:38.320,0:01:43.600
Similar to the Angular example, we use a 
custom component. We’ve created one called

0:01:43.600,0:01:50.720
BeefreeEditorView. In the TypeScript file, 
starting on line 15, we define the BConfig. On

0:01:50.720,0:01:59.440
line 28, we access the authorized token, and with 
that token, we instantiate the editor on line 37.

0:01:59.440,0:02:04.080
Now the SDK is embedded in a 
component and ready to use—but

0:02:04.080,0:02:11.040
we won’t see it yet because it hasn’t 
been added to the view. Go to AppView

0:02:12.000,0:02:19.200
and import the BeefreeEditorView component 
so it’s rendered in the parent component.

0:02:20.080,0:02:23.840
Everything is now in place to run 
the application locally. Open two

0:02:23.840,0:02:27.600
terminal windows. In the first, 
install a few critical packages:

0:02:28.560,0:02:30.640
express for the web server

0:02:30.640,0:02:32.880
axios for making requests

0:02:32.880,0:02:36.080
cors to handle cross-origin requests 
between the proxy and the app

0:02:36.080,0:02:44.160
Once installed, run the proxy server with node

0:02:44.160,0:02:54.480
proxyServer.js. In the other terminal, 
start the application with npm run dev.

0:02:54.480,0:03:02.240
The app will be served at localhost:5173. 
Open that in your browser, and you’ll see your

0:03:02.240,0:03:12.080
application running. In the center, the Beefree 
SDK email editor is embedded and ready to use.

0:03:12.080,0:03:14.400
You’re ready to start editing.

```
