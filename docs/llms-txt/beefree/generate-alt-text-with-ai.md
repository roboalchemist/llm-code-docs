## Limit the Usage <a href="#limit-the-usage" id="limit-the-usage"></a>

After you complete the configuration, the Alternate Text Generation with AI tool will be available to your end users. At this point in the process, the tool is offered for free to your end users. Take the steps outlined in this section to limit the usage of this feature for your end users.

The `onInfo` call in the following code snippet updates the usage limits for the Alternate Text Generation with AI feature. When AI-generated alternate text is used, the `infoMessage.detail.consumedImages` field indicates how many images were processed. This number is added to `imagesCounter`, which keeps track of the total images used so far. The backend processes images in bulk, so `imagesCounter` reflects the cumulative count of `consumedImages` from a single backend call. The refreshed settings ensure that the `isIconDisabled` property is updated if the image usage limit (`imagesAvailable`) is reached, and the settings are reloaded with `bee.loadConfig(refreshedUsageSettings)`.

If you’d like to limit the usage of the Alternate Text Generation with AI tool, take the following steps to configure usage limitations.

1. Implement the `onInfo` call

Sample code `onInfo` call:

```javascript

else if (handle === 'ai-alt-text') {
            imagesCounter += infoMessage.detail.consumedImages
            const refreshedUsageSettings = {
              addOns: [
                {
                  id: "ai-alt-text",
                  settings: {
                    imagesAvailable: imagesAvailable,
                    imagesUsed: imagesCounter,
                    isIconDisabled: (imagesCounter >= imagesAvailable) ? true : false,
                    isUpsellEnabled: isUpsellEnabled,
                  }
                },
              ],
            }
            // Reload Config
            bee.loadConfig(refreshedUsageSettings)
          }

```

2. Confirm the AddOn handle is `ai-alt-text`

The following sample code shows `imagesCounter` and `imagesAvailable`, which determine how many images you have used, and the image limit the host application setup for users, respectively.

```javascript

let imagesCounter = 0
let imagesAvailable = 5

```

**Note:** In this example, the end user can only make five requests in total, after the fifth request, the end user will no longer be able to generate alternate text. The number five is defined in the configuration and can be customized. For example, if `imagesAvailable` is set ten, the end user will be able to perform ten requests.

3. In the AddOn settings, `isIconDisabled` is configured to automatically disable the Alternate Text Generation with AI feature when the counter reaches zero. However, through the [Token Upselling](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/builder-addons/partner-addons/ai-writing-assistant/token-upselling) notification banner, application end users will have the opportunity to purchase more images and regain access to the feature.

```javascript

  // Check which addon
        const handle = data.detail.handle
        if (handle === 'ai-alt-text') {
          imagesCounter += infoMessage.detail.consumedImages || 1
          const refreshedUsageSettings = {
            addOns: [
              {
                id: "ai-alt-text",
                settings: {
                  imagesAvailable: imagesAvailable,
                  imagesUsed: imagesCounter,
                  isIconDisabled: imagesCounter >= imagesAvailable,
                  isUpsellEnabled: isUpsellEnabled,
                }
              },
            ],
          }
          bee.loadConfig(refreshedUsageSettings)
        }

```

## Display the Usage Widget <a href="#display-the-usage-widget" id="display-the-usage-widget"></a>

To display the widget usage, take the following steps:

1. The call looks for `imagesAvailable` value and `imagesUsed` value
2. To activate the display usage widget, provide the usage data via the AddOn settings. Since the editor doesn’t track usage, you’ll need to refresh the values via the `bee.loadConfig` method to keep the display widget data current

```javascript
let imagesCounter = 0
let imagesAvailable = 1000
let isUpsellEnabled = true

const beeConfig = {
  ...
  addOns: [
    {
      id: "ai-alt-text",
      settings: {
        imagesAvailable: imagesAvailable,
        imagesUsed: imagesCounter,
        isIconDisabled: false,
        isUpsellEnabled: isUpsellEnabled,
      }
    },
  ],
  ...
  onInfo: function (data) {
    if (data.code === 1000) {
      const handle = data.detail.handle
      
      if (handle === 'ai-alt-text') {
        imagesCounter += data.detail.consumedImages
        const refreshedUsageSettings = {
          addOns: [
            {
              id: "ai-alt-text",
              settings: {
                imagesAvailable: imagesAvailable,
                imagesUsed: imagesCounter,
                isIconDisabled: (imagesCounter >= imagesAvailable),
                isUpsellEnabled: isUpsellEnabled,
              }
            },
          ],
        }
        bee.loadConfig(refreshedUsageSettings)
      }
    }
  },
}
```

**Note:** If either of the settings `imagesAvailable` or `imagesUsed` are not sent, the application will not show the consumption.

## Advanced Permissions <a href="#advanced-permissions" id="advanced-permissions"></a>

This section discusses advanced permissions for your application users. You can use the two settings `IsIconDisabled` and enabled to configure permissions for your end users. To configure both booleans, take the steps outlined in the subsequent sections.

#### Disable Prompts Per User <a href="#disable-prompts-per-user" id="disable-prompts-per-user"></a>

To disable prompts per user, perform the following:

1. Set `isIconDisabled` to true

```javascript

{
                id: "ai-alt-text",
                settings: {
                  isIconDisabled: true
                }

```

**Note:** The end user will be able to see the button, but will not be able to use the button through setting the `isIconDisabled` setting to true

You can reference the difference in appearance in the following images.

Image 1.0 displays an example of the wand when the feature is not active.

<figure><img src="https://806400411-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F8c7XIQHfAtM23Dp3ozIC%2Fuploads%2F60pkVUXzSDkoR62czsu2%2F2image.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c05a41c8-fc04-4cf5-b201-d628d4f0f26b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Image 2.0 displays an example of the AI wand icon when the feature is active.

<figure><img src="https://806400411-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F8c7XIQHfAtM23Dp3ozIC%2Fuploads%2FRzF5jKAbfmO4UX8ruMwY%2F3image-1.png?alt=media&#x26;token=17b002e2-3986-4796-9178-12352f7846fd" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Disable AddOn Per User <a href="#disable-addon-per-user" id="disable-addon-per-user"></a>

To disable the AddOn completely for an end user, perform the following:

1. Set the `enabled` field to `false`

```javascript

const beeConfig = {
    ... 
    addOns: [
      {
        id: "ai-alt-text",
        enabled: false
      },
    ],
    ...
}

```

## Feature Limitations <a href="#feature-limitations" id="feature-limitations"></a>

Ensure you familiarize yourself with the following feature limitations to ensure this AddOn is suitable for your application’s needs:

* You can generate the caption for an image multiple times, but you’ll always get the same result for the alternate text
* The AI model does not work well with PNG or SVG images with transparent backgrounds, especially when the outline is black
* Only available in English
* Not available for Multi-language templates
* Images must have URLs and be publicly accessible
* Only available for static images, not available for dynamic images
* Not available for custom AddOn of image type

## Billing <a href="#billing" id="billing"></a>

Unlike the OpenAI AddOn, the Alternate Text Generation AddOn does not charge by tokens. Rather, the AddOn charges for each image caption you generate. Reference the [Microsoft Azure Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) for additional information.

If you want to know if you are being charged, and you have the usage widget enabled, you will only be charged if the counter goes down.

**Note:** If an error occurs after the icon for the Alternate Text Generation AddOn is clicked by an end user, and text is not generated, you will not be charged. You will only be charged for instances when a caption is successfully generated.

## Error Handling <a href="#error-handling" id="error-handling"></a>

In the event an error occurs, the end user will see an alert and you will receive a message from the Azure API with additional details regarding the error.

For more information on potential errors and error codes, reference the [Azure Cognitive Services REST API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/) or the [Computer Vision REST API reference – Azure Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/computer-vision/) depending on which service you opted in for to configure this feature.

## Additional Considerations

The AI Alternate Text Generator is compatible with token upselling. The token upselling feature notifies the end users when their token usage is running low and when it is completely out. Both notifications include an option for the end user to purchase more tokens. The appearance of these notifications are customizable. Read the [Token Upselling documentation](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/builder-addons/partner-addons/ai-writing-assistant/token-upselling) to learn more about configuring token upselling within your host application.

## FAQs <a href="#faqs" id="faqs"></a>

**Q: Will Azure keep the photos used with this feature?**

A: The following answer is directly from the [Azure Data and privacy for Image Analysis website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/imageanalysis-data-privacy-security):

*The images you submit to Image Analysis service are processed in real time, and the input images and results are not retained or stored in the service after processing.*

For more information on image processing and data security, refer to the [Azure AI services security documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/security-features).
