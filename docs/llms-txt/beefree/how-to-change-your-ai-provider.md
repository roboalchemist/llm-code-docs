Hey there! Mark from Beefree, and in this 
video, I'll guide you step-by-step through

0:00:07.200,0:00:13.200
configuring your AI provider for the AI 
Writing Assistant add-on within Beefree SDK.

0:00:13.200,0:00:16.600
In the first part of this tutorial, 
we'll cover how to configure the AI

0:00:16.600,0:00:20.960
Writing Assistant add-on for those 
who have not yet activated it. Here,

0:00:20.960,0:00:25.000
we'll tackle how to configure it 
with the provider of your choice.

0:00:25.000,0:00:28.960
After that, we'll move on to the second part 
of the tutorial for those who have already

0:00:28.960,0:00:34.400
configured the AI Writing Assistant in their host 
application. In this section, we'll demonstrate

0:00:34.400,0:00:41.120
how to seamlessly switch your AI Provider 
from OpenAI to Azure OpenAI or vice versa.

0:00:41.120,0:00:45.960
Before we get started, though, let's review 
the following: The AI Writing Assistant

0:00:45.960,0:00:51.600
helps your host applications and users quickly 
generate written content within their designs,

0:00:51.600,0:00:56.920
helping them get across the finish line faster. 
They can use the AI Writing Assistant to generate

0:00:56.920,0:01:01.600
content for things like the title block, 
the paragraph block, the button block,

0:01:01.600,0:01:08.320
the list block, and metadata like titles, 
descriptions, subject lines, and preheader.

0:01:08.320,0:01:13.720
Okay, let's start with the first flow now, which 
is activating the AI Writing Assistant add-on in

0:01:13.720,0:01:19.560
the Beefree SDK developer console. After you log 
in, you'll land on the dashboard. First, head to

0:01:19.560,0:01:26.520
the Email Builder application by clicking Details. 
Once you're in the details page, select Add-ons.

0:01:26.520,0:01:32.160
Now, if you haven't already installed the AI 
Writing Assistant, just click on Browse Add-ons,

0:01:32.160,0:01:36.120
and from there, you can either scroll 
through the list to find it or use the

0:01:36.120,0:01:39.240
search bar. It's important to 
remember that the AI Writing

0:01:39.240,0:01:44.640
Assistant add-on only works with Azure 
OpenAI and OpenAI. If new providers are

0:01:44.640,0:01:49.360
added in the future, be sure to check 
the description here for any updates.

0:01:49.360,0:01:54.640
Okay, let's click Install. This brings 
you to the setup modal. If you haven't

0:01:54.640,0:01:59.840
set up any providers already, you'll need 
to create one. Let's click Manage Providers

0:02:01.200,0:02:08.320
and then Add Provider. Under Type, we can 
select our AI provider. For this example,

0:02:08.320,0:02:13.920
let's go with Azure OpenAI. Next, we'll need 
to fill in the name. It needs to be at least

0:02:13.920,0:02:19.360
three characters long and should be unique, 
so we can call this "Azure OpenAI Test."

0:02:19.360,0:02:25.120
And we'll need to add the API key, the URL 
provider, and the deployment ID. You can find

0:02:25.120,0:02:31.560
all of this information in your Azure OpenAI 
account. Once that's done, we can hit Save.

0:02:31.560,0:02:37.240
Okay, awesome! We can see that the Azure OpenAI 
provider is now active. Now that we've set up

0:02:37.240,0:02:44.360
the provider, we need to activate the add-on. So 
let's go back to Enabled Add-ons, click Edit under

0:02:44.360,0:02:57.080
AI Writing Assistant, select your provider in the 
drop-down, enable the toggle, and then hit Save.

0:02:57.080,0:03:01.240
Okay, great! The add-on has successfully 
been activated. Now you'll know for

0:03:01.240,0:03:05.720
sure that the add-on is working for your 
end-users by simply entering the Builder,

0:03:05.720,0:03:09.440
dropping in a title block, 
and clicking on the text,

0:03:09.440,0:03:14.480
and we can see that the Right with AI 
button is now visible in the sidebar.

0:03:14.480,0:03:18.800
If you would like to configure the add-on 
to customize your end-user's experience, you

0:03:18.800,0:03:24.840
will need to edit your Bee config code and add the 
add-on's property. That means including the add-on

0:03:24.840,0:03:31.120
ID AI Integration. This is the only part that is 
required for your configuration. You can then add

0:03:31.120,0:03:36.120
optimal settings highlighted in our documentation, 
which I've linked in the description.

0:03:36.120,0:03:41.840
Next, let's quickly show you how to change your 
AI Provider from one to another. In this example,

0:03:41.840,0:03:47.400
let's assume we've added two AI providers to 
our application. All we need to do now is head

0:03:47.400,0:03:54.280
to Enabled Add-ons. Under AI Writing Assistant, we 
can select Edit. In the drop-down menu, we can now

0:03:54.280,0:04:00.720
select the AI provider of our choice, so let's go 
with OpenAI. We can ensure that the enable toggle

0:04:00.720,0:04:07.640
is switched to On and then hit Save. We've now 
successfully switched providers! It's that easy.

0:04:07.640,0:04:13.160
Now, that's all for this video. We hope your 
end-users enjoy the AI Writing Assistant add-on!
