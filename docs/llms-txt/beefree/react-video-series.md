   {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transcript" %}
The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,200
To get started, navigate to developers.beefree.io. 
This will be your essential hub for everything

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
related to the Beefree SDK. In the top-right 
corner of the window, click Create a Developer

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,840
Account, then fill out the form to create 
your first developer account with Beefree.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,800
You’ll notice there’s also a link 
to the Beefree app as a standalone

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
tool. However, this video series focuses on 
the Beefree SDK as an embeddable solution.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,760
Once you’ve created your account and logged 
in, you’ll be taken to a screen that looks

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,760
something like this. At the top-right, you’ll 
find links to support and documentation.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,880
In the main section, you’ll see the 
type of subscription you’ve chosen,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
along with four activation options: Email Builder, 
Page Builder, Popup Builder, and File Manager.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,160
This is where you’ll activate the SDK instance 
that will later run within your application.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Let’s do that now by clicking Activate 
for the Email Builder application.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,880
On the next screen, you’ll be prompted 
to name your application. I’ll call

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,240
mine Test Email 1. You can choose any 
name you like. Once you click Create,

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
you’ll see your running SDK instance. 
Here, you’ll find the application name,

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,040
client ID, subscription type, and a Details 
button. Let’s go ahead and click on Details.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Inside the details screen, you’ll see important 
information such as the environment type,

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,480
creation and update dates, and configuration 
options. From here, you can change themes,

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,320
manage roles, and manage add-ons. 
One of the key features of the SDK

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,400
is that it provides two critical pieces of 
information: your Client ID and Client Secret.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,120
Don’t worry—we’ll delete these 
credentials after this video. You’ll

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,480
also see references to some of our APIs, 
like the HTML Importer, Content Services,

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,000
and the Template Catalog API. All of these 
can be accessed from this single screen.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,600
This area is known as the Beefree 
Developer Console. As mentioned,

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,520
this is where you’ll find your Client ID and 
Client Secret, which are used for authorization.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Since they’re sensitive credentials, you 
should never share them. If necessary,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
you can regenerate them using the 
Regenerate button on this screen.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Finally, in this video series, we’ll demonstrate

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,240
a client-side authorization process for 
simplicity. But when moving to production,

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,280
you’ll want to implement server-side 
authorization for added security.

### Quickstart Guide: React No-code Email Builder for Beefree SDK (Part 2)

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auyOorxU7X0>" %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
This quickstart video series provides a step by step walkthrough of how to embed the Beefree SDK’s Email Builder inside a React application. You’ll see the full process in action — from creating a React app to running the builder live in your browser.

PART 2: introduction to installing the Beefree SDK with a React Application
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transcript" %}
The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
Once you've set up your Beefree account, 
you're ready to install the Beefree SDK.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
This video will teach you how to do 
just that with a React application.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,080
We’ll also have other videos available 
if you’re working with Angular or Vue.js.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,240
In this video, we’ll first walk you 
through cloning a sample React demo that

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,840
we’ve made available in a GitHub repo. Then, we’ll 
cover the SDK installation process, including

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,040
installing with NPM, setting up authorization, 
and configuring your first BeeConfig.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,640
Finally, we’ll show you how 
to run your first Beefree SDK

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,082
app locally on your machine. Let’s get started.

### Quickstart Guide: React No-code Email Builder for Beefree SDK (Part 3)

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBZ1lHkPc0w>" %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
This Quickstart Guide shows you step by step how to embed Beefree SDK’s Email Builder into a React application. By the end of the guide, you'll have a functional React app running locally, with Beefree SDK's no-code email builder integrated and properly authenticated—following best practices for React development.

PART 3: in this video, you'll learn how to:

* Project Setup: How to clone the Beefree React demo from GitHub
* How to configure environment variables by renaming a file and adding your client ID and secret
* An overview of the sample React application
* An explanation of the secure authentication process using a local proxy server
* Launch the application locally to see the embedded Beefree editor in action
  {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transcript" %}
The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Let's get started with installation. These 
instructions will work the same whether

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
you're on a Windows or Mac computer. The only 
assumptions are that you have set up your account,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,600
have your client ID and client secret, and 
have Node version 14 or greater. You'll go

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,480
to GitHub to the Beefree SDK account 
and find the Beefree React demo repo.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,920
We'll include a link for that below 
as well. Let's go ahead and clone it.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Okay,

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
that didn't take long at all. By the way, if you 
get lost during any of these steps or need more

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,720
detail, the README for this repo contains complete 
step-by-step instructions. From here, let's cd

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,040
into our project and run npm install to update 
our dependencies. Once that's complete, we'll run

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:02,880
npm install beefree.io-sdk to install the official 
NPM package. Again, that didn't take long at all.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,400
Now, from either your terminal or your 
editor, let's list the files, and you'll see

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,640
a .env.example file provided for you. Let's rename 
that to simply .env for proper configuration.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,080
When you open it, you'll notice that we have 
your Client ID and Client Secret typed out

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,880
as text. You'll want to go to your developer 
console, copy your Client ID and Client Secret,

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,560
and replace that text here. Make sure to leave 
the single quotes so it’s captured properly.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
Next, let's look at some of the files available 
in the simple React app. Navigate to the src

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,720
directory and open App.tsx. You'll find 
a React function describing a button,

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
and that button links to a convenient URL:

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,800
our documentation. Feel free to replace the URL 
with one of your choice, or replace this entire

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,520
function with a component that better matches 
what you’ll have in a production environment.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,040
All right, that last button represented a sample 
component you might have in your app. Now let's

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,800
look at the component for the Beefree SDK itself. 
Open BeefreeEditor.tsx, a TypeScript file in the

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,701
src directory. You'll see an example that 
uses both the useEffect and useRef hooks.

24
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:17,600
The useEffect hook manages the 
lifecycle of the SDK component,

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,320
and the useRef hook provides a reference 
to the HTML element where the editor will

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,520
live. You'll see that right here as an 
HTML element using the useRef.

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Next is our useEffect hook, which is 
critical. We'll pass an empty array

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,240
as the second argument to tell 
React: run this code just once,

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,000
right after the component first mounts. 
This prevents the editor from trying

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,560
to reinitialize every time the component 
re-renders, which is exactly what we want.

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,800
Inside the useEffect, we have an async function

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,280
called initializeEditor. The first 
part is the BConfig object itself,

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
where we configure the SDK's behavior. The 
most critical property here is container,

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,280
which is set to beefree-react-demo, matching the 
ID of the where the editor will render.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
We also have callbacks like onSave and onError,

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,800
letting us react to events from the 
editor, such as when a user hits save.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Now look at this fetch call. Remember our 
discussion on security? Here's that in action.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,960
We're making a fetch call to localhost:3001. This 
isn’t a direct call to the Beefree SDK API—it goes

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,240
through our local proxy server, which we'll 
set up in a separate file. The proxy handles

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,600
secure authentication and returns a temporary 
access token that the client can safely use.

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:47,520
With that token, we can create a new instance of 
the Beefree SDK and call its start method. This

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,720
is the moment the editor is initialized 
and rendered inside our container.

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,920
The component’s return statement simply 
renders the HTML structure. The has

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,000
the matching ID beefree-react-demo, 
and the ref attribute is set to our

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,680
container ref. This completes the circle 
and tells the SDK exactly where to render.

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,760
In summary, this file uses 
a ref to get a DOM element,

47
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,440
a useEffect hook to safely run the code once, 
a secure fetch to get an authorization token,

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,080
and then uses that token to initialize the Beefree

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,000
SDK. This is a production-ready pattern for 
embedding the editor in your React application.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Earlier, you added your Client ID and Client 
Secret to the .env file. To complete authorization

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,600
and authentication, we use the loginV2 method. An 
example is provided in proxyServer.js in the root

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
directory. You’ll want to do something 
similar in your production application.

53
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
This handles the critical authentication process 
for running the Beefree SDK in your React app.

54
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:19,360
The Beefree SDK requires passing the Client ID 
and Client Secret server-side. On lines 14 and 15,

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,960
you define BE_CLIENT_ID and BE_CLIENT_SECRET 
to reference the values you pasted earlier.

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,560
These are used in an Axios POST method 
for secure server-side authorization.

57
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,240
Now comes one of the most fun parts: running your 
Beefree SDK instance locally. Open two terminal

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,920
windows. In the first, run node proxyServer.js 
to handle backend authorization. In the other,

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,200
run npm run dev to start the React app. 
The app is served at localhost:5173.

60
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,280
Open your browser and navigate there.

61
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,800
You’ll see the portion of the React app we built: 
"Welcome to Beefree Demo" and the "Read the Docs"

62
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
button from earlier. Here, you can 
interact with the Beefree SDK editor,

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,280
which is now fully embedded in your React 
application. From here, feel free to click

64
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:28,888
on different content blocks and explore the 
editor’s functionality—it’s a powerful tool.
