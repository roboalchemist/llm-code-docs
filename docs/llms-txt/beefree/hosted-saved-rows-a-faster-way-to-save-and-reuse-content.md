The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's talk about that header or footer, the 
one your user absolutely nailed. It's clean,

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,440
perfectly branded, and makes their emails and 
pages look sharp. It's a tiny masterpiece. But

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,840
here's the problem: every time they want to use 
it again, they're stuck recreating it from scratch

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,800
or, worse, digging through old designs to copy and 
paste that piece of content into your new design.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,960
That's where the magic of Saved Rows comes in. 
With Saved Rows, your users can lock in those

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,280
beautifully crafted sections—headers, footers, 
product showcases, you name it—and reuse them

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,200
whenever and wherever they need. No tedious 
recreating, no endless copying and pasting. Just

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,560
drag and drop, and they're good to go. Saved Rows 
is the perfect solution for your end users who are

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,240
looking to save time while keeping their designs 
clean and consistent across different projects.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,080
In this video, we're going to talk all about Saved

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Rows and how you can make the most 
of this feature for your end users.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,080
What are Rows and Saved Rows in Beefree SDK?
First, we'll break down the difference between

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,040
rows and Saved Rows in Beefree SDK. After that, 
we'll highlight the benefits of Saved Rows,

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,040
showing how they can save your end users 
time and boost efficiency. From there,

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,240
we'll explain the two flexible options for 
implementing Saved Rows in Beefree SDK:

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
Hosted Saved Rows and Self-Hosted Saved Rows.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Next, we'll dive into the developer 
console and demonstrate how easy it

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,360
is to enable Hosted Saved Rows. Spoiler 
alert: it's just one toggle! We'll also

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,680
walk you through how your end users can manage 
and organize Saved Rows within their designs.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,040
Finally, for those of you who'd like to take 
things one step further, we'll explain how to

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,760
set up Advanced Permissions inside your Beefree 
SDK configuration. This allows you to manage

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:53,680
which specific actions your end users can perform 
when using Hosted Saved Rows within Beefree SDK.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,880
Rows are the building blocks that let 
your end users structure, organize,

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,680
and design their content with precision. 
They're a powerful way to create layouts

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,480
that adapt to any design need. The first step 
every content creator takes in the Beefree SDK

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,600
Builder is to drag and drop a row onto the 
stage. This is where the magic begins. Rows

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,360
provide the foundation for adding content blocks 
and designing layouts that bring ideas to life.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,360
But while regular rows are built 
for flexibility and customization,

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,920
Saved Rows take things a step further. 
They allow your end users to save the

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,418
rows they've already designed for 
convenient reuse in future projects.

31
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,680
Benefits of Saved Rows
Saved Rows aren't just convenient;

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,000
they're a total game-changer. And here's why:

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Save time: Skip the repetitive work 
of rebuilding sections from scratch.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,960
Maintain design consistency: 
Ensure key components like headers,

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,720
footers, or product showcases remain 
perfectly aligned with your brand.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,000
Avoid the blank page: Repurpose existing 
content as a starting point for new designs.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
Increase efficiency: Focus more on 
creativity and strategy, not busy work.

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,840
With Saved Rows in Beefree SDK, 
your end users can work smarter,

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,327
not harder, while keeping their designs 
fresh, consistent, and easy to manage.

40
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:17,800
Hosted vs. Self-Hosted Saved Rows
For teams looking to implement Saved Rows,

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,040
we offer two flexible options based on your needs:

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Hosted Saved Rows and Self-Hosted Saved Rows. 
Let's quickly break down the differences

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,383
to show you how Hosted and Self-Hosted 
Saved Rows are configured and managed.

44
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:34,080
Hosted Saved Rows
Hosted Saved Rows are ideal

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,000
for teams looking for a quick, hassle-free 
setup. Everything is managed by Beefree SDK,

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,440
so you can activate it with a toggle 
in the developer console. This option

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,720
provides centralized storage, security, 
and reliability, along with an easy-to-use

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,960
interface to save and reuse rows within your 
app. It's perfect if you don't want to manage

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,618
back-end systems and you just want to bring the 
power of reusable content to your users fast.

50
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:02,560
Self-Hosted Saved Rows
Now, if you need full

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,760
control over how and where rows are stored, 
Self-Hosted Saved Rows might be the way to

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,120
go. This option is best for teams with specific 
compliance or integration needs and requires

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,560
development resources to manage storage 
and build an interface for row management.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,400
We won't dive too deep into the details here, 
but if you'd like to learn more, check out our

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,720
video tutorial and technical documentation, 
which I've linked in the video description.

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,440
Setting up Hosted Saved Rows
Now, let's show you how to set

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,120
up Hosted Saved Rows. First, let's enable 
Hosted Saved Rows for your application.

58
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
We'll need to log into the developer console.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,200
Then, we can navigate to the 
application you'd like to configure.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,760
Click on Details, then View More 
under Application Configuration.

61
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,840
We can scroll to the Saved Row section and then

62
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,040
toggle on the option for Hosted 
on the Beefree SDK Infrastructure.

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,640
Finally, we can review the pricing details 
and confirm to activate the feature.

64
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,920
Congrats! You've officially enabled 
Hosted Saved Rows in under a minute,

65
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,305
and your users can immediately 
start saving and reusing content.

66
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,560
Managing Saved Rows

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Now that Hosted Saved Rows are enabled, 
here's how end users can manage them:

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,480
You can save your row directly 
inside the Builder by selecting

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,520
it and then clicking the save icon. To 
keep your row organized and easy to find,

70
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,920
you can give them clear names. Under 
Row Name, we can call this "Header."

71
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,360
We can then add this row to either a new or 
existing category to make it easy to find. Let's

72
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,840
create a new category and call it "Headers for 
Flower Emails." You can then hit the Save button.

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Next, go to the Row section, 
click on the dropdown menu,

74
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,240
and from the options, select "Headers for 
Flower Emails." You'll see your Saved Row

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,920
appear there. Simply drag it onto the 
canvas to start using it right away.

76
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,240
At any time, you can edit, reuse, and 
delete a Saved Row by clicking on the

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,480
three dots here. By selecting Edit 
Info, you can edit the name of the

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Saved Row and even change the category. 
To save your changes, just hit Update.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,680
Keep in mind that we will store your end 
users' Hosted Saved Rows securely in a

80
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,760
Beefree S3 bucket. Each row will 
be exclusively used for the given

81
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,240
UID belonging to the subscription. As a 
reminder, we're proud to be SOC 2, ISO,

82
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,200
and GDPR compliant. You can read more about 
our security measures at beefree.io/security.

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,640
It's important to mention that 
this is a premium feature and

84
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,040
that usage-based fees may apply 
for using Hosted Saved Rows. You

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,100
can reference our usage-based fees 
documentation for additional details.

86
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,080
Advanced Permissions
Now, what if you'd like to

87
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,760
customize how specific groups of users can 
interact with your new Saved Row feature?

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,560
For example, maybe you want admins to enjoy 
full access to add, manage, and delete rows,

89
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,280
while copywriters can only add and manage but not 
delete them. Or perhaps you could limit saving and

90
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,760
reusing content for premium tier users to support 
your app's business model and encourage upgrades.

91
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,560
That's where Advanced Permissions comes 
in. That's your tool for controlling what

92
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,960
users can and cannot do in your 
application. Hosted Saved Rows

93
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,560
includes the following Advanced Permission 
options. Keep in mind that each of these

94
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,120
options are boolean within your Beefree SDK 
configuration. This means if set to true,

95
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,440
the end user can perform that action, and if 
set to false, they can't perform that action.

96
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,720
Let me show you how easy it is to 
adjust Advanced Permissions. It's

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,680
all done via the Advanced Permissions object 
in your config file, and you can see how we

98
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,520
defined rows and behavior objects nested 
within it. Inside the behaviors object,

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,240
you can see that we've set the 
canDeleteHostedRow property to true.

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,560
Let's check out the end-user experience now. If we 
select a row and then click the three dots here,

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,360
the user is able to click on this Delete 
button, and then once inside the modal,

102
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,560
they can confirm that they do in fact 
want to remove this Saved Row. Okay,

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,840
great. Now let's jump back into the code and 
change that value to false. If we head back

104
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,040
to the end-user experience and then try 
clicking on a row, you can see that the

105
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,340
user is no longer able to delete the Saved 
Row based on the permission we've just set.

106
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,440
Recap
Okay,

107
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,600
that wraps up this video. 
Let's recap what we learned:

108
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,000
We covered the key differences between 
rows and Saved Rows in Beefree SDK.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,720
We discussed how rows can save time and 
improve efficiency for your end users.

110
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,240
Then we explored the two implementation options,

111
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,280
Hosted and Self-Hosted Saved Rows, 
and demonstrated how easy it is to

112
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,760
enable Hosted Saved Rows with just 
one toggle in the developer console.

113
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,040
We also showed how your end users 
can manage their Saved Rows.

114
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,240
And finally, we covered setting up Advanced

115
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,000
Permissions to control what 
your users can and cannot do.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,760
By adding Saved Rows to your application, 
you can help users save time,

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,800
maintain design consistency, and boost 
satisfaction. And with Hosted Saved Rows,

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:18,480
you can activate this powerful feature 
in seconds just by toggling it on.
