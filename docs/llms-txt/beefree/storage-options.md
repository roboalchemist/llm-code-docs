# Storage options

## Understanding storage & content delivery options

When you configure a builder application, you have four options for image & file storage:

* **Beefree SDK storage**: unless you select another option, images will be hosted in Beefree SDK’s own AWS S3 bucket. [See below](#storage-and-delivery-fees) for details about potential fees associated with this option.
* **An existing builder application**: to connect the selected application’s storage to an already existing application. After selecting this option the two applications will share their storage.
* **Your own AWS S3 bucket**: instead of using Beefree SDK’s AWS S3 bucket to store & deliver files, you can use your own. See [Configuring your own S3 bucket](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/server-side-configurations/server-side-options/storage-options/configure-your-aws-s3-bucket).
* **Your own file system**: if your application already has a place where images and other assets are stored, you can leverage it. This option is only available on Beefree SDK paid plans. See using [your file system](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/server-side-configurations/server-side-options/storage-options/connect-your-file-storage-system).

### Custom File System Provider

When working with your own custom file system provider, there are many considerations to keep in mind. Follow the steps outlined in the[ Move Files in the File Manager](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/server-side-configurations/server-side-options/connect-your-file-storage-system#move-files-in-the-file-manager) documentation to ensure you configure this feature successfully for this storage option.

## Images vs. other files

End users can upload images, PDFs, and other documents to the builder. For instance, they can link a button to download a PDF report.

Reference[ the white label end-user documentation](https://docs.beefree.io/end-user-guide/file-manager) to learn more about the end user experience with the File manager.

If you need more control on what files users should be able to upload, you may activate [file manager limitations](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/file-manager/file-manager-application-overview) in the **Privacy & Security** section of your app’s configuration. In alternative, you may consider [connecting the builder to your file system](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/server-side-configurations/server-side-options/storage-options/connect-your-file-storage-system).

**Note:** In addition to storing images and files within the Beefree SDK File Manager, Beefree SDK also offers a storage option for saving saved rows. This is available through [Hosted Saved Rows](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/rows/storage/hosted-saved-rows). To store the JSON of full email templates, you'll need to connect your own database to Beefree SDK. While there is an option to host saved rows within Beefree SDK, there currently isn't a way to host full email, page, and popup designs just yet.

## About Beefree SDK storage

### **How images are stored & delivered**

By default, images used in emails and pages created with the builder are stored in Beefree SDK’s file storage system. Beefree SDK uses [Amazon Web Service’s S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingObjects.html) service for storage, and leverages Amazon’s Content Delivery Network ([CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)) for fast content delivery.

### **Storage and delivery fees**

* There are no charges for storing images & other documents.
* There are no charges for delivering images & other documents up to a total of 5TB of delivery traffic per 30-day period.
* Above 5TB of data traffic recorded in a 30-day period, you will be billed $0.01 per GB of data transferred.
* Beefree SDK customers that exceed 50 GB of image data traffic on the Free plan in a given month will be moved to our [Essentials plan](https://beefree.io/bee-plugin/pricing/).

### Enabling the Move File Feature for Your File Manager

You can enable the move icon for files within the File manager. This move icon allows your end users to move their files between folders, locations, and so on within the File manger. They can access the move icon directly on the file within the File manager. The move icon is a folder with an arrow pointing right inside it. End users click this icon to initiate the process of relocating the corresponding file to a new destination.

If you are using the Beefree AWS S3 Bucket, take the following steps to enable this feature for your File manager.

#### Using the Beefree AWS S3 Bucket

If you are using your own AWS S3 bucket, take the following steps to activate the **Move File** feature:

1. Ensure that your FSP is updated to the latest version.
2. Navigate to the [Beefree SDK Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/login?from=website_menu).
3. Locate the **Move File** configuration toggle.
4. Toggle the feature on.

The **Move Feature** will be available in your application.

#### **Why do you charge for traffic when using Beefree SDK storage?**

When you use the Beefree SDK S3 storage, your images are delivered via a Content Delivery Network (AWS Cloudfront), and AWS bills us based on the traffic generated by those assets when you send emails or publish web pages created with Beefree SDK. A large amount of monthly traffic (5TB) is included in your Beefree SDK paid subscription at no charge.

If you exceed the 5TB monthly traffic allotment, we ask you to cover the cost of the service (for a few of our customers that generate a lot of image data traffic, that cost has grown to exceed their Beefree SDK subscription fee). Also, note that this scenario is quite rare: it applies to less than 3% of our customers.

#### **When does the traffic counter reset?**

* If you’re on a paid plan, billed monthly, the counter will reset on the same days as your UIDs and CSAPI calls, i.e., on the day your subscription to Beefree SDK is renewed.
* If you’re on a paid plan, billed yearly, the counter will reset on the 1st day of each month.
* If you’re on a free plan, the counter will reset on the 1st day of each month.

You can always see when the current period starts and ends in your application details, in the Statistics widget:

#### I'm on an annual plan. When will I be charged for usage-based fees? <a href="#im_on_an_annual_plan._when_will_i_be_charged_for_usage-based_fees" id="im_on_an_annual_plan._when_will_i_be_charged_for_usage-based_fees"></a>

If you’re on an annual plan, any usage-based fees are still billed monthly. This means that even though your subscription is annual, any additional usage beyond your included monthly allotment will be calculated and charged at the end of each month.

#### **Do I get notified when I’m about to exceed the quota?**

For the moment, only subscriptions on paid plans will be notified by our Customer Success team. If you’re on a free plan, you may check your usage by logging into the [Beefree SDK Console](http://developers.beefree.io/), and going into the application details, in the **Statistics** widget.

#### **I’m using Beefree SDK storage. What can I do to avoid getting charged?**

You can switch to [using your S3 storage](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/server-side-configurations/server-side-options/storage-options/configure-your-aws-s3-bucket) or [connect your file storage](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/server-side-configurations/server-side-options/storage-options/connect-your-file-storage-system).

#### **I connected my application’s storage to an already existing one. How will the billing work?**

All traffic generated is charged to the shared storage.\
E.g.: an Email Builder application shares its storage with a Popup and a Page applications. In this case, the Email Builder application will be charged for the traffic generated by Email + Popup + Page.

#### **Are there any restrictions when connecting an application’s storage to an already existing one?**

* It’s not possible to link a development app to a production app.
* An app can be linked to another just once.
* The same shared storage can be shared across different applications within the same subscription

#### **Can I connect my dev app storage to a production app?**

No, this is not possible. You can either connect production apps included in the same subscription or dev apps included in the same subscription.

#### **Can I get a history of my monthly traffic usage?**

Please contact your account manager for this. If you are not sure how to do this, please [log into the Beefree SDK Console](https://developers.beefree.io/) and submit a support ticket asking for your usage history.
