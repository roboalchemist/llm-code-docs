1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,000
depending on where you're joining 
us from around the world. Welcome

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,440
to this session of the spotlight series 
from Beefree, specifically Beefree SDK.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,800
Today, I'm Lawrence, your host 
and Senior Developer Advocate.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm here with my friend Luca, 
Senior Fullstack Developer and

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,800
Technical Presenter. Our topic for 
the day is the HTML Importer API.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,280
As you're all coming in, feel free to hop into 
the chat and leave your name and location.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,080
It's always nice to give a shout-out to our 
visitors, all of our users, future users,

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,640
and even fellow employees. We love to hear where 
you're from and shout out your hometown because we

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,560
have not only a global workforce but also a global 
user base. We definitely love to shout you out!

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Speaking of global, Luca, you and I are 
both settling in from a pretty exciting

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,120
event last week. We had a week-long retreat 
on the sunny beaches of Spain. I just kept

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,200
thinking, "They're working me too hard! 
They're working me way too hard!" Luca,

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,640
let me hear your feedback. How 
are you feeling after last week?

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,000
It went great! I got a lot of stuff done, and 
I spent an amazing time with our colleagues,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,120
getting to know new colleagues better 
and getting in touch with old friends

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,880
and colleagues that I already met at 
previous retreats. What about you,

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Lawrence? This was your first 
experience with us at our retreat.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,080
Listen, I just kept thinking to myself, 
"For real, best first month ever!" Get

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,760
hired in one month, get flown to Europe 
for the next month for an entire week,

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,800
all expenses paid. That was incredible! But you 
know, it's interesting, prior to the retreat,

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,400
I had never seen a single co-worker in 
person—not even my boss, not HR, no one.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,000
So, all of a sudden, I get to see the majority of 
the company all together, collaborate with them,

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
have sessions, have breakout sessions, get 
their feedback on some things that I thought,

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,320
and get some good positive responses for some 
and some gentle corrections for others. But it

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,400
was all great because we were in person, 
and getting that feedback, and of course,

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,600
the pool time and beach time, helped as well. So, 
I'm excited. We have some amazing initiatives that

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,920
I heard talked about just last week, so it's 
going to be a really exciting year for Beefree.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
I agree! That being said, we have a lot of people 
in the comments. Thanks all for checking in with

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
us. We have Sam from Clearwater, Florida. 
Definitely glad to have her for multiple

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,720
reasons. Good to see you, Sam! We have Stu 
from Kick, London, using Beefree SDK. Thank

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,360
you for that, definitely appreciate it. 
Mark checking in from Lincoln, Nebraska,

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,640
just above me. I'm in the Memphis, Tennessee, area 
here in the States. We have Philip from Germany,

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Krishna from India. This is fantastic! We 
have David also calling in from Palm Coast,

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,880
Yash from India, and Aaron Bird from the 
UK. And Adrian is typing as well. So,

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,520
thank you all for joining us, 
thank you for participating.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,200
As you'll notice, all of you, down on the bottom 
there, we have the chat that you're engaging in

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,360
right now. Feel free to continue to chat all 
throughout the session today. Just make friends

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
with each other; you never know what kind of 
collaborations and opportunities might arise. Any

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,880
specific questions you have, please click on the 
"Questions" tab. That way, it'll be a lot easier

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,200
for us to find those toward the end of today's 
session. And once again, hello to Aaron from the

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:28,560
UK and Adrian from sunny Ireland, and Alfred from 
Engine Mailer—I think I'm butchering that, I'm so

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,120
sorry. I was going to say hello to Alfred, we're 
glad to have you, and I'm glad you're having a

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,000
sunny day in Ireland, Adrian. Here in the Memphis, 
Tennessee, area, we have had three days of rain.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,560
I got back home, and we were forecasted to have 
three more days of rain, so I wish I had your sun.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,960
That being said, it's a couple of minutes after 
this is scheduled for being a 30-minute session,

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,400
and I'm all about efficiency. 
Luca, shall we jump into it?

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Let's go!

49
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,400
Fantastic! So, I'm going to share my screen 
real quick here. We'll share the window,

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
and that looks a little weird, so 
hold on just a second. I didn't like

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:20,320
how that looked. I'm going to share the 
window, that one there we go. And Luca,

52
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
if you'd just be so kind to let me 
know if that is coming through okay.

53
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Okay, I can see that.

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,240
Fantastic! All right, so today, folks, we are 
talking about the HTML Importer API. Again,

55
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm here with my friend Luca, who 
is a Senior Fullstack Developer,

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,400
and I'm Lawrence Lockhart, Senior Developer 
Advocate—let me get my own name correct!

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
So, the first thing we have is our agenda. 
Naturally, we're going to talk about what is the

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,480
HTML Importer API and why does it even matter. 
Then, you're going to see some amazing demos,

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,170
Part One and Part Two, from Luca. 
Then, we'll wrap up with a Q&A.

60
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,520
What is the HTML Importer API?
But the first question is, "What the

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,680
heck is this thing? What is an HTML Importer API, 
all those strange words and letters, and why does

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,560
it even matter?" You all ask great questions on 
a Tuesday; I'm happy to help you out with that.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
So, the HTML Importer API is a new API; 
it's one of our latest features within

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,520
the Beefree SDK environment. What it allows 
you to do is to take an existing HTML email

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,560
template and have it converted to the Beefree 
proprietary JSON for use in the editor itself,

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,040
which I think is an absolute game-changer.

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Now, I do recognize in the audience we probably 
have some new folks, so just a little bit of

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,960
background. First of all, when it comes to 
Beefree, we have this amazing visual editor,

69
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,880
the Beefree app, that allows you to build email 
landing pages, pop-ups, with simply using drag

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,080
and drop. But we also have the SDK, and that tends 
to be where my focus is. Our Software Development

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,320
Kit lets you get that same type of power and 
embed it within your own application. It can be

72
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,520
your SaaS application so your users can have that 
text to making great emails, or for you to make

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,160
great emails yourself using our editor power. You 
can embed our editor in your application, and the

74
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,920
power behind it, the data structure underneath all 
of it, is our proprietary JSON. So, this feature,

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,640
this API, takes your HTML and converts it to 
our JSON so you can then use it in the editor.

76
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,960
Who Needs the HTML Importer API?
Who would need something like this? Another

77
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,840
great question! Well, if you're a new user, 
you've just come over to the Beefree ecosystem,

78
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,200
but you've already been doing emails, you already 
have this entire library of HTML, you can now,

79
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,360
case by case, convert those to Beefree JSON and 
then make further iterations within the editor.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
You don't want to have all that work go to 
waste. So, that works whether you're a new

81
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,640
customer or even if you're an older customer, 
you've been using us for a while, but you have

82
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,120
some templates that you would love to use from 
back in the day, but they don't convert naturally,

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,760
and the man-hour to go into that is not something 
you want to invest. We have the tool for you;

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,520
it's called the HTML Importer API, and 
you will be able to take that HTML code,

85
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,000
have it converted to our JSON, import it to 
the editor, and then you just drag and drop.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
You can literally pass it over to your marketing 
team; they can make beautiful emails from there.

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
Now, regarding the billing, we looked at 
it, we did the requisite research. Again,

88
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
those man-hours can be tremendous, and 
so it's going to only be a $2 charge

89
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,480
per successful API call, and you'll see 
that at the end of your monthly usage.

90
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,400
From there, it's time for the live demo, and 
as I told you, our technical presenter today is

91
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:34,880
Luca. So Luca, I'm going to stop sharing and pass 
over control to you as soon as I find my window.

92
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:43,040
Thank you, Lawrence! Absolutely. Stop 
sharing. There we go. That's great. I'm

93
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,880
going to stop sharing my screen now. 
Do you see that, Lawrence? Am I good?

94
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,360
Hold on a second, I am still on 
the wrong window. You are great.

95
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,840
Thank you. So, let's jump into these hands-on. 
Let's look at the HTML importer and how you can

96
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,440
make the most out of it, combining it with 
the Brand Style Management API. More on

97
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,760
that later. We'll walk through both features 
and how to enable them in the SDK console by

98
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:21,920
generating scope-specific API keys, and we'll 
plug them into a real-world integration setup.

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,360
Our first stop is the SDK console. In order to 
enable the HTML Importer API, you need to go into

100
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:41,760
the details section of the application you want 
to use. Then, reach for the HTML Importer API tab.

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,800
And as you can see, I already have a key, but I 
will remove that just for the purpose of this demo

102
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,560
to show you how to enable one. Bonus point: 
you can see now how to disable that as well.

103
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,480
So, when you don't have a key, the card will 
look like this. If you hit "Enable and Get

104
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,600
the API Key," this modal will pop up where it 
requires you to check this box to acknowledge the

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,520
additional fees for the service, and then you can 
hit "Create Key." Once you do this and wait just

106
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,880
a couple of seconds, you'll be able to see your 
newly created key where the previous one was. From

107
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,200
the same card, as you saw, you can also disable 
and revoke the key and regenerate it as well.

108
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,000
Now, I'll move on to the IDE to show you how 
to implement the HTML Importer inside a simple

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,960
integration. It's nothing special, nothing 
fancy. You can customize your integration

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,320
however you'd like. Probably, if you're 
already a customer, you already have your

111
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,400
integration well customized. If you're not, 
take this as a simple example to start from.

112
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,360
What I did in this simple integration is I've 
added a simple button in the top toolbar that

113
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,760
opens a modal. Here, you can see the code for 
the modal. I've kept everything simple, just bare

114
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,280
bone to make it work with little customization, 
just to make it good enough to see. And here,

115
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:16,320
the customer can paste the HTML code for the 
email they want to import, and after doing that,

116
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:25,440
they can hit "Import" and trigger the actual 
API call to the HTML Importer endpoint.

117
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,480
Now, I'll move over to the code for the call. 
As you can see, this is a POST call done to

118
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,480
this endpoint that you can see on the screen 
and that you can find in our documentation. All

119
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,160
it requires in the body is an html field that 
contains the HTML that you want to import into

120
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,600
the builder. For the authorization, you need the 
key that we created before in the SDK console,

121
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,400
and the way to pass it to the service is by 
this authorization header. Just a heads-up,

122
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,720
I advise you to keep your keys inside a .env file 
and not version them, just not to risk exposing

123
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:16,400
your credentials. The HTML that you pass to the 
service has some limitations. In particular,

124
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,960
we cannot parse dynamic content yet. The 
service is optimized to handle emails,

125
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:33,440
so it's not yet optimized to handle the import of 
HTML pages. The HTML should be valid. That means

126
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,200
it should include a doctype declaration, 
valid HTML and body elements, and also

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:47,680
the meta charset UTF-8 tag in the head section. 
Furthermore, you need to ensure that all images

128
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,080
and resources contained in the email you want to 
import are publicly available on the internet,

129
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,600
and be aware that we currently don't support 
all HTML tags. For more information on this

130
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:10,960
specification, you can look at our documentation. 
In this section, you can also handle the errors

131
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:18,240
from the service. There's nothing specific to 
speak about the errors, so the usual stuff.

132
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,400
Now, I'll quickly jump over to the demo 
environment I've created, which code you were just

133
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,320
seeing, and show you how it actually works. As 
you see, here is the button I talked about before,

134
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:40,720
and when we click on this, you see the "Import 
HTML" form. What I need now is an HTML to pass

135
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,600
in here to move on with the import. What I can do 
is visit Really Good Emails and look for an email

136
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,400
that I like and I want to take inspiration 
from. For example, let's pick the first one,

137
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,160
view more about this email, get to the 
code—that is what we need—and copy and

138
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,760
paste this code inside our demo environment and 
hit "Import." It will take just a few seconds,

139
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:17,120
not days like when you have to do this manually, 
and you can see that we have pretty much a close

140
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,920
recreation of the email. I'll quickly 
show you the original one here in RGE,

141
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,040
and you can see the importer did pretty well. 
But do not expect always a one-to-one recreation.

142
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,680
The job of the importer is not to import 
an exact copy of the email inside Beefree,

143
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,480
but to facilitate the recreation of the email 
inside the builder. The idea is that we get

144
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,000
80% to 90% of your job done, depending on 
the template and the quality of the HTML,

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,680
and you just have to put the final tweaks to have 
the result you desired. One more important thing:

146
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:07,040
the import process is deterministic. So, no matter 
how many times you import a specific HTML, you'll

147
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:16,080
always get the same result. And this is important 
because you will pay all the calls you make, so be

148
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:23,360
careful. Don't think that different iterations 
of the import can generate different results.

149
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,320
So, let's go back to the tweaking we were talking 
about. One thing that the Brand Style Management

150
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:38,640
API is great for after you have imported your 
HTML is applying your brand style to the email you

151
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,520
took inspiration from. So, let's say this is the 
email that you loved, you love the style, you love

152
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:53,840
the structure, but of course it doesn't fit your 
brand style, and you want to improve that. Well,

153
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,440
the Brand Style Management API is there for you. 
What you need to do to use that API is once again

154
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,760
go back to the Beefree SDK console and once again 
activate another API key. Every API key is scoped

155
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,800
for a specific context. In this case, what you 
need is the Content Services API. Once again, I

156
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,680
already have one, but for the scope of this demo, 
I'm going to disable and revoke the key and once

157
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,000
again hit the "Enable and Get the API Key" button, 
just like we did for the HTML Importer. This time,

158
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,280
the fees are already mentioned to you in the 
terms of service when you sign up for the plugin,

159
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:47,520
so you don't have to check any boxes, and 
you can create a key. A couple of seconds,

160
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,840
and you'll see that, just like with the 
importer, we have the Content Services

161
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,680
API key right here. And once again, you can 
regenerate the key or disable and revoke the key.

162
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,440
Once you have your key, it's time to get back 
into the IDE to see how you can implement the API

163
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:12,400
endpoint inside the integration. Once again, all 
you need for this is a simple button or whatever

164
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:20,000
you choose to trigger the call to the Brand Style 
Management API. The Brand Style Management API is

165
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,840
once again a POST call made to this endpoint that 
you can find in our documentation. And this time,

166
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:34,000
the body requires two fields: styles, which is 
basically a JSON object structured in a similar

167
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,640
manner to this (for more information, you can 
check our documentation) where you define the

168
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,760
styles—in this example, for the buttons, such 
as color, font size, and all the stuff that is

169
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,920
according to your brand style management. Once 
you have your style, you simply need to pass the

170
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,920
template you want that style to be applied to. In 
our case, it's the template we generated through

171
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,880
the HTML Importer. Once again, to make this 
call, you need to use the key that we created

172
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,240
before through this authorization header. And once 
again, I advise you, keep the same behavior as I

173
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:22,240
told you about before with the .env file, just to 
be sure not to expose your credentials. One thing

174
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,120
that needs specific mention for the Brand Style 
Management, though, is their error handling. The

175
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,720
error that needs a specific mention is the status 
code 422: "Unprocessable Entity." This one doesn't

176
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,920
mean that you did something wrong on your side, 
but it simply means that the styles you were

177
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,280
trying to apply to the template you were trying to 
apply them to weren't compatible. What does this

178
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,600
mean? In our example, we saw that we defined 
styles just for the button element. Let's say

179
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,920
we have a template that has no button elements; 
in that case, there is no compatibility between

180
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,400
the style and the template because there's no 
style you can apply to the template at hand. In

181
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,600
this case, the service will reply with a 422 
error that simply means no changes were made

182
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,280
to this template. You can decide what to do with 
that. You can bubble up the message to your user,

183
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,440
maybe through a toast message telling them nothing 
happened because the style wasn't applicable,

184
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,080
or you can simply reload the template. The 
behavior of the integration is up to you.

185
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,120
And once again, we can go back to the demo 
environment to show you the brand style

186
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,760
management in action. I've already shown you 
the template that we imported. I want you to

187
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,240
pay attention specifically to the button because, 
as you saw, that's the style we defined in our

188
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,640
JSON. And once I hit "Apply Brand Style," the 
template is processed, and you can see the email

189
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,280
is pretty much the same, except for the button 
that now has the style we have defined inside

190
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,640
our Brand Style Management API, specifically 
in the JSON that we passed to the endpoint.

191
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,520
So, before moving on to the Q&A session of this 
spotlight, I'd like to quickly recap what we

192
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,360
saw today. We learned how to enable the HTML 
Importer for your application by creating an

193
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,120
API key and how you can manage it inside your 
application details, and specifically the HTML

194
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,000
Importer API card. We saw a simple implementation 
of the endpoint in an integration of our builder,

195
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,320
and then we moved to how to maximize the impact 
of the HTML Importer by combining it with the

196
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,680
Brand Style Management. To do that, we 
enabled the Content Services API key,

197
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,640
just like we did for the HTML Importer, 
by using the dedicated card. And then we

198
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,680
saw an easy implementation of the Brand 
Style Management API endpoint into the

199
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:07,120
same integration we used prior to show you 
the functionality of the HTML Importer.

200
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,280
Now, it's time for a Q&A session where we'll 
get all your questions and hopefully give

201
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,760
you all your answers. And I don't know 
if any came up during the explanation,

202
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,840
we'll start with them and 
then move on to the live ones.

203
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,960
First of all, Luca, fantastic explanation! You 
went through a ton of content in a miraculously

204
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,520
short amount of time, so great job on 
that. Thank you for those explanations.

205
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,560
We do have a robust set of questions, 
so I'm going to go to the first one,

206
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:45,200
which is from David Cohen. I believe he was 
also from the Palm Coast. And his question is,

207
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,800
"Is there an ability to test the HTML 
importer for free coming in the future?"

208
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,320
So, this is more of a product question, 
so I'm not the right guy to ask it to. But

209
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,160
I'll check with my colleagues, and I'll get 
back to you with an answer after the spotlight.

210
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,960
Awesome, appreciate that. Let's go on to the next 
one that is from Stu. "If there are unsupported

211
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,400
HTML tags in the imported file, will you either 
get an error or accept the file and strip them

212
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
out?" And they're trying to figure out how they 
need to handle validation, if they need to handle

213
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,640
it on their side or just parse the responses. 
So, what happens with unsupported HTML tags?

214
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:34,720
The unsupported HTML tags won't break 
the endpoint, as long as the HTML is

215
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,480
correctly structured. That's the only 
thing that will break the endpoint:

216
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:49,440
an HTML that doesn't have the right structure. 
Unsupported HTML tags won't behave predictably,

217
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,640
so you might not get the best result from 
your import, but you don't have to validate

218
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:03,760
on your side which tags you are passing to 
the importer and which you need to sanitize.

219
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,680
Fantastic, thank you for that. Let's 
see here, we have one from... oh okay,

220
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,040
so Samantha shared one, I guess it was 
shared over in the chat, from Provo. "How

221
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:24,080
do you import email templates from the client's 
Beefree account to their Beefree SDK editor?"

222
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,280
Okay, interesting workflow there. So, 
their client has the HTML template,

223
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:38,480
but the provider wants to import it to their SDK 
editor. Yeah, so assuming you want to use the

224
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,280
tools that we are highlighting in this spotlight, 
the thing you can do is have your customer export

225
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:53,200
the HTML for the specific template and then 
import it to the HTML importer. But since your

226
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:01,200
customer is using the Beefree account and 
the Beefree SDK, I'd say get in touch with

227
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:10,560
the CSM that's following you and maybe see if 
there's any other solution that we can work on.

228
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,480
Fantastic, thank you for that. I'm just 
clicking a bunch of buttons here. There's

229
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,240
a lot going on in the chat, but yes, 
excellent answer, excellent answer.

230
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,920
I believe the next one here is from Vishnu. 
"Can they apply external CSS to their HTML?"

231
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,800
Okay, so I'll split this question into two since 
I don't have the full context. If you are saying,

232
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,960
"Can I apply an external CSS to the 
HTML you are importing?" I'd say no,

233
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,640
unless the CSS is publicly available online, but I 
can't guarantee that because we never tested that,

234
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,920
so that's something we should try on our 
end, and maybe we can let you know. The best,

235
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,360
though, is to have the styling 
incorporated in the HTML. That way,

236
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,120
we are certain that the importer can handle 
it correctly. If you want to apply CSS after

237
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,760
you have imported the template, you can do 
that through the Brand Style Management API,

238
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:17,360
as we saw in the second part of the demo, 
simply by defining an appropriate style JSON.

239
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,520
Awesome. You're just handling these 
rapid fire, so I'm going to keep going,

240
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,240
Luca. The next one is from Stu, interesting 
question regarding dynamic content: "If we

241
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,040
want to import dynamic content, can we"—I think 
he means—"can we import it with two different

242
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:40,480
rows for the content and then drag it 
into dynamic content inside the editor?"

243
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,280
So, the only thing that's stopping you from using 
dynamic content is the actual import step. Once

244
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,680
the template is inside the builder, you can 
handle dynamic content as you're used to. So,

245
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,200
let me read the question once again. "If you want 
to import dynamic content, can we import it with

246
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,160
two different rows for the content and then drag 
it into dynamic content inside the editor?" So,

247
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:16,640
the way you're suggesting won't work because the 
HTML Importer isn't coded to work like that. But

248
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,640
you can simply fix the dynamic content after you 
have imported the HTML. As I told you before,

249
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
don't think of this as a 
way to go from zero to 100,

250
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,840
but hopefully from zero to 80% to 90%. There 
are some cases where you might get 100%;

251
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm not saying it won't happen, but you don't 
have to think like that's the solution for this.

252
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,240
Awesome. All right, we have one 
from Kristen, a short question:

253
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,160
"Does the HTML Importer API support merge tags?"

254
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,840
I'll need to double check on this, but 
I don't think so, as once again, you can

255
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,160
add them after you have imported 
the HTML in the template, though.

256
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,000
Got it, okay. And we have one regarding 
the users using the importer: "If we

257
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,880
embed this and give users access, can we 
put a limit on how many times it's used,

258
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,360
like 10 credits or something like that?"

259
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, that is totally up to you. The integration 
of the endpoint into your version of our builder

260
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,200
is completely up to you. You can limit 
the usage per user, you can even create

261
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,600
tiers where each tier has a different number of 
usages for the service. You can price each call

262
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:44,160
like we do. It's up to you. You can do the 
implementation you think suits you better.

263
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,720
Awesome. And just for clarity, would 
that limitation or those tiers be done

264
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
within the editor feature, or 
that would be done externally?

265
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:02,320
I'd say a little bit of both because you have to 
keep track of the limits your user is hitting.

266
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:11,120
One simple implementation that comes to the top 
of my mind is based on the UID of your user,

267
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,720
keep track of how many calls they do 
to those endpoints and keep a counter,

268
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,080
for example, in a database, and once 
the counter reaches the maximum,

269
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:30,800
you stop them from making the call, either 
monthly or with the recurrence you prefer.

270
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:37,280
Awesome, appreciate that. We have one from 
Sam Lewis: "Are there additional improvements

271
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,240
being made to the Import API to improve 
the conversion? We consistently see added

272
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,840
empty columns to the imported templates 
and unaccessible background colors."

273
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,120
Yes, I don't have a roadmap since 
we follow the shape methodology,

274
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,200
but be sure that we'll keep 
improving the HTML Importer.

275
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Awesome. Gideon asks, "How does this 
work with save rows?" So he's using one

276
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,920
of our other very popular features, save 
rows. How does this work with save rows?

277
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,640
Okay, so what do you mean by that? 
Of course, it won't use your save

278
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,280
rows because it doesn't have access while 
it's creating the template to the save

279
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,360
rows, but you can use the save row 
after you have imported the email.

280
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,560
Fantastic. All right. Gideon asked 
a similar question to earlier:

281
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,440
"Any plans to offer a cheaper alternative?"

282
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
Once again, I'm not the right guy 
to ask these kind of questions to,

283
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:49,760
but I will bring the question to our 
product colleagues and let you know.

284
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,840
Absolutely. And at the end, we're going 
to also supply a support email that all

285
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,200
of our users can reach out to for deeper 
questions like that. Let's see here,

286
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,720
here's one from Aaron Bird. And 
again, for anyone who has questions,

287
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,080
put them in the question section of the 
window there. We'll be able to see them a

288
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,800
lot easier. But thanks for sharing this, Sam, 
from Aaron Bird. "When importing with images,

289
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,600
are the images stored on our image editor, 
or is it from the original source?"

290
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,000
So, this is an interesting question, and we can 
check on the fly. So, by the looks of it, it's

291
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:33,920
the original source. Sorry, wrong combination. 
Yep, it's the original source, and that can also

292
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,840
be tested by changing the image and seeing that 
there's no image uploaded to the file manager.

293
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:48,080
That's the reason why we specifically said before 
that any resource you are using in the HTML you

294
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,160
want to import needs to be publicly available on 
the internet; otherwise, this image won't show.

295
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,880
Awesome, thank you for that. The next one is a 
product question again, so I'm going to go to

296
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,560
this one from Yash: "When creating email content 
from within the builder, adds a ton of additional

297
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,880
information for MS and other browser vendors, 
Microsoft or other browser vendors. Simple HTML

298
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,840
created without any fuss. When imported via 
HTML, will the fuss be added automatically?"

299
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:26,800
Okay, that's a lot. Let me digest that one 
again. Okay, okay, so, oh, okay, I got you.

300
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,920
Go ahead. I think the question is, "Will all 
the improvements that Beefree makes to the

301
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,880
HTML to guarantee the compatibility with all 
the email clients be available if I import

302
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,720
the email?" And the answer is yes, yes. Once 
you have imported the email, you're working

303
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,280
with our proprietary JSON. When you want to 
get the HTML back from our proprietary JSON,

304
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,280
you go through our parser, so the end 
result will be what you usually get when

305
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:07,760
you parse an email, you export the HTML from 
Beefree, either Beefree or the Beefree SDK.

306
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,320
Fantastic. And we're down to our last 
two questions. You are killing these,

307
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,440
Luca, so here we go. One from Sudhir: "I'm 
building an HTML template using the AI,

308
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,880
and it is using inline CSS. Can it 
be applied when I import the HTML?

309
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,080
Can be applied, will the inline CSS 
be converted to the JSON properly?"

310
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah, so you are building an HTML using AI, and 
then you want to import the HTML you built with

311
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,120
AI into the builder. If I get this right, I think 
they're asking specifically about the inline CSS,

312
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,320
if that's going to be applied correctly. Yeah, 
as long as it is formatted correctly, I'd say

313
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:02,000
so. We go back to the limitation about the HTML 
being formatted correctly with those specifics

314
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,920
we said earlier about the doctype, the html, 
the body, etc. And if you want more clarity on

315
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,640
the specification, you can look at the 
documentation, but overall, I'd say yes.

316
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:26,000
Fantastic. And finally, one from Bombsy here, who 
asks, "I have a plan—I have plain HTML. Can you

317
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,960
add colors for that by using HTML Importer 
API based on header text? Can I get related

318
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,560
images?" Sounds like two questions. You figure 
that one out. "Plan," perhaps that's plain HTML.

319
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:46,880
Yeah, I think it means plain. "I have plain 
HTML. Can you add colors for that by using the

320
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:58,000
HTML Importer?" So, the HTML Importer doesn't add 
anything; it simply reads the HTML and converts

321
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,720
it to the JSON proprietary for Beefree so that 
you can use it in the template. What you can do

322
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,920
if you want to add colors is use the Brand Style 
Management API, but then again, the Brand Style

323
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,880
Management for now doesn't work in addition; it 
simply merges the style you are defining with the

324
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,000
style already present inside the templates, so 
you cannot add the styles with the Brand Style

325
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,280
Management, but simply modify those that already 
exist. I hope this answered your first question.

326
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,920
Awesome. And by the way, our teammate Samantha 
offered this for the last question as well,

327
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,600
that our simple schema, that there 
was a spotlight session for recently,

328
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,200
that might also be a great option for the 
use in that AI case. So also check schema.

329
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,240
Don't want to go through the HTML to do the AI. 
The AI generation, you can use simple schema,

330
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,840
and it will be converted into our full schema 
using the endpoint we made available recently.

331
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:09,920
Absolutely. The other question was about 
images. This is the last one I have here. "Okay,

332
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,960
if we are onboarding a client and they provide us 
their existing emails to import, I assume there

333
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,360
is no quick route to just import the EML files. 
We need to convert that to plain HTML first."

334
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:30,080
Yes, for now, yes, we just handle plain HTML. 
So, you can develop something on your side if

335
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:36,160
you import customers often and you want to 
speed up this process. You can implement

336
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:45,200
some pre-processing that converts the EML 
into plain HTML, and you can also implement

337
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:54,080
bulk imports on your side. So, you have 
plenty, this tool is very multifaceted,

338
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,920
and it can be used in many ways 
on your side of the integration.

339
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,120
Fantastic. All right, that is all the 
questions. You filled those very well,

340
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,680
Luca. I want to go ahead and put the 
support email up here. Thanks again

341
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,120
for all of you for joining us today for 
this spotlight session about the all-new

342
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,400
HTML Importer API. The docs are listed 
there in the chat, and for any additional

343
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:27,040
questions you have, definitely reach out to 
sdk.support@beefree.io. Any final thoughts, Luca?

344
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:35,120
Well, I just hope you found this spotlight 
interesting and that you are going to be trying

345
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,560
out the HTML Importer and see how you can maximize 
the result with the Brand Style Management.

346
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,760
Fantastic. Thank you all for 
joining and have a great day!
