1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,320
What if transforming HTML email templates 
into editable Beefree content only took

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,920
seconds? From conversations with our customers, 
we’ve heard it can take up to two hours just to

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,600
rebuild a single email starting from 
raw HTML. With the new HTML Importer,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,200
you can programmatically turn existing 
email HTML into Beefree JSON with a single

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,840
API call—transforming your templates into 
fully editable content in seconds, not hours.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
This video will guide you through 
the HTML Importer and how it works,

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
in five easy-to-follow sections. 
We’ll cover real-world use cases,

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
how it works, how to use it, 
embedding it into your workflow,

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,960
and we’ll walk through a full HTML template 
example and the JSON returned from the API.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,440
To kick things off, let’s look at some real-world 
use cases for the HTML Importer. Slow, cumbersome

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,960
migration processes? They’re a thing of the past. 
If you're new to the Beefree SDK, you can migrate

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,800
all your legacy templates without asking your 
customers to manually recreate every single one.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,280
Do you regularly onboard new users who’d 
love to keep using the templates they

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
already have? The HTML Importer lets 
them import their designs and gives

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
them instant editing power—without 
the usual migration headaches.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,320
Or maybe you have a professional services 
team that helps new users migrate their

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,160
templates. With the Importer API, that job 
just got a whole lot easier and faster.

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,360
No matter how you plan to use the HTML 
Importer, it will dramatically streamline

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
your processes. This isn’t just about 
saving time—it’s about empowering your

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,000
users to finally embrace modern email 
builders without the heavy lifting,

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
unlocking faster onboarding, happier customers, 
and a smoother workflow for everyone.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,640
Now let’s quickly talk about what 
the HTML Importer API actually does.

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,120
It takes static HTML emails and transforms 
them into Beefree SDK’s native JSON format,

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,200
ready to load in the builder for quick 
editing. This is great for teams looking

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
to migrate existing templates or 
upload HTML templates to edit.

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,880
Now let’s talk about how to use it—but 
before we do, one quick note: The email

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,160
example we’ll be showing in this video comes from 
reallygoodemails.com and is used strictly for

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,040
demonstration purposes. This example is intended 
to show how the HTML Importer API works and should

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,960
not be seen as an endorsement or encouragement 
to copy or reuse another brand’s content.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,360
So, we kindly ask that you use 
any email inspiration responsibly.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,320
Okay—when you’re ready to transform your 
HTML email templates into editable designs

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,760
inside the Beefree builder, here’s how to do it.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,280
Step one: Enable the HTML Importer API

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,440
Before anything else, you need to enable the 
HTML Importer API for your SDK application.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Make sure you’re logged into the 
Beefree SDK developer console. Next,

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,080
select your application—in this example, 
our email builder. Click on “Details.”

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,880
Now, scroll down to the section labeled HTML 
Importer API, then click “Enable the service

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:27,520
and generate an API key.” You’ll see a 
popup confirming that additional fees

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,520
may apply when using this feature. Click 
“Save,” and your API key is now available.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,680
This key is required for authentication, 
so be sure to keep it safe.

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
It’s also worth noting that you can set

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,320
up the HTML Importer with a free 
account—no paid plan is needed.

43
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,800
Step two: Copy HTML and authenticate your API key

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,920
Now we’ll jump into the Beefree SDK docs, 
where you’ll find details about how the

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,040
API works—and where you can test 
it in our interactive playground.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:17,040
First, navigate to the API section, click 
on HTML Importer API, and then Import HTML.

47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:34,080
Scroll down to see the prerequisites—which 
we’ll talk about more in a second—and the

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920
API call setup (for example, making sure 
your method is POST). At the very bottom,

49
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,400
you’ll find the testing 
environment. Click “Test it.”

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,560
A window will pop up. You can expand it using 
the top-right button. You'll see information

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,120
pre-populated here, including the URL 
and a placeholder for the collection,

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,000
which we’ll later set to conversion.

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,280
Before authenticating our API 
key, let’s first grab the HTML.

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Head to reallygoodemails.com. I’ve 
pre-selected an email that celebrates

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,720
how awesome dogs are—and I love the 
layout, so I want to repurpose it.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,760
Copy the HTML. Head back to the playground,

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,440
scroll down to the “body” section, 
click “Other,” and paste in the HTML.

58
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Step three: Structure your HTML before sending

59
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,280
Correct formatting is critical for successful 
conversion. If your HTML is missing key elements

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
or doesn’t follow standard structure, 
we can’t properly convert the design.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,320
To prepare your HTML for smooth 
conversion, make sure it includes:

62
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,620
A DOCTYPE declaration

63
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,960
Opening and closing html and body tags

64
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,440
A meta charset="UTF-8" tag in the <head>

65
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Remove anything unexpected—like merge tags or 
scripts—especially if they’re outside the body or

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,800
at the end of the file. Poor structure can cause 
the conversion to fail or generate corrupted JSON.

67
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
Clean, well-structured HTML = best results.

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
Now that our HTML is ready, we can 
complete the authentication step.

69
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
Head back to the Beefree SDK developer console,

70
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,852
copy your API key, and paste it into the 
authentication section as a Bearer Token.

71
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:31,040
Make sure you select Bearer Token 
as the authentication method—this is

72
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:41,600
required for Beefree SDK’s API calls.

73
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,480
Step four: Import HTML via the API

74
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,600
We need to input a few key 
values before converting

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,880
our static HTML into Beefree’s editable JSON.

76
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,960
We’ve already pasted our HTML 
and added our API key. Now:

77
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
Set collection to conversion

78
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,920
Set Content-Type to text/html

79
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,040
Click “Send.” If everything’s set 
up correctly, you should receive

80
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,560
a 200 response, confirming a successful call.

81
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,320
On the right, you’ll see the JSON. This is Beefree

82
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,160
SDK’s proprietary format—what gets 
loaded into the builder for editing.

83
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Step five: Embed in your workflow

84
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,760
You can use this API however it fits your 
team’s workflow. One common use case:

85
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,960
adding an Import HTML button to your app that 
lets users upload their HTML with a single click.

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,960
We’ve made that easy—sample code is available 
in our docs and linked in the video description.

87
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
Let’s try it out together.

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:16,800
Using our demo environment, we’ll copy 
the same HTML from reallygoodemails.com,

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:27,440
paste it into the Import 
HTML modal, and click Import.

90
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:35,120
Give it a second—and just like that, the email 
is now loaded in the Beefree SDK builder.

91
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,520
You’ll notice how all the 
elements—images, buttons,

92
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,440
and layout—are now editable Beefree blocks.

93
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
Once you load that JSON into the editor,

94
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,800
most of the heavy lifting is done. Users 
can tweak the design or polish it as needed.

95
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,400
Think of it as 95% done, with full 
control to customize the rest.

96
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,640
Let’s wrap with a quick summary:

97
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,400
The HTML Importer converts static 
HTML into Beefree JSON via API

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,240
It requires well-formatted HTML

99
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Use POST + text/html + 
authentication via Bearer Token

100
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,280
Response is ready-to-edit JSON

101
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,760
Final edits can be made in the builder

102
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,120
Choose this if you want to cut 
down on manual rebuilding and

103
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
support smart migrations or quick HTML uploads.

104
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,840
That’s a wrap.

105
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:38,240
The HTML Importer makes it easier than ever to 
bring HTML templates into Beefree SDK. It’s fast,

106
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
flexible, and saves time for both 
internal teams and end users.

107
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,280
No need to rebuild templates from 
scratch—just import and edit.

108
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,920
