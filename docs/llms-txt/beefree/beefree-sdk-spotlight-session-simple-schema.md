Hello, hi everyone! Hi there. Welcome 
to Simple Schema. If you're joining us,

0:00:24.160,0:00:29.840
if you're here, put a little note in the 
chat message down on the right-hand side

0:00:29.840,0:00:37.440
and let us know where you're joining from. 
Hello! My name is McKenzie, this is Zair,

0:00:37.440,0:00:44.320
and we'll wait a few minutes to get started here, 
but we're on the West Coast of the United States,

0:00:44.320,0:00:50.080
if you can't tell from my accent. So I'm in 
Portland, Oregon. We've got Mark from Lincoln,

0:00:50.080,0:00:54.880
Nebraska. Hello, my fellow Midwesterner, 
not sure if that's what we call us. I'm

0:00:54.880,0:01:04.160
from Wisconsin originally. Hello Blaine from 
San Francisco, hi Alex, got Denver, Colorado.

0:01:04.160,0:01:16.240
California, Little Rock, Arkansas. How's 
the weather everywhere? It's really sunny

0:01:16.240,0:01:21.120
here today in Portland. We're having a 
beautiful Portland, Oregon sunny day,

0:01:21.120,0:01:28.240
which is certainly an oxymoron. It's 
quite rainy here, but spring's coming,

0:01:28.240,0:01:34.800
or spring's here, I think almost, and then it'll 
be summer soon. Thanks for joining us everyone

0:01:34.800,0:01:41.360
to talk about Simple Schema. We'll just give it 
another couple minutes before we get going. Oh,

0:01:41.360,0:01:49.200
tornado storms incoming in Arkansas. Okay, stay 
safe out there, but stay on this call because

0:01:49.200,0:02:00.480
this is very important. No, I'm kidding. Please 
stay safe in Arkansas. We've got Utah, Germany,

0:02:00.480,0:02:10.000
Berlin. I'll be in Berlin next week, maybe I'll 
see you there. We'll give it just a couple more

0:02:10.000,0:02:19.680
moments. Again, thanks for joining us. I'm located 
in Portland, Oregon, on the West Coast here in

0:02:19.680,0:02:31.920
the US. Zair's down in San Diego, right? Yep, yep, 
sunny San Diego, it's always a beautiful day here.

0:02:35.920,0:02:58.560
Um, yeah, we could use a Berlin email geek 
meetup. Okay, I think we'll get going here. So,

0:02:59.600,0:03:03.200
I'm McKenzie Wacker, and I have worked with,

0:03:03.200,0:03:08.720
um, I've worked on the Beefree SDK Customers 
team here for about a year, so perhaps I've

0:03:08.720,0:03:15.840
interacted with some of you, and hopefully 
I've helped you. And Zair here: Hey everyone,

0:03:15.840,0:03:22.880
I'm Zair. I'm the Lead Technical Writer here at 
Beefree SDK. I'm on the Product Engineering team,

0:03:22.880,0:03:28.880
and I'm excited to be with you all here today and 
to talk a little bit more about Simple Schema. And

0:03:28.880,0:03:36.320
like McKenzie mentioned, I'm located in Southern 
California, in the wonderful city of San Diego.

0:03:37.200,0:03:42.960
Yeah, so again, thank you all for joining here. 
We're going to talk about, if you want to go to

0:03:42.960,0:03:50.560
the next slide, Zair, just a couple notes first. 
So on the right-hand side, you've found the chat

0:03:50.560,0:03:56.480
box. A lot of you have found the chat box. There 
is also a Questions section down there. It's the

0:03:56.480,0:04:01.360
tab next to Questions. So throughout this, we're 
going to, yeah, I'm going to give an introduction

0:04:01.360,0:04:06.720
to the Simple Schema, talk about the benefits. 
Then I'll pop it over to Zair for a live demo,

0:04:06.720,0:04:13.440
and at the end we'll have a Q&A session. So feel 
free to put your questions down into the Question

0:04:13.440,0:04:19.520
section next to the chat, and we'll save them till 
the end. And then we'll try to get through as many

0:04:19.520,0:04:25.040
as we can, but if we don't get through them all, 
that's okay. This is being recorded, so you will

0:04:25.040,0:04:31.040
receive the recording of this afterwards. And 
then if we don't get to your question today,

0:04:31.040,0:04:38.640
we'll follow up with you individually afterwards. 
And then we also, you know, we can always email

0:04:38.640,0:04:47.040
pluginsupport@beefree.io with any further 
questions as well if something comes up later.

0:04:47.040,0:04:54.160
So let's get going. What is the Beefree Simple 
Schema? Well, let's start with the problem or

0:04:54.160,0:05:00.000
the challenge that we were having. For years now, 
we've received many requests from customers asking

0:05:00.000,0:05:06.160
if you can open up the internal JSON language 
so that they can generate Beefree-compatible

0:05:06.160,0:05:12.720
content outside of the editor. People have been 
wanting to more easily and programmatically

0:05:12.720,0:05:17.600
generate native Beefree JSON without having to 
enter the editor. So in the last couple years,

0:05:17.600,0:05:23.120
we've had even more people make this request 
because they want to train an AI model on

0:05:23.120,0:05:28.320
the structure of our JSON so the model can 
appropriately respond to prompts requesting

0:05:28.320,0:05:33.680
for content or full templates that match 
our JSON and can then be uploaded and be

0:05:33.680,0:05:39.920
compatible with the editor. So the challenge 
here is that the Beefree native JSON is just,

0:05:39.920,0:05:45.120
it's way too complex for these tasks. And 
one reason for that is it doesn't just hold

0:05:45.120,0:05:50.400
the structure of your design, it also powers 
things like the drag-and-drop functionality

0:05:50.400,0:05:55.520
within the editor and so much else. So 
what we really needed here was a simpler,

0:05:55.520,0:06:03.600
more streamlined data structure for the AI models 
and the developers alike to work with more easily.

0:06:03.600,0:06:08.560
So our team listened, and we 
developed the Simple Schema.

0:06:08.560,0:06:13.840
So the Simple Schema is a new data structure 
that is much more simple and streamlined,

0:06:13.840,0:06:20.000
and it's a versatile version of the Beefree native 
JSON. It's designed to make that programmatic

0:06:20.000,0:06:25.840
template creation much more accessible, especially 
for AI models, which we're going to really get

0:06:25.840,0:06:32.160
into today. With the Simple Schema, you can now 
generate full templates or content outside of the

0:06:32.160,0:06:38.080
visual builder, whether manually or using AI. And 
if you'd like, you can then use our new Simple to

0:06:38.080,0:06:44.800
Full Schema conversion API to turn your content 
into the full Beefree JSON schema so that it's

0:06:44.800,0:06:52.960
also editable in the editor. The key benefit 
here of the Simple Schema is that it opens

0:06:52.960,0:07:00.160
that door for AI-powered content generation, 
so you can train a large language model to

0:07:00.160,0:07:06.160
create full templates, or a small 
AI model to handle copy, images,

0:07:06.160,0:07:11.040
layout separately. So whether you're building 
templates via code or training generative AI

0:07:11.040,0:07:18.880
tools, this schema reduces that complexity that is 
with the Beefree native JSON, and it just really

0:07:18.880,0:07:24.400
speeds up development. It also significantly 
enhances custom add-on development, making that

0:07:24.400,0:07:32.720
easier and more flexible than ever with more 
properties and simplified schema management.

0:07:32.720,0:07:40.400
So now we're going to have Zair here come on 
and give us a demo. All right, thanks so much

0:07:40.400,0:07:47.040
for that awesome introduction, McKenzie, and hello 
everyone. So for this portion of the presentation,

0:07:47.040,0:07:52.960
we're going to walk through a live demo, and 
the best and easiest way for me to do that is

0:07:52.960,0:07:57.760
to navigate through these different tabs 
that I have open on my screen right now.

0:07:57.760,0:08:02.720
So just bear with me as I navigate through 
the various tabs. If for any reason along

0:08:02.720,0:08:08.960
the way there's something on my screen that's too 
tiny, just let me know and I can zoom in further

0:08:10.400,0:08:18.560
so that way you all can see what I'm doing. 
So when we talk about Simple Schema, one of

0:08:18.560,0:08:25.600
the first steps we take is to train AI with the 
Simple Schema, and in order to really understand

0:08:25.600,0:08:31.360
what that looks like, I want to go through a 
few of the resources that we created when we

0:08:31.360,0:08:38.400
first went live with Simple Schema. One of those 
resources was this GitHub repository, and I'll

0:08:38.400,0:08:45.920
actually share the link to this repository here 
in the chat that way everyone can access this as

0:08:45.920,0:08:53.600
I go along for this portion of the presentation. 
And in this repository, you'll notice that we have

0:08:54.320,0:08:59.520
many different schemas. So Simple Schema 
is actually composed of all these various

0:08:59.520,0:09:06.560
components. So you'll notice that we have the 
structure for a simple template. We also have

0:09:06.560,0:09:14.640
a definition schema, and then when we think about 
how templates are created within Beefree, we have

0:09:14.640,0:09:22.560
the infrastructure is essentially to create 
rows, and within rows, so here we have the Simple

0:09:22.560,0:09:27.840
Row Schema. Within rows, we have columns, 
we have the Simple Column Schema over here,

0:09:27.840,0:09:35.120
and then within columns, we have different 
content blocks and modules. So those options

0:09:35.120,0:09:42.240
include button, divider, HTML, icons, and so 
on. So when we talk about training an AI agent,

0:09:42.240,0:09:48.800
what we're really talking about is taking these 
files that are included in this repository and

0:09:48.800,0:09:56.640
using them as a set of instructions for an 
AI agent to learn off of. So that's step one.

0:09:56.640,0:10:03.520
Now let's talk about an example prompt. So 
when we're prompting AI, we want to make sure

0:10:03.520,0:10:09.440
that we're very clear. The instructions that 
we provide it with that way it leverages the

0:10:09.440,0:10:17.360
various files that I went over earlier to create 
valid templates, JSON templates. And the reason

0:10:17.360,0:10:23.440
why that's important is because we're in our next 
step. We're going to be making a few API calls.

0:10:23.440,0:10:32.800
So when we talk about a prompt here on the screen, 
I have a few instructions here. I'm talking about

0:10:32.800,0:10:44.160
a template that is targeted at dog lovers, and 
here I'm telling the AI agent to reference this

0:10:44.160,0:10:52.560
Simple Template Schema, which I pointed out in 
the repository earlier, and mentioning that this

0:10:52.560,0:10:58.000
defines the overall structure of the template, so 
to use it as a reference correctly. And then we

0:10:58.000,0:11:02.480
all know that sometimes AI can be a little bit 
creative. Sometimes it has a mind of its own,

0:11:02.480,0:11:07.440
and we want to make sure that when we're 
constructing templates, that AI stays on

0:11:07.440,0:11:13.760
track. So the ways that we provide instructions 
for AI to stay on track is really important,

0:11:13.760,0:11:18.800
and I include a few high-level bullet points 
over here that kind of go over that guidance,

0:11:18.800,0:11:24.880
right? So strictly follow the schemas provided, 
those are the ones that we referenced. Do not use

0:11:24.880,0:11:30.560
any properties that are not explicitly supported. 
This is just to keep AI on track and make sure it

0:11:30.560,0:11:36.880
doesn't invent any properties along the way. 
And then ensure that all required properties

0:11:36.880,0:11:42.960
are correctly included, and then the final 
output should be that valid Simple Template

0:11:42.960,0:11:50.720
JSON. So this is an example. As you train your 
own AI models to build these schemas, you're

0:11:50.720,0:11:57.040
probably going to add many more instructions, 
but this is just a high-level overview for a

0:11:57.040,0:12:02.480
minimalist type of implementation, 
which we're going to go over today.

0:12:02.480,0:12:09.120
So now let's jump into the next step. Okay, we 
talked about how to train AI, where those schemas

0:12:09.120,0:12:14.800
are, what an example prompt should look like. 
Let's talk about what this API call looks like.

0:12:15.440,0:12:21.680
So in our technical documentation, we actually 
have an interactive testing environment,

0:12:21.680,0:12:29.360
and that interactive testing environment, 
um, I'll go ahead and navigate to it very

0:12:29.360,0:12:39.360
quickly over here in this tab. And it's all 
the way over here, Simple to Full. So it's

0:12:39.360,0:12:47.440
this section of the documentation. It talks about 
the different requirements for making an API call,

0:12:47.440,0:12:55.440
and then you can actually test that out over here. 
If you click Test It, it just navigates over to

0:12:55.440,0:13:00.320
an environment that looks a lot like this, and 
you'll notice that I already prepopulated some

0:13:00.320,0:13:06.880
information here, but I'm still going to go over 
the different components. So the first part is the

0:13:06.880,0:13:14.240
URL. The endpoint is simple-to-full-json. It does 
require the collection. The collection for this

0:13:14.240,0:13:20.240
one is conversion, and in order to authenticate, 
you need to have a bearer token, and you can get

0:13:20.240,0:13:28.480
that bearer token within the Beefree SDK Developer 
Console, and that'll be, um, that'll be the token

0:13:28.480,0:13:33.040
that's associated with like API key. So it'll 
say API key, and you use that, and you enter

0:13:33.040,0:13:41.600
it as a bearer token here. And then we on our 
docs site, we actually already have an example,

0:13:41.600,0:13:50.880
um, template that was created using Simple Schema 
and AI that you can go ahead and test a conversion

0:13:50.880,0:13:56.240
with if you want to start experimenting. And 
as we scroll down, we'll notice that this

0:13:57.040,0:14:09.760
body, this request body, is only 313 lines long. 
Now when we make a request, okay, perfect. And we

0:14:09.760,0:14:19.040
now get our full Beefree SDK JSON, and we scroll 
all the way down. I'm still scrolling, so I did

0:14:19.040,0:14:28.720
scroll past line 313, and I'm still scrolling. 
Almost there, I'll try to speed this up. Okay,

0:14:28.720,0:14:39.200
so yeah, we're about a thousand lines over what 
Simple Schema was. So that's, this touches on the

0:14:39.200,0:14:49.840
point that McKenzie made earlier, right? 313 
lines, that's a very reasonable, um, quantity

0:14:49.840,0:14:56.160
to train AI off of. AI can keep up with that, 
but when we're talking about our more complex

0:14:56.160,0:15:07.200
Beefree JSON that is builder-compatible, that is 
much more difficult to train AI with because of

0:15:07.200,0:15:17.280
the volume. We're talking about 1,377 lines here 
compared to 313. That's a very large difference.

0:15:17.920,0:15:24.160
So that's what makes Simple Schema so easy 
to use is that with a simple API call,

0:15:24.160,0:15:33.200
you can convert that AI-generated template into 
the Beefree SDK-compatible JSON that can then

0:15:33.200,0:15:40.480
be loaded within the builder by end-users. 
So that's how the API call works. If you

0:15:40.480,0:15:46.480
are interested in experimenting with the APIs, 
with this API endpoint in particular, you can

0:15:46.480,0:15:52.800
check out the documentation. It'll navigate you to 
the same exact environment. The only thing you'll

0:15:52.800,0:16:00.880
need to add is your own bearer token and make 
sure that you set the collection to conversion.

0:16:00.880,0:16:10.080
All right, so now that we've gone over, um, 
the Simple Schema files, the example prompt,

0:16:10.080,0:16:20.240
and how the API call works, now we can go ahead 
and jump into scenario one. So in this repository,

0:16:20.240,0:16:26.800
you'll notice that I included this folder called 
Simple Schema Concept, and in this folder, we have

0:16:26.800,0:16:32.640
an example scenario of how you can implement 
a Simple Schema for your end-users and how to

0:16:32.640,0:16:40.000
create an AI-driven content creation experience 
for them, uh, using this folder. It's kind of

0:16:40.000,0:16:46.880
an inspirational guide. It's very minimalist, 
bare bones, but it does the job in terms of

0:16:46.880,0:16:53.680
providing that inspirational aspect. So let's 
take a visual look at all of this, and I'm going

0:16:53.680,0:17:11.200
to open my demo environment very quickly. So I 
have this, okay, awesome. So here's a very simple,

0:17:11.200,0:17:19.840
um, experience that I've created, and you can see 
on the front end, this looks like an application.

0:17:19.840,0:17:30.480
I built all of this, so it's all, um, just, uh, 
additional add-ons, um, and here you'll notice

0:17:30.480,0:17:37.200
that there is this rectangle that says "Use AI 
to build your first design." So I'm an end-user,

0:17:37.200,0:17:44.720
I'm going to go ahead and click this button, 
and I see, uh, "AI Email Design Assistance."

0:17:44.720,0:17:52.320
This is again, just an inspirational popup, 
and it's asking me to describe my email design,

0:17:52.320,0:17:58.240
and it provides me with a few tips for the best 
results. So here I'm going to go ahead and write a

0:17:58.240,0:18:15.600
prompt, uh, something like, uh, "Provide me with a 
compelling email that follows email best practices

0:18:15.600,0:18:32.640
defined by the greatest marketers of all time. The 
products should be from my product offering." And

0:18:32.640,0:18:42.560
now I'm just going to wrap this up: "Include the 
tech line of products." All set. So that's good

0:18:42.560,0:18:49.680
to go. I click Generate, and now as an end-user, 
I'm seeing this, uh, confirmation message. Again,

0:18:49.680,0:18:55.600
this is all the part of the experience that 
I created, and then I click "Customize my new

0:18:55.600,0:19:02.160
email," and I'm redirected to the Beefree 
SDK Builder, and now I have this template

0:19:02.160,0:19:08.320
that was created programmatically, automatically 
loaded within the builder, and as an end-user,

0:19:08.320,0:19:15.920
I can start editing it. So I can see that all of 
these modules are clickable, they're editable. Um,

0:19:15.920,0:19:23.760
I can add text within there, and I can also, 
um, let's say I want to add some, you know,

0:19:23.760,0:19:35.120
additional modules, I can also do that. So let's 
talk a little bit about what happened, um, when I,

0:19:35.120,0:19:43.280
uh, as the end-user, um, clicked or submitted 
my prompt. That prompt was sent to the backend

0:19:43.280,0:19:53.120
and used as context for the Simple Schema to be 
generated. And then that generated Simple Schema,

0:19:53.120,0:19:59.200
based off of the prompt that the end-user 
submitted, is then sent over to the API

0:19:59.200,0:20:05.360
endpoint. The API endpoint creates this template, 
and then this template loads within the builder,

0:20:05.360,0:20:15.040
and the end-user is redirected to that. So this 
is scenario one. And I'll go through one more

0:20:15.040,0:20:24.000
scenario. And before I jump into that second 
scenario, I want to take you to Deepseek,

0:20:24.000,0:20:32.240
where I had a quick and brief conversation with 
Deepseek about creating not just one template,

0:20:32.240,0:20:37.920
but three templates for me all at once. And the 
reason why I want to get into this is because

0:20:37.920,0:20:45.680
this concept touches upon how you can create 
multiple versions of a template and then allow

0:20:45.680,0:20:52.640
your end-users to select which version works 
best for them and their needs. And then you

0:20:52.640,0:20:58.880
can create a scenario in which you can actually 
gather more information about your end-users

0:20:58.880,0:21:07.920
and their preferences based on providing them 
with multiple options. So I attached my files,

0:21:07.920,0:21:17.120
these all came from the GitHub repository. 
Deepseek in this chat has like a ten-file limit,

0:21:17.120,0:21:22.960
so I couldn't actually attach more than ten files, 
so I pasted the last three. That's why in the

0:21:22.960,0:21:32.000
prompt, you'll see that I've attached and pasted 
the different schemas within here, within this

0:21:32.000,0:21:41.360
message. And then I provided it with the prompt 
guidelines that I mentioned in the presentation,

0:21:41.360,0:21:49.520
in this portion, in the example prompt. And then 
from there, I went on to describe the scenario.

0:21:49.520,0:21:56.800
So I mentioned that this is for dog lovers. It 
should include these different color preferences

0:21:56.800,0:22:02.960
for each template, and then it should remain 
consistent with these essential products. So I go

0:22:02.960,0:22:11.280
on to provide it with all of those instructions, 
and then it starts generating these templates.

0:22:11.280,0:22:28.080
So now let's take a look at what that looked like 
as the final result. So over here, okay, so now

0:22:28.080,0:22:37.760
this is the new version, the new environment that 
shows three versions of an email design based on

0:22:37.760,0:22:46.640
an end-user's one prompt. So I click here. I 
provide, you know, the same prompt. I want to,

0:22:46.640,0:22:57.920
well, a different prompt in this scenario. 
I want to make an email campaign for dog

0:22:57.920,0:23:10.400
lovers advertising my products. And then here I 
click Generate. Excuse me. And now I have three

0:23:10.400,0:23:16.400
different versions here, and at a glance, you can 
see that this one is a little bit slightly darker

0:23:16.400,0:23:22.560
blue, this one's a lighter blue in the background, 
and this one has a gray background. And if you're

0:23:22.560,0:23:31.680
wondering how I was able to generate these images, 
I was able to do that using the /html and /image

0:23:31.680,0:23:39.040
endpoints, which brought them, which brought these 
images into this portion. So it's really using

0:23:39.040,0:23:44.560
the Simple Schema endpoint, the HTML endpoint, 
and then also the Image endpoint, which you can

0:23:44.560,0:23:52.640
learn more about in our technical documentation. 
So I'm just going to click on Version One as the

0:23:52.640,0:23:59.600
end-user, and now I'm redirected to this template, 
and you'll notice here that I'm redirected to an

0:23:59.600,0:24:06.880
email. It includes the images that I included 
in my prompt. It includes the different products

0:24:06.880,0:24:14.480
that I wanted to advertise. And while it's not 
a perfect design, it's something that you can

0:24:14.480,0:24:21.440
absolutely iterate upon, um, as you create 
more sophisticated prompts on your backend.

0:24:22.160,0:24:30.000
And now as the end-user, because I selected this, 
uh, template, Template One, you've also learned

0:24:30.000,0:24:37.360
more about my design preferences, and you can use 
that information to create future Simple Schemas

0:24:37.360,0:24:47.520
that are then converted into other assets. All 
right, so that's scenario two, and that concludes

0:24:47.520,0:24:54.960
this portion of the presentation with the demo. 
I'll go ahead and toss it back over to McKenzie,

0:24:54.960,0:25:05.280
and we can open it up for Q&A. Well, thanks, Zair, 
that was, that was fantastic. Um, that was great.

0:25:05.280,0:25:10.960
Yeah, just a reminder, there is a question 
tab down in the bottom right-hand corner. I

0:25:10.960,0:25:16.880
see there's a couple in there right now, uh, so if 
you do have a question, please throw it in there.

0:25:17.520,0:25:22.880
So first of all, "Will the slides be made 
available to us later?" This has been recorded,

0:25:22.880,0:25:29.360
and we are going to share that recording 
with everybody who has signed up today. So

0:25:29.360,0:25:34.560
if you really would like the slides, please 
reach out, and we can get you those as well,

0:25:34.560,0:25:39.600
but they are in the recording and, and you know, 
we think that's kind of the most important part.

0:25:41.680,0:25:43.520
Q&A
Q:

0:25:48.320,0:25:56.720
Can the Simple Schema be used for 
building landing pages as well?

0:25:56.720,0:26:06.240
A: Yes, it can. You actually have to 
define the type inside of the template

0:26:06.240,0:26:12.000
when you make your API call, and that 
type field you can set it to popup,

0:26:12.000,0:26:21.520
email, or page (not landing page, just page), 
and then it'll define, it'll go from there.

0:26:21.520,0:26:32.720
Q: I know the Simple Schema is recommended 
for programmatically creating templates,

0:26:32.720,0:26:40.560
but is there a specification 
available for the full schema as well?

0:26:43.680,0:26:56.880
A: I think you might be talking about the full 
Beefree SDK native JSON. If that's not the case,

0:26:59.600,0:27:09.280
please clarify in the chat. But 
right now we have Simple Schema, and

0:27:13.520,0:27:20.240
next week we'll also have an HTML importer, 
which will allow you to use the HTML route

0:27:20.240,0:27:29.120
and convert that to Beefree SDK native JSON. 
So really, either of those two options are

0:27:29.120,0:27:37.520
the ones that we currently have available. So 
there is an endpoint that allows you to use

0:27:38.320,0:27:45.600
the Simple Schema and then hit the endpoint to 
convert it into that full native Beefree JSON.

0:29:11.520,0:29:54.320
Q: What about the elements that are not documented 
in Simple Schema docs, like forms for pages?

0:29:54.320,0:29:58.480
A: That's a good question. We 
actually have a separate GitHub

0:29:58.480,0:30:04.800
repository for forms. I can share the 
schema you can use to validate forms,

0:30:05.360,0:30:11.600
but that does exist in a separate repository. 
I'll share it in the chat right now so whoever

0:30:11.600,0:30:18.960
asked that question also has access to 
that schema, the form validation schema.

0:30:18.960,0:30:45.920
Q: Any plans for moving 
these changes to production?

0:31:04.160,0:31:13.200
A: The Simple Schema is already live, 
so you can start using it today.

0:31:26.800,0:31:35.600
Q: Will we need to convert old email JSON 
from our own schema into Beefree-compatible

0:31:35.600,0:31:40.480
JSON? Am I correct in assuming this 
would be a good workflow for that:

0:31:40.480,0:31:46.800
our JSON to Simple Schema 
JSON to Beefree native JSON?

0:31:48.480,0:31:55.120
A: Yes, I think that sounds like a good 
workflow. We also are about to release,

0:31:55.840,0:32:02.400
or have just, we're about to release on 
May 7th, an HTML to Beefree JSON converter,

0:32:02.400,0:32:06.400
which is very exciting. That's something 
different, but also something a lot of

0:32:06.400,0:32:10.880
people have been asking about. So 
that's not your native JSON, however,

0:32:10.880,0:32:18.960
if you had HTML that you wanted to convert 
to the Beefree native JSON, that's just about

0:32:18.960,0:32:29.440
possible. So we're excited about that. But 
yes, I think that this is a good workflow.

0:32:29.440,0:32:35.600
Q: Is there documentation 
that our development team

0:32:35.600,0:32:41.280
can refer to with some examples for a 
person who is new to the Beefree API?

0:32:41.280,0:32:52.400
A: Yes, I'll share that link in the chat 
right now. I'll include our GitHub URL. We

0:32:52.400,0:32:56.960
have an example repository, and then I'll 
also include the technical documentation,

0:32:56.960,0:33:06.000
and on the technical documentation, you 
can actually test all of our endpoints.

0:33:06.000,0:33:14.720
Q: Have you tested with other models other than 
DeepSeek, and if so, how have the results varied?

0:33:14.720,0:33:24.560
A: Yes, one of the developers on our team used 
GitHub Copilot, and it was in the same format too,

0:33:24.560,0:33:31.680
so it was just a chat, and they connected, they 
uploaded the schema files, and then used a similar

0:33:31.680,0:33:42.160
prompt, and it did generate the Simple Schema 
template, and the results were, you know, they

0:33:42.160,0:33:48.640
worked pretty well. And even if it doesn't work on 
that first try, again, with just a little bit of

0:33:48.640,0:33:59.120
feedback from the API call results, it'll give you 
error validation feedback. Just by applying that,

0:33:59.120,0:34:05.920
usually it gets it on the second try too, so 
it's really, really impressive and works very

0:34:05.920,0:34:14.720
quickly. There's a little bit of training 
involved, but this is completely different

0:34:14.720,0:34:22.800
than first attempts with the native JSON Beefree 
JSON here, so this should really be a great tool.

0:34:24.640,0:34:29.200
Q: Can we set up anything to 
import JavaScript as well into

0:34:29.200,0:34:38.480
JSON as a complement of HTML? I'm 
talking about pages, not email.

0:34:40.720,0:34:47.600
A: The native Beefree JSON is actually 
kind of compatible between builders,

0:34:47.600,0:34:54.160
so you could actually build an email template 
in the editor and then take that JSON and put

0:34:54.160,0:35:02.720
it into the page builder, and it would then, 
upon saving, generate HTML for the web. So

0:35:02.720,0:35:10.640
it is compatible between the builders. Therefore, 
if you are converting that into the Beefree JSON,

0:35:10.640,0:35:34.960
it's compatible across. I would recommend checking 
out the documentation to get all the very granular

0:35:35.600,0:35:41.440
level details on that so that way you can ensure 
that you're setting everything up correctly,

0:35:41.440,0:35:47.280
but there are a few instructions in there that 
I recommend following. I'll share a link right

0:35:47.280,0:35:52.720
now in the chat to that specific section, 
which includes those more granular level

0:35:53.280,0:35:59.920
instructions for folks. And in the 
email following this presentation,

0:36:00.480,0:36:06.720
we'll include all relevant links as well, so 
if you're not grabbing them from the chat,

0:36:06.720,0:36:15.520
don't worry about it, we're recording, 
and we will share in the follow-up email.

0:36:15.520,0:36:22.240
Q: Is it possible to use the full schema 
programmatically to implement own transformations,

0:36:22.240,0:36:32.400
like full schema to some other format for the spec 
needed? So it has to be stable, is that the, um...

0:36:32.400,0:36:39.200
A: I think, and the individual who asked 
this, feel free to correct me if you're

0:36:39.200,0:36:46.880
asking something else, but we do have a group 
of endpoints that are available in our Content

0:36:46.880,0:36:54.560
Services API that actually takes the Beefree 
native JSON and converts it into other formats,

0:36:54.560,0:37:01.680
and those formats can be HTML. It can 
transform the Beefree JSON to an image

0:37:03.520,0:37:18.000
using the HTML endpoint, and also you can 
export other formats like PDF. So we have a

0:37:18.000,0:37:23.280
variety of different formats that you can use 
that are available under the Content Services

0:37:23.280,0:37:30.320
API section of the documentation where you 
can transform Beefree JSON into a lot of

0:37:30.320,0:37:41.600
other things. We even have an AI collection for 
converting them to SMS metadata or also summaries.

0:37:49.680,0:37:54.480
Q: How does the Simple Schema work with saved

0:37:54.480,0:38:03.120
rows? Is it just another property 
in the JSON like everything else?

0:38:03.120,0:38:15.040
A: We have the Simple Schema section because 
really what the workflow would look like is that

0:38:15.040,0:38:22.480
you create the Simple Schema template, the Simple 
Schema is converted to the Beefree full JSON,

0:38:22.480,0:38:28.720
and then folks can interact on the front end with 
that content and save rows from there. That's one

0:38:28.720,0:38:36.640
pathway. There's also the custom add-ons where 
you can create a custom row type, and that works

0:38:36.640,0:38:42.160
a little bit differently. We won't cover that in 
this particular session, but I do know that we'll

0:38:42.160,0:38:49.120
have future sessions touching on custom add-ons, 
so we can jump into that other scenario a little

0:38:49.120,0:38:54.240
bit more there. And we do have some resources 
on that in the custom add-on section of our

0:38:54.240,0:39:00.880
documentation too, and you can also reach out 
to us at the email that McKenzie mentioned,

0:39:04.160,0:39:14.960
pluginsupport@beefree.io, is always a great way 
to tell us anything, reach out with questions.

0:39:20.880,0:39:29.360
Q: Is there documentation that 
talks more specifically about the

0:39:29.360,0:39:34.160
details of training the AI model on Simple Schema?

0:39:34.160,0:39:41.280
A: This is going to kind of depend on the AI model 
a little bit as well. So you know, we really kind

0:39:41.280,0:39:53.280
of leave it to you to pick the AI model that works 
best for you. Experiment a bit if need be. We did

0:39:53.280,0:39:57.920
mention that we would share the, I think we were 
talking just a few minutes ago about including

0:39:57.920,0:40:04.720
the prompt that we used in the documentation. I 
think that's a great idea, so I think we'll put

0:40:04.720,0:40:09.360
our sample prompt into the docs, and then we 
can, we can add in some additional notes on,

0:40:09.360,0:40:18.080
on what we did there. We can absolutely include 
some inspirational aspects to the documentation,

0:40:18.080,0:40:24.960
but it really depends on the model, like McKenzie 
mentioned, and then also the documentation

0:40:24.960,0:40:32.400
of whichever provider you decide to use and 
their own best practices and stuff like that.

0:40:32.400,0:40:43.360
But we'll definitely include the inspirational 
portion on our end so you can see how we did it.

0:40:47.600,0:41:00.400
Q: If I'd like to implement a custom 
transformation, is the full schema

0:41:00.400,0:41:13.040
stable enough for, for example, having a 
public spec, or is it just an internal JSON?

0:41:13.040,0:41:20.400
A: That's something that we'll probably want to 
touch base with our team on. I would recommend

0:41:20.400,0:41:30.560
that Hari reach out to us at the email that 
McKenzie provided, pluginsupport@beefree.io,

0:41:31.760,0:41:38.000
so that way we can follow up. We probably 
want to touch base with our internal team

0:41:38.000,0:41:42.560
on this one to make sure we give you the best 
answer for your use case. We'll take a note,

0:41:42.560,0:41:45.760
we'll bring it to our team, and then 
we can reach out to you about this.

0:41:45.760,0:41:53.840
The full schema, the native Beefree JSON, that 
full schema is not available to be completely

0:41:53.840,0:41:55.437
opened up for public use. It's why we have 
the new endpoints to get that in return.

0:41:55.437,0:42:00.640
Q: Regarding the HTML to Beefree 
JSON workflow mentioned earlier,

0:42:00.640,0:42:04.800
could you speak to any expected data loss 
between the two formats? In other words,

0:42:04.800,0:42:09.600
is it possible to fully represent 
an HTML document in Beefree JSON?

0:42:09.600,0:42:14.160
A: This is something that we can, we'll 
follow up with you afterwards on this,

0:42:14.160,0:42:19.920
but yes, we have great success with 
converting the HTML to the Beefree JSON,

0:42:19.920,0:42:23.600
and then you can use it in the 
editor to edit a little bit as

0:42:23.600,0:42:30.320
needed. It's kind of case by case, 
so we can follow up with you on that.

0:42:55.840,0:43:53.520
Q: I had a question regarding image handling. 
How will images generated using AI be managed?

0:43:57.520,0:44:09.680
A: It depends on your storage, your file manager 
and storage system. End-users can also provide

0:44:09.680,0:44:16.480
the URLs to their images in their prompts if 
they're talking about adding specific images

0:44:16.480,0:44:24.080
to their design, or if they're looking for 
just like an inspirational image placeholder,

0:44:24.080,0:44:31.680
then that placeholder will appear in the final 
output, and then they can add their image URL

0:44:31.680,0:44:38.640
later on, or they can upload images once they're 
in the builder using the file manager. I mean,

0:44:38.640,0:44:44.000
there's really a lot of flexibility, but in terms 
of the initial prompt, they can either directly

0:44:44.000,0:44:48.960
mention like, "Hey, I already have some images 
that I work with, and I know that I want to use

0:44:48.960,0:44:57.680
them in this design," or they can just ask for 
an image placeholder, and even if they don't ask,

0:44:57.680,0:45:04.880
that image placeholder will appear because 
it'll pick up that an image should go there.

0:45:04.880,0:45:10.240
There are a few other ways outside of those two 
scenarios that you can also experiment with that,

0:45:10.240,0:45:14.560
but those are the two that I used for this 
demo. But there are other ways to get more

0:45:14.560,0:45:21.840
creative and customized with that based on how 
you train your AI model and how you prompt it.
