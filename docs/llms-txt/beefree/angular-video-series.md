The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,200
To get started, navigate to developers.beefree.io. 
This will be your essential hub for everything

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
related to the Beefree SDK. In the top-right 
corner of the window, click Create a Developer

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,840
Account, then fill out the form to create 
your first developer account with Beefree.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,800
You’ll notice there’s also a link 
to the Beefree app as a standalone

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
tool. However, this video series focuses on 
the Beefree SDK as an embeddable solution.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,760
Once you’ve created your account and logged 
in, you’ll be taken to a screen that looks

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,760
something like this. At the top-right, you’ll 
find links to support and documentation.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,880
In the main section, you’ll see the 
type of subscription you’ve chosen,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
along with four activation options: Email Builder, 
Page Builder, Popup Builder, and File Manager.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,160
This is where you’ll activate the SDK instance 
that will later run within your application.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Let’s do that now by clicking Activate 
for the Email Builder application.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,880
On the next screen, you’ll be prompted 
to name your application. I’ll call

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,240
mine Test Email 1. You can choose any 
name you like. Once you click Create,

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
you’ll see your running SDK instance. 
Here, you’ll find the application name,

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,040
client ID, subscription type, and a Details 
button. Let’s go ahead and click on Details.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Inside the details screen, you’ll see important 
information such as the environment type,

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,480
creation and update dates, and configuration 
options. From here, you can change themes,

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,320
manage roles, and manage add-ons. 
One of the key features of the SDK

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,400
is that it provides two critical pieces of 
information: your Client ID and Client Secret.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,120
Don’t worry—we’ll delete these 
credentials after this video. You’ll

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,480
also see references to some of our APIs, 
like the HTML Importer, Content Services,

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,000
and the Template Catalog API. All of these 
can be accessed from this single screen.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,600
This area is known as the Beefree 
Developer Console. As mentioned,

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,520
this is where you’ll find your Client ID and 
Client Secret, which are used for authorization.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Since they’re sensitive credentials, you 
should never share them. If necessary,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
you can regenerate them using the 
Regenerate button on this screen.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Finally, in this video series, we’ll demonstrate

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,240
a client-side authorization process for 
simplicity. But when moving to production,

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,280
you’ll want to implement server-side 
authorization for added security.

The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,680
Hi developers. In this video, we're 
going to talk you through using the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,720
Beefree SDK in an Angular application. If 
your framework of choice is React or Vue.js,

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,120
we have separate videos for those as well. In 
this video, we'll first have you clone a sample

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
Angular repo that we have available for you in 
GitHub. Then we'll talk through authentication

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,560
both with environment variables and securing 
a token through a proxy server. After that,

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,760
we'll look at the Angular component that we 
built to house your local instance of the

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
Beefree SDK in your Angular app. And finally, 
we'll talk you through how to run it locally.

{% tab title="About" %}
This quickstart video series provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to set up and run a fully functional Angular app integrated with the Beefree SDK. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a live development environment showcasing the Beefree email editor embedded in Angular—following best practices for this framework.

PART 3: in this video, you'll learn how to:

* How to create a new Angular app
* Connect your application to your Beefree account by creating an .env file
* Understand the core logic of the Beefree SDK initialize it and create a new instance
* Run your Angular app locally with the builder fully integrated
  {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Transcript" %}
The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,440
To get the most out of this video, make 
sure you’ve set up your Beefree account

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,360
and the Beefree SDK console, and that you 
have access to your Client ID and Client

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
Secret. As long as you have that and a current 
version of Node.js, you’re ready to get started.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,680
First, navigate to the GitHub repo called Beefree 
Angular demo, within the Beefree SDK account.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,400
Once that’s downloaded, cd 
into the project folder,

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:48,400
which should be beefree-angular-demo. 
Then run npm install beefree.io-sdk.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,320
That went smoothly. Next, install the 
supporting packages for our proxy server, which

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,720
will handle authentication. All of these 
commands are available in the README.

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,320
Excellent—now we’re ready to connect this 
Beefree SDK instance with your credentials.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:18,800
If we list the files, you’ll see a 
.env.example file. Open it. Where it

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,880
says YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET, 
replace those with your actual Client ID and

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,240
Secret from the developer console. 
For example, select a test instance,

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:49,280
click "Details" or "Reveal" to see both the 
ID and secret, and copy-paste them here.

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,440
Two more things to do with this environment file:

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:20,320
Rename it from .env.example to .env 
so it works correctly in our package.

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,520
Add it to your .gitignore file. We don’t want 
these sensitive variables pushed into version

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:38,000
control. Check under Environment files—if 
.env is already listed, you’re good to go.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,480
Next, a quick note about authentication. To 
run the Beefree SDK, you need a secure way

19
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:50,470
to fetch authentication tokens. We provide an 
example in proxyServer.js in the root directory.

20
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:58,880
Open that file. You’ll see we’re making a 
POST request using Axios to log into Beefree,

21
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,160
populating the necessary fields with your 
Client ID and Secret, and returning the

22
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,120
full JSON body. This authenticates and 
initializes the Beefree SDK. You can use

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
this implementation or replace it with one 
suitable for your development environment.

24
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
With the project and proxy set up, let’s look 
at the Angular components that render the

25
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Beefree SDK editor. We created a standalone 
Angular component called BeefreeEditor.

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,920
In the TypeScript file, the main logic lives 
inside the ngOnInit lifecycle hook. First,

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,240
we securely fetch the token from the 
local proxy server. Once we have the

28
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,120
token, we create a new Beefree SDK 
instance and call its start method.

29
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,120
This method takes a configuration object 
where we define key properties, such as:

30
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,080
container: the ID of the HTML 
element where the editor will load

31
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,760
Callback functions like onSave and onError, 
letting our Angular app react to editor events

32
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Now that the editor component is ready, we just

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,360
need to use it. Open the main app component 
(AppComponent.ts). Import the BeefreeEditor

34
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
component and add its selector 
<beefree-editor> inside the template.

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,120
At this point, we’re ready. Within 
our sample Angular application,

36
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,920
we’ve installed a local instance of the 
Beefree SDK, handled authentication,

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,400
and created a component to house the editor.

38
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,640
To run the application, open two 
terminal windows. In the first,

39
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,520
run node proxyServer.js to handle 
token authorization. In the second,

40
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,200
run ng serve to start the Angular application. 
Once built, it will be served at localhost:4200.

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Open your browser and navigate there. 
You’ll see your Angular application,

42
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,680
including the H1 heading and the 
documentation button. The Beefree

43
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,760
SDK editor is embedded and ready to start 
adding content blocks of your choice.
```
