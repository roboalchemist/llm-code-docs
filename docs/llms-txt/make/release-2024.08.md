## Public-facing changes <a href="#public-facing-changes" id="public-facing-changes"></a>

### Improvements and changes <a href="#improvements-and-changes" id="improvements-and-changes"></a>

* We made an improvement to the scenario property creation process. Now, you can add new scenario properties directly from the table view without needing to go back to the **Organization → Scenario** properties tab. Newly created properties are immediately visible in the table. Note that the Table view is only available for the **Enterprise** accounts.
* Previously, if a folder had a long name, it was not possible to see the full name in the left sidebar. Now, hovering over a folder with a long name displays a tooltip showing the full name.
* The scenario editor has been updated for better usability. Previously, to add a new module, you had to hover over the last module to see the **+Add another module button**. Now, the button is always visible and shows a hint upon hover.
* We have released a new major version of our **Visual Studio Code** extension. The new version brings in the local development for apps, which enables you to use `git` versioning for custom app development.
* Local development for apps is currently in beta. Feel free to share your feedback!

### Fixed issues <a href="#fixed-issues" id="fixed-issues"></a>

* We've updated how we track scenario operations. Now, the list includes operations used to resolve incomplete executions. Plus, the Make API endpoint for listing [scenario operations usage](https://developers.make.com/white-label-documentation/) also covers these operations.
* An issue was resolved where scenarios rarely ended with an error when processing items from the webhook queue with sequential processing enabled. The processing of webhook queue items with sequential processing enabled now works as expected.
