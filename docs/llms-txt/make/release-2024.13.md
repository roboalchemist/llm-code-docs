## Public-facing changes

### Improvements and changes

* Users can now update their existing connections when their credentials change, instead of creating and reconfiguring new connections.

* The [scenario inputs](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/scenario-inputs) are now available to all Make users. Previously, scenario inputs were available only to users in organizations with the Pro plan or higher.
* The scenario entity in the Make API now has the `isActive` parameter. This parameter shows whether a scenario [is active](https://developers.make.com/api-documentation/api-reference/scenarios). The `islinked` parameter is now deprecated. Make API still returns the `islinked` parameter for backward compatibility.
* Custom app developers now have the ability to utilize data structures directly within custom apps. Users can create a data structure and integrate it into their app, similar to how data structures function in data stores.
* Previously, when a Team Admin only had an organization member role, they were unable to add new users to the team. Now, a Team Admin with a member role can see all the organization users and add users to the team.
* Custom app developers can now add a banner to the module settings. You can use banners in module settings to highlight new features or announce changes.

### Fixed issues

* When parsing a date with the `parseDate` function in the timestamp format in milliseconds, users had to convert the timestamp to a number first. This is no longer required. The `parseDate` function converts timestamps in seconds or in milliseconds directly.
* Previously, attempting to add a custom property would result in an error stating that the property data already exists if there was an empty value for that property. Now, the function recognizes an empty object as a condition and allows the user to add the new property without receiving an error.
