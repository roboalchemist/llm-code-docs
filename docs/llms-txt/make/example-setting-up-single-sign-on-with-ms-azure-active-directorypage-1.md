3. Give the registration a name.
4. Fill in the Redirect URL.
   * Find the Redirect URL In **Make > Organization > Settings** after you select an SSO type.
5. Click **Register**.
6. Note down the Application (client) ID.
   * Paste this ID into your Make settings.
7. Go to **Certificates** and secrets and click **New client secret**.
   * Paste the secret value into your Make settings.
8. Go to **Overview** and click **Endpoints**.
   * Paste the OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint (v2) into the Authorize URL field in Make settings.
   * Paste the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2) into the Token URL field in Make settings.
9. Paste the following into the **User information URL** in Make settings.
   * <https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me>

    * Login scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`
    * Scopes separator: space
