# Logging in using SSO

Once you configure SSO, your end-users don't use the default sign-in form. Instead, they use the dedicated SSO sign-in options.

1. Go to your login URL.
2. Click **Sign in with SSO.**
3. Log in using your identity provider and consent to Make's access to your user data.

The user is now logged in. If the user was not assigned to your organization before, the system creates a new users account for them and assigns them to the selected default team.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a user's email address already exists in the organization before you configure SSO, they do not have access to the organization's data. To solve this, delete the user from the organization and ask them to log in again using SSO.
{% endhint %}
