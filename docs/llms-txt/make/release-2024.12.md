* The [subscenarios](https://www.make.com/en/help/scenarios/subscenarios) are have left the closed beta and are now available to users in organizations with the **Teams** or **Enterprise** plan.
* The custom IML function for developing custom apps has been re-enabled! It was disabled because of security reasons, and is now available again.
* We are migrating the existing custom apps to the new technology in batches, so it might take time until you can edit a custom IML function in an already existing custom app. You can read more about the re-enablement here.

### Fixed issues
