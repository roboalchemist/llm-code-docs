## Public-facing changes

### Improvements and changes

* We have improved the notes experience, making it easier and more enjoyable to create and manage notes. In addition to a fresh new look, notes now support rich text formatting. For more information, refer to our new [Scenario notes](https://help.make.com/scenario-notes) documentation.

* Managing operations at the team level is now easier with the new **Enterprise** feature, [Operations per Team Management](https://help.make.com/operations-per-team-management). Benefits include improved control over team consumption, operational continuity, real-time monitoring of operations usage, flexibility in operations allocation, and proactive usage notifications.
* You can now connect third-party apps or clients with Make using the **OAuth 2.0** protocol. Check out the latest updates in our [Make API documentation update](https://developers.make.com/api-documentation/authentication/requesting-an-oauth-2.0-client).
* We’ve added more filter options to our [Analytics dashboard](https://help.make.com/analytics-dashboard), available to **Enterprise** users. Additional filters include **Status**, **Team**, and **Folder** for overall stats, with **Executions Change** and **Folder** now available in the scenario breakdown.
* Scenario execution history can now be exported into a CSV file. This is a useful option for users who want to analyze their scenario execution history in an external system. Before exporting, you can choose to hide check runs or the change log, depending on what data you want to include in the file.
* You can now rename keys without specifying their values. Previously, when renaming keys, you had to provide the current values. If you did not, the values would be replaced with blank entries.
