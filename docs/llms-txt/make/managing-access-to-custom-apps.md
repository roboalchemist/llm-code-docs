# Managing access to custom apps

The method for restricting access to a custom app depends on its development stage:

* **Private** - Once a user has created a custom app, they can use it in scenarios. The only way to restrict access is to disable the apps platform from **Administration > System settings** before users create custom apps. It is possible to delete an app but only when it is private. Once published, it is no longer possible to delete an app.
* **Public** - Once published, a custom app is visible and accessible to all users in the creator's organization. You can prevent users outside of the organization from installing the app by setting the [license object parameter](https://developers.make.com/white-label-documentation/install-and-configure-apps/manage-custom-apps/broken-reference) `installPublicApps` to `false`.
* **Approved** - After approving and compiling a custom app, the only way to restrict access and visibility is the same as for native apps. You can turn visibility off and on at a global level or assign an app tier.
