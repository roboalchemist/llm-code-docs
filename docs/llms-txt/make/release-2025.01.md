## Public-facing changes

### Improvements and changes

* Our new [Analytics dashboard](https://help.make.com/analytics-dashboard), available to **Enterprise** users, gives you a clear view of your account’s key metrics. You can easily see what’s happening across all of your scenario, so you can stay on top of things and make informed decisions to optimize performance.
* We've updated our **downgrading and cancelation** process. Now, if you downgrade to a plan that only offers one team, or if you cancel and revert to the Free plan, you will be asked to choose the team you want to keep. You will also see a table, comparing the features of your old and new plan, before you commit to the change. For more information, refer to our [Changing your subscription](https://www.make.com/en/help/general/changing-your-subscription--upgrading,-downgrading,-or-canceling-#changing-your-subscription--upgrading--downgrading--or-canceling-) article.

* Users can now retry multiple incomplete executions at once. You can either select specific incomplete executions or attempt to retry all of them. You can see approximately when an incomplete execution will be rerun in the scenario incomplete executions tab.
* We’ve updated your options in the profile settings. Before, you were unable to change the country you first chose when registering. Now, you can change your country if necessary.
* You can now schedule resolving multiple incomplete executions at once with the Make API. This feature is best for resolving incomplete executions caused by temporary errors like rate limit or connection errors, or for incomplete executions where you fixed the error already.
* We've improved the way that custom app logos are processed for more accurate representation. For more details on how single color, multicolor, and grayscale logos are processed, view the specifications and examples [here](https://developers.make.com/custom-apps-documentation/app-logo#app-logo).
