## Public-facing changes <a href="#public-facing-changes" id="public-facing-changes"></a>

### Improvements and changes <a href="#improvements-and-changes" id="improvements-and-changes"></a>

* Previously, the route order numbers were hidden by default when using a router in your Make scenario. We have now enabled the Show route order option as the default setting, making it easier to view and manage route orders.
* To help avoid accidental deletion of organizations or teams, we've added an additional step. Users now need to type the name of the organization or team to confirm the deletion.
* You can now update your keys in the Keys tab. To do so, navigate to the Keys tab, locate the key you want to update, and click the Edit button. Note that you can only overwrite the existing value with a new one. Both the previous and updated key values will not be visible when editing.
* We've added a Remember this device option for two-factor authentication (2FA). When enabled, this feature allows users to skip 2FA on the same device for 30 days. This option makes accessing your account faster and easier on trusted devices.
* Previously, the cloned Make scenarios were saved in the Uncategorized folder. Now, they stay in the same folder as the original scenario.
* Non-admin users can now decide to leave an organization, with the option to either keep or delete their connections. A confirmation window will appear to help them decide how to manage their connections.
* We’ve added helpful tooltips to the app search. Now, when you hover over the app type badge (Verified, Built-in, Community, etc.), a tooltip will appear, providing a clear explanation of what each badge represents.

### Fixed issues <a href="#fixed-issues" id="fixed-issues"></a>

* When using the Search or Get modules, if the processed data exceeded 3.5 MB and there were many output bundles, only the last set of bundles would be shown in the module's output. This issue has been resolved. Now, regardless of the amount of processed data or the number of output bundles, all bundles are displayed correctly in the module output.
* Sometimes, module outputs failed to load properly. We've fixed this bug and now you can see module outputs without any issues.
