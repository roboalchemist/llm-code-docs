## Public-facing changes <a href="#public-facing-changes" id="public-facing-changes"></a>

### Improved app search <a href="#improved-app-search" id="improved-app-search"></a>

* We're excited to introduce our improved in-product app search designed to help you discover apps and build scenarios faster! What's new:
  * Improved search speed and reliability.
  * Apps related to your search query show up in the app search window with added insight into available modules.
  * Your recently used apps move to the top for a speedy build.
  * The new right-hand bar gives you quick access to common tools and functions.
  * While creating or editing the scenario you see a new section in the list of apps called **Apps in scenario**. It helps you get quicker access to already used apps.

If you want to learn more or leave feedback for this feature go to [this Community post](https://community.make.com/t/feature-spotlight-enhanced-app-search/32674).

### Improvements and changes <a href="#improvements-and-changes" id="improvements-and-changes"></a>

* We’ve added a small but important improvement to the Users tab. Now you can filter users by their role at both organization and team levels. Simply click on the filter icon and select the role that you would like to see in the list.

### Fixed issues <a href="#fixed-issues" id="fixed-issues"></a>

* When rerunning an incomplete execution caused by an error in a route in a router, only the route where the error occurred would be executed while resolving the incomplete executions. Any subsequent routes would be ignored. Now, all subsequent routes are also processed when resolving incomplete executions.
* Previously, custom functions couldn't handle parameters with binary data types, such as email attachments or pictures. This caused failures when trying to process files with custom functions. We fixed it and now you can successfully use custom functions to process raw binary data.
* Recently, when searching for modules in the scenario editor, the **Instant** tag was missing from instant triggers and they were mistakenly labeled as **ACID** (polling) triggers. This issue has been resolved, and it now works as expected.
