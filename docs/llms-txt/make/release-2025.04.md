## New On-premise Services

We're introducing two new services to improve how applications are managed in your On-premise environment: **Zone Assets Server** and **Make Apps Processor**. These services streamline operations and enhance reliability for self-hosted deployments. To deploy these new services, follow the steps outlined in [Set up Helm charts](https://developers.make.com/white-label-documentation/set-up-helm-charts) guide.

### Zone Assets Server

**What it does:** The Zone Assets Server is a dedicated service that delivers essential files and resources (assets) directly within your On-premise infrastructure. Think of it as a local content delivery system that ensures your applications can quickly access everything they need to run smoothly.

**Why this matters:** Previously, each application had to manage its own assets internally, which added complexity. By centralizing asset delivery through a dedicated service, we're simplifying our core applications and making the overall system more maintainable.

**Technical details:** This NestJS-based file server contains all the assets that would normally be stored in cloud-based content delivery networks (CDNs). Since CDNs aren't practical for self-hosted environments, this service provides a local alternative that packages all necessary assets in a separate, containerized service.

#### **Zone Assets Server Deployment**

**Current status:** The Zone Assets Server is already running in your environment but isn't active yet. Your web-zone container still uses its internal asset packages as before.

**What's coming:** In an upcoming release, we'll activate the new system. When this happens:

* The web-zone container will stop bundling its own assets
* Instead, it will retrieve assets from the Zone Assets Server
* This transition will be automatic and require no action from you

**Resource allocation**

The Zone Assets Server has the following memory configuration:

* Requested memory: `128Mi`

  This is the minimum amount of memory the service needs to start and run.
* Memory limit: `512Mi`\
  This is the maximum amount of memory the service is allowed to use.

### Make Apps Processor

**What it does**: The Make Apps Processor automatically handles application updates by compiling your app changes into native formats and deploying them to your IPM server. This streamlines the entire application deployment process.

**Service transition**: This new service will replace the current Apps Processor (apps-processor) in an upcoming release, providing enhanced functionality and improved reliability.

**Resource allocation**

The Make Apps Processor is optimized for low resource usage and stable performance. Here’s the recommended configuration:

* Recommended memory: `1024 MB`

  This gives the service enough memory to compile and deploy your applications efficiently.
* Recommended CPU: `1/3 vCPU`

  The service runs smoothly with low CPU usage. This setting is enough for stable performance.

{% hint style="info" %}
No immediate action is required for either service. Both are being deployed as part of your regular update cycle and will be activated automatically when ready.
{% endhint %}

## Public-facing changes

### Improvements and changes

#### Make﻿ TypeScript SDK now available

We've added a new client library to our API documentation – the [Make TypeScript SDK](https://developers.make.com/api-documentation/client-libraries). This library provides developers with:

* Comprehensive type definitions
* Support for most Make API endpoints
* Built-in error handling
* Response typing

The SDK is fully compatible with pure JavaScript projects, allowing seamless integration regardless of your preferred development approach.

#### Improved collection handling

We've simplified your workflow with automatic collection conversion. When mapping a collection to a text field, Make now automatically converts it to a JSON string for you. This eliminates the manual conversion step previously required, saving you time and reducing potential errors in your scenarios.

### Apps updates

#### New apps

* [SAP SuccessFactors](https://apps.make.com/sap-successfactors) - A cloud-based human capital management software that helps companies manage employee information. You can now retrieve and search for the records in your SAP SuccessFactors account.
* [XLSX](https://apps.make.com/xls) - The XLSX app is our built-in app available on all plans. It allows you to aggregate data in an XLSX file without the need to connect to the Microsoft 365 Excel app.
* [Amazon Bedrock](https://apps.make.com/amazon-bedrock) - We've released the new Amazon app. You can now build AI-powered automations that create text, images, or chat responses using your Bedrock setup.
* [Clay](https://apps.make.com/clay) - The new Clay app lets you create new webhook records in your Clay tables.

#### Updated apps

* [OpenAI](https://apps.make.com/openai-modules#67hWK) - The OpenAI app now includes four new modules that help you manage model responses more effectively:
  * List Input Items
  * Get a Model Response
  * Create a Model Response
  * Delete a Model Response
* [xAI](https://apps.make.com/xai) - A new module called Generate an image is now available. It lets you create images based on a prompt.
* [Monday.com](https://apps.make.com/monday) - We have two new modules that will let you monitor the events and search items in the board by column values:
  * Watch Events
  * Watch Events\
    Search Item sin the Board by Column Values (advanced)
* [Facebook Pages](https://apps.make.com/facebook-pages) - A new module is now available that lets you publish Reels directly to your Facebook Page:
  * Publish a Reel
* [Crowdin](https://apps.make.com/crowdin) - The app now supports both OAuth and API key authentication, giving you two different ways to create a connection.
