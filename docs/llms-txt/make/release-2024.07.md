## Public-facing changes <a href="#public-facing-changes" id="public-facing-changes"></a>

### Improvements and changes <a href="#improvements-and-changes" id="improvements-and-changes"></a>

* We added a new read-only **Audience URI** field to the SSO settings, where you can find the path to the `metadata.xml`. This can be useful for setting up SSO on the provider’s side. Also, we included a link to the documentation in the SSO settings so that users can access the information more easily.
* We created new Make API endpoints to help you monitor the usage of operations in your scenarios.
  * **Get scenario usage**: Returns the daily operation usage for a specific scenario over the past 30 days.
  * **Get team usage**: Returns the daily operation usage for all scenarios within a team over the past 30 days.
  * **Get organization usage**: Returns the daily operation usage for all scenarios across all teams within the organization over the past 30 days.

Learn more about them in the [Make API documentation](https://www.make.com/en/api-documentation).

* We updated the timezones for operations and data transfer in your organization and team dashboards. Instead of showing usage in GMT+0, the dashboards will now display data based on each user’s account timezone.
* The organization and team dashboards now include data from incomplete executions, covering both operations and data transfer usage.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your Make scenarios frequently have incomplete executions, you may notice an increase in usage metrics on the dashboards.
{% endhint %}

* Previously, it was not possible to open a scenario in a new tab from the Table view of the **Scenarios** tab. Now, you can right-click on a scenario from the list and select the option to open it in a new tab. Note that the Table view is only available for the **Enterprise** accounts.

### Fixed issues <a href="#fixed-issues" id="fixed-issues"></a>

* We resolved an issue where, in rare cases, scenarios were running indefinitely and blocking the processing of webhook queue items. With this fix, scenarios will no longer get stuck, allowing the webhook queue items to be processed smoothly.
