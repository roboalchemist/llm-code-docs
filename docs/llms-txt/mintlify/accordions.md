# Accordions

> Use accordions to show and hide content.

Accordions allow users to expand and collapse content sections. Use accordions for progressive disclosure and to organize information.

## Single accordion

<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here, including other components, like code:

  ```java HelloWorld.java theme={null}
   class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
  ```
</Accordion>

````mdx Accordion example theme={null}
<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here, including other components, like code:

   ```java HelloWorld.java
    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
  ```
</Accordion>
````

## Accordion Groups

Group related accordions together using `<AccordionGroup>`. This creates a cohesive section of accordions that can be individually expanded or collapsed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting started">
    You can put other components inside Accordions.

    ```java HelloWorld.java theme={null}
    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced features" icon="bot">
    Add icons to make accordions more visually distinct and scannable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
    Keep related content organized into groups.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
