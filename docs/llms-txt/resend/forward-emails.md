# Forward Received Emails

> Forward Received emails to another email address.

Received emails can also be forwarded to another email address.

<Info>
  Webhooks do not include the actual HTML or Plain Text body of the email. You
  must call the [received emails
  API](/api-reference/emails/retrieve-received-email) to retrieve them. This
  design choice supports large payloads in serverless environments that have
  limited request body sizes.

## Using the `forward` helper method

The Node.js SDK provides a `forward()` helper method that simplifies forwarding received emails. This method automatically handles fetching the email content and attachments.

Here's an example of forwarding an email in a Next.js application:

```js app/api/events/route.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => {
  const event = await request.json();

  if (event.type === 'email.received') {
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.receiving.forward({
      emailId: event.data.email_id,
      to: 'delivered@resend.dev',
      from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
    });

    if (error) {
      return new NextResponse(`Error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
    }

    return NextResponse.json(data);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({});
};
```

By default, the `forward` method forwards the email in a way that preserves the original email content and attachments exactly as received.

Alternatively, you can forward emails as if they had been forwarded through an email client, with the `forwarded message` footer. For that, use `passthrough: false` and provide custom text or HTML content. The original email will be shown after the `forwarded message` footer:

```js app/api/events/route.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.receiving.forward({
  emailId: event.data.email_id,
  to: 'delivered@resend.dev',
  from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
  passthrough: false,
  text: 'See attached forwarded message.',
  html: '<p>See attached forwarded message.</p>',
});
```

## Manual forwarding

If you're not using Node.js or prefer not to use the `forward` helper method, you can manually forward received emails using the [Send Email API](/api-reference/emails/send-email).

The recommended approach is to download the raw email and parse it to properly extract content and attachments (especially for inline images). Then, you can send a new email with the extracted content and attachments using the [Send Email API](/api-reference/emails/send-email).

```js app/api/events/route.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"vesper"}}
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { simpleParser } from 'mailparser';

const resend = new Resend('re_xxxxxxxxx');

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest) => {
  const event = await request.json();

  if (event.type === 'email.received') {
    // Get the email metadata
    const { data: email } = await resend
      .emails
      .receiving
      .get(event.data.email_id);

    // Download the raw email content if available
    if (!email?.raw?.download_url) {
      return new NextResponse('Raw email not available', { status: 500 });
    }

    const rawResponse = await fetch(email.raw.download_url);
    const rawEmailContent = await rawResponse.text();

    // Parse the raw email to extract content and attachments
    const parsed = await simpleParser(rawEmailContent, {
      skipImageLinks: true,
    });

    // Extract attachments with content_id for inline images
    const attachments = parsed.attachments.map((attachment) => {
      // Strip < and > from content IDs for proper inline image handling
      const contentId = attachment.contentId
        ? attachment.contentId.replace(/^<|>$/g, '')
        : undefined;

      return {
        filename: attachment.filename,
        content: attachment.content.toString('base64'),
        content_type: attachment.contentType,
        content_id: contentId || undefined,
      };
    });

    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: 'Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>',
      to: ['delivered@resend.dev'],
      subject: email.subject || '(no subject)',
      html: parsed.html || undefined,
      text: parsed.text || undefined,
      attachments: attachments.length > 0 ? attachments : undefined,
    });

    if (error) {
      return new NextResponse(`Error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
    }

    return NextResponse.json(data);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({});
};
```

<Note>
  This example uses the [`mailparser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailparser)
  library (`npm install mailparser`) to parse the raw email. For other
  languages/SDKs, you'll need an equivalent email parsing library capable of
  processing emails compliant to [RFC
  5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322).
