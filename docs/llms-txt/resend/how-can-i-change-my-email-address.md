# How can I change my Resend email address?

> How to change the email address associated with your Resend account.

To change the email address associated with your Resend account:

1. Navigate to your [**Profile**](https://resend.com/profile) page.
2. Under **Your email**, enter your new email address in the **Email address** field.
3. Click the **Update email** button.

After clicking **Update email**, you will be signed out and two confirmation emails will be sent:

* **To your new email address**: An email with the subject "Confirm email change for Resend" asking you to confirm the update.
* **To your current email address**: An email with the subject "Request to change your email" asking you to confirm the request.

Click the confirmation link in **both** emails to complete the email change. Once both confirmations are complete, you can log in with your new email address.
