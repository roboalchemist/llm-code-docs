## Gmail

Follow these steps to add an avatar to your Gmail inbox:

1. Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/personal-info)
2. Upload a profile picture

Avatars in Gmail only display in the mobile app (including in push notifications) and inside opened emails on desktop.

## Outlook

Follow these steps to add an avatar to your Outlook inbox:

1. Go to your [Outlook Profile Settings](https://account.microsoft.com/profile/)
2. Upload a profile picture

Avatars in Outlook only display in the mobile app and inside opened emails on desktop.

## Yahoo

Follow these steps to add an avatar to your Yahoo inbox:

1. Go to your [Yahoo Account Setting](https://login.yahoo.com/account/personalinfo)
2. Upload a profile picture

Avatars in Yahoo only display in the mobile app and inside an opened email on desktop.

## Apple Mail

Apple Mail only shows avatars if recipients have added images to contacts. Alternatively, you can set up [Apple Branded Mail](/knowledge-base/how-do-i-set-set-up-apple-branded-mail), a proprietary Apple format that displays your logo as an avatar in the inbox of Apple Mail, or [set up BIMI](/dashboard/domains/bimi#what-is-bimi) with a Verified Mark Certificate (Apple Mail does not support CMC).

## Using Gravatar

Some inbox service providers or email clients (e.g. Thunderbird, Airmail, and Postbox) rely on [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) to display an image.

You can set up a free Gravatar account, add your avatar, and verify your addresses you're sending from to that account to have your avatar displayed.

## Limitations

Almost every email provider has its own way of adding a profile picture to an inbox.

This means **you can only**:

1. Add your avatar to a real inbox, limiting it only to that provider
2. Send mail from the same address that you set the avatar on

The way around this is [BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)](/dashboard/domains/bimi). It is much more difficult to obtain, but supports by nearly all providers and allows you to send from any address on that domain.
