# How do I create an email address or sender in Resend?

> Learn how sending from an email address works on Resend.

Resend does **not** require you to “create an email address”, “set up a sender identity”, or “add a from-address” before sending.

Once a domain is verified in your Resend account, you can send from **any** email address at that domain.

<Info>
  The email address you send from does **not** need to exist in another system.
  However, we recommend using addresses that can receive replies.

## Common misconceptions

Some platforms require you to create, register, or pre-approve a sending address.\
Resend does **not**. After verifying your domain, you’re free to send from any address **@yourdomain**, with no extra setup, creation, or configuration of that address.

## Getting started

To start sending emails with Resend:

1. [Sign up for a Resend account](https://resend.com/signup)
2. [Add and verify your domain](https://resend.com/domains)
3. [Create an API key](https://resend.com/api-keys)
4. Start sending emails immediately from any address at the domain you verified

If you're having trouble with domain verification or DNS records, see our [domain verification troubleshooting guide](/knowledge-base/what-if-my-domain-is-not-verifying) or check our [DNS setup guides](/knowledge-base/introduction) for your specific DNS provider.
