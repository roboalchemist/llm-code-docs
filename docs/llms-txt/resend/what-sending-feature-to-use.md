# What sending feature should I be using?

> How to pick between our different sending features depending on your number of recipients and the nature of the message.

Resend allows you to send both **Transactional** and **Marketing** emails.

## What's the difference between Transactional and Marketing emails?

### What is a Transactional email?

A **Transactional email** is a message triggered by a user action or required for legal compliance. These emails are essential communications that users **cannot unsubscribe** from. Common examples include:

* Order confirmations
* Password reset emails
* Account notifications

Typically, transactional emails are **1-to-1** messages sent in response to a specific event.

### What is a Marketing email?

A **Marketing email** is any email that is not transactional. These can be **promotional**, **informative**, or **general communication** messages.

Marketing emails are regulated by laws like **CAN-SPAM** (US) and **CASL** (Canada), and **recipients must have the option to unsubscribe**.

Examples of marketing emails:

* Promotional offers and discounts
* Newsletters
* Product updates

Marketing emails can be **1-to-1** (e.g., abandoned cart reminders) or **1-to-many** (e.g., newsletters).

## Should I be sending a Transactional or a Marketing email?

While not exhaustive, here's a table listing different examples of emails and the most appropriate type for each example.
