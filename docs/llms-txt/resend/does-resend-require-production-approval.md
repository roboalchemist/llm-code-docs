# Does Resend require production approval?

> Learn about production access and account limitations on Resend.

No, Resend does **not** require production approval. All accounts, including free accounts, have immediate production access from the moment you sign up.

## Free accounts have production access

Free accounts on Resend have full production access immediately. There is no sandbox mode, no approval process, and no waiting period. You can start sending transactional emails to your customers right away.

  production emails. All accounts have the same production capabilities from day
  one.

## Common misconceptions

Some users may think they need production approval if:

* **DNS records aren't generated yet**: If you've added a domain but haven't completed DNS verification, the domain will show as "Pending" until you add the required DNS records. This is not related to account approval—it's simply waiting for domain verification. Once you add and verify your DNS records, you can send from that domain.

* **Coming from other email services**: Some email service providers do require production approval or have sandbox modes. Resend does not have these restrictions.

## Getting started
