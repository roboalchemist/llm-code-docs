# Domain and/or IP Warm-up Guide

> Learn how to warm up a domain or IP to avoid deliverability issues.

Warming up a domain or IP refers to the practice of progressively increasing your sending volume to maximize your deliverability. The goal is to send at a consistent rate and avoid any spikes in email volume that might be concerning to inbox service providers.

Whenever you change your sending patterns—whether because you're using a new domain, a new IP, or a new vendor, or because your volume will increase—you should warm-up your domain and/or IP.

A thought-out warm-up plan limits greylisting and delivery throttling, as well as helping establish a good domain and IP reputation.

As your volume increases, you'll need to monitor your bounce rate to ensure it remains below 4%, and your spam rate below 0.08%. An increase in these rates would be a sign that your warm-up plan needs to be slowed down and an investigation into the root causes of the increases started.

Following these rules and metrics will establish a good domain reputation.

# What about third-party warm-up services?

We know email deliverability is important, and it can be tempting to use services promising quick fixes. However, using tools that artificially boost engagement can harm your long-term sender reputation. These services often rely on manipulating anti-spam filters, which can backfire as email providers like Gmail adjust their systems.

Instead, we recommend focusing on sustainable practices—such as sending relevant content, maintaining a clean list, and using proper authentication. These methods build trust with email providers and improve your deliverability over time.
