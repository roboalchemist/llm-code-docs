# Should I add an unsubscribe link to all of my emails sent with Resend?

> Learn best practices about using unsubscribe links.

Transactional emails are generally exempt from including an unsubscribe link. Unlike marketing emails, transactional emails serve a functional purpose, such as account confirmation, password resets, and order confirmations.

As a best practice, we recommend telling recipients how to opt out of receiving future email from you if the content is more related to nurturing relationships with your customers, rather than pragmatic, action-oriented emails.

Laws enforced by the FTC and GDPR prioritize giving recipients an easy way to give and withdraw their consent to recieving email marketing content. Additionally, not having an option for opting out of emails risks recipients complaining or marking the email as spam, which can hurt your reputation as a sender.

If you're using [Resend Broadcasts](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/audiences/managing-unsubscribe-list), the unsubscribe headers are added automatically to your emails. You can include the Unsubscribe Footer in your Broadcasts, which will be automatically replaced with the correct link for each contact or use `{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}` as a link target should you want to customize the unsubscribe footer.
