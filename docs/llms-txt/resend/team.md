# Managing Teams

> Manage your account across multiple teams

Resend allows multiple teams to be managed under a single email address. Each team is distinct, with its own API keys, billing, and usage.

## Inviting new members to a team

1. Navigate to your [**Team Settings**](https://resend.com/settings/team).
2. Click **Invite**. Input an email address and select a role (**Admin** or **Member**).
   * **Members** have access to manage emails, domains and webhooks.
   * **Admins** have all Member permissions plus the ability to invite users, update payments, and delete the team.
3. The new member will receive an email invitation to join the team.

## Add a team avatar

1. Navigate to your [**Team Settings**](https://resend.com/settings/team).
2. Click **Upload Image** next to the avatar placeholders.
3. Upload an image file to use as the team avatar.
