# NVIDIA NIM for Developers

[NVIDIA NIM™](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/) provides containers to self-host GPU-accelerated inferencing microservices for pretrained and customized AI models across clouds, data centers, and RTX™ AI PCs and workstations. NIM microservices expose industry-standard APIs for simple integration into AI applications, development frameworks, and workflows and optimize response latency and throughput for each combination of foundation model and GPU.

## Ethical AI

NVIDIA’s platforms and application frameworks enable developers to build a wide array of AI applications. Consider potential algorithmic bias when choosing or creating the models being deployed. Work with the model’s developer to ensure that it meets the requirements for the relevant industry and use case; that the necessary instruction and documentation are provided to understand error rates, confidence intervals, and results; and that the model is being used under the conditions and in the manner intended.
