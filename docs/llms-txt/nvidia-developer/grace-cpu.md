# NVIDIA Grace CPU

## Meet NVIDIA Grace, a breakthrough in data center performance and efficiency.

NVIDIA Grace, our first data center CPU, is designed to deliver flagship server performance in a power-efficient design for enterprise and hyperscale computing applications, scientific computing, and data analytics. The NVIDIA Grace CPU is a standards-based design that builds on and is compatible with the same Arm™ ecosystem found in mobile, edge, data center, and on-premises systems.

## Developer Tools

As part of our commitment to the broader Arm™ ecosystem, existing AArch64 binaries, tools, compilers, and operating systems are compatible with NVIDIA Grace—delivering incredible performance thanks to its streamlined architecture and intelligent on-chip fabric.   
Applications not yet distributed for Arm can gain a dramatic boost in performance and efficiency with a simple recompile. NVIDIA distributes upstream Arm optimizations to open-source tools, like Clang, for developers who don&#39;t want to wait for regular releases, but do want to build code that performs optimally, not only on NVIDIA Grace but any Arm server CPU.
