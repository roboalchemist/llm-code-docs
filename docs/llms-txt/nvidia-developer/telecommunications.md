#### Network Slicing

Set up and run an open-source 5G network simulator lab, coupled with an agentic AI workflow for dynamic bandwidth allocation. The lab uses Open Air Interface for the 5G core and RAN, FlexRIC for slice management, and iPerf for traffic generation, with performance data logged in a Kinetica database. The agentic AI workflow, powered by a LangGraph agent, analyzes traffic data and optimizes bandwidth allocation.
