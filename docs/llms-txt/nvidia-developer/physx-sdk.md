# NVIDIA PhysX  

Modeling digital twins of factories, cities, or entire worlds involves complex simulations that must accurately replicate the physical behavior of objects and systems, which are foundational in building [physical AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/) for powering the next generation of autonomous systems.  
  
NVIDIA PhysX® is a powerful, open-source multi-physics SDK that provides scalable simulation and modeling capabilities for robotics and autonomous vehicle applications.

## Key Benefits of PhysX

### Open-Source

PhysX is fully open-source, enabling free use and sharing of your work with other developers, as well as contributing your innovative developments back to the community.

### Unified   

Model FEM soft body, cloth, particles, and fluid simulation with two-way coupled interactions under a unified solver framework.

### Scalable

Runs on various platforms, from mobile CPUs to high-end GPUs, with a GPU API supporting end-to-end  
reinforcement learning via NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab.

### Accurate

Enhanced simulation stability with robust collision detection, stacking, and joints, while also supporting momentum conservation and gyroscopic forces.

## PhysX Features  

 

### Rigid Body Dynamics  

Analyze multi-body dynamics under external forces like gravity. PhysX offers scalable rigid-body simulation for CPU and GPU, with proven industry performance.

### Scene Query  

Conduct spatial queries in simulated environments using the PhysX raycast, overlap, and sweep functions with customizable filtering.

 

### Joints  

Utilize a suite of common built-in joint types and support custom joints in PhysX through a flexible callback mechanism.

 

### Reduced Coordinate Articulations  

Reduced coordinate articulations provide a linear-time, guaranteed joint-error-free simulation of a tree of rigid bodies.

 

### Vehicle Dynamics  

Study the movement of multi-body interactions under external forces, such as gravity. PhysX provides industry-proven scalable rigid body simulation on both CPU and GPU.

 

### Character Controllers  

The kinematic character controller in PhysX permits an avatar to navigate a simulated world and supports both static and dynamically simulated bodies.

 

### Soft Body Dynamics  

Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of soft bodies allows for accurate and efficient models of elastic deformable bodies.

 

### SDF Colliders  

A new Signed Distance Field based collision representation allows PhysX to simulate non-convex shapes like gears and cams without convex decomposition.

 

### Position-Based Dynamics  

Position-Based Dynamics provide a flexible framework for simulating a wide range of phenomena including liquids, granular materials, cloth, rigid bodies, deformable bodies, and more.

 

### Custom Geometry  

Utilize a wide range of built-in geometries and a flexible callback mechanism to allow custom geometry types into the simulation.

 

### Fracture &amp; Destruction  

Blast, available in PhysX, is a destruction and fracture library designed for performance, scalability, and flexibility.

 

### Smoke &amp; Fire  

Flow enables realistic combustible fluid, smoke, and fire simulations. Flow is part of the PhysX SDK.

#### Newton, the Next-Generation Open-Source Physics Simulation Engine

Newton is an open-source, GPU-accelerated, and extensible physics engine, co-developed by Google DeepMind and Disney Research, and [managed by the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-contribution-of-newton-by-disney-research-google-deepmind-and-nvidia-to-accelerate-open-robot-learning). Built on NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD, Newton is optimized for robotics and compatible with learning frameworks such as MuJoCo Playground or NVIDIA Isaac Lab. [Newton Beta](https://github.com/newton-physics) is now available to use.
