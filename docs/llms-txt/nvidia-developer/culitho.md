## Accelerate computational lithography

NVIDIA cuLitho is a library with optimized tools and algorithms for GPU-accelerating computational lithography and the manufacturing process of semiconductors by orders of magnitude over current CPU-based methods.

  

Manufacturing computer chips requires a critical step called computational lithography – a complex computation – involving electromagnetic physics, photochemistry, computational geometry, iterative optimization, and distributed computing.

  

This computational lithography step is already one of the largest compute workloads in semiconductor production, necessitating massive data centers, and the silicon miniaturization evolution process exponentially amplifies the computation requirements over time.

## The Challenge

As silicon feature sizes become smaller, and the impacts of optical diffraction have to be offset, there arises a need to proactively manipulate mask patterns with optical proximity correction (OPC) or inverse lithography technology (ILT) to accurately image wafers. This requires advanced computational lithography techniques and increased compute efficiency. Every industry needs to accelerate every workload, so that we can reclaim power and do more with less.

### Productivity

Photomasks that took two weeks can be processed overnight.

  

3X to 5X more masks can be generated per day.

### Cost Savings

500 NVIDIA Hopper™ GPU systems running cuLitho can do the work of 40,000 CPU systems. That&#39;s 1/9 the power and 1/8 the space.
