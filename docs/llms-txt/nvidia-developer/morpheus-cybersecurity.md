# NVIDIA Morpheus

[NVIDIA Morpheus](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/morpheus/ &quot;NVIDIA Morpheus&quot;) is a GPU-accelerated, end-to-end AI framework that enables developers to create optimized applications for filtering, processing, and classifying large volumes of streaming cybersecurity data. Morpheus incorporates AI to reduce the time and cost associated with identifying, capturing, and acting on threats, bringing a new level of security to the data center, cloud, and edge. Morpheus also extends human analysts’ capabilities with generative AI by automating real-time analysis and responses, producing synthetic data to train AI models that identify risks accurately, and run what-if scenarios

## Content Kits

Access technical content on cybersecurity topics such as spear phishing detection and digital fingerprinting.

### Spear Phishing Detection  

Spear phishing is one of the largest and most costly cyber threats to organizations. Customized for individuals and usually very convincing, spear phishing emails are difficult to defend against due to a lack of training data. This kit will take you through spear phishing detection built around Morpheus and demonstrate how to use the content.
