## How It Works

With the CloudXR Suite, extended reality (XR) content can be **streamed over wired** or **wireless networks** to any **tethered** or **untethered thin client** device.

  

The CloudXR Suite contains the following components:

  

- **Core:** Provides the streaming layer, complete with new improvements such as L4S optimizations, QoS algorithms, and enhanced logging tools.
- **Client Additions:** This Unity plug-in allows developers to build custom CloudXR client applications with Unity development tools. 
- **Server Additions:** Includes a compilable OpenXR runtime based on the Monado Open Source OpenXR runtime.

## Benefits

### Untethered XR Device Experience

High-fidelity, immersive VR applications typically require a restrictive tethered HMD. NVIDIA CloudXR allows VR users to move to wireless HMDs without any noticeable degradation in the VR experience.

### Growing Wireless Ecosystem
  

Beyond the multitude of cellular phones and tablets, there are several OEMs working on 5G- and wifi-enabled VR all-in-one HMDs.

### Streaming of Any OpenVR Application

The CloudXR streaming stack provides developers with a flexible high-performance cloud instance to stream even the most demanding immersive experiences.

### AR Support
  

The CloudXR server application even supports streaming VR content to AR phones/tablets by adding an alpha channel to blend rendered content with live camera streams.
