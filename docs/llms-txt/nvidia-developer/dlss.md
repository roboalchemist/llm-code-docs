# NVIDIA DLSS

NVIDIA DLSS is a suite of neural rendering technologies powered by NVIDIA RTX™ Tensor Cores that boosts frame rates while delivering crisp, high-quality images that rival native resolution. DLSS 4 introduced Multi Frame Generation (MFG) and a transformer model for high quality super resolution. DLSS 4.5 introduces Dynamic MFG and a second generation transformer model for super resolution.

## DLSS AI Technologies

DLSS neural rendering technologies include:

- 

**DLSS Multi Frame Generation**  boosts frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame - and up to five frames coming soon, powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and RTX PRO Blackwell Generation GPUs with fifth-generation Tensor Cores.

- 

**DLSS Dynamic Multi Frame Generation** Dynamically adjusts the frame generation multiplier to maximize smoothness across different games and scenes (coming in Spring).

- 

**DLSS Ray Reconstruction** enhances image quality by using AI to generate additional pixels for intensive ray-traced scenes. DLSS replaces hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels between sampled rays.

- 

**DLSS Super Resolution** boosts performance by using AI to output higher-resolution frames from a lower-resolution input. DLSS samples multiple lower-resolution images and uses motion data and feedback from prior frames to construct high-quality images. A new second-generation Transformer AI model further improves stability, anti-aliasing, and visual clarity.

- 

**Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing** provides higher image quality with an AI-based anti-aliasing technique. DLAA uses the same Super Resolution technology developed for DLSS, constructing a more realistic, high-quality image at native resolution.

DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA use cutting-edge transformer AI models trained by NVIDIA’s supercomputers for the best image quality.

## Key Benefits

### Performance Multiplier

DLSS 4 featuring DLSS Multi Frame Generation—working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies, including [NVIDIA Reflex](https://developer.nvidia.com/performance-rendering-tools/reflex)—multiplies frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering.

### Maximize Quality With AI

DLSS takes advantage of AI models that are continuously improved through ongoing training on NVIDIA supercomputers, providing better image quality and performance across more games and applications. The latest transformer-based model offers improved stability, enhanced lighting detail, and more detail in motion.

### Enhanced Ray Tracing

DLSS Ray Reconstruction replaces the need for multiple hand-tuned denoisers and generates higher-quality pixels between sampled rays.
