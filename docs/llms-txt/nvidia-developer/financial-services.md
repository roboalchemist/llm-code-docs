# Developer Resources for Financial Services

NVIDIA technologies for use cases across capital markets, banking, payments, and fintech.

Use Cases:

- 
Fraud detection
- 
Financial crime (AML/KYC)
- 
Customer service
- 
Algorithmic trading
- 
Intelligent document processing

### Starter Kits by Use Case

### Detect Anomalies With Fraud Prevention  

AI-enabled applications using deep learning techniques such as [graph neural networks](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-graph-neural-networks/) (GNNs) can reduce false positives in transaction fraud detection, enhance identity verification accuracy for know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, and make anti-money laundering (AML) efforts more effective, improving both the customer experience and your company’s financial health.

### Scale Real-Time Decisions With Accelerated Portfolio Optimization

Traditional CPU-based workflows for portfolio optimization are slow, limited in scale, and unable to support real-time analysis. With AI acceleration, financial firms can model advanced risk measures, process large-scale portfolios in real time, and improve operational efficiency, enabling faster, more informed investment decisions.

### Accelerate Feature Engineering From Unstructured Data

Financial institutions consume massive volumes of unstructured data in their alpha research, feature generation, and strategy creation processes. By combining real-world financial data streams (news, filings, calls) with automated fine-tuning and evaluation, AI accelerates signal backtesting and the time from research to actionable models.
