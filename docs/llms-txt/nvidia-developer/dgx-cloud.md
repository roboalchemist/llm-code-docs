## How NVIDIA DGX Cloud Works

DGX Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of cloud-native solutions that include:

- 
**NVIDIA DGX Cloud Lepton** : Bring or discover compute from NVIDIA Cloud Partners (NCPs) and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Deploy across multiple clouds, decoupled from infrastructure, and focus on building apps from a single UI, using DGX Cloud Lepton’s integrated platform for development, training, fine-tuning, and scalable inference.
- 
**NVIDIA DGX Cloud for CSPs** : Build and fine-tune AI foundation models on scalable, optimized GPU infrastructure co-engineered with leading cloud providers, with flexible access to contiguous, preconfigured, high-performance clusters and the latest GPUs.
- 
**NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCFs)**: Scale deployment of AI workloads on a serverless AI inference platform that offers fully managed, auto-scaling, event-driven deployment across multiple clouds, on-prem, and existing compute environments. 
- 
**DGX Cloud Benchmarking** : Get detailed metrics on end-to-end AI workload performance, scaling efficiency, precision format impact, and multi-GPU behavior to help gauge what platform can deliver the fastest time-to-train and what GPU scale is required to achieve an outcome within a given time period.
- 
**NVIDIA Omniverse™ on DGX Cloud** : Deploy streaming applications for industrial digitalization and physical AI simulations on a fully managed platform, utilizing optimized NVIDIA L40 GPUs that deliver NVIDIA RTX™ rendering and low-latency streaming directly to Chromium-based browsers or custom web-based applications.
- 
**NVIDIA Cosmos™ Curator on DGX Cloud:** Fine-tune NVIDIA world foundation models with proprietary data, then manage the entire video data pipeline on DGX Cloud with fully GPU-accelerated pipelines for 89x faster processing and 11x higher throughput for captioning—accelerating AI development for robotics, AV, and video AI applications.
