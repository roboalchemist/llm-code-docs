# NVIDIA Performance Libraries

NVIDIA Performance Libraries (NVPL) are a collection of essential mathematical libraries optimized for [Arm 64-bit architectures](/arm). NVPL allows you to easily port HPC applications to [NVIDIA Grace™ CPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/) platforms to achieve industry-leading performance and efficiency.

## Key Features

### Seamlessly Port to Grace CPU

NVPL math libraries are drop-in replacements for standard C and Fortran mathematical APIs. This allows existing HPC applications to be easily ported to Grace-based systems with no source code changes.

### Optimized for Arm Architecture

NVPL is specifically tuned for Arm 64-bit CPUs and ensures mathematical applications achieve peak efficiency on the Grace microarchitecture. NVPL allows you to fully harness NVIDIA silicon in the data center.

### Use Standard Math Subroutines

Many HPC applications rely on standardized mathematical APIs like BLAS, FFTW, and LAPACK that are critical to application performance. NVPL provides optimized implementations of these essential libraries for the Grace CPU.
