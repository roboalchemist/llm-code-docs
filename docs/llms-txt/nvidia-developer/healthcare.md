Isaac for Healthcare

# NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare   

NVIDIA Isaac™ for Healthcare is a platform purpose-built for developing healthcare robots. Built on NVIDIA’s three-computer framework for [physical AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/), it features pre-trained models, physics-based simulation, synthetic data generation pipelines, and accelerated runtime libraries.

Isaac for Healthcare supports developers across the entire workflow—from collecting and curating data to building and testing AI models in realistic simulated environments, and deploying intelligent, low-latency robotic applications at the edge.
