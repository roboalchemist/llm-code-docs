## Up to 49X End-to-End Throughput Improvement

CV-CUDA lets you move your bottlenecked pre- and post-processing pipelines from the CPU to the GPU, boosting throughput for complex workflows.

  

For a typical video segmentation pipeline, CV-CUDA enabled an end-to-end 49X speedup using NVIDIA [L4 Tensor Core GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l4/). With the latest and most efficient NVIDIA GPUs and CV-CUDA, developers of cloud-scale applications can save tens to hundreds of millions in compute costs and eliminate thousands of tons in carbon emissions.

### Video Segmentation Pipeline (End-to-End) 

1080p, 30fps
