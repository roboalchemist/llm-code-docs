# NVIDIA Riva for Developers

[NVIDIA® Riva](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/) is a collection of GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation microservices for building fully customizable, real-time conversational AI pipelines. Riva includes [industry-leading](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard) automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and neural machine translation (NMT) and is deployable in all clouds, in data centers, at the edge, or in embedded devices. With Riva, organizations can add speech and translation capabilities that transform chatbots into engaging, expressive multilingual AI voice agents or avatars.

## How NVIDIA Riva Works  

Speech and translation AI microservices convert spoken words into text (speech recognition), written language into spoken words (speech synthesis), and spoken or written words from one language to another (translation). Pretrained AI models are trained on vast datasets and can be fine-tuned on custom datasets to accelerate the development of domain-specific models. Fully containerized, these microservices are optimized for real-time performance and offline high throughput on premises or in the cloud, and can quickly scale to hundreds and thousands of parallel streams.

## Ethical AI   

NVIDIA’s platforms and application frameworks enable developers to build a wide array of AI applications. Always consider potential algorithmic bias when choosing or creating the models being deployed. Work with the model’s developer to ensure that it meets the requirements for the relevant industry and use case; that the necessary instruction and documentation are provided to understand error rates, confidence intervals, and results; and that the model is being used under the conditions and in the manner intended.
