## Isaac GR00T N Robot Foundation Models

Isaac GR00T N open foundation models are ideal for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills. This cross-embodiment solution takes multimodal input—including language and images—to perform manipulation tasks in diverse environments.   
  
These models are trained on an expansive humanoid dataset consisting of real captured data, synthetic data generated using the components of the [Isaac GR00T-Mimic blueprint](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/isaac-gr00t-synthetic-manipulation), [Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint](http://github.com/nvidia/gr00t-dreams), and internet-scale video data. They’re also adaptable through post-training for specific embodiments, tasks, and environments.  
  
Isaac GR00T N models can easily generalize across common tasks—such as grasping, moving objects with one or both arms, and transferring items from one arm to another—or perform multi-step tasks that require long context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across a variety of use-cases, including material handling, packaging, and inspection.
