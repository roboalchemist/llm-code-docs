# LIFO

In some cases, it is useful to process jobs in a LIFO (*Last-in, First-Out*) fashion. This means that the newest jobs added to the queue will be processed **before** the older ones.

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const myQueue = new Queue('Paint');

// Add a job that will be processed before all others
await myQueue.add('wall', { color: 'pink' }, { lifo: true });
```
