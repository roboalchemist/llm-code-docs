# Drizzle setup guide

> This guide will show you how to set up Drizzle ORM with Trigger.dev

## Overview

This guide will show you how to set up [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with Trigger.dev, test and view an example task run.

## Prerequisites

* An existing Node.js project with a `package.json` file
* Ensure TypeScript is installed
* A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server running locally, or accessible via a connection string
* Drizzle ORM [installed and initialized](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) in your project
* A `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set in your `.env` file, pointing to your PostgreSQL database (e.g. `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname`)

## Initial setup (optional)

Follow these steps if you don't already have Trigger.dev set up in your project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the CLI `init` command">
    The easiest way to get started is to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing project, create a `/trigger` folder and give you an example task.

    Run this command in the root of your project to get started:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      npx trigger.dev@latest init
      ```

      ```bash pnpm theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest init
      ```

      ```bash yarn theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest init
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    It will do a few things:

    <Tip title="MCP Server">
      Our [Trigger.dev MCP server](/mcp-introduction) gives your AI assistant direct access to Trigger.dev tools; search docs, trigger tasks, deploy projects, and monitor runs. We recommend installing it for the best developer experience.
    </Tip>

    1. Ask if you want to install the [Trigger.dev MCP server](/mcp-introduction) for your AI assistant.
    2. Log you into the CLI if you're not already logged in.
    3. Ask you to select your project.
    4. Install the required SDK packages.
    5. Ask where you'd like to create the `/trigger` directory and create it with an example task.
    6. Create a `trigger.config.ts` file in the root of your project.

    Install the "Hello World" example task when prompted. We'll use this task to test the setup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the CLI `dev` command">
    The CLI `dev` command runs a server for your tasks. It watches for changes in your `/trigger` directory and communicates with the Trigger.dev platform to register your tasks, perform runs, and send data back and forth.

    It can also update your `@trigger.dev/*` packages to prevent version mismatches and failed deploys. You will always be prompted first.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      npx trigger.dev@latest dev
      ```

      ```bash pnpm theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
      ```

      ```bash yarn theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Perform a test run using the dashboard">
    The CLI `dev` command spits out various useful URLs. Right now we want to visit the Test page.

    You should see our Example task in the list <Icon icon="circle-1" iconType="solid" size={20} color="F43F47" />, select it. Most tasks have a "payload" which you enter in the JSON editor <Icon icon="circle-2" iconType="solid" size={20} color="F43F47" />, but our example task doesn't need any input.

    You can configure options on the run <Icon icon="circle-3" iconType="solid" size={20} color="F43F47" />, view recent payloads <Icon icon="circle-4" iconType="solid" size={20} color="F43F47" />, and create run templates <Icon icon="circle-5" iconType="solid" size={20} color="F43F47" />.

    Press the "Run test" button <Icon icon="circle-6" iconType="solid" size={20} color="F43F47" />.

  </Step>

  <Step title="View your run">
    Congratulations, you should see the run page which will live reload showing you the current state of the run.

        <img src="https://mintcdn.com/trigger/5SxX7bFjJKRsidSL/images/run-page.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SxX7bFjJKRsidSL&q=85&s=4b0bb5f9b181499cf324cdb8d5d673a8" alt="Run page" width="2978" height="2110" data-path="images/run-page.png" />

    If you go back to your terminal you'll see that the dev command also shows the task status and links to the run log.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a task using Drizzle and deploying it to production

<Steps>
  <Step title="The task using Drizzle">
    First, create a new task file in your `trigger` folder.

    This is a simple task that will add a new user to your database, we will call it `drizzle-add-new-user`.

    <Note>
      For this task to work correctly, you will need to have a `users` table schema defined with Drizzle
      that includes `name`, `age` and `email` fields.
    </Note>

    ```ts /trigger/drizzle-add-new-user.ts theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
    import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
    import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
    import { users } from "src/db/schema";
    import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";

    // Initialize Drizzle client
    const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);

    export const addNewUser = task({
      id: "drizzle-add-new-user",
      run: async (payload: typeof users.$inferInsert) => {
        // Create new user
        const [user] = await db.insert(users).values(payload).returning();

        return {
          createdUser: user,
          message: "User created and updated successfully",
        };
      },
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring the build">
    Next, in your `trigger.config.js` file, add `pg` to the `externals` array. `pg` is a non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

    It is marked as an external to ensure that it is not bundled into the task's bundle, and instead will be installed and loaded from `node_modules` at runtime.

    ```js /trigger.config.js theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
    import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

    export default defineConfig({
      project: "<project ref>", // Your project reference
      // Your other config settings...
      build: {
        externals: ["pg"],
      },
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploying your task">
    Once the build configuration is added, you can now deploy your task using the Trigger.dev CLI.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
      ```

      ```bash pnpm theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
      ```

      ```bash yarn theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
      yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adding your DATABASE_URL environment variable to Trigger.dev">
    In your Trigger.dev dashboard sidebar click "Environment Variables" <Icon icon="circle-1" iconType="solid" size={20} color="A8FF53" />, and then the "New environment variable" button <Icon icon="circle-2" iconType="solid" size={20} color="A8FF53" />.

        <img src="https://mintcdn.com/trigger/uys6iMwf9B_ojh8r/images/environment-variables-page.jpg?fit=max&auto=format&n=uys6iMwf9B_ojh8r&q=85&s=af652254781808a35c2bcefd4b61b59f" alt="Environment variables page" width="1600" height="900" data-path="images/environment-variables-page.jpg" />

    You can add values for your local dev environment, staging and prod. in this case we will add the `DATABASE_URL` for the production environment.

        <img
          src="https://mintcdn.com/trigger/uys6iMwf9B_ojh8r/images/environment-variables-panel.jpg?fit=max&auto=format&n=uys6iMwf9B_ojh8r&q=85&s=79b5fd91e809cb0c6c9298410922df96"
          alt="Environment variables
    page"
          width="1600"
          height="900"
          data-path="images/environment-variables-panel.jpg"
        />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running your task">
    To test this task, go to the 'test' page in the Trigger.dev dashboard and run the task with the following payload:

    ```json  theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
    {
      "name": "<a-name>", // e.g. "John Doe"
      "age": "<an-age>", // e.g. 25
      "email": "<an-email>" // e.g. "john@doe.test"
    }
    ```

    Congratulations! You should now see a new completed run, and a new user with the credentials you provided should be added to your database.
