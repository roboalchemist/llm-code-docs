# Complete a waitpoint token

> Completes a waitpoint token, unblocking any run that is waiting for it via `wait.forToken()`. An optional `data` payload can be passed and will be returned to the waiting run. If the token is already completed, this is a no-op and returns `success: true`.

This endpoint accepts both secret API keys and short-lived JWTs (public access tokens), making it safe to call from frontend clients.

        Use your project-specific Secret API key. Will start with `tr_dev_`,
        `tr_prod`, `tr_stg`, etc.


        You can find your Secret API key in the API Keys section of your
        Trigger.dev project dashboard.


        Our TypeScript SDK will default to using the value of the
        `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` environment variable if it is set. If you are using
        the SDK in a different environment, you can set the key using the
        `configure` function.


        ```typescript

        import { configure } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";


        configure({ accessToken: "tr_dev_1234" });

        ```
    publicAccessToken:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      description: >
        A short-lived JWT scoped to a specific waitpoint token. Returned as
        `publicAccessToken`

        when you call `wait.createToken()` or `POST /api/v1/waitpoints/tokens`.


        This token is safe to embed in frontend clients — it can only complete
        the specific

        waitpoint it was issued for and cannot be used for any other API
        operations.
