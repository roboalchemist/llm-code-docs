# Team Config for shared configuration

- Date: 2026-01-23
- Products: Codex

Team Config groups the files teams use to standardize Codex across repositories and machines. Use it to share:

- `config.toml` defaults
- `rules/` for command controls outside the sandbox
- `skills/` for reusable workflows

Codex loads these layers from `.codex/` folders in the current working directory, parent folders, and the repo root, plus user (`~/.codex/`) and system (`/etc/codex/`) locations. Higher-precedence locations override lower-precedence ones.

Admins can still enforce constraints with `requirements.toml`, which overrides defaults regardless of location.
