The Codex app for macOS is a desktop interface for running agent threads in parallel and collaborating with agents on long-running tasks. It includes a project sidebar, thread list, and review pane for tracking work across projects.

Key features:

- [Built-in worktree support](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/worktrees)
- [Voice dictation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/features#voice-dictation)
- [Built-in Git tooling](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/features#built-in-git-tools)
- [Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/features#skills-support)
- [Automations](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/automations)

For a limited time, **ChatGPT Free and Go include Codex**, and **Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu** plans get **double rate limits**. Those higher limits apply in the app, the CLI, your IDE, and the cloud.
