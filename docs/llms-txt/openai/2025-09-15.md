It's available in the IDE extension and CLI when you sign in with your ChatGPT account.
It also powers the cloud agent and Code Review in GitHub.

When working in the cloud on front-end engineering tasks, GPT-5-Codex can now display screenshots of the UI in Codex web for you to review. With image output, you can iterate on the design without needing to check out the branch locally.

#### New in Codex CLI

- You can now resume sessions where you left off with `codex resume`.
- Context compaction automatically summarizes the session as it approaches the context window limit.
