Now you can give Codex access to the internet during task execution to install dependencies, upgrade packages, run tests that need external resources, and more.

Internet access is off by default. Plus, Pro, and Business users can enable it for specific environments, with granular control of which domains and HTTP methods Codex can access. Internet access for Enterprise users is coming soon.

Learn more about usage and risks in the [docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/agent-internet).
