# Slash commands in Codex CLI

Slash commands give you fast, keyboard-first control over Codex. Type `/` in the composer to open the slash popup, choose a command, and Codex will perform actions such as switching models, adjusting approvals, or summarising long conversations without leaving the terminal.

This guide shows you how to:

- understand every built-in slash command and when to reach for it,
- steer an active session with commands like `/model`, `/status`, and `/compact`, and
- register custom prompts that behave like new slash commands with arguments and metadata.

## Built-in slash commands at a glance

Codex ships with the following commands. Open the slash popup and start typing the command name to filter the list.

| Command      | Purpose                                                         | When to use it                                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/model`     | Choose the active model (and reasoning effort, when available). | Switch between general-purpose models (`gpt-4.1-mini`) and deeper reasoning models before running a task.   |
| `/approvals` | Set what Codex can do without asking first.                     | Relax or tighten approval requirements mid-session, for example switching between Auto and Read Only.       |
| `/review`    | Ask Codex to review your working tree.                          | Run after Codex completes work or when you need a second set of eyes on local changes.                      |
| `/new`       | Start a new conversation inside the same CLI session.           | Reset the chat context without leaving the CLI; useful when you want a fresh prompt but keep the same repo. |
| `/init`      | Generate an `AGENTS.md` scaffold in the current directory.      | Capture persistent instructions for the repository or subdirectory you are working in.                      |
| `/compact`   | Summarise the visible conversation to free tokens.              | Use after long runs so Codex retains key points without blowing the context window.                         |
| `/undo`      | Revert Codex’s most recent turn.                                | Quickly roll back an unwanted edit or command execution.                                                    |
| `/diff`      | Show the git diff, including untracked files.                   | Review Codex’s edits before committing or running tests.                                                    |
| `/mention`   | Attach a file to the conversation.                              | Highlight specific files or folders you want Codex to inspect next.                                         |
| `/status`    | Display session configuration and token usage.                  | Confirm the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and remaining context capacity.                  |
| `/mcp`       | List configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.             | Check which external tools Codex can call during the session.                                               |
| `/logout`    | Sign out of Codex.                                              | Clear local credentials when using a shared machine.                                                        |
| `/quit`      | Exit the CLI.                                                   | Leave the session immediately.                                                                              |
| `/exit`      | Exit the CLI (same as `/quit`).                                 | Alternative spelling; both commands terminate the session.                                                  |
| `/feedback`  | Send logs to the Codex maintainers.                             | Report issues or share diagnostics with support.                                                            |

`/quit` and `/exit` both terminate the CLI. Use them only after you have saved or committed any important work.

## Control your session with slash commands

The following workflows keep your session on track without restarting Codex.

### Set the active model with `/model`

1. Start Codex and open the composer.
2. Type `/model` and press Enter.
3. Choose a model such as `gpt-4.1-mini` or `gpt-4.1` from the popup.

Expected: Codex confirms the new model in the transcript. Run `/status` to verify the change.

### Update approval rules with `/approvals`

1. Type `/approvals` and press Enter.
2. Select the approval preset that matches your comfort level, for example `Auto` for hands-off runs or `Read Only` to review edits.

Expected: Codex announces the updated policy. Future actions respect the new approval mode until you change it again.

### Inspect the session with `/status`

1. In any conversation, type `/status`.
2. Review the modal output for the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and current token usage.

Expected: You see a summary similar to what `codex status` prints in the shell, confirming Codex is operating where you expect.

### Keep transcripts lean with `/compact`

1. After a long exchange, type `/compact`.
2. Confirm when Codex offers to summarise the conversation so far.

Expected: Codex replaces earlier turns with a concise summary, freeing context while keeping critical details.

### Undo recent work with `/undo`

1. When Codex makes an incorrect edit or runs an unwanted command, type `/undo`.
2. Confirm the rollback when prompted.

Expected: Codex restores the previous state (including reverting file changes) and tells you what it removed.

### Review changes with `/diff`

1. Type `/diff` to inspect the git diff.
2. Scroll through the output inside the CLI to review edits and added files.

Expected: Codex shows staged and unstaged differences, including untracked files, so you can decide what to keep.

### Highlight files with `/mention`

1. Type `/mention` followed by a path, for example `/mention src/lib/api.ts`.
2. Select the matching result from the popup.

Expected: Codex adds the file to the conversation, ensuring follow-up turns reference it directly.

### Close or report a session

- Use `/feedback` to send logs to maintainers when you encounter issues.
- Use `/logout` to clear your credentials, then `/quit` (or `/exit`) to leave the CLI once you are finished.

## Create your own slash commands with custom prompts

Custom prompts turn Markdown files into reusable slash commands that you trigger with `/prompts:<name>`.

1. Ensure your Codex home exists:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
   ```

2. Create `~/.codex/prompts/draftpr.md` with reusable guidance:

   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Prep a branch, commit, and open a draft PR
   argument-hint: [FILES=<paths>] [PR_TITLE="<title>"]
   ---

   Create a branch named `dev/<feature_name>` for this work.
   If files are specified, stage them first: $FILES.
   Commit the staged changes with a clear message.
   Open a draft PR on the same branch. Use $PR_TITLE when supplied; otherwise write a concise summary yourself.
   ```

3. Restart Codex (or start a new session) so it loads the new prompt.

Expected: Typing `/prompts:draftpr` in the slash popup shows your custom command with the description from the frontmatter and hints that files and a PR title are optional.

## Add metadata and arguments

Codex reads prompt metadata and placeholders the next time the session starts.

- **Description** — Shown under the command name in the popup. Set it in YAML frontmatter as `description:`.
- **Argument hint** — Document expected parameters with `argument-hint: KEY=<value>`.
- **Positional placeholders** — `$1`–`$9` expand from space-separated arguments you provide after the command. `$ARGUMENTS` includes them all.
- **Named placeholders** — Use uppercase names like `$FILE` or `$TICKET_ID` and supply values as `KEY=value`. Quote values with spaces (for example, `FOCUS="loading state"`).
- **Literal dollar signs** — Write `$$` to emit a single `$` in the expanded prompt.

After editing prompt files, restart Codex or open a new chat so the updates load. Codex ignores non-Markdown files in the prompts directory.

## Invoke and manage custom commands

1. Launch Codex and type `/` to open the popup.
2. Enter `prompts:` or the prompt name, for example `/prompts:draftpr`.
3. Supply required arguments:

   ```text
   /prompts:draftpr FILES="src/pages/index.astro src/lib/api.ts" PR_TITLE="Add hero animation"
   ```

4. Press Enter to send the expanded instructions (skip either argument when you do not need it).

Expected: Codex pastes the content of `draftpr.md`, replacing placeholders with the arguments you supplied. Run `/status` or `/diff` afterward to confirm the prompt triggered the intended workflow.

Manage prompts by editing or deleting files under `~/.codex/prompts/`. Codex scans only the top-level Markdown files in that folder, so place each custom prompt directly under `~/.codex/prompts/` rather than in subdirectories.
