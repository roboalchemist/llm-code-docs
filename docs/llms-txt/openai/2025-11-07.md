# Introducing GPT-5-Codex-Mini

- Date: 2025-11-07
- Products: Codex

Today we are introducing a new `gpt-5-codex-mini` model option to Codex CLI and the IDE Extension. The model is a smaller, more cost-effective, but less capable version of `gpt-5-codex` that provides approximately 4x more usage as part of your ChatGPT subscription.

Starting today, the CLI and IDE Extension will automatically suggest switching to `gpt-5-codex-mini` when you reach 90% of your 5-hour usage limit, to help you work longer without interruptions.

You can try the model for a new Codex CLI session using:

```bash
codex --model gpt-5-codex-mini
```

You can also use the `/model` slash command in the CLI. In the Codex IDE Extension you can select GPT-5-Codex-Mini from the dropdown menu.

Alternatively, you can change your default model to `gpt-5-codex-mini` by updating your `config.toml` [configuration file](https://developers.openai.com/codex/local-config):

```toml
model = "gpt-5-codex-mini”
```
