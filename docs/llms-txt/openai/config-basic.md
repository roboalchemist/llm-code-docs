# Basic Configuration

Codex reads local settings from `~/.codex/config.toml`. Use this file to change defaults (like the model), set approval and sandbox behavior, and configure MCP servers.

## Codex configuration file

Codex stores its configuration at `~/.codex/config.toml`.

To open the configuration file from the Codex IDE extension, select the gear icon in the top-right corner, then select **Codex Settings > Open config.toml**.

The CLI and IDE extension share the same `config.toml` file. You can use it to:

- Set the default model and provider.
- Configure [approval policies and sandbox settings](/codex/security).
- Configure [MCP servers](/codex/mcp).

## Configuration precedence

Codex resolves values in this order:

1. CLI flags (for example, `--model`)
2. [Profile](/codex/config-advanced#profiles) values (from `--profile <name>`)
3. Root-level values in `config.toml`
4. Built-in defaults

Use that precedence to set shared defaults at the top level and keep profiles focused on the values that differ.

## Common configuration options

Here are a few options people change most often:

#### Default model

Choose the model Codex uses by default in the CLI and IDE.

```toml
model = "gpt-5.2"
```

#### Approval prompts

Control when Codex pauses to ask before running generated commands.

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
```

#### Sandbox level

Adjust how much filesystem and network access Codex has while executing commands.

```toml
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
```

#### Reasoning effort

Tune how much reasoning effort the model applies when supported.

```toml
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
```

#### Command environment

Restrict or expand which environment variables are forwarded to spawned commands.

```toml
[shell_environment_policy]
include_only = ["PATH", "HOME"]
```

## Feature flags

Optional and experimental capabilities are toggled via the `[features]` table in `config.toml`.

```toml
[features]
shell_snapshot = true           # Speed up repeated commands
web_search_request = true       # Allow the model to request web searches
```

<DocsTip>
  The Maturity column uses feature maturity labels such as Experimental, Beta,
  and Stable. See [Feature Maturity](/codex/feature-maturity) for how to
  interpret these labels.

### Enabling features quickly

- In `config.toml`, add `feature_name = true` under `[features]`.
- From the CLI, run `codex --enable feature_name`.
- To enable multiple features, run `codex --enable feature_a --enable feature_b`.
- To disable a feature, set the key to `false` in `config.toml`.
