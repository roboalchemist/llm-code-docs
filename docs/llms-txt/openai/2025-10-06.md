You can now questions and assign tasks to Codex directly from Slack. See the [Slack guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/integrations/slack) to get started.

#### Codex SDK

Integrate the same agent that powers the Codex CLI inside your own tools and workflows with the Codex SDK in Typescript. With the new Codex GitHub Action, you can easily add Codex to CI/CD workflows. See the [Codex SDK guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk) to get started.

```ts


const agent = new Codex();
const thread = await agent.startThread();

const result = await thread.run("Explore this repo");
console.log(result);

const result2 = await thread.run("Propose changes");
console.log(result2);
```

#### New admin controls and analytics

ChatGPT workspace admins can now edit or delete Codex Cloud environments. With managed config files, they can set safe defaults for CLI and IDE usage and monitor how Codex uses commands locally. New analytics dashboards help you track Codex usage and code review feedback. Learn more in the [enterprise admin guide.](https://developers.openai.com/codex/enterprise/admin-setup)

#### Availability and pricing updates

The Slack integration and Codex SDK are available to developers on ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans starting today, while the new admin features will be available to Business, Edu, and Enterprise.
Beginning October 20, Codex Cloud tasks will count toward your Codex usage. Review the [Codex pricing guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing) for plan-specific details.
